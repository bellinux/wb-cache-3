In the training phase, the robot acquires image sequences along the desired route and automatically learns the route visually. In the subsequent autonomous navigation phase, the robot moves by localizing itself by comparing input images with the <b>learned</b> <b>route</b> representation. To be robust to changes of weather and seasons, an object-based comparison is adopted. Our previous method applied a {{support vector machine}} (SVM) algorithm to object recognition and localization and exhibited a satisfactory performance but was sometimes sensitive to the variation of the robot’s heading. This paper thus extends the method to use panoramic images. By searching the image for the region which matches the model image the most, a new method can considerably improve the localization performance and provide the robot with globally correct directions to move.

40|$|Establishing verbal memory traces for non-verbal stimuli was {{reported}} to facilitate or inhibit memory for the non-verbal stimuli. We show that these effects are also observed in a domain not indicated before – wayfinding. Fifty-three participants followed a guided route in a virtual environment. They were asked to remember half of the intersections by relying on the visual impression only. At the other 50 % of the intersections, participants additionally heard a place name, which {{they were asked to}} memorize. For testing, participants were teleported to the intersections and were asked to indicate the subsequent direction of the <b>learned</b> <b>route.</b> In Experiment 1, intersections’ names were arbitrary (i. e., not related to the visual impression). Here, participants performed more accurately at unnamed intersections. In Experiment 2, intersections’ names were descriptive and participants’ route memory was more accurate at named intersections. Results have implications for naming places in a city and for wayfinding aids...|$|E
40|$|The {{human brain}} distinguishes between {{landmarks}} placed at navigationally relevant and irrelevant locations. However, {{to provide a}} successful wayfinding mechanism not only landmarks but also the routes between them need to be stored. We examined the neural representation of a memory for route direction and a memory for relevant landmarks. Healthy human adults viewed objects along a route through a virtual maze. Event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data were acquired during a subsequent subliminal priming recognition task. Prime-objects either preceded or succeeded a target object on a preciously <b>learned</b> <b>route.</b> Our results provide evidence that the parahippocampal gyri distinguish between relevant and irrelevant landmarks whereas the inferior parietal gyrus, the anterior cingulate gyrus as well as the right caudate nucleus are involved in the coding of route direction. These data show that separated memory systems store different spatial information. A memory for navigationally relevant object information and a memory for route direction exist...|$|E

30|$|Dutch upper-secondary VE distinguishes two <b>learning</b> <b>routes,</b> both {{of which}} combine school {{education}} and practical training and result in formally equivalent diplomas. In the work-based <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> (the former apprenticeship system), which is taken by {{almost a third of}} the students, the practical component dominates, whereas in the school-based <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> the school component does. 5 These routes may therefore attract different types of students: those with an affinity for learning in practice and those who prefer a school-based approach. Furthermore, schools— in programmes that follow the work-based learning route—may use the discretionary room that they have within formal curriculum demands not to broaden the programme’s labour market perspective but, rather, to create a better match with a specific part of the regional business community. This would give these education programmes a narrower scope in the labour market. Education programmes offered through the work-based <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> not only are a priori narrower, but probably also exhibit less variation in broadness between programmes than programmes with a school-based <b>learning</b> <b>route.</b> The larger practical component in the work-based <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> and closer ties with companies involved {{in this part of the}} programme with which students have often already signed an employment contract could imply that this <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> offers a greater chance of finding a job after programme completion. In addition, given the unobserved heterogeneity of the two student populations, there are differences in labour market opportunities between the two programme variants that are unrelated to the broadness of the programme but which appear to be statistically associated if no distinction is made between the <b>learning</b> <b>routes.</b> We therefore focus solely on programmes with the school-based <b>learning</b> <b>route.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an approach for the automated design of <b>learning</b> <b>routes,</b> {{based on the}} application of AI techniques. Our educational planning system is composed of two main modules: an instructor-oriented graphical authoring tool to model the key elements of a course and an automated planner to compute a <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> for a specific student profile or a customised <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> {{for a group of}} students. More specifically, the proposed architecture works in three stages: (1) the instructor defines the elements of a course such as learning concepts, tasks, teaching materials, required resources, etc. Our authoring tool helps guide the instructor during the course design; (2) an AI planning process is applied over the course structure defined in the above stage to obtain a generic <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> for a given student profile. This <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> is composed of a set of partially-ordered activities which contemplates teaching goals at different levels of competence. The purpose of this generic <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> is to validate the course design described by the instructor in the authoring tool and check the existence of a feasible implementation for the course; (3) a second AI planning process permits to obtain a customised <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> for a specific group of students. This <b>learning</b> <b>route</b> is a course of actions allocated in time which accounts for the available resources and temporal constraints of the particular teaching context where the course will be taught...|$|R
40|$|Non-human {{animals can}} acquire novel route {{preferences}} by following knowledgeable individuals. Such socially <b>learned</b> <b>route</b> preferences can be stably maintained over multiple transmission episodes, sometimes forming long-lived traditions. In humans, preferences for familiar routes or heavily used worn trails over unfamiliar ones {{have been described}} in various contexts. However, social learning of route preferences has not been experimentally demonstrated in humans. Here, we demonstrate that social learning and tradition influence route choice. We led adult male and female participants into a room by one of two routes. Participants followed the demonstrated route choices, and later remembered and preferred this choice even when determinably suboptimal (i. e. longer and not preferred by control participants) or when the choice was indicated as arbitrary (the demonstrator took one route to retrieve a poster that had ostensibly fallen). Moreover, route preferences were stably maintained over multiple transmission episodes. We suggest that simple social learning processes, often neglected in human and primate research, can result in long-lived route preferences that may influence a range of additional behaviour patterns...|$|E
40|$|Retracing a {{recently}} traveled route {{is a frequent}} navigation task when learning novel routes or exploring unfamiliar environments. In the present study we utilized virtual environments technology to investigate age-related differences in repeating and retracing a <b>learned</b> <b>route.</b> In the training phase of the experiment participants were guided along a route consisting of multiple intersections each featuring one unique landmark. In the subsequent test phase, they were guided along short sections of the route and asked to indicate overall travel direction (repetition or retracing), the direction required to continue along the route, and the next landmark they would encounter. Results demonstrate age-related deficits in all three tasks. More specifically, in contrast to younger participants, the older participants had greater problems during route retracing than during route repetition. While route repetition can be solved with egocentric response or route strategies, successfully retracing a route requires allocentric processing. The age-related deficits in route retracing {{are discussed in the}} context of impaired allocentric processing and shift from allocentric to egocentric navigation strategies as a consequence of age-related hippocampal degeneration. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Adapting {{behavior}} to accommodate {{changes in the}} environment is an important function of the nervous system. A universal problem for motile animals is the discovery that a <b>learned</b> <b>route</b> is blocked and detour is required. Given the substantial neuroscience research on spatial navigation and decision-making {{it is surprising that}} so little is known about how the brain solves the detour problem. Here we review the limited number of relevant functional neuroimaging, single unit recording and lesion studies. We find that while the prefrontal cortex consistently responds to detours, the hippocampus does not. Recent evidence suggests the hippocampus tracks information about the future path distance to the goal. Based on this evidence we postulate a conceptual model in which: Lateral prefrontal cortex provides a prediction error signal about the change in the path, frontopolar and superior prefrontal cortex support the re-formulation of the route plan as a novel subgoal and the hippocampus simulates the new path. More data will be required to validate this model and understand 1) how the system processes the different options and 2) deals with situations where a new path becomes available (i. e. shortcuts) ...|$|E

This paper focuses on planning <b>learning</b> <b>routes</b> under a very ex-pressive constraint programming approach. After present-ing a general planning formulation based on constraint pro-gramming, we adapt it to an e-learning setting. This requires to model learners profiles, learning concepts, how tasks at-tain concepts at different competence levels, synchronisa-tion constraints for working-group tasks, capacity resource constraints and multi-criteria optimisation.

40|$|Efficient spatial {{navigation}} requires not only accurate spatial knowledge {{but also the}} selection of appropriate strategies. Using a novel paradigm that allowed us to distinguish between beacon, associative cue, and place strategies, we investigated the effects of cognitive aging on the selection and adoption of navigation strategies in humans. Participants were required to rejoin a previously <b>learned</b> <b>route</b> encountered from an unfamiliar direction. Successful performance required {{the use of an}} allocentric place strategy, which was increasingly observed in young participants over six experimental sessions. In contrast, older participants, who were able to recall the route when approaching intersections from the same direction as during encoding, failed to use the correct place strategy when approaching intersections from novel directions. Instead, they continuously used a beacon strategy and showed no evidence of changing their behavior across the six sessions. Given that this bias was already apparent in the first experimental session, the inability to adopt the correct place strategy is not related to an inability to switch from a firmly established response strategy to an allocentric place strategy. Rather, and in line with previous research, age-related deficits in allocentric processing result in shifts in preferred navigation strategies and an overall bias for response strategies. The specific preference for a beacon strategy is discussed {{in the context of a}} possible dissociation between beacon-based and associative-cue-based response learning in the striatum, with the latter being more sensitive to age-related changes...|$|E
40|$|Visuospatial {{difficulties}} in Williams syndrome (WS) are well documented. Recently, {{research has shown}} that spatial {{difficulties in}} WS extend to large-scale space, particularly in coding space using an allocentric frame of reference. Typically developing (TD) children and adults predominantly rely on the use of a sequential egocentric strategy to navigate a large-scale route (retracing a sequence of left-right body turns). The aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether individuals with WS are able to employ a sequential egocentric strategy to guide learning and the retracing of a route. Forty-eight TD children, aged 5, 7 and 9 years and 18 participants with WS were examined on their ability to learn and retrace routes in two (6 -turn) virtual environment mazes (with and without landmarks). The ability to successfully retrace a route following the removal of landmarks (use of sequential egocentric coding) was also examined. Although in line with TD 5 year-olds when learning a route with landmarks, individuals with WS showed significantly greater detriment when these landmarks were removed, relative to all TD groups. Moreover, the WS group made significantly more errors than all TD groups when learning a route that never contained landmarks. On a perceptual view-matching task, results revealed a high level of performance across groups, indicative of an ability to use this visual information to potentially aid navigation. These findings suggest that individuals with WS rely on landmarks to a greater extent than TD children, both for learning a route and for retracing a recently <b>learned</b> <b>route.</b> TD children, but not individuals with WS, were able to fall back on the use of a sequential egocentric strategy to navigate when landmarks were not present. Only TD children therefore coded sequential route information simultaneously with landmark information. The results are discussed in relation to known atypical cortical development and perceptual-matching abilities in WS...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{involvement}} of the parietal cortex and the hippocampus in three kinds of spatial memory tasks which all require a memory of a previously experienced movement in space. The first task compared, by means of positron emission tomography (PET) scan techniques, the production, in darkness, of self-paced saccades (SAC) with the reproduction, in darkness, of a previously learned sequence of saccades to visual targets (SEQ). The results show that a bilateral increase of activity was seen in the depth of the intraparietal sulcus and the medial superior parietal cortex (superior parietal gyrus and precuneus) together with the frontal sulcus but only in the SEQ task, which involved memory of the previously seen targets and possibly also motor memory. The second task is the vestibular memory contingent task, which requires that the subject makes, in darkness, a saccade to the remembered position of a visual target after a passively imposed whole-body rotation. Deficits in this task, which involves vestibular memory, were found predominantly in patients with focal vascular lesions in the parieto-insular (vestibular) cortex, the supplementary motor area-supplementary eye field area, and the prefrontal cortex. The third task requires mental navigation from the memory of a previously <b>learned</b> <b>route</b> in a real environment (the city of Orsay in France). A PET scan study has revealed that when subjects were asked to remember visual landmarks there was a bilateral activation of the middle hippocampal regions, left inferior temporal gyrus, left hippocampal regions, precentral gyrus and posterior cingulate gyrus. If the subjects were asked to remember the route, and their movements along this route, bilateral activation of the dorsolateral cortex, posterior hippocampal areas, posterior cingulate gyrus, supplementary motor areas, right middle hippocampal areas, left precuneus, middle occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus and lateral premotor area was found. Subtraction between the two conditions reduced the activated areas to the left hippocampus, precuneus and insula. These data suggest that the hippocampus and parietal cortex are both involved in the dynamic aspects of spatial memory, for which the name 'topokinetic memory' is proposed. These dynamic aspects could both overlap and be different from those involved in the cartographic and static aspects of 'topographic' memory...|$|E

40|$|Everyday {{experience}} suggests that certain people can {{find their way}} to a destination easily, while others have considerable difficulty. This dissertation focused on gaining a greater understanding of navigational strategies that can facilitate or hinder an individual’s wayfinding performance. The first study was conducted to gain a broad idea of various factors that may influence navigational performance. Participants were guided through a building and then asked to {{find their way to}} a destination. It was found that good navigators made fewer errors in traversing a <b>learned</b> <b>route</b> than did poor navigators. They were also better at recognizing landmarks they had seen along the route, recalling the appropriate directions to be turned at each landmark, and at drawing the correct pathways on a map drawing task. A discriminant analysis revealed that the best predictor of determining navigational performance was the ability to form spatial relationships between landmarks. Results from the first study demonstrated that good navigators were better at determining spatial relationships between landmarks, but it did not address whether this was due to spatial relationships between distances and/or angles. The focus of the second study was to gain a greater understanding {{of the degree to which}} distance and angular information are used by good and poor navigators in determining spatial relationships between landmarks. Results showed that neither a distance nor an angular strategy were preferred in either group of wayfinders. An analysis of navigators initial heading angle error to a target location suggested that good wayfinders may be more efficient at finding their way because they appear to plan routes prior to initiating self-locomotion. Such pre-planning was confirmed by the fact that good wayfinders’ initial heading direction error was significantly less than in poor wayfinders. Poor wayfinders appear to head in a random direction and then attempt to determine target locations. The use of landmark information may be useful in certain contexts, but this may not always be the most efficient strategy. The last experiment was aimed at determining whether good navigators adjust strategies used (landmark vs. street), depending on contextual factors. Differences in strategies used were not found, however the results suggest that good navigators appear to be more skilled at navigating in environments rich with streets compared to poor wayfinders. Good and poor navigators were equally skilled at navigating in environments rich in landmarks. It appears that the ability to determine spatial relationships between landmarks is the strongest predictor of navigational performance compared to a wide range of other navigational skills...|$|E
