5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum cubebae, was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|E
5|$|A {{contravention}} of {{the regulations}} renders speakers and organizers of demonstrations <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> fines of up to $10,000, or incarceration of up to six months. The penalty for displaying anything violent, lewd or obscene at a demonstration is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or, on a subsequent conviction, $5,000. Events which adhere to the regulations are also not immune from other existing laws such as those relating to defamation and sedition.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which {{are thought to}} be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, making them more <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E
50|$|An {{unlimited}} liability corporation (ULC) is a Canadian corporation designation, wherein shareholders are <b>liable</b> up <b>to</b> unlimited amounts for any liability, act or default of the corporation. By comparison, in most corporations, shareholders {{are not usually}} <b>liable</b> due <b>to</b> a limited liability model. ULCs {{can be used by}} American corporations for tax planning, as ULCs are treated as corporations for Canadian tax purposes but as flow-through entities for American tax purposes.|$|R

5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale. Civilians {{who took part in the}} war effort through such activities as building fortifications and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered combatants in a legal sense and therefore <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> be attacked.|$|E

Finally, the District Court required New York state to indemnify the counties. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.|$|E

5|$|The harbour and {{the mouth}} of the River Esk are on a {{geological}} fault. On the east side the cliff is tall, , and consists of alternating layers of shale, sandstone and clay. On the west side the cliff is much lower and has a deep capping of boulder clay over a sandstone base making it less stable and <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> slippage. Both cliffs are being eroded quite rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The slave's freedom {{could be}} either total or partial, at the master's whim.

In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the paramone, a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.|$|E

The Ministry was <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> the Party, the state, and the people.

5|$|At {{the age of}} {{twenty-three years}} male peasants were drafted {{to serve in the}} military, where they were {{assigned}} to infantry, cavalry, or navy service. After one year of training, they went on to perform a year of actual military service in frontier garrisons or as guards in the capital city. They remained <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> perform this year of service until the age of fifty-six. This was also the age when they were dismissed from their local militias, which they could join once they had finished their year of conscripted service. These non-professional conscripted soldiers comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍) was a standing army composed of paid career soldiers.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe global {{context is}} going {{throught}} a disruptive complexity and the traditionally elements {{of citizenship and}} community are going in crisis: social rights, membership, participation; all this is accompanied by an European economic crisis that is leading the revision of the work's traditional forms. With rising unemployment, the negative effect {{for people with disabilities}} is even more important and this situation <b>liables</b> <b>to</b> impoverish the people without opportunities of job. We need to rethink approaches to the work integration, designing and experimenting flexible models with diversify applications and costs, with wages to supplement those already perceived for disability, with a constant check of the accessibility of workplaces, with a strong supervision, so we can assure the social “membership” and not only the economic payment...|$|R

The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> crack.|$|E
5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment.

Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It {{remains to be seen whether}} selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E
