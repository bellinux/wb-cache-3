40|$|The {{evaluation}} of ecosystem health {{is a fundamental}} process for conducting effective ecosystem management. Ecological exergy is used primarily to summarize the complex dynamics of lotic ecosystems. In this study, we characterized the functional aspects of lotic ecosystems based on the exergy and specific exergy from headwaters to downstream regions in the river’s dimensions (i. e., river width and depth) and in parallel with the nutrient gradient. Data were extracted from the Ecologische Karakterisering van Oppervlaktewateren in Overijssel (EKOO) database, consisting of 249 lotic study sites (including springs, upper, middle and lower courses) and 690 species. Exergy values were calculated based on trophic groups (carnivores, detritivores, detriti-herbivores, herbivores and omnivores) of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was applied to characterize the different benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the <b>lotic</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> and the Random Forest model was used to predict the exergy and specific exergy based on environmental variables. The SOM classified the sampling sites into four clusters representing differences in the longitudinal distribution along the river, as well as along nutrient gradients. Exergy tended to increase with stream size, and specific exergy was lowest at sites with a high nutrient load. The Random Forest model results indicated that river width {{was the most important}} predictor of exergy followed by dissolved oxygen, ammonium and river depth. Orthophosphate was the most significant predictor for estimating specific exergy followed by nitrate and total phosphate. Exergy and specific exergy exhibited different responses to various environmental conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background Nutrient {{management}} in {{rivers and streams}} is difficult due to the spatial and temporal variability of algal growth responses. The objectives of this project were to determine the spatial and seasonal in situ variability of trophic status in the Lake Waco/Bosque River watershed, determine the variability in the <b>lotic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> trophic status index (LETSI) at each site as indicators of the system's nutrient sensitivity, and determine if passive diffusion periphytometers could provide threshold algal responses to nutrient enrichment. Methods We used the passive diffusion periphytometer to measure in-situ nutrient limitation and trophic status at eight sites in five streams in the Lake Waco/Bosque River Watershed in north-central Texas from July 1997 through October 1998. The chlorophyll a production in the periphytometers {{was used as an}} indicator of baseline chlorophyll a productivity and of maximum primary productivity (MPP) in response to nutrient enrichment (nitrogen and phosphorus). We evaluated the <b>lotic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> trophic status index (LETSI) using the ratio of baseline primary productivity to MPP, and evaluated the trophic class of each site. Results The rivers and streams in the Lake Waco/Bosque River Watershed exhibited varying degrees of nutrient enrichment over the 18 -month sampling period. The North Bosque River at the headwaters (NB- 02) located below the Stephenville, Texas wastewater treatment outfall consistently exhibited the highest degree of water quality impact due to nutrient enrichment. Sites at the outlet of the watershed (NB- 04 and NB- 05) were the next most enriched sites. Trophic class varied for enriched sites over seasons. Conclusion Seasonality {{played a significant role in}} the trophic class and sensitivity of each site to nutrients. Managing rivers and streams for nutrients will require methods for measuring in situ responses and sensitivities to nutrient enrichment.

40|$|Disturbance is {{a central}} factor shaping composition, structure, and {{dynamics}} of local communities. Drying is a disturbance that occurs in aquatic ecosystems globally and can strongly influence their communities. Although the effects of drying may depend on ecosystem connectivity and the dispersal abilities of resident species, {{there have been no}} comparisons of community responses to drying between lentic and <b>lotic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> across different climates. Here, we predicted that drying would have stronger effects on aquatic communities in isolated lentic ecosystems than in dendritic <b>lotic</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> owing to the higher hydrological connectivity of the latter, and that drying would have stronger effects on passive than on active dispersers, because of the potentially higher recolonizing ability of the latter. We tested these predictions by comparing alpha diversity, phylogenetic relatedness, and beta diversity for active and passive dispersers, in both ecosystem types across five climatic regions. Drying caused greater declines in alpha diversity in lentic than in <b>lotic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Communities that experienced drying were more similar to one another than those of perennial sites, and this pattern was especially pronounced in lentic ecosystems. In contrast, drying did not influence the contributions of turnover and richness gradients to beta diversity. Additionally, dispersal mode did not influence community responses to drying. Relatively weaker effects of drying in lotic compared to lentic systems were likely due to the hydrological connectivity among perennial and temporary river sites, which may facilitate dispersal of organisms to escape drying and recolonize rewetted sites. Collectively, our results suggest that habitat connectivity may ameliorate (and fragmentation may worsen) the impacts of drying disturbance. This is an important finding in light of increasing drying and concomitant aquatic habitat fragmentation under global change...|$|R

The short life cycle, rapid reproduction, cosmopolite, wide spread distribution, variation in population, most are sensitive to the environmental changes, easily handle samples and identification, low cost of sampling and data analysis may promote diatoms as a powerful bioindicator of water quality. The unique siliceous frustules make diatoms able to preserve in the sediment. Rawa Pening is a semi natural lake that administratively surrounded by four districts that consist of 27 villages. The main problem of this lake is erosion in the upstream and sedimentation in the downstream area as well as uncontrolled of aquatic plant growth, particularly water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) that induce lake shallowness. For people who live around Rawa Pening, this lake had been used for agricultural irrigation, fisheries, electricity power and tourism. To conserve the lake, as 3 rd World Water Forum in Tokyo, March 2003 and 2006 – 2009 National Research Agenda there is a need of limnological research on the environmental changes. This research was conducted in order to study the potential used of epipelic diatom as bioindicator of lenthic ecosystem, particularly Rawa Pening Lake. Water and sediment samples were taken from 27 sites from inlet, outlet and water body of Rawa Pining Lake. There were 254 diatom species that consist of 8 Centrophycidae species and 246 Pennatophycidae species. The population varied between 6, 989 and 3, 781, 000 individual/gram. Based on diversity indices of diatom, some part of Rawapening Lake was unstable, whereas the others were stable based on the diversity indices.

My thesis research combines empirical studies and modeling to improve our ability to predict and measure the effects of several major types of natural and anthropogenic disturbance in <b>lotic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> In Chapter 1 I improved the accuracy of hydrodynamic habitat models for juvenile salmon by up to 10 % by applying Akaike information criterion and model averaging. In Chapters 2 and 3 I applied multiple regression and bioenergetic models to illustrate how wildfire, by burning riparian vegetation, can elevate stream temperatures by up to 0. 6 °C adding ~ 5 kJ of metabolic costs to salmonids. As well, I found concentrations of food web resources such as nitrate and fine particulate organic matter increased in burned compared to unburned regions by 244 % and 44 %, respectively, and I found significantly greater seasonal changes in terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate abundance than changes attributable to wildfire. Despite similar regional invertebrate prey abundance, Bayesian stable isotope mixing models revealed seasonal and regional differences in salmonid diets, with higher trophic level prey contributing more to diets in the burned compared to a reference region. Lastly, in Chapter 4 I found that forest harvest and rising air temperatures are warming waters in the Fraser River basin at 0. 07 °C per decade on average by applying Spatial Stream Network models.
