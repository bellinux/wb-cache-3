40|$|We {{packaged}} {{a series}} of high power white LEDs by covering the blue LED chips with yellow phosphor, red phosphor and the two phosphors mixed by appropriate mass ratio, respectively, and discussed the excitation and emission spectrum of yellow phosphor and red phosphor and {{the characteristics of the}} LEDs. We found that the luminous efficacy of the white <b>LEDs</b> <b>covered</b> with the two phosphors mixed by appropriate mass ratio was lower than that of the white <b>LEDs</b> <b>covered</b> with yellow phosphor, but the color rendering index was improved observablyFund of the Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Science...|$|R

50|$|A bokode {{is a type}} of data tag {{which holds}} much more {{information}} than a barcode over the same area. They were developed by a team led by Ramesh Raskar at the MIT Media Lab. The bokode pattern is a tiled series of Data Matrix codes. The name is a portmanteau of the words bokeh (a photographic term) and barcode. Rewritable bokodes are called bocodes. They are circular with a diameter of 3mm. A bokode consists of an <b>LED</b> <b>covered</b> with a mask and a lens. They are readable from different angles and from 4 meters (13 feet) away by any standard digital camera. Powered bokodes are relatively expensive because of the LED and the power it requires, but there are prototypes which manage with reflected light.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{patterned}} sacrificial layer structure {{comprised of}} 3 mu m-wide SiO(2) narrow strips and 3 mu m spacing between strips fabricated on sapphire substrate was proposed. The structure was used {{not only to}} improve GaN epilayer quality, {{but also as a}} sacrificial layer structure. The GaN light emitting diodes (<b>LEDs)</b> <b>covered</b> by the Cu substrate was fabricated after the GaN epitaxy layer was grown on the sapphire by lateral epitaxial overgrowth. Chemical etching using hydrofluoric acid was conducted to remove the aforementioned SiO(2) strips, and hence transform them into narrow tunnels. The GaN LEDs with the Cu substrate detached from the sapphire substrate after interface strain was increased, which demonstrates that n-side-up vertical GaN LEDs could be more easily obtained using chemical lift-off technology without laser damage compared with the laser lift-off technique.

40|$|Corneal {{disease is}} the second leading cause of {{blindness}} in the developing world. Over 314 million people are visually impaired and nearly 90 % live in the developing world. Better diagnosis of corneal disease would decrease the number of blindness cases. Fluorescein sodium {{is often used to}} diagnose dry eye, corneal abrasions, corneal ulcers, and other afflictions. A diagnostic eye camera that could take naked and fluorescent images of the cornea would improve diagnostics in the developing world. A web camera with a USB 1. 0 interface was adapted for fluorescent imaging. Blue <b>LEDs</b> <b>covered</b> in an additional blue-light filter and a yellow band-pass filter were used to provide optimal imaging. The resultant device has the ability to image any part of the human body, and fluorescently image the eye. The device can be bulk manufactured for approximately $ 10. 88 and disseminated in the developing world with fluorescein sodium dye strips. Initial results show that the images provided by this device can be used accurately to diagnose many corneal diseases and some other ocular diseases as well. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{high power}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) {{light emitting diode}} (LED) multi-chip module package based on aluminum nitride (AIN) and alumina (Al 203) is presented. The AIN subsrate with a high thermal conductivity of up to 180 W/(mK) and LED chips based on copper alloy provide superb thermal management and heat extraction. Efficient cooling is an important prerequisite for the increase of extractable optical power and decrease of thermally induced wavelength shift. A design of a stackable module featuring arrays of 7 x 2 indium-gallium-aluminum-nitride UV LED ships at 395 nm is developed. This configuration of sub-modules allows for the scalable assembly of line sources with different lengths. Applications using UV <b>LEDs</b> <b>cover</b> market segments such as curing of adhesives, inks and coatings, sterilization of medical equipment and treatment of potable water, as well as various uses in chemical detection, biochemical analytics and spectroscopy. Thermal and thermo-mechanical modeling of the sub-mount is conducted using finite elements analysis. Die attach using eutectic gold-tin solder, lower melting tin-lead solder and silver-filled adhesive are compared with respect to optical output power and wavelength drift. Mechanical strength {{and structure of the}} resulting joints are investigated using shear force measurements, cross-sectioning and micro-tomography. An optical output power of 7. 7 W is achieved using a cluster of 14 LED chips at 1050 mA resulting in a peak irradiance of 30. 8 W/cm² at the LED surface with respect to the footprint and pitch of the attached chips...|$|R
40|$|A phosphor-free white lamp was {{fabricated}} {{using the}} InGaN-based {{blue and green}} light-emitting diode (<b>LED)</b> chips <b>covered</b> with semiconductor-conversion layer AlGaInP. The lamp can provide three bands: a 460 -nm blue emission coming from the blue LED, a 555 -nm green emission coming from the green LED, and 630 -nm red emission coming from the excited AlGaInP epilayer. As 50 mA was injected into the white lamp at room temperature, the chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperature (T(C)) are (0. 338, 0. 335) and 5348 K, respectively. By separating injection current into blue and green LED chips, T(C) of lamp can be tuned from about 4000 K to 5400 K...|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21st century he achieved some notoriety with two papers on the 911 terrorist attacks, which <b>led</b> to <b>cover</b> page articles in the New York Times, a commentary in Scientific American, TV interviews, and participation in documentaries on the causes of the collapse of the World Trade Center and on the speed of the aircraft, produced by British TV. Since then that work has often been the target of 9/11 conspiracy theorists who insist instead on alternative explanations. Ultimately, Kausel’s early explanations in 2001 on the causes of the WTC collapse were largely corroborated by a comprehensive and detailed study reported by NIST in 2005.|$|R
