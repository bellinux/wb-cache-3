5|$|John Marshall was {{the captain}} of the Van Diemen's Land team and William Philpott led the Port Phillip team, which batted first. The Victorian team found the home bowling {{difficult}} to face, on account of its unusually slow pace; in their first innings, they scored 82. Van Diemen's Land replied with 104, assisted by a large number of extras. The batsmen coped better than expected with the overarm bowling, although Thomas Antill took three wickets in four balls in returning figures of seven wickets for 33 runs. Batting again, the Victorian team scored 57, leaving the Tasmanian team needing 36 to win. When the first day's play ended due to bad <b>light,</b> <b>Van</b> Diemen's Land had scored 15 runs and lost six wickets. The next morning, the home team scored the required runs for the loss of one more wicket, recording a three-wicket victory. The match, which had been keenly anticipated, was a great attraction and was followed closely in the press in Melbourne. Additionally, there were many social events for the visiting team.|$|E

2500|$|Concerned simply {{with the}} {{harmonious}} arrangement {{of objects and}} the accurate representation of texture and <b>light,</b> <b>Van</b> der Hamen [...] arranged the objects represented in geometrical compositions, circles and spheres play. In contrast with the geometric severity of the setting, the artist arranged the objects on stepped stone ledges, thus varying their distances from the light source. The objects represented, fruits vegetables, wood, terra cotta, and crystal are masterfully described. He carefully calculated the distribution of [...] color that casts a shadow and, at the same time, reflects the light. The calculated, red in various tones, weaves the forms into a harmonious whole whose simplicity, at first glance, belies its careful structure.|$|E
2500|$|A fourth model, the Bond Ranger <b>light</b> <b>van</b> was {{introduced}} in March 1960. This utilised the body with the cut out behind the front seats from the Family Saloon and married it with a similar hardtop roof without side windows, but {{with the addition of}} an opening flap around the rear window. Very much an economy model, in standard form it came finished in primer with topcoat as an optional extra. A total of 39 cars of this type were recorded in factory production records as a Van rather than a Ranger. This is believed to denote that they were only fitted with a single driver's front seat to increase load capacity, much like the 1952 Minitruck. U.K. law at the time also meant that this type of lightweight, single-seat three-wheeler could be driven [...] unaccompanied on learner L-plates without the need to pass a driving test.|$|E
2500|$|The Suzulight Van-based TLA Fronte was {{introduced}} in March 1962 as a passenger car version of the popular <b>light</b> <b>van.</b> The Suzulight Fronte {{was based on the}} earlier Suzulight SS series, itself a fairly straightforward copy of the even older Lloyd LP400, and as such had a transversely mounted two-cylinder, two-stroke engine driving the front wheels. Suspension was independent on all four wheels, with transverse double leafsprings on both axes. 2,565 were built in the first year. Power was [...] at 6000rpm, from a unique engine (also called [...] "TLA") with its cylinders cast separately rather than in a single block. Of 360cc (64.0 × 56.0mm) this method allowed for a lower production cost and better cooling, allowing Suzuki to price the TLA below the more spartan TL Van. As with the light commercials on which it was based, the transmission was a three-speed manual with an unsynchronized first gear and a column-mounted shifter.|$|E

60|$|He had {{repeated}} {{this process}} {{in just the}} same order, many times, {{as if it were}} a matter of necessity, when the sound of wheels called his attention to the window out of its regular turn; and there he beheld a kind of <b>light</b> <b>van</b> drawn by four horses, and laden, as well as he could see (for it was covered in), with corn and straw. The driver, who was alone, stopped at the door to water his team, and presently came stamping and shaking the wet off his hat and coat, into the room where Martin sat.|$|E

The driver was punctual, the road good--save for the dust, the weather being very hot and dry--and at seven in the forenoon of Friday the second of June, one thousand seven hundred and eighty, they alighted {{at the foot of}} Westminster Bridge, bade their conductor farewell, and stood alone, together, on the scorching pavement. For the freshness which night sheds upon such busy thoroughfares had already departed, and the sun was shining with uncommon lustre.|$|E
