25|$|The {{purchase}} of <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets</b> cannot {{be accounted for}} by decision models based on expected value maximization. The reason is that <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets</b> cost more than the expected gain, as shown by lottery mathematics, so someone maximizing expected value should not buy <b>lottery</b> <b>tickets.</b> Yet, lottery purchases can be explained by decision models based on expected utility maximization, as the curvature of the utility function can be adjusted to capture risk-seeking behavior. More general models based on utility functions defined on things other than the lottery outcomes can also account for lottery purchase. In addition to the lottery prizes, the ticket may enable some purchasers to experience a thrill and to indulge in a fantasy of becoming wealthy. If the entertainment value (or other non-monetary value) obtained by playing is high enough for a given individual, then the {{purchase of}} a lottery ticket could represent a gain in overall utility. In such a case, the disutility of a monetary loss could be outweighed by the combined expected utility of monetary and non-monetary gain, thus making the purchase a rational decision for that individual.|$|E
