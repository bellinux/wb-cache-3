The project was pitched and greenlit for {{production}} in mid 2013. Daniel Lutz served as creative director, and the team size peaked at eleven people throughout {{the remainder of the}} game's development. The studio looked at several different engines for building the game, but opted with Unity early on as it had a <b>low</b> <b>barrier</b> of entry, provided support for the main mobile platforms, and some members of the development team had previous experience creating projects in the game engine. An initial working prototype and a basic level editor were developed in a few days and after two weeks the first version of the game was presented to the remainder of the studio.|$|E

500|$|A 2016 {{study from}} Lund University and the GSI {{nevertheless}} cast some {{doubt on the}} syntheses of moscovium and tennessine after the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party recognized these elements as having been discovered in 2009–2010. It found that the decay chains assigned to the isotopes 287Mc and 288Mc were probably internally consistent, with the uncertainty due to the probable insensitivity of the measurements to very short and very long nuclide lifetimes, incorrect assignments of other decay chains from the 243Am+48Ca reaction to different moscovium isotopes, or uncertainty {{in the identification of}} some of the daughters of these moscovium isotopes. On the other hand, the decay chains assigned to 289Mc, the isotope instrumental in the official confirmation of the synthesis of moscovium and tennessine, were found not to be internally consistent. Some subsets of these chains were found to be consistent, suggesting however that their true assignment was to 288Mc, and that their shortness indicated instead new spontaneous fission branches in its daughters 284Nh and 280Rg – or, more likely, undetected electron capture branches in these daughters leading to the even–even nuclides 284Cn and 280Ds, which have a very <b>low</b> <b>barrier</b> to spontaneous fission. While the 294Ts decay chains were found to be congruent, the 293Ts decay chains approved by the JWP were found to probably not be so and require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different tennessine isotopes. It was also found that the set of chains from 293Ts and 289Mc were not congruent. The multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even–even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross-reactions. This study criticised the IUPAC/IUPAP JWP report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue, and noted that the fact that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine was an almost certainly non-existent link was [...] "problematic".|$|E

2500|$|The solid templon first {{appeared}} in Christian churches around the 5th century and is still found in many Eastern Christian churches. Initially it was a <b>low</b> <b>barrier</b> probably {{not much different from}} the altar rails of many Western churches. It eventually evolved into the modern iconostasis, still found in Orthodox churches today. [...] It is usually composed of carved wood or marble colonnettes supporting an architrave (a beam resting on top of columns). Three doors, a large central one and two smaller flanking ones, lead into the sanctuary. The templon did not originally obscure the view of the altar, but as time passed, icons were hung from the beams, curtains were placed in between the colonnettes, and the templon became more opaque. In modern Orthodox churches, it is common for the openings of the templa to be constructed specifically to contain icons.|$|E

Gallant cavalieri and grave cittadini; soldiers of Dalmatia, and seamen of the galleys; dames of the city, and females of lighter manners; jewellers of the Rialto, and traders from the Levant; Jew, Turk, and Christian; traveller, adventurer, podestà, valet, avvocato, and gondolier, held their way alike to the common centre of amusement.

60|$|Sometimes the Diggers {{aspire to}} nobler game, and succeed in entrapping the antelope, the fleetest animal of the prairies. The {{process by which}} this is {{effected}} is somewhat singular. When the snow has disappeared, says Captain Bonneville, and the ground become soft, the women go into the thickest fields of wormwood, and pulling it up in great quantities, construct with it a hedge, about three feet high, inclosing about a hundred acres. A single opening is left for the admission of the game. This done, the women conceal themselves behind the wormwood, and wait patiently for {{the coming of the}} antelopes; which sometimes enter this spacious trap in considerable numbers. As soon as they are in, the women give the signal, and the men hasten to play their part. But one of them enters the pen at a time; and, after chasing the terrified animals round the inclosure, is relieved by one of his companions. In this way the hunters take their turns, relieving each other, and keeping up a continued pursuit by relays, without fatigue to themselves. The poor antelopes, in the end, are so wearied down, that the whole party of men enter and dispatch them with clubs; not one escaping that has entered the inclosure. The most curious circumstance in this chase is, that an animal so fleet and agile as the antelope, and straining for its life, should range round and round this fated inclosure, without attempting to overleap the <b>low</b> <b>barrier</b> which surrounds it. Such, however, {{is said to be the}} fact; and such their only mode of hunting the antelope.|$|E
