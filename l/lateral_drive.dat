IEEE; IEEE Nanotechnology Council; The Murata Science Foundation; The Kyoto University Foundation; Office of Naval Research GlobalA fully-symmetrical {{resonant}} {{pressure sensor}} based upon <b>lateral</b> <b>drive</b> is presented, which can avoid stress concentration that arises from temperature or vacuum packaging. Unlike conventional driving method, resonant structure with laterally driven comb capacitance allows the linear characteristic of driving force and also obtains high quality factor for its slide-film air damping. Furthermore, the detection {{sensitivity of the}} device can be improved by using differential capacitance, which will reduce shared-frequency interference phenomenon at the same time. According to the FEM analysis, the structural parameters of resonant pressure sensor are optimized. Meanwhile, the pressure sensitivity of the sensor has designed to be 22. 602 Hz/kPa for a 18 渭m thick diaphragm over a pressure range of 550 kPa. From temperature simulation, the temperature coefficient of sensor is - 1. 8233 Hz/掳C {{in the range of}} - 20 掳C鈭? 0 掳C without any temperature compensation. Finally, the frequency domain characteristics have been confirmed and the quality factors of sensor under different damping ratios are identified, it offers reliable reference for the choice of vacuum in resonant pressure sensor packaging. 漏 2012 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} involves micromachined synthetic jet actuators, or �microjet� actuators. These fluidic {{control devices}} may be fabricated using standard silicon micromachining techniques and comprise an orifice situated atop an actuator cavity which is bounded {{at least partially}} by a flexible membrane. Alternatively, microjets may be formed in more robust substrates, such as metals or ceramics. Vibration of the membrane using either electrostatic or piezoelectric drives results in a turbulent air jet formed normal to the microjet orifice. The jet stream is synthesized by a train of vortex rings. Each vortex is formed by {{the motion of the}} diaphragm and is advanced away from the jet under self-induced velocity. Alternatively, the microjet actuator can comprise a �piston in cylinder� to take the functional place of the vibrating diaphragm. This can be accomplished by changing the aspect ratio of the actuator cavity to a deeper, more cylindrical shape. A piston-like actuator can then be realized by using a �bossed� diaphragm. An improvement to microjets is the use of modulators with the jet actuators. Modulators are generally devices to selectively cover and uncover the orifice of a synthetic jet actuator in order to prevent either flow into or out of the jet cavity. Such modulators are fabricated as either vertical drive, <b>lateral</b> <b>drive</b> or constricting modulators. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|E

Therefore, this gas accumulation is a secondary DTA. Hanson et al. (2004) argued that gas charging in the Lance Formation of the Jonah Field occurred before the reservoir became tight and that the accumulation {{is the result of}} vertical and <b>lateral</b> migration <b>driven</b> by buoyancy.|$|R

The emission frequency of the sub-pulses can be systematically controlled, and the emission of sub-pulses leads to the periodic modulation of the temperature of a Si film and the resulting formation of macroscopic stripe patterns. The relationship between a sub-pulse emission frequency and the width of the macroscopic stripe patterns yields EC velocity.

40|$|Most Earth system {{models are}} based on grid-averaged soil columns that do not {{communicate}} with one another, and that average over considerable sub-grid heterogeneity in land surface properties, precipitation (P), and potential evapotranspiration (PET). These models also typically ignore topographically <b>driven</b> <b>lateral</b> redistribution of water (either as groundwater or surface flows), both within and between model grid cells. Here, we present a first attempt to quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneity and lateral redistribution on grid-cell-averaged evapotranspiration (ET) {{as seen from the}} atmosphere over heterogeneous landscapes. Our approach uses Budyko curves, as a simple model of ET as a function of atmospheric forcing by P and PET. From these Budyko curves, we derive a simple sub-grid closure relation that quantifies how spatial heterogeneity affects average ET as seen from the atmosphere. We show that averaging over sub-grid heterogeneity in P and PET, as typical Earth system models do, leads to overestimations of average ET. For a sample high-relief grid cell in the Himalayas, this overestimation bias is shown to be roughly 12  %; for adjacent lower-relief grid cells, it is substantially smaller. We use a similar approach to derive sub-grid closure relations that quantify how lateral redistribution of water could alter average ET as seen from the atmosphere. We derive expressions for the maximum possible effect of lateral redistribution on average ET, and the amount of lateral redistribution required to achieve this effect, using only estimates of P and PET in possible source and recipient locations as inputs. We show that where the aridity index P /PET increases with altitude, gravitationally <b>driven</b> <b>lateral</b> redistribution will increase average ET (and models that overlook lateral redistribution will underestimate average ET). Conversely, where the aridity index P /PET decreases with altitude, gravitationally <b>driven</b> <b>lateral</b> redistribution will decrease average ET. The effects of both sub-grid heterogeneity and lateral redistribution will be most pronounced where P is inversely correlated with PET across the landscape. Our analysis provides first-order estimates of the magnitudes of these sub-grid effects, as a guide for more detailed modeling and analysis...|$|R

Since the forces on the sail are resisted by forces in the water (for a boat) or on the traveled surface (for an ice boat or land sailing craft), their corresponding forces can also be decomposed from total aerodynamic force into driving force (FR) and <b>lateral</b> force (FLAT). <b>Driving</b> force overcomes resistance to forward motion.

It was found that chloride beneath plant canopies were 11 to 222 times higher than adjacent (1 - 2 m away) bare soil locations. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using HYDRUS 2 D/ 3 D model were used to further explore the impact of plants on chloride transport. The simulation results indicated that <b>lateral</b> flow <b>driven</b> by root uptake concentrated chloride toward root zones, leading to the accumulation of chloride under plant canopies. Results also suggest that locally micro-topography can have a substantial impact on chloride migration, as runoff into locally low areas (swales) can push chloride deeper into the soil profile than in adjacent high areas (bars). Hence, the uneven distribution of chloride in microsites should be considered when select field sampling sites for paleoflux and age estimates using chloride mass balance method...|$|R

40|$|The {{flash lamp}} {{annealing}} (FLA) of electron-beam- (EB-) evaporated amorphous silicon (a-Si) films {{results in the}} formation of polycrystalline Si (poly-Si) films with at least a few μm long grains stretching along lateral crystallization directions. Unlike the case of using chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) hydrogenated a-Si films as precursors, no peeling of Si films occurs {{even in the absence of}} Cr adhesion layers. Such a flash-lamp-induced crystallization occurs also in doped EB-evaporated a-Si films as in the case of undoped films. The p＾+/p^-/n^+ stacked structure is sufficiently kept even after crystallization, although the profiles of dopants are slightly modified. This fact clearly indicates that the crystallization observed is not based on liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) after the complete melting of the whole a-Si precursor during millisecond-order treatment but through LPE-based explosive crystallization (EC), self-catalytic <b>lateral</b> crystallization <b>driven</b> by the release of latent heat.

As a simplified {{model of the}} electron path in the plasma, a magnetically neutral plane was assumed between linearly gradient antiparallel B fields, and a uniform E field was applied along the neutral plane perpendicularly to the B fields. The electron behaviour showed two contrasting modes depending on {{the direction of the}} B fields relative to the E field. In the field configuration which confines the electrons near the neutral plane, values of the mean electron energy, the drift velocity and the effective ionization frequency were close to those under the dc E field without B field. On the other hand, in the opposite B field configuration, the electrons hardly drifted along the E field, but instead, they showed a constant <b>lateral</b> diffusion <b>driven</b> by the ExB drift. A reverse-blocking effect of the gradient antiparallel B fields is reported...|$|R

40|$|When {{strained}} Stranski-Krastanow {{islands are}} used as “self-assembled quantum dots,” a key goal is to control the island position. Here we show that nanoscale grooves can control the nucleation of epitaxial Ge islands on Si(001), and can <b>drive</b> <b>lateral</b> motion of existing islands onto the grooves, even when the grooves are very narrow and shallow compared to the islands. A position centered on the groove minimizes energy. We use as prototype grooves the trenches which form naturally around islands. During coarsening, the shrinking islands move laterally to sit directly astride that trench. In subsequent growth, we demonstrate that islands nucleate on the “empty trenches” which remain on the surface after complete dissolution of the original islands...|$|R
40|$|Failures of 13 {{geothermal}} direct-use well pumps {{were investigated}} and information obtained about an additional 5 pumps {{that have been}} in service up to 23 years, but have not failed. Pumps with extra long <b>lateral</b> and variable-speed <b>drives</b> had the highest correlation with reduced time in service. There appears to be at least circumstantial evidence that recirculation may be a cause of reduced pump life. If recirculation is a cause of pump failures, pump specifiers will need to be more aware of minimum flow conditions as well as maximum flow conditions when specifying pumps. Over-sizing pumps and the tendency to specify pumps with high flow and low Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) could lead to increased problems with recirculation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRotating dynamos {{controlled}} by laterally varying thermal {{conditions at the}} bound- ary are investigated in this paper. A quasi-stationary, locked dynamo solution is obtained when the thermal winds produced by the non-axisymmetric lateral varia- tions come into an approximate balance with the Coriolis forces. This force balance is verified numerically for both equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric bound- ary variations. The introduction of lateral variations at the boundary can excite dynamo action in a weakly convective regime that does not otherwise sustain a magnetic field with homogeneous boundary heating. A sufficiently large <b>lateral</b> vari-ation <b>drives</b> strong radial and axial uid motions near the equatorial plane; these ows in turn generate the helicity required for dynamo action. It is shown that a boundary-locked dynamo operates {{in a state of}} equipartition between the velocity and magnetic fields. The departure from equipartition in a partially locked dynamo allows the magnetic energy to be greater than the kinetic energy. As the balance of forces in a locked dynamo is different from that in a convection-driven dynamo, lower-mantle coupling could have a marked effect on the structure and dynamics of convection in the Earth's core...|$|R
40|$|Melting beneath mid-ocean ridges occurs over {{a region}} that is much broader than the zone of magmatic {{emplacement}} to form the oceanic crust. Magma is focused into this zone by lateral transport. This focusing has typically been explained by dynamic pressure gradients associated with corner flow, or by a sub-lithospheric channel sloping upward toward the ridge axis. Here we discuss a novel mechanism for magmatic focusing: <b>lateral</b> transport <b>driven</b> by gradients in compaction pressure within the asthenosphere. These gradients arise from the co-variation of melting rate and compaction viscosity. The compaction viscosity, in previous models, was given {{as a function of}} melt fraction and temperature. In contrast, we show that the viscosity variations relevant to melt focusing arise from grain-size variability and non-Newtonian creep. The asthenospheric distribution of melt fraction predicted by our models provides an improved ex- planation of the electrical resistivity structure beneath one location on the East Pacific Rise. More generally, although grain size and non-Newtonian viscosity are properties of the solid phase, we find that in the context of mid-ocean ridges, their effect on melt transport is more profound than their effect on the mantle corner-flow.

The height of the steps on the gibbsite (001) faces can vary from less than one nanometre (elementary steps) to several nanometres (microsteps) and finally to dozens of nanometres (macrosteps). The lateral advancement rates of micro/macrosteps {{are related to the}} height of steps. Step coalescence occurs during <b>lateral</b> advancement, <b>driven</b> by Ostwald ripening. There are three possible pathways for the formation of micro/macrosteps on basal (001) face, all of which are controlled by layer-by-layer growth mechanism. Gibbsite structure suggests that the frequent and random formation of the elementary steps on basal (001) face can be attributed to weak inter-layer hydrogen bonds along the c-axis of gibbsite unit cell. The prismatic (100) faces are characterised by microstep trains along gibbsite [001] direction. These microsteps grow higher along gibbsite [100] direction, advance laterally and step coalescence also occurs. Two dimensional islands often form on the terrace adjacent to the edges of micro/macrosteps, suggesting that the step edge should be a preferred site for island nucleation due to the Ehrlich–Schwoebel effect...|$|R

In this study, the distribution of water masses, dissolved inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids (TSS) on the inner shelf (< 35 m depth), between Itacaré and Canavieiras, eastern Brazil, is presented. Sampling surveys were carried out in March and August 2006 and March 2007. Tropical water (TW) prevailed during March 2006 and August 2007 with the lower salinity waters (< 36) found in most samples taken in March 2007, reflecting the influence of continental outflow and rain in coastal waters. Low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients and Chl-a found were typical of TW and results suggested that the inner shelf waters were depleted in dissolved inorganic nitrogen in August 2006 and March 2007, and in phosphate in March 2006, potentially affecting phytoplankton growth. Stratification of the water column was observed due to differences in dissolved nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a and TSS when comparing surface and bottom samples, possibly the result of a colder water intrusion and mixing on the bottom shelf and a deep chlorophyll maximum and/or sediment resuspension effect.

40|$|Task {{difficulty}} is widely cited in current theory regarding cognitive control and fronto-parietal function. Ongoing debate surrounds {{the extent to}} which global difficulty across multiple cognitive demands is the main driver of lateral frontal activity. Here, we examine a commonly cited behavioral marker of difficulty in these accounts: time-on-task (ToT), as assessed by response time. Specifically, we investigate the task-dependent scaling of frontal BOLD responses with ToT during hierarchical cognitive control. We observe a paradoxical relationship, whereby rostral regions show greater scaling with ToT on a first-order task, despite showing greater recruitment on a second-order task; caudal regions show the converse relationships. Together, these results demonstrate that ToT does not reflect a single dimension of difficulty that uniformly <b>drives</b> <b>lateral</b> frontal activity. Rather, this discrepancy in the mean and scaling of BOLD requires that multiple, distinct processes are instantiated across these fronto-parietal regions in the service of cognitive control function.

Here, we investigate the pattern of bidirectional coupling between mesial and lateral cortical areas and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) at rest and during movement, with and without pharmacological dopaminergic input, in patients with Parkinson's disease. We simultaneously recorded scalp electroencephalographic activity and local field potentials from depth electrodes and deduced patterns of directed coherence between cortical and STN levels across three frequency bands [sub-beta (3 - 13 Hz), beta (14 - 35 Hz), gamma (65 - 90 Hz) ] in the different states. Our results show (1) asymmetric bidirectional coupling between STN and both mesial and lateral cortical areas with greater drives from cortex to STN at frequencies < 35 Hz, (2) a drop of beta band coupling driven from mesial cortex to STN during movement, and (3) an increase in symmetrical bidirectional drives between STN and mesial cortex and in <b>lateral</b> cortical <b>drive</b> to STN in the gamma band after dopaminergic therapy. The results confirm a bidirectional pattern of cortico-basal ganglia communication that is differentially patterned across frequency bands and changes with movement and dopaminergic input...|$|R
