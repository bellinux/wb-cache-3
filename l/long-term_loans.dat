25|$|The bank offered {{loans to}} income-producing manor owners (about 70–80% of total loans) or {{property}} owners in cities. <b>Long-term</b> <b>loans</b> were paid not in cash, but in mortgage bonds which provided for a fixed annual interest to their holders. Initially, that interest was 6%. Twice a year, the borrowers {{had to pay}} the interest to mortgage bond holders plus 1% administrative fee to the bank. This fee was lowered several times and in 1900s it was 0.25% for manor owners and 0.5% for city residents. The loans were provided for only up to 60% of the appraised value of the mortgaged real estate. The terms of the <b>long-term</b> <b>loans</b> varied over the years. Initially, the loans for manor owners were offered for 43.5, 48.67, or 54.5 years. More terms were added later, the longest being 66.17 years. The loan terms for city residents were shorter: initially up to 27.5 years and later up to 38.33 years. Most borrowers (more than 80% in 1912–1914) opted for the longest possible loans. Short-term loans, for one to three years, were available only for up to 10% of the appraised real estate value.|$|E
25|$|Adjustable rate {{mortgages}} are typically, but not always, {{less expensive}} than fixed-rate mortgages. Due to the inherent interest rate risk, long-term fixed rates will tend {{to be higher than}} short-term rates (which are the basis for variable-rate loans and mortgages). The difference in interest rates between short and <b>long-term</b> <b>loans</b> is known as the yield curve, which generally slopes upward (longer terms are more expensive). The opposite circumstance is known as an inverted yield curve and is relatively infrequent.|$|E
25|$|The Organisation for European Economic Co-operation {{took the}} leading role in allocating funds, and the OEEC {{arranged}} for {{the transfer of the}} goods. The American supplier was paid in dollars, which were credited against the appropriate European Recovery Program funds. The European recipient, however, was not given the goods as a gift, but had to pay for them (usually on credit) in local currency. These payments were kept by the European government involved in a special counterpart fund. This counterpart money, in turn, could be used by the government for further investment projects. Five percent of the counterpart money was paid to the US to cover the administrative costs of the ERP. The Marshall Plan money was in the form of grants that {{did not have to be}} repaid. In addition to ERP grants, the Export-Import Bank (an agency of the US government) at the same time made <b>long-term</b> <b>loans</b> at low interest rates to finance major purchases in the US, all of which were repaid.|$|E

Reverse Lend-Lease policies comprised services such as rent on air bases {{that went to the}} U.S., and totaled $7.8 billion; of this, $6.8 billion came from the British and the Commonwealth. The terms of the agreement provided that the materiel was to be used until returned or destroyed. In practice very little equipment was returned. Supplies that arrived after the termination date were sold to Britain at a large discount for £1.075 billion, using <b>long-term</b> <b>loans</b> from the United States. Canada operated a similar program called Mutual Aid that sent a loan of $1 billion and $3.4 billion in supplies and services to Britain and other Allies.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} and reserves were controlled {{in the mid-1980s}} by the State Administration of Exchange Control under the People's Bank of China, the central bank. Foreign exchange allocations to banks, ministries, and enterprises were all approved by the State Administration of Exchange Control. The Bank of China, the foreign exchange arm of the People's Bank of China, lost its monopoly on all foreign exchange transactions in 1984 when the Agricultural Bank, People's Construction Bank, China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) were permitted to deal in foreign currency. The Bank of China remained China's principal foreign exchange bank and provided loans for production and commercial transactions related to exports, set up branches overseas, maintained correspondent relations with foreign banks, and did research on international monetary trends. The Bank of China also was active in international financial markets through such activities as loan syndication and issuing of foreign bonds. CITIC, formed in 1979 to facilitate foreign investment in China, also borrowed and lent internationally and issued foreign bonds in addition to encouraging and participating in joint ventures, importing foreign technology and equipment, and making overseas investments. In 1986 CITIC was renamed CITIC Group and shifted its emphasis to power, metallurgical, and raw materials industries, which had trouble attracting investments. In late 1986 the CITIC Group had set up 47 joint ventures, invested in 114 domestic companies, and issued US$550 million in foreign bonds. The China Investment Bank was established in 1981 as a channel for medium- and <b>long-term</b> <b>loans</b> from international financial {{institutions such as the}} World Bank.|$|E
2500|$|Estrella {{and others}} have {{postulated}} that the yield curve affects the business cycle via the balance sheet of banks (or bank-like financial institutions). [...] When the yield curve is inverted banks are often caught paying more on short-term deposits than they are making on <b>long-term</b> <b>loans</b> leading {{to a loss of}} profitability and reluctance to lend resulting in a credit crunch. [...] When the yield curve is upward sloping, banks can profitably take-in short term deposits and make <b>long-term</b> <b>loans</b> so they are eager to supply credit to borrowers. This eventually leads to a credit bubble.|$|E

2500|$|The Central and State Government funded 58.91% of {{the total}} project cost. The {{remaining}} 41.09% was secured through loans from domestic and foreign financial institutions. BMRCL secured [...] through <b>long-term</b> <b>loans</b> and [...] by selling bonds, while the remaining project cost was funded by Central Government and the State Government. BMRCL secured loans from several agencies – [...] from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), [...] from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO), [...] from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the rest from the French Development Agency. Approximately 10% of the 6500 crore must be paid as interest by the BMRCL every year. The Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry estimated that this amounted to an interest payment of [...] per day. The BMRCL refuted claims that the interest was that high, but confirmed that it was [...] "definitely more than [...] per day." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{shape of}} the yield curve {{indicates}} the cumulative priorities of all lenders relative to a particular borrower (such as the US Treasury or the Treasury of Japan), or the priorities of a single lender relative to all possible borrowers. With other factors held equal, lenders will prefer to have funds at their disposal, {{rather than at the}} disposal of a third party. The interest rate is the [...] "price" [...] paid to convince them to lend. As the term of the loan increases, lenders demand an increase in the interest received. In addition, lenders may be concerned about future circumstances, e.g. a potential default (or rising rates of inflation), so they demand higher interest rates on <b>long-term</b> <b>loans</b> than they demand on shorter-term loans to compensate for the increased risk. Occasionally, when lenders are seeking long-term debt contracts more aggressively than short-term debt contracts, the yield curve [...] "inverts", with interest rates (yields) being lower for the longer periods of repayment so that lenders can attract long-term borrowing.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, the Federal Reserve System of the United States {{raised the}} {{discount}} rate that it charged its member banks from 9.5% to 12% {{in an effort to}} reduce inflation. The building or savings and loans associations (S) had issued <b>long-term</b> <b>loans</b> at fixed interest rates that were lower than the interest rate at which they could borrow. In addition, the S had the liability of the deposits which paid higher interest rates than the rate at which they could borrow. When interest rates at which they could borrow increased, the S could not attract adequate capital, from deposits to savings accounts of members for instance, they became insolvent. Rather than admit to insolvency, lax regulatory oversight allowed some S to invest in highly speculative investment strategies. This had the effect of extending the period where S were likely technically insolvent. These adverse actions also substantially increased the economic losses for the S than would otherwise have been realized had their insolvency been discovered earlier. One extreme example was that of financier Charles Keating, who paid $51 million financed through Michael Milken's [...] "junk bond" [...] operation, for his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association which at the time had a negative net worth exceeding $100 million.|$|E
