40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this study was to conceptualize and {{investigate}} a causal relationship model of Thai university students’ <b>living</b> behavior based <b>on</b> sufficiency economy philosophy. The model posits that psychological immunity, family factors, and friend factors influence attitude towards sufficiency economy philosophy which in turn predicts Thai university students’ <b>living</b> behavior based <b>on</b> sufficiency economy philosophy. Data were collected by means of self-report questionnaires from 800 undergraduate students in public universities. The structural equation model was employed to examine the causal relationship model. Results revealed that (a) attitude towards sufficiency economy philosophy mediated the relationship between friend factors and <b>living</b> behavior based <b>on</b> sufficiency economy philosophy, (b) psychological immunity had a direct positive relationship with <b>living</b> behavior based <b>on</b> sufficiency economy philosophy, and (c) psychological immunity mediated the effects of family factors <b>on</b> <b>living</b> behavior based <b>on</b> self-sufficiency economy philosophy. Implications for theory and practices are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Gasketball was {{developed}} and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired Solipskier for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on Gasketball, paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo {{did not have a}} following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while <b>living</b> <b>on</b> the Solipskier funds. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, <b>living</b> <b>on</b> the couches of friends.|$|E

5|$|In 1849 {{there were}} just 11 people <b>living</b> <b>on</b> the island {{but it was not}} long before the island farms expanded. In the 1850s gold was {{discovered}} on mainland Australia where crews would abandon their ships, preferring to dig for gold than to risk a life at sea. As a consequence many vessels avoided the mainland and Lord Howe Island experienced an increasing trade which peaked between 1855 and 1857. In 1851 about 16 people were <b>living</b> <b>on</b> the island. Vegetable crops now included potatoes, carrots, maize, pumpkin, taro, watermelon – even grapes, passionfruit and coffee. Between 1851 and 1853 there were several aborted proposals by the NSW Government to establish a penal settlement on the island.|$|E
