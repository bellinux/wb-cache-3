Yet Pixar made a historic $26million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story. By then the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and IceMan, and Lasseter's animation department, which made television commercials (and four Luxo Jr. shorts for Sesame Street the same year), were all that remained of Pixar.|$|E
5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger {{on his left}} hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long <b>layoff,</b> Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E
5|$|The {{dismissal}} ended another low-scoring innings, and Australia batted {{only once}} in a shortened match. Brown was omitted from the team in favour of Barnes {{for the next two}} Tests. Morris—who had established himself as one of Australia's first-choice opening batsmen during Brown's injury <b>layoff</b> during the previous season—was rested for the Fifth Test as the Australian Board trialled potential candidates for the 1948 tour of England. Morris was omitted after losing a coin toss to Barnes. Brown partnered Barnes, making 99 in the first innings before being run out. Brown had survived a confident appeal for caught behind before he had scored, and Barnes was convinced that his partner had edged the ball. Barnes claimed that had Brown failed to make an impact in the innings, he would have been overlooked for the 1948 tour.|$|E

With the two fights scheduled to take place a month apart from each other, the media speculated that the winners of the two fights would likely fight each other next. Cotto was successful in his third title defense, defeating Mosley by unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden in New York City, while one month later, Mayweather defeated Hatton by tenth round technical knockout at the MGM Grand in Paradise, Nevada. Following his victory, Mayweather announced that he would take a two-year <b>layoff</b> from boxing to focus on his promotional company. However, one month later, Mayweather began negotiations for a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya. With several top welterweight fighters unavailable, Cotto agreed to fight Alfonso Gomez, a fighter most notable for appearing on the first season of The Contender.

He continued his form for Railways in the one-dayers, taking seven wickets at 20.57 in four matches at an economy rate of 4.00, before suffering a serious back injury that forced him to travel to Adelaide for treatment, which was funded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. He made a successful comeback in January after a month-long <b>layoff,</b> and ended as fourth-highest wicket taker in the Ranji Trophy, with 34 at an average of 17, taking 5/51 and 3/7, and scoring 69 in his final match of the season to secure a win over Baroda. He batted well {{in the second half of}} the season, also scoring 42 and 58. He also performed well in the Challenger Trophy and zonal one-dayers after his surgery, taking ten wickets at 21.70 in seven matches.

5|$|With Klim {{recently}} {{returning from}} a two-year injury <b>layoff,</b> and Callus ill, Thorpe could only anchor Australia to sixth in the 4×100m freestyle relay. The 200m began with van den Hoogenband again attacking immediately, reaching the 100m mark more than a second under the world record split, with Thorpe half a body length behind. Thorpe gradually reduced the lead before passing van den Hoogenband in the last 50m to win The Race of the Century by half a body length, in a new Olympic record of 1min 44.71s. Having achieved what had eluded him four years earlier, Thorpe reacted emotionally, immediately tearing off his cap, punching the air and screaming. The next day saw six years of Australian victory in the 4×200m freestyle relay ended when Hackett, Klim and Sprenger had put Thorpe into the final leg 1.48s behind Keller. Thorpe gradually reduced the margin {{but was unable to}} pass Keller in the last lap, the United States touching 0.13s earlier. Thorpe found himself {{on the other side of}} a close result when he qualified last for the 100m freestyle by 0.01s. He capitalised in the final by coming from sixth at the 50m mark to win bronze medal in a personal best of 48.56s, making him the only person to medal in the 100–200–400 combination in Olympic history.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and empirical analysis of <b>layoffs</b> in Germany In recent years <b>layoffs</b> have increasingly {{become the focus of}} public attention. So far, however, there has been no representative study for Germany of how far and under what conditions <b>layoffs</b> are accepted by the population – in other words by people who are not immediately affected.

Key findings are: � By relinquishing their own bonus payment, the management of a firm can increase the acceptance of <b>layoffs.</b> � Generous compensation payments for those made redundant are perceived to be fairer than wage cuts to avoid <b>layoffs.</b> Wage cuts are not even preferred to <b>layoffs</b> where no measures are taken to soften the blow of job loss...|$|R

These discussions occur without much evidence on what employment contract employees currently feel is fair. We perfomed quasi-experimental surveys to study when employees in the U.

This result appears to be solely due to norms of reciprocity (companies should not punish employees for their efforts), rather than norms of sharing rents, as new technology was also considered a justification for <b>layoffs.</b> Consistent with theories of distributive and procedural equity, <b>layoffs</b> were perceived as more fair if the CEO voluntarily shared the pain.

In the Orlando game, Davis became the {{youngest}} player in franchise history to record 25 points and 15 rebounds in a game. In the third game of the season against Charlotte on November 2, Davis established career-highs with 6 blocks and 6 steals, while helping New Orleans to its first victory. He also became the first player with 6 blocks, 6 steals and 25 points in a game in the last 20 years and only the fifth with at least 5 blocks, 5 steals and 25 points in that period. For the week, Davis earned an NBA Player of the Week nomination, but lost out to Kevin Love. On November 8, against the Los Angeles Lakers, Davis scored a career-high 32 points and tied a career high with 6 blocks, along with 12 rebounds, becoming the youngest player ever to have at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and 5 blocks in an NBA game. On November 16, he established a new career high with 8 blocks against Philadelphia. He again had 8 blocks on November 20 against the Utah Jazz. With two 8-block games in the Pelicans' first 11 games of the 2013–14 NBA season, Davis matched the number of 8-block games that Roy Hibbert had at that time in the 2012–13 and 2013–14 NBA seasons combined. No other players had two 8-block games as recently. According to ESPN, while drawing a charging foul from Amar'e Stoudemire, Davis suffered a non-displaced fracture in his left hand in the first quarter against the New York Knicks on December 1.
