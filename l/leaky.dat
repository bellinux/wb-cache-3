50|$|At Derbyshire, he {{was always}} to be the tenth man, {{followed}} solely by the tenacious defensive backstrokes of the Great Dane, teammate Ole Mortensen, while maintaining a slightly <b>leakier</b> bowling attack. He did not play first-class cricket again after the 1986 season.|$|R
50|$|Alan Curbishley and his Charlton side won many admirers {{after their}} Division One title glory gained them {{promotion}} {{back to the}} Premiership at the first time of asking. This time he kept them there with an excellent ninth-place finish and 52 points. They would have finished higher still - and possibly qualified for Europe - had their defence not been the <b>leakiest</b> of any in the top 15 and the sixth <b>leakiest</b> in the division. Still, it was a superb achievement for a side who had been among the favourites of many punters to suffer an immediate return to the Nationwide League. The arrival of striker Jason Euell from Wimbledon in a club record deal gave fans hope of more success in 2001-02.|$|R
50|$|They {{finished}} 20th due {{to their}} superior goal average. However with 58 goals scored, their attack was the third worst in the division; whilst their 89 goals conceded made them the second <b>leakiest</b> defence in the division. Lacking a consistent goalscorer, top-scorers Nolan and Tippett failed to reach twenty goals between them. Losing half their games, their statistic of nine home defeats was particularly worrying.|$|R

50|$|The Vale {{finished}} {{just outside}} the re-election zone on goal average, if the ranking was based on goal difference then they would have finished below Chesterfield. Vale lost seventeen of their nineteen away games, never drawing a match away from home, and conceded more on their travels than any other side in the league. Overall the defence was the <b>leakiest</b> in the division, conceding 82 goals in 38 games.|$|R
40|$|Identifying {{the source}} of space faults in {{functional}} programs is hard. The problem is compounded as space usage can vary enormously from one implementation to another. We use a term-graph rewriting model to describe evaluators with explicit space usage. Given descriptions for two evaluators E 1 and E 2, if E 1 never has asymptotically worse space usage than E 2, we can use a bisimulation-like proof method to prove it. Conversely, if E 1 is <b>leakier</b> than E 2, we characterise a class of computations that expose the difference between them...|$|R
40|$|An LPCVD oxide/LPCVD nitride stack {{has been}} {{investigated}} as a possible substitute for the interpoly oxide in double-level-polysilicon VLSI processes. Results from capacitor lots show that 25 nm LPCVD oxide/ 25 nm LPCVD ni-tride stacks yield breakdown voltages greater than 25 V with a tight distribution. The breakdown voltage can further be enhanced by depositing an additional LPCVD blocking oxide of 50 A thickness on the stack. Suitable thermal sealing ox-ides are also shown {{to be effective in}} enhancing the breakdown field strength. A further scaling of the stack thickness is also demonstrated. The thermal oxide grown on polysilicon is known to be much <b>leakier</b> than the single-crystal counterpart. It is also well known that a higher oxidation temperature (> 1100 ~ tends to smooth the asperities and yield better polyoxide (1, 2). However, such a high temperature treat-ment may be prohibitive in future VLSI process flows. On the other hand, the use of lower temperature (less than or equal to 1000 ~ oxidation results in surface-reaction-controlled oxidation and, thus, a rougher poly-silicon surface and a much <b>leakier</b> resultant polyoxide. An alternative dielectric deposited by LPCVD is a poten-tial substitute for thermal polyoxide in VLSI processes. Different combinations of thin LPCVD oxide and LPCVD nitride stacks (with equivalent SiO ~ thickness less than 500 ~) have been demonstrated to yield good-quality, low defect density interpoly dielectrics uitabl...|$|R

5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the most persistent volcano of the NCVP. More than 20 eruptive centres are present on the summit and flanks of the massif. These have produced mainly felsic and mafic lavas, a chemical composition range typical of bimodal volcanism. Such volcanism commonly occurs at hotspots, continental rifts and <b>leaky</b> transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that volcanism at the massif originated from the upper mantle. Hiatuses of up to a million years or more can be expected between periods of volcanic activity at Level Mountain.|$|E
5000|$|In Europe, {{ductwork}} airtightness classes A to D {{are defined}} in European Standard EN 12237 [...] for circular ducts and EN 1507 [...] for rectangular ducts.

A parallel standard to EN 12237, EN 1507 and EN 1751 {{based on the}} same leakage classification is EN 15727 which applies to technical ductwork products and specifies the leakage requirements for technical ductwork products. The leakage test method for system commissioning is described in EN 12599. Airtightness classes for air handling units (L1 to L3) are defined in EN 1886. System standards, in particular EN 13779, give further recommendations for airtightness class selection for different purposes.|$|R
5000|$|... 1997-98 was {{the first}} top-flight season in Barnsley's 102-year history, and, despite some courageous performances, their stay among the elite lasted just one season. They {{suffered}} from horrendous defeats and the <b>leakiest</b> defensive record in the division, conceding 82 goals. They were in the bottom three virtually all season long, though they did enjoy some success in the FA Cup, knocking out Manchester United in the fifth round before bowing out to eventual runners-up Newcastle United in the quarter-final. Their relegation was confirmed a few weeks later, and manager Danny Wilson then moved to South Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday. 35-year-old striker John Hendrie was appointed player-manager following Wilson's departure.|$|R
5000|$|They {{immediately}} {{encountered the}} problem of water build-up from rain being retained by the now [...] "water-tight" [...] bund; the unwanted rain-water reduces the holding capacity of the bund. Once the water level reaches more than 10% of the holding capacity of the bund, {{it is no longer}} fit for purpose and the water must be removed. The water is also likely to be, at best, moderately contaminated with a small film of oil on the top of it or, at worst, substantially contaminated by a thick layer of oil. This is worse on older, <b>leakier</b> transformers. This also can apply to any oil storage tank ...|$|R
5|$|On September 3, 1912, {{ground was}} broken {{for a new}} {{cyclorama}} building on Baltimore Street in Gettysburg, on Cemetery Hill (on {{the site of the}} present day Holiday Inn), near the entrance to the Soldiers' National Cemetery. It opened to the public in 1913, in time for the 50th anniversary of the battle, once again displayed as a full circular painting, rather than in sections. The unheated, <b>leaky</b> brick building took a further toll on the condition of the painting. The Boston cyclorama was purchased by the National Park Service in 1942, and moved to a site on Ziegler's Grove near the new Visitor's Center in 1961, after a second round of restoration.|$|E
5|$|SM U-21 {{was built}} at the Pola Navy Yard and was {{launched}} on 15 August 1916, {{and was the first}} of the class to be launched. U-21 was damaged in a diving trial in January 1917, requiring seven months for repairs. The U-boat was commissioned on 15 August 1917. In early October, U-21 conducted patrols off the Albanian coast, but a mid-October Mediterranean patrol was cut short by a <b>leaky</b> seal on her main hatch. After an additional eight months of repairs, U-21 again conducted patrols off Albania. A broken piston in her diesel engine cut short her war career. At Pola at the war's end, U-21 was ceded to Italy in 1920 as a war reparation and broken up. U-21 did not have any successes during the war.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} marked by the {{problems}} of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass) and disordered blood clotting. These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial glycocalyx, which acts as a molecular filter of blood components. <b>Leaky</b> capillaries (and the critical phase) {{are thought to be}} caused by an immune system response. Other processes of interest include infected cells that become necrotic—which affect both coagulation and fibrinolysis (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.|$|E
50|$|After {{coming to}} <b>Leaky's</b> Landing, a small river town, they meet a former soldier {{by the name}} of Loaf. He agrees to take the boys to a city called O to sell one of the jewels for money. The city is along the way to their final {{destination}} so they agree. When the trio reaches O, they are arrested by General Citizen of the People's Republic. Rigg is accused of impersonating the lost prince Rigg Sessamakesh. Rigg infers from this that he actually is the prince Rigg, and was stolen at birth by the man he called his father, for purposes yet unknown. They are taken on a boat to Aressa Sessamo, but Umbo and Loaf are able to escape back to <b>Leaky's</b> Landing so Umbo can practice his ability to travel through time. The pair soon returns to O. Upon reaching Aressa Sessamo, Rigg meets his mother and sister for the first time. It is also revealed that the man that died under the tree, his mentor, was not his real father and his actual father is also dead. He finds that his sister, Param, has the ability to skip through time, making time pass much more slowly for her. While she is doing this she turns invisible, but she can be greatly harmed or even killed if something goes through her. Royals are clearly unliked by the current government of Aressa Sessamo, who overthrew royal rule long ago. Because of this, royals lives are highly restricted and only Rigg and his mother know that Param is still alive. She spends almost all her time invisible.|$|R

40|$|Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is the {{building}} block of modern main memory systems. DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data. These refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance by interfering with memory accesses. The {{negative effects of}} DRAM refresh increase as DRAM device capacity increases. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the <b>leakiest</b> cell in the device. However, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. Therefore, many of these refreshes are unnecessary.

5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a roller bearing to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of spoiler ailerons and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft's poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the <b>leaky</b> hydraulic systems.|$|E

5|$|The Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, {{and later}} the Little Belt Affair, contributed to the United States' {{decision}} to declare war on Britain on 18June 1812. Chesapeake, {{under the command of}} Captain Samuel Evans, was prepared for duty in the Atlantic. Beginning on 13December, she ranged from Madeira and traveled clockwise to the Cape Verde Islands and South America, and then back to Boston. She captured six ships as prizes: the British ships Volunteer, LiverpoolHero, Earl Percy, and Ellen; the brig Julia, an American ship trading under a British license; and Valeria, an American ship recaptured from British privateers. During the cruise she was chased by an unknown British ship-of-the-line and frigate but, after a passing storm squall, the two pursuing ships were gone the next morning. The cargo of Volunteer, 40tons of pig iron and copper, were sold for $185,000. Earl Percy never made it back to port as she ran aground off the coast of Long Island, and LiverpoolHero was burned as she was considered <b>leaky.</b> Chesapeakes total monetary damage to British shipping was $235,675.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} for {{the first}} time record low Leakage-EOT (3. 5 x 10 (- 7) A/cm(2) at 1 V, EOT= 0. 49 nm) MIM capacitors fabricated using a low temperature (250 degrees C) ALD SrTiO 3 (STO) deposition process on ALD TiN bottom electrode. While most previous work on STO used deposition techniques not compatible with high aspect ratio DRAM applications, recent work on ALD STO showed promise on noble-like metal electrodes (Ru, Pt) [1, 2]. In this work, a low temperature ALD process with alternative precursor set and carefully optimized deposition and processing conditions enables the use of low-cost, manufacturable-friendly TiN electrode MIMcaps for future DRAM nodes. Composition (Sr-rich) and process optimization allowed minimization of interfacial EOT penalties and leakage reduction by decreasing the density of <b>leakier</b> STO grains...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{significant}} growth has been observed in using MEMS based passive components in the RF microelectronics domain, especially in transceiver components. This is due to some excellent properties of the MEMS devices like low loss, excellent isolation etc. in the microwave frequency domain where the on-chip passives normally tend to become <b>leakier</b> and degrades the transceiver performance. This paper presents a comparative analysis between MEMS-resonator based and MEMS-passives based band-pass filter configurations for RF applications, along with their design, simulation, fabrication and characterization. The filters were designed to have a center frequency of 455 kHz, meant for use as the intermediate frequency (IF) filter in superheterodyne receivers.

5|$|On 14 August 1782, Hector {{separated}} {{from the rest of}} the prize ships in heavy weather and on 22 August encountered two large French frigates, Aigle of 40 guns and Gloire of 32 guns. Together these vessels significantly outclassed the <b>leaky</b> ship of the line in weight of shot, but Captain John Bourchier determined to resist the French attack, preparing Hector as the French approached. The French ships surrounded Hector at 02:00 and the engagement was furiously contested, with Bourchier wounded early on and many of his officers following him below with serious injuries. Within a short period, Inman was the only officer remaining on deck, but he was able to successfully drive the French away following a failed attempt to board, although Hector was left in a severely damaged state with 75 men killed or wounded. A hurricane that followed the battle inflicted further damage and the ship was badly flooded, seawater ruining the food supplies and threatening to sink the ship completely. Some of the crew were so ill and exhausted that they collapsed and died while manning the pumps. Inman only managed to prevent the remaining sailors from fleeing below decks by carrying loaded pistols and threatening men who refused his orders. Once the storm had abated it was clear that Hector was foundering; her rudder and masts had been torn away and the pumps were unable to keep pace with the water leaking through the battered hull. For two weeks Inman made desperate efforts to keep the ship afloat, as food and water supplies ran low and the hull began to collapse in on itself. Fortunately for the men aboard Hector, the tiny snow Hawke appeared and approached the ship of the line to render assistance. Throwing his cargo overboard, Captain John Hill worked with Inman to supervise the transfer of all of Hectors remaining men, many of whom were wounded or sick, into Hawke as Hector rapidly sank. No men were lost in the operation and Inman was the last to leave, Hector disappearing ten minutes after the boat carrying him reached Hawke. The snow set sail for St John's in Newfoundland, its crew and passengers subsisting on short rations; they arrived off the port on the same day they consumed the last water supplies.|$|E
