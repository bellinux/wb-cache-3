40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringStructures made {{of glass}} {{reinforced}} plastic (GRP), often abbreviated GRP cover, are used to protect subsea equipment in {{the oil and gas}} industry. These structures need to be lifted during fabrication, transportation and during the installation. The present work investigates the lifting capacity of the GRP covers. The aim is to achieve a more accurate analytical estimate of the lifting capacity, with a desire to replace the simplified hand calculations used today. In order to investigate the lifting capacity, a lifting point (reinforced lifting holes made of GRP) is studied with both finite element analysis and experimental tests in a hydraulic tensile bench. Three different test setups, Case 1, Case 2 and Case 3 are investigated. Case 1 is a representation of a lift through the splash zone during installation, where the GRP cover is in an upright vertical position. Case 2 is an approximation of a horizontal lift with the lifting point located on top of the cover, causing the lifting point to encounter out-of-plane loads. Case 3 is a representation of a horizontal four-point lift, with the lifting point placed on the side walls. The experimental tests were performed in collaboration with Highcomp AS at Westcon Løfteteknikk in Haugesund. The finite element analysis represents the test setup in the hydraulic tensile bench in order to achieve comparable data. Finite element analysis can reduce cost and time compared with physical experiments. For Case 1, with in-plane loads representing the lifting through the splash zone, the results achieved were within a 2 % error margin. For the out-of-plane situation (Case 2) with solid elements, the results were within a 20 % error margin. The results from the in-plane and out-of-plane scenarios were used in a capacity evaluation to create a graph which represents all results and takes into account the out-of-plane angle from the <b>lifting</b> <b>slings.</b> This graph is easy to use in design and provides good results. Based on the comparison of the results, it was concluded that the Puck criterion with gradual degradation provides the most accurate estimate for the capacity and that use of this criterion can replace simplified hand calculation and reduce the number of physical experiments in the future. Based on these findings, an improvement study was conducted for a 30 mm laminate with Puck criterion and gradual degradation with a new lay-up consisting of fibers at [0, 90, + 45, - 45] degrees, compared to the one used today [0, 90]. The results of the new study showed an increase of over 28 % for the capacity in Case 1 and an increase of over 16 % compared with Case 2. These are interesting results, leading to the conclusion that by introducing the fiber directions + 45 degrees, one can enhance the capacity of the material by about 20 %, and it is easy and efficient to implement in a new design of the lifting point used in GRP covers...|$|E

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} has become more challenging the past years and marine operations must be performed in smarter and more cost-effective ways. Waiting on weather should be minimised and design and planning will be of high importance. A marine operation shall be designed to bring an object from one safe condition to another safe condition. A subsea lift consists of different phases that should be evaluated during the planning process, where the through splash zone phase is usually most critical. In order to account for uncertainty in weather forecast, the operation's design criterion is reduced by an alpha-factor. Installations of protection covers are common offshore operations, but only a few hydrodynamic investigations have been performed on such objects. This Master Thesis describes a study aimed at finding as high operational criterion as possible for an installation of a GRP pipeline protection cover. Further investigations were performed on the differences in use of numerical simulations and DNV GL's Simplified Method. The operation's operability was investigated for the two different operational criteria. For a light lift operation, the occurrence of slack in slings are critical and does usually determine the maximum operational sea state. Slack arises when the total hydrodynamic force acting on the object exceeds 90 % of its submerged weight. The lift was simulated for the splash zone phase in the non-linear time domain simulation program, SIMA. The minimum tension that arose in the slings for each wave condition with random seed number, were used to develop a Gumbel distribution. The sea state was categorised as operational if the 10 % quantile, found by an inversed Gumbel CDF, was above the slack requirement. The lifting system consisted of the vessel s crane tip, a crane wire, a hook, a hook winch, four slings, a spreader bar and the cover. The cover was implemented as slender elements in SIMA, were each slender element was given depth dependent added mass and drag. The implemented hydrodynamic parameters were estimated by CFD-analyses. The cover was lifted with an angle of 68 degrees, and the short-term environmental conditions were characterised by short-crested JONSWAP wave spectra. The installation was defined as a weather restricted level B marine operation. The total hydrodynamic force was manually estimated by the Simplified Method. The respective added mass and drag were calculated by use of tabulated coefficients for rectangular flat plates, in two directions; longitudinal and perpendicular to the cover flanges. The total added mass for a rotated cover was found by summing the vertical components of the longitudinal and perpendicular added mass. The largest tension variations occurred right after the cover was fully submerged, hence slamming and varying buoyancy forces could be omitted. The inertia and drag forces were dependent on the most probable largest crane tip motion, found by the crane tip and vessel COG locations. The maximum sea state was assessed by use of linear scaling. The average manually estimated design criterion was 1. 64 m and constant for all peak periods. Hence with an alpha-factor of 0. 76 the operational criterion was 1. 25 m. For each wave condition, 20 - 30 lowering simulations were performed with random seed numbers. The average winch speed was 0. 2 m/s and the cover was lowered to a depth of approximately 33 m. Both the spreader bar and the cover experienced large motions in air. The motions diminished when the cover entered the water. The tension variation in the lifting system increased when the cover entered the splash zone and calmed down when the cover was lowered to 20 meter depth. The simulated design criteria were found by investigating the tension in the <b>lifting</b> <b>slings.</b> No large snap forces were observed after a slack condition. The simulated design criteria were dependent on both significant wave heights and peak periods. The average design criterion was independent of peak periods and determined to be 2. 5 m. Hence with an alpha-factor of 0. 81 the operational criterion was 2 m. The operation can take place if the wave conditions are below the operational criteria over a longer duration than the operation's reference period. The operability was investigated for two fields; Heidrun and Tanzania Block 2. The reference periods were dependent on the water depth, and thus determined to be 2. 5 hours and 9. 3 hours for the two fields respectively. The operability and actual duration of operation with a random start were heavily season dependent, and were studied for both the manually estimated and simulated operational criteria. When the operational criterion increased from 1. 25 m to 2 m the operability increased with 30 - 50 % at both fields. At the same time the actual duration of operation with a random start decreased with up to 80 % at Heidrun. That is, for a given reference period, the waiting on weather decreased with the corresponding. Generally, at both fields the reason of waiting on weather was due to storm periods, where the wave conditions were above the operational criterion. The operational limit was determined by several factors; the installation method, the environmental conditions, the crane tip motion, the alpha-factor and the tension airing in the slings. According to this one can say that an operation should be short {{in order to be able}} to take place often. For increased operational criteria the operability increased and waiting on weather decreased. If the operation should take place at a random time, the risk of waiting on weather will increase. Usually, a marine operation is planned ahead of execution and is based on weather forecasts. Such planning will with a high probability reduce waiting on weather and increase the operation efficiency. In order to determine the highest operational sea state as possible in such a way that waiting on weather can be reduced, simulations should be performed prior to installations of pipeline protection covers. Hence operational costs, engine idling and pollution can be significantly reduced compared to only relying on the simplified method...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologySpools are {{rigid pipe}} {{sections}} which {{are parts of}} the infrastructure for transporting produced hydrocarbons and injection fluids subsea. Installing them includes a subsea lifting operation commonly carried out by use of the crane on an offshore construction vessel. Such operations are highly sensitive to waves, and usually limited by conditions such as excessive pendulum motions of the lifted structure and occurrence of slack <b>lifting</b> <b>slings</b> during transition through the wave zone. The industry practice is to perform software analyses of vessel motions and hydrodynamic loading acting on the spool(s) when deployed and lifted through the wave zone, {{in order to establish}} a limiting operational wave criterion. That is to determine acceptable sea states for such a lifting operation to be safely carried out. A new Offshore Standard was recently issued, the DNV-OS-H 206 “Loadout, transport and installation of subsea objects (VMO Standard – Part 2 - 6) ”. The new standard distinguishes between characteristic vessel motions generated by wind seas and the once generated by swell. A new requirement is introduced demanding that the wind sea is regarded as short crested when analyzing vessel response for operations that are independent of vessel heading. In addition, a minimum requirement to consider the situation where the wind sea and swell is acting with 90 ° degrees difference in propagation direction is introduced for subsea lifting operations. This report addresses the problem of whether or not including spreading when describing the wind sea is more conservative for spool installation lifting as compared to earlier recommended practice where waves could be assumed being long crested. Furthermore, the question about potential benefits of doing more detailed assessments of the combination of the wind sea and swell than the minimum required by DNV-OS-H 206 is raised. Both aspects are referring to the resulting limiting operational wave criterion, where conditions in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea are of interest. A case study including a thorough process of establishing a model in the software package OrcaFlex, of a state of the art spool installation lift has been the basis for the investigations carried out. The model consists of an installation vessel, lifting arrangement and spools with properties modeled at a level of detail making it representative for the real world system. A range of dynamic time domain analyses have then been carried out where the system is subjected to sea states relevant for the problem defined. The methodology is, however, similar for all analyses carried out. Simulating the lowering from approximately 2 meters above deck level down to the sea surface identifies potential excessive pendulum motions, whereas as the wave zone crossing is assessed by running simulations for selected positions through the wave zone, ensuring that loads from the irregular sea is transferred to the system. Vessel motions are described by detailed RAO values and all relevant wave induced hydrodynamic loads experienced by the lifted spools are accounted for. Analyses in a wind sea comparison study showed that modeling the wind sea as short crested waves described by the JONSWAP spectrum introduces significantly higher roll motions to the installation vessel. This subsequently leads to both excessive pendulum motions {{for a wide range of}} wave peak periods and large hydrodynamic loading on the spools because of increased crane tip motions, slamming loads in particular. The acceptable significant wave height for carrying out the lifting operation reduces. Considering this particular spool installation lift as representative also for other similar operations one can in general conclude that the limiting operational wave criterion for deployment and lifting through the wave zone for spool installations is more conservative as a result of these regulations being implemented. A combined wind sea and swell study revealed that the situation where wind sea and swell is acting with 90 ° difference in propagation direction and where the swell approaches the vessel as beam sea with periods coinciding with the natural period of the vessel’s roll motion and/or the horizontal motion of the lifted spools, as the most critical wave situation one can encounter. This study also showed that there are several benefits of doing analyses that are more refined where the wind sea and swell are modeled as separate wave trains. First, it allows one to identify a range of sea states characterized by other possible directions of the wind sea and swell than the worst case scenario, for which the operation is considered safe to carry out. Another profound merit is the opportunity to account for the vessel’s heading relative to the wind sea and swell directions. This allows one to benefit from performing analyses based on conditions more similar to the actual offshore operation, where the vessel will be able to obtain an optimal heading relative to the wind sea and the swell. This advantage is particularly evident for situations of swell dominated sea states due to the essential assumption that it is reasonable to model wind sea and swell as separate wave trains, where the swell is assumed regular and not prone to the requirement of analyzing response for directions ± 15 ° of the assumed vessel heading, as is the requirement for wind sea. The new standard’s distinction between characteristic vessel motions generated by wind seas and the once generated by swell should be seen as an encouragement to establish a new practice where these consistently also are analyzed separately. This is further supported by the fact that weather forecasts providing information about wave conditions at an installation site, which the decision to initiate an operation is based upon, can now provide information on a level much more detailed than what is currently utilized for establishing the actual limiting operational wave criterion for an operation. That is, information about height, period and direction of wind sea and swell, separately. The draft of a possible future practice where such detailed analyses, performed during transit or waiting on weather is presented in this report. An interesting continuation of the work in this report would be to investigate the new regulations’ level of conservatism. This would require a comparison of analyses results and actual measured vessel motions. Also the issue of dynamic positioning accuracy and hence level of uncertainty related to the vessel’s ability to maintain heading throughout an operation should be included in such a study. The usefulness of the presented possible future practice of establishing limiting operational criteria and initiating operations offshore should be further assessed by applying it in practice for an actual spool installation lift operation. This includes preparing a methodology where also uncertainty in forecasted wave period can be accounted for, as an extension of todays ∝-factor which accounts only for uncertainty in the forecasted significant wave height...|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to modern cranes, medieval cranes and hoists - much like {{their counterparts in}} Greece and Rome - were primarily capable of a vertical lift, and not used to move loads for a considerable distance horizontally as well. Accordingly, lifting work was organized at the workplace {{in a different way}} than today. In building construction, for example, it is assumed that the crane lifted the stone blocks either from the bottom directly into place, or from a place opposite the centre of the wall from where it could deliver the blocks for two teams working {{at each end of the}} wall. Additionally, the crane master who usually gave orders at the treadwheel workers from outside the crane was able to manipulate the movement laterally by a small rope attached to the load.

This may lead to lower productivity, high absenteeism and unsatisfactory patient care, and with cost of treating and caring for patients with LBP well over $ 100 billion annually in the USA alone, makes this a public health concern. Epidemiological studies identified numerous biomechanical factors that cause disc degeneration; exposure to vibrations, prolonged sitting and, especially, high compressive loadings that occur on the L 3 disc during lifting, sitting, flexion and hyperextension of the spinal column. This puts certain occupations, {{such as health care}} workers, in higher risk group for developing degenerative problems with intervertebral discs.

40|$|This thesis {{serves as}} a preparatory study for a new concept in {{subsurface}} towing proposed by Acergy Norway. 3 different mathematical methods for determining the most important dynamics occurring during a subsurface towing operation is therefore discussed and compared. The 3 models examined is a simple mass-spring system with forced excitations implemented in Matlab (chapter 6), a multibody time domain simulation in SIMO (chapter 7) and a model test for verification of results (chapter 9). The accuracy of the relatively simple hand calculations is discussed and compared to experimental values in chapter 10. The {{first part of this}} thesis includes a description of different concepts for transportation of subsea templates to installation site. Transportation by subsurface towing instead of using a barge can reduce operational costs if the dimensions of the structure require a heavy-lift vessel. Also risk related to pendulum motions in air is reduced, and subsurface towing is therefore of great interest to marine contractors. The most significant parameters to check by hand calculations in a subsurface towing operation is natural frequencies and modes of the dynamic system, and also estimates of the maximum/minimum loads <b>lifting</b> wires and <b>slings.</b> Since simple hand calculation models are of interest in early concept studies, formulas for these values are derived in chapter 6. These formulas are also found in (DNV Recommended practice H 103, 2009). SIMO is a time domain simulation program for multibody systems, which allows export of station keeping forces and connecting force mechanism (<b>lifting</b> wire and <b>slings).</b> Based on a system description file provided by Acergy Norway, a suitable model of the Gjøa ITS subsea template is made, and positioned 50 [m] below the moonpool hangoff point. Multiple analyses with different sea conditions and towing velocities have been done in SIMO to determine the feasibility and best practice of a subsurface towing operation. In addition, a towing tank experiment was performed in Marine Cybernetics towing tank at Tyholt in Trondheim. A detailed model of the Gjøa ITS was made in 2008, and numerous previous experiments have been conducted (e. g Solaas(2008) and Eilertsen(2008)) which provided valuable information and reduced the required amount of work in planning a model experiment. In the experiment the template was towed with a vertical oscillator to simulate the vessel translation in head sea and forces were measured in the lifting wire. These model experiments were made for various environmental conditions, and compared to the numerical models previously described. A correct representation of the towing arrangement in SIMO provides a relatively inexpensive model for further dynamic analysis of the system. A heave compensation device can easily be implemented in SIMO when the model of the vessel and template is correctly represented and can therefore be of valuable importance when designing a new conceptual hangoff-structure. </p...|$|R
50|$|Working oxen usually require shoes, {{although}} in England not all working oxen were shod. Since their hooves are cloven, two shoes or ox cues {{are required for}} each hoof, unlike the single shoe of a horse. Ox shoes are usually of approximately half-moon or banana shape, either with or without caulkins, and are fitted in symmetrical pairs to the hooves. Unlike horses, oxen are not easily able to balance on three legs while a farrier shoes the fourth. In England, shoeing was accomplished by throwing the ox {{to the ground and}} lashing all four feet to a heavy wooden tripod until the shoeing was complete. A similar technique was used in Serbia and, in a simpler form, in India, where it is still practiced. In Italy, where oxen may be very large, shoeing is accomplished using a massive framework of beams in which the animal can be partly or completely lifted from the ground by slings passed under the body; the feet are then lashed to lateral beams or held with a rope while the shoes are fitted. Such devices were made of wood in the past, but may today be of metal. Similar devices are found in France, Austria, Germany, Spain, Canada and the United States, where they may be called ox slings, ox presses or shoeing stalls. The system was sometimes adopted in England also, where the device was called a crush or trevis; one example is recorded in the Vale of Pewsey. The shoeing of an ox partly <b>lifted</b> in a <b>sling</b> is the subject of John Singer Sargent's painting Shoeing the Ox, while A Smith Shoeing an Ox by Karel Dujardin shows an ox being shod standing, tied to a post by the horns and balanced by supporting the raised hoof.|$|R
40|$|As the {{offshore}} industry operates on deeper seas, subsea technology {{becomes more and}} more important. As a consequence of this, marine lifting operations of subsea equipment has become very common. Prior to such an operation it is necessary to define the limiting sea states. Many methods for doing this are very conservative and will underestimate the operational conditions. Defining the limiting sea states can be done by numerical simulations using commercial software. However this may be very time consuming. The focus on this report is put on modeling lifting of objects through the splash zone using the computer program USFOS. Dynamic analyses of the lowering were performed. Even though this program is not initially intended for such use, it has features that makes such analyses possible. In this report the applicability of USFOS for such use will be studied. Three main models have been considered. The first of them was a very simple model of a horizontal pipe that was lowered into the sea. The wire forces was considered, and it was studied how different input parameters affected the results. The input parameters for this simple model was taken further by simulating the lowering of a subsea spool through the splash zone. This model consisted of a subsea spool, a spreader bar, 4 <b>slings</b> and a <b>lifting</b> wire. Both flat sea and regular waves were simulated. For the regular wave cases, the forces in the wires and slings was studied. This showed that slack in the <b>lifting</b> wire or <b>slings</b> would occur in 3 out of 4 sea states. Further the elastic utilization of the structure was evaluated according to API-RP- 2 A-WSD, which is implemented in USFOS. In this study {{it was found that the}} utilization of the structure increases as the wave height in- creases. However it is questioned how accurately USFOS calculates the forces in the splash zone for the most extreme cases of regular waves. The last and most realistic model that was considered in this thesis, was lowering of the subsea spool into irregular waves. These waves were simulated according to the JONSWAP wave spectrum. Different sea states were modeled by changing the value of significant wave height and peak period. In addition the top end of the lifting wire was connected to the moving crane tip of a vessel. The vessel motions were defined by RAO functions that were included in the input files. For all of the sea states that were modeled, the minimum wire forces were found. This resulted in an overview of which sea states that would give slack in <b>lifting</b> wire or <b>slings.</b> The trend showed that as the significant wave height was increased, the minimum forces in the wires and slings decreased. From the work that was carried out it was concluded that USFOS can be used for modeling simple marine lifting operations. The program calculates the equilibrium forces in the top end of the wire element in the right way. But its use for this purpose is limited. If damping is introduced to the system, the force in the wire element will decrease due to this, and thus give an error in the equilibrium value. Further the special beam formulation used to model the elongating wire element, requires that a dynamic analysis is performed. Thus there will be oscillations in the system due to initiation of gravity and self weight. Therefore this initial phase should be neglected when considering the structural response. One of the advantages of the program for this type of use is its ability to evaluate non-linear structural behavior, and calculate elastic utilization of the structure. There are, however, uncertainties in the elastic utilization calculations when it comes to definitions of parameters such as buckling length. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} and evaluations provided {{in this report}} were compiled to address the recurring problem of synthetic sling failure. As safety {{is the number one}} priority in all work aspects, a solution must be devised to prevent accidents from occurring. A total of thirteen cases regarding synthetic sling failure were evaluated in order to determine their causes, effects, and preventative measures. From the collected data, it was found that all cases in which the synthetic sling contacted the edge of its load resulted in sling failure. It is required that adequate synthetic sling protection devices be used to protect <b>slings</b> in any <b>lift</b> where the <b>sling</b> comes in direct contact with the edge or corner of its load. However, there are no consensus codes or standards stating the type, material, or purpose of the type of protective device used to protect the sling from being cut. Numerous industry standards and codes provide vague descriptions on how to protect synthetic slings. Without a clear, concise statement of how to protect synthetic slings, it is common for inadequate materials and sling protection devices to be used in an attempt to meet the intent of these requirements. The use of an inadequate sling protection device is the main cause of synthetic sling failure in all researched cases. Commercial sling protection devices come in many shapes and sizes, and have a variety of names, as well as advertised uses. 'Abrasion pads' and 'wear protectors' are two different names for products with the same intended purpose. There is no distinguishable way {{to determine the extent of}} sling protection which these devices will provide, or what specific scenarios they are made for. This creates room for error in a field where error is unacceptable. This report provides a recommended action for hoisting and rigging activities which require synthetic slings to contact a load, as well as recommended changes to industry standards which will benefit overall industry safety...|$|R
60|$|There are {{numerous}} rumours current in camp that the chiefs are forming an alliance against us, {{and that they}} intend to put their forces in motion to attack us. But of all this I cannot say that I believe one word. Nor do I consider it a matter of importance one way or another, for if they do come they will go away again at a vastly greater rate of speed than they advance, and will be very much more civil afterwards. After the landing of the Chief yesterday I went on board the Gomta, which has brought in nineteen elephants from Bombay, in charge of Captain Annesley, of the Land Transport Train. They all arrived in excellent condition, having been perfectly well during the whole voyage, except for two days, {{when there was a}} strong wind, which made them very unhappy. The debarkation was to begin directly the Commander-in-chief had landed. Accordingly, a party of sailors and marines came on board from the Octavia. The tackle had been already fixed, and the barge was alongside. It had been at first proposed that the animals should have been lowered over the ship’s side into the water, and allowed to swim ashore; but the difficulty in relieving them of the slings would have been so great that it was determined, at any rate, to make the experiment with the barge. The animals were down in the hold, which was amply high enough even for the largest of them. They were ranged along on either side, with strong beams between each. They could lie down or stand up as they pleased. The operation of landing them was superintended by Captain Annesley, and by one of the officers of the Octavia. Large blocks were attached to the mainyard, which was strengthened by extra stays. One of the animals who was in the stall immediately under the hatchway was selected for the first experiment. The first difficulty consisted in getting the sling which was of the strongest canvas, with strong ropes along each side, under him. It was laid down upon the ground, and the mahout endeavoured to back the animal over it. Again and again he got him into the right position, but the instant the sailors pulled to the cords to <b>lift</b> up the <b>sling</b> the elephant made a rush forward. At last Sergeant Evans, {{who is one of the}} first-class inspectors in the transport train, succeeded in getting the sling under him in his stall, and then getting on his back, backed him under the blocks, the sailors keeping the sling in its place until they could get the hooks fast. Even then all was not finished, for the alarmed elephant continued trumpeting, and endeavouring to rush back to his stall. Sergeant Evans managed to get the breast- and hind-ropes fast, and then all that remained was for the men on deck to work the capstan. The fife struck up, and the elephant, protesting strongly but uselessly, was gradually lifted off his feet. Once in the air the great beast’s strength was useless, and he swung an inert mass, except that as he went through the hatchway he got his hind-feet against it, and pushed with so much force, that it was feared for an instant that he would push himself head foremost out of the slings. In another minute, however, he rose above the hatchway, and was now beyond the possibility of doing himself or anyone else any harm. Up he rose, higher and higher, and then he was swung clear of the bulwarks, and lowered down into the barge. Here his mahout and attendant received him, stroked his trunk, and soothed him, and he allowed his slings to be taken off quietly, and stood quite tranquil until two more of his companions were raised from the hold and lowered to his side. Thus far nothing could be more satisfactory. Some of the others who landed later in the day gave more trouble, and had it not been for Sergeant Evans there would have been very great difficulty with them; but he is, without exception, the most resolute and fearless fellow I ever saw at work. Had it not been for him it is questionable whether the elephants would have been got on board at Bombay on the day fixed for their embarkation, and he was raised from the position of a third-class to that of a first-class inspector on the spot for his gallantry.|$|R
