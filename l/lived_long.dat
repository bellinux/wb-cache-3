5|$|Arthur Holmes (1890–1965) {{was born}} in England and became Regius Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh in 1943. His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' {{as it was then}} called. He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology. He <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> enough to see the theory of plate tectonics become widely accepted, and he is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential geologists of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Buckles {{was born}} to James Clark Buckles, a farmer, and Theresa J. Buckles (née Keown) in Bethany, Missouri, on February 1, 1901. He had two older brothers, Ashman and Roy, and two older sisters, Grace and Gladys. Several family members <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> lives; he remembered {{speaking}} with his grandmother {{who was born in}} 1817, and his father lived to be 94. His ancestry included soldiers of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.|$|E

5|$|Men {{were also}} {{motivated}} by positive means. New medals were instituted: the Military Cross {{was created in}} December 1914 for warrant officers and officers up to captain, the Military Medal for enlisted men in March 1916 (although to the regret of some men, it did not carry a cash bounty like the Distinguished Conduct Medal). The Order of the British Empire (of which the MBE is one grade) was instituted in 1917. By 1918, medals for bravery were often awarded within a week {{to ensure that the}} man <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> enough to receive it.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbert retired {{some time}} before his death, consecrating Eanbald as his successor. The exact date this {{occurred}} is unclear. Alcuin gives a date corresponding to July 778, {{but it could be}} 777 too. Eanbald's position may have just been as an associate bishop, with Æthelbert remaining in office until his death while sharing the office with Eanbald. During his retirement, he had constructed a new church dedicated to Alma Sophia. He <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> enough to consecrate the new church, ten days before his death on 8 November.|$|E
5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{observers}} such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez {{have suggested that}} if he had <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> enough to see his predictions substantiated by experiment, Oppenheimer might have won a Nobel Prize for his work on gravitational collapse, concerning neutron stars and black holes. In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this to be his most important contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime. The physicist and historian Abraham Pais once asked Oppenheimer what he considered to be his most important scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction. Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1945, 1951 and 1967, but never won.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin had no {{legitimate}} descendants, {{though it}} is probable he had illegitimate issue. Four of his five sisters <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> enough to bear children, but only the daughters of his sister Marfa Elena (sometimes rendered as 'Helen') received Potemkin's special attention. The five unmarried Engelhardt sisters arrived in court in 1775 on the direction of their recently widowed father Vassily. Legend suggests Potemkin soon seduced many of the girls, {{one of whom was}} twelve or thirteen at the time. An affair with the third eldest, Varvara, can be verified; after that had subsided, Potemkin formed close—and probably amorous—relationships successively with Alexandra, the second eldest, and Ekaterina, the fifth.|$|E
5|$|A further {{report in}} 1945, {{supporting}} the same conclusion, was produced and stifled. In 1943, two U.S. POWs—Lt. Col. Donald B. Stewart and Col. John H. Van Vliet—had {{been taken by}} Germans to Katyn for an international news conference. Documents released by the National Archives and Records Administration in September 2012 revealed that Steward and Van Vliet sent coded messages to their American superiors indicating that they saw proof that implicated the Soviets. Three lines of evidence were cited. Firstly, the Polish corpses were in such an advanced state of decay that the Nazis could not have killed the Poles, as they had only taken over the area in 1941. Secondly, none of the numerous Polish artifacts, such as letters, diaries, photographs and identification tags pulled from the graves, were dated later than the spring of 1940. Most incriminating was the relatively good state of the men's uniforms and boots, which showed {{that they had not}} <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> after being captured. Later, in 1945, Van Vliet submitted a report concluding that the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. His superior, Major General Clayton Lawrence Bissell, General George Marshall's assistant chief of staff for intelligence, destroyed the report. Washington kept the information secret, presumably to appease Stalin and not distract from the war against the Nazis. During the 1951–52 Congressional investigation into Katyn, Bissell defended his action before the United States Congress, arguing that it was not in the U.S. interest to antagonize an ally (the USSR) whose assistance was still needed against the Empire of Japan. In 1950 Van Vliet recreated his wartime report.|$|E

5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include {{oxidizing}} agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E
5|$|Deeply in debt, William made {{multiple}} {{attempts at}} marrying a wealthy heiress such as Catherine Tylney-Long, but his suits were unsuccessful. Following {{the death of}} William's niece Princess Charlotte of Wales, then second-in-line to the British throne, in 1817, the king was left with twelve children, but no legitimate grandchildren. The race was on among the royal dukes to marry and produce an heir. William had great advantages in this race—his two older brothers were both childless and estranged from their wives, who were both beyond childbearing age anyway, and William was the healthiest of the three. If he <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> enough, he would almost certainly ascend the British and Hanoverian thrones, and {{have the opportunity to}} sire the next monarch. William's initial choices of potential wives either met with the disapproval of his eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, or turned him down. William's younger brother Adolphus, the Duke of Cambridge, was sent to Germany to scout out the available Protestant princesses; he came up with Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, but her father Frederick declined the match. Two months later, the Duke of Cambridge married Augusta himself. Eventually, a princess was found who was amiable, home-loving, and was willing to accept, even enthusiastically welcoming William's nine surviving children, several of whom had not yet reached adulthood. In the Drawing Room at Kew Palace on 11 July 1818, William married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the daughter of George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. At 25, Adelaide was half William's age.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{believe that}} from the {{beginning}} of the bridge's life, it was toll-free for Lumberland residents. Eventually the town leased the bridge out to private individuals, who collected tolls indiscriminately. During times when bridge could not be leased, the town retained control. The tollhouse was later removed and sold. It is now a home. Originally, the settlement of Pond Eddy on the Pennsylvania side was named Flagstone, but changed to its current name upon construction. Both Pond Eddys expanded rapidly. A new railroad station was created in Pond Eddy on the Pennsylvania side. The riverfront location on the New York side had two stores, a Methodist church, a telegraph office, eighteen homes and a new hotel with a restaurant. The hotel had new owners around the time of the bridge and eventually became a large stop for travelers. The Pond Eddy Bridge served the town of Lumberland well in the late 19th century, but the area's prosperity did not last. The canal went out of business in 1898, after years of competition from railroads. The Erie station on the Pennsylvania had no roads to go anywhere, and the community began to decline. Decker died at 77 years old in 1900, having <b>lived</b> <b>long</b> enough to experience the rise and fall of Pond Eddy.|$|E
