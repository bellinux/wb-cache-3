500|$|During the {{production}} of Tekken 7, Harada {{was impressed by the}} Swedish rock band BatAAr, and felt the game could benefit from their songs. The group originally met Harada during a Twitter conversation when one of the band members asked him where he could buy a Tekken action figure in Tokyo. Harada invited the group to dine with him and presented them with his idea. As Lars is half-Swedish, he asked the band to compose the character's theme song, which he hoped fans of the franchise would <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> when playing the character. The group then went to Japanese arcades to play Tekken 7 as Lars while listening to their own music, which they found fitting. Honored by the proposal, the band said Harada had given them complete freedom as long as the song included Swedish lyrics to fit Lars' nationality. Band member Patrik, responsible for writing the lyrics, made extensive research about Lars' role in the Tekken series, as well as fan theories about him, in an attempt to understand Lars' characterization in Tekken 7 and make the lyrics fit. [...] BatAAr's theme song for Lars was ultimately titled [...] "Vrede" [...] (Swedish for [...] "Anger"), and included in both a CD single as well as the original soundtrack of Tekken 7. The band took a liking to Lars to the point where all the band members played Tekken 7s tournament mode as him, while singing [...] "Vrede" [...] during pauses. One of them even said he was disappointed that Lars never spoke Swedish in the game.|$|E
