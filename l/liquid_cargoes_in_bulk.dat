5000|$|Tankers are a {{relatively}} new concept, dating from the later years of the 19th century. Before this, technology had simply not supported the idea of carrying bulk liquids. The market was also not geared towards transporting or selling <b>cargo</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk,</b> therefore most ships carried {{a wide range of}} different products in different holds and traded outside fixed routes. Liquids were usually loaded in casks—hence the term [...] "tonnage", which refers to the volume of the holds in terms of how many tuns or casks of wine could be carried.

25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an ISO {{standard container}} that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee.

5000|$|Unlike <b>in</b> dry <b>bulk</b> and <b>liquid</b> <b>bulk</b> (<b>liquid</b> <b>cargo</b> carried <b>in</b> ship's tank, example {{petroleum}} crude) shipments, where [...] "parcel size" [...] for carriage in a ship {{is influenced}} by decision of shipper, {{in the case of}} containerised cargo, no single trader or a few of them together would be able to move a parcel size of 10,000 or 18,000 TEUs (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units) of own <b>cargo</b> <b>in</b> a ship. In this situation, container ship operators have been able to force development of ports to suit their huge-size ships. Exceptionally few ports having foresight and good planning have been able resist bearing cost of development of the port to suit huge-size container ships.

40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} {{movement}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>in</b> a road tanker in two road manoeuvres - steady state turning and an evasive manoeuvre. Simulations of movement were performed by two methods: a pendulum {{model and the}} Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model Tis Isat were used. Movements of the fluid gravity centre were compared for various heights of liquid in the circular tanker during the chosen manoeuvres. The agreement of results was satisfactory. Therefore, we can consider the two methods comparable. Two reference pendulum models of overturning were chosen and tested. A new overturning model using the SPH modelling results was developed. Simulations of rollover threshold were performed with all three models for the first described manoeuvre. The results of the static pendulum model are {{significantly higher than the}} results obtained with the dynamic models. The SPH results are slightly higher, but still comparable to the dynamic pendulum method. The possible reasons for the discrepancies between the SPH and the dynamic pendulum methods are from different description of fluid itself and phenomena that cannot be described by pendulum methods (sloshing, mixing, interaction between fluid particles, and friction at the wall-fluid boundary. Mathematical models based on pendulum method are well established for simulating both the dynamic effects of fluid sloshing inside tankers and the rollover threshold of vehicles with <b>liquid</b> <b>cargo,</b> while the SPH method has not yet been used for such simulations. ...|$|R
50|$|Cargo ships {{transport}} dry and <b>liquid</b> <b>cargo.</b> Dry cargo can {{be transported}} <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> by bulk carriers, packed directly onto a general <b>cargo</b> ship <b>in</b> break-bulk, packed in intermodal containers as aboard a container ship, or driven aboard as in roll-on roll-off ships. <b>Liquid</b> <b>cargo</b> is generally carried <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> aboard tankers, {{such as oil}} tankers which may include both crude and finished products of oil, chemical tankers which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and LPG/LNG tankers, although smaller shipments may be carried on container ships in tank containers.|$|R

50|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} strongly {{influences the}} directional dynamics and safety performance of highway tank vehicles {{in a highly}} adverse manner. Hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from <b>liquid</b> <b>cargo</b> oscillations <b>in</b> the tank under steering and/or braking maneuvers reduce the stability limit and controllability of partially-filled tank vehicles. Anti-slosh devices such as baffles are widely used in order to limit the adverse liquid slosh effect on directional performance and stability of the tank vehicles. Since most of the time, tankers are carrying dangerous liquid contents such as ammonia, gasoline and fuel oils; therefore stability of partially-filled <b>liquid</b> <b>cargo</b> vehicles is very important. Optimizations and sloshing reduction techniques in fuel tanks such as elliptical tank, rectangular, modified oval and generic tank shape have been performed in different filling levels using numerical, analytical and analogical analyses. Most of these studies concentrate on effects of baffles on sloshing while the influence of cross-section is completely ignored.|$|R
40|$|MONOGRAFÍA DE TRABAJO DE GRADOThe {{purpose of}} the project {{is based on the}} {{implementation}} of an electronic braking system with braking pressure regulation and stability control depending on the applied load for movable equipment, for either semi-trailers or trailers. The main objective of this implementation is to prevent possible accidents due to overturning or loss of maneuverability while carrying all kind of loads on the Ecuadorian highways.. The project innovates the pneumatic system of the conventional brake with the TEBS (Electronic Braking System for trailer), because the equipment didn't provide this manufacture feature, providing the driver a significant performance for the truck.

40|$|AbstractDamping plays a {{significant}} role on the maximum amplitude of a vessel's roll motion, in particular near the resonant frequency. It is a common practice to predict roll damping using a linear radiation–diffraction code and add that to a linearized viscous damping component, which can be obtained through empirical, semi-empirical equations or free decay tests in calm water. However, it is evident that the viscous roll damping is nonlinear with roll velocity and amplitude. Nonlinear <b>liquid</b> <b>cargo</b> motions inside cargo tanks also contribute to roll damping, which when ignored impedes the accurate prediction of maximum roll motions. In this study, a series of free decay model tests is conducted on a barge-like vessel with two spherical tanks, which allows {{a better understanding of the}} nonlinear roll damping components considering the effects of the <b>liquid</b> <b>cargo</b> motion. To examine the effects of the cargo motion on the damping levels, a nonlinear model is adopted to calculate the damping coefficients. The <b>liquid</b> <b>cargo</b> motion is observed to affect both the linear and the quadratic components of the roll damping. The flow memory effect on the roll damping is also studied. The nonlinear damping coefficients of the vessel with <b>liquid</b> <b>cargo</b> motions <b>in</b> spherical tanks are obtained, which are expected to contribute in configurations involving spherical tanks...|$|R

Gradually, he will take on a cargo handled at terminals in the Astrakhan (about 3.5-5 million tons). Port area of 250-300 ha can count on such developments. While another nearby Makhachkala port will be developed in collaboration with the port. At the same time, the Dagestani port will retain the transshipment of oil cargo. Planned throughput for the <b>liquid</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>in</b> the port of Makhachkala reaches 15 million tons. Establishment of an expanded port.

Currently existing port facilities of the Russian coast of the Caspian Sea is clearly not cope with growing freight traffic. The new port can be a good alternative for the construction of marine terminals in this area. In 2010, the turnover of Olga may have reached 1 million tonnes due to working with metals, and building materials. Further intensive development of offshore oil fields in the Caspian Sea, as the Russians and other countries will be an additional incentive for the development of regional port infrastructure. Planned opening of the inland waterways of Russia (mainly the southern half rings of Astrakhan, Olya to Rostov) can significantly enhance the role of the Russian Caspian Sea ports. Ports will be able to transit goods of other countries, in particular, Kazakhstan, actively building a private fleet. With the commissioning of berths and port infrastructure had placed high hopes on the socio-economic development of southern Russia, Astrakhan Oblast and the entire transportation system.

40|$|International audienceThe {{rise in the}} {{flows of}} {{dangerous}} <b>cargo</b> shipped <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> by sea has in some cases led to {{a rise in the}} explosion hazards onboard the ships that carry products that may release flammable vapors.
