5000|$|When <b>Holiday</b> signed her <b>contract</b> for Columbia, {{the label}} {{looked at it}} as new beginning, for this was her return to the label after sixteen years.

Also, unlike the bulk of Holiday's recordings with Norman Granz and her early years at Columbia in the 1930s and early 1940s, {{rather than in the}} setting of a jazz combo Holiday returns to the backdrop of full orchestral arrangements as done during her Decca years eight years earlier.

Phase 1 will extend service to a temporary terminal in north-eastern San Jose in late 2017 at Berryessa station.

With her dark long hair and beauty, she so impressed the theater director Max Reinhardt, that he offered the part of First Angel in a revival of his and Hugo von Hofmannsthal's adaptation of Calderón's The Great Theater of the World for the Salzburg Festival of 1934. Werfel, however, did not think Manon had the training for such an important role, having only performed in a few theater productions that he had directed himself to entertain her mother and their friends on the long back porch of Haus Mahler in Breitenstein, a porch designed by her father in 1916. So, as her stepfather, Werfel refused to allow Manon the opportunity.In March 1934, Manon and her mother traveled to Venice for the Easter <b>holiday.</b> There, Manon <b>contracted</b> polio, which left her totally paralyzed.

40|$|Traditional export {{processing}} {{zones are}} fenced-in industrial estates specializing in manufacturing for exports. Modern ones have more flexible rules, such as permitting more liberal domestic sales. They provide a free-trade and liberal regulatory {{environment for the}} firms involved. Their primary goals: to provide foreignexchange earnings by promoting non-traditional exports, to provide jobs and create income, and to attract foreign direct investment and attendant technology transfer and knowledge spillover. Domestic, international, or joint venture firms operating in export processing zones typically benefit from reduced red tape, flexible labor laws, generous <b>long-term</b> tax <b>holidays</b> and concessions, above-average communications services and infrastructure (and often subsidized utilities and rental rates), and unlimited duty-free imports of raw and intermediate inputs and capital goods needed for production. In this review of experience, the author concludes that export processing zones have limited applications; the better policy choice is to liberalize a country's entire economy. Under certain conditions - including appropriate setup and good management - export processing zones can play a dynamic role in a country's development, but only as a transitional step in an integrated movement toward general liberalization of the economy (with revisions as national economic conditions change). The world Bank, writes the author, should be cautious about supporting export processing zone projects, doing so only on a case-by-case basis, only with expert guidance, and only {{as part of a}} general reform package. It should not support isolated export processing zone projects in unreformed or post-reform economies (in the last case they might encourage backsliding on trade policy). In general, if a policy is good for the economy as a whole, {{it is likely to be}} good for an export processing zone. Sound policy will encourage: 1) Sound, stable monetary and fiscal policies, clear private property and investment laws, and a business-friendly economic environment. 2) Moderate, simplified (but not"over-friendly") corporate tax schedules, and generally liberal tariffs and other trade taxes. 3) Private development and management of export processing zones and their infrastructure and unsubsidized utilities. 4) Labor laws that are business-friendly but do not abuse workers'safety and labor rights. 5) A better understanding of the impact of industrial refuse on the quality of air, soil, water, and human health.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact due to farming of the Indian backwater oyster Crassostrea madrasensis (Preston) for five consecutive years was studied. The changes during crop holiday periods of three; six and nine months were also assessed. The water column and sediment characteristics and benthic macrofaunal community changes of farm sites of different farming and crop holiday periods {{were compared with}} those of reference sites. The study indicated that there were no significant variations in the hydrographic parameters due to continuous farming. Howeve the sediment characteristics and the benthic macrofaunal composition at the farm sites were found to change with continuous farming. The percentage of coarse and fine sand was found to decrease while that of silt, clay and organic carbon found to increase with the year of farming. The impact on sediment characteristics due to farming for two years could be rectified with a crop holiday of six months period but the impact due to continuous farming for five years could not be rectified even with a <b>long-term</b> crop <b>holiday</b> of nine months. The benthic macrofaunal communities of the farm and reference sites were found to vary with the year of farming. The number of species recorded at the farm and reference site of first year of farming was almost similar (30 for farm site, 28 for reference site). The number of species recorded for the second year farming period was 24 for farm site and 33 for reference site, but the difference was not significant. On the contrary, Significant differences were found in the number of species at the farm and reference sites of three, four and five years of farming. The number of individuals was always higher at the reference sites than that of farm sites. Maximum number of individuals (1278 m· 2) was recorded at the first year farm site and the minimum (279 m· 2) at the fourth year farm site. Improvements in number of species, number of individuals were noticed at farm sites when crop holiday was given and a crop holiday of six months proved to be useful in rectifying the impact of oyster farming of two years. Based on findings of the present study it is recommended that oyster farming can be done continuously for a maximum period of two years and if the culture needs to be carried {{for more than two years}} at the same site, a crop holiday of at least six months is to be given. Altemately, the location of farming has to be shifted to an adjacent site after 2 years...|$|R
