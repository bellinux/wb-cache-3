40|$|The remark has {{occasionally}} {{been made}} {{that there is nothing}} that can accurately be called a 2 ̆ 2 law of tort 2 ̆ 2 {{in the sense of a}} systematic and logically coherent body of legal principles which disclose a consistent policy in the protection of those interests which it is the function of tort law to protect. This is partly or at least superficially true. Certainly legal literature does not reveal that quantity of analysis and systematic development of legal conceptions in the field of tort that has characterized the development of the law of contract. This may, in part, be explained by the somewhat checkered history of tort law, as compared with that of contract law. The diverse origins of the various 2 ̆ 2 torts, 2 ̆ 2 and the tardy ripening of the idea of negligence as a source of liability, together with the difficulties of rationalizing the several <b>liabilities</b> <b>without</b> <b>fault</b> are obvious impediments to the growth of a uniform and logical structure. What is perhaps more important, the wide range of interests that are protected by tort law and the varying shades of protection required therefor indicate a slow growth of the rational side of this branch of law as compared with the almost unitary interest protected by the law of contracts. Whereas the latter is concerned with the shaping of a consistent policy to protect the interest in the security of promised advantages, the former must work out adequate protection for the interests in bodily security and freedom, security of property, reputation, privacy, marital and other domestic relations, mental and emotional interests, pecuniary interests connected with transactions and trade and business generally...|$|R

In social policy, various reforms {{were carried out}} {{in areas such as}} labour rights, care for the elderly, child support, and assistance for people with disabilities. In 1995, a law on family-care leave was introduced which made it mandatory for employers to grant a maximum of three consecutive months leave to male and female employees who need to take constant care of a family member, and prohibited employers from dismissing employees for taking family-care leave. Safety standards concerning mobile cranes were established in 1995, and amendments made to the Radiation Safety Law of 1960 and the Radiation Safety Law of 1957 in 1995 extended coverage to previously excluded rental business workers, rental business offices, and rental businesses. Amendments made to the Radiation Hindrance Prevention Law of 1957 in 1995 extended the law to cover rental business workers, rental business offices, and rental businesses. In July 1995, a law came into effect that imposed strict liability, or <b>liability</b> <b>without</b> <b>fault,</b> upon manufacturers and importers of defective products. The Food Sanitation Law of 1995 introduced a comprehensive food safety system. In 1995, an amendment to the Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law made gun possession a more serious offence, and the Science and Technology Basic Law passed that same year provided the framework of Japan’s science and technology policy.|$|E
50|$|Fault is {{an element}} of every crime. It may take one of two forms:• {{intention}} (dolus); or• negligence (culpa).All common-law crimes require intention (except for culpable homicide and contempt of court committed by an editor of a newspaper for which negligence is sufficient). Statutory crimes require either intention or negligence.Fault refers to the legal blameworthiness of the reprehensible state of mind or careless conduct of a criminally accountable person who has acted unlawfully.It is a firmly established principle of criminal justice {{that there can be no}} <b>liability</b> <b>without</b> <b>fault,</b> a principle generally expressed in the maxim actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea (the act is not wrongful unless the mind is guilty).In other words, the general rule is that, in order for an accused to be held liable, in addition to unlawful conduct (or actus reus) and capacity, there must be fault (or mens rea) on the part of the accused.The requirement of fault as an element of liability means, among other things, that fault must exist in respect of each and every element of the crime with which the accused has been charged. This is so whether fault is in the form of intention or of negligence. The only exception to the rule is where the Legislature expressly provides that fault need not exist in respect of each element of a crime but, even in this eventuality, there is a presumption of statutory interpretation that the Legislature intended some form of fault to be required.Murder, by way of illustration, is the unlawful, intentional killing of a human being. In terms of the rule, a person who kills another will be guilty only if he knows or at least foresees the possibility that what he has done is unlawfully to kill a human being. Fault must exist in respect of each of the elements of the crime; if it is absent for any one of them (as where the killer believes he is acting lawfully, or does not know or foresee that death will be the consequence of his conduct, or does not know or foresee that what he is killing is a human being), there can be no fault.The accused must know, therefore,• that he may be acting unlawfully;• that his actions may bring about a death; and• that it is a human being he is killing.|$|E

40|$|The {{formative}} {{period in}} the history of contract and tort (in {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century) may be characterized by the cleavage of contract and tort around the concept of fault: tort modernized by moving from strict liability to a regime of 2 ̆ 2 no <b>liability</b> <b>without</b> <b>fault,</b> 2 ̆ 2 while contract moved toward strict liability. The opposing attitudes toward fault are puzzling at first glance. Nineteenth-century scholars of private law offered explanations for the opposition, reasoning that alternative ideas about fault account for the different character of state involvement in enforcing private law rights: tort law governs liabilities imposed by law on nonconsenting members of society (and thus, it should limit itself to fault-based conduct), while contract law governs bargained-for duties and liabilities of parties who exercise freedom of contract (and thus, liability voluntarily undertaken need not consider fault). These theories are problematic, especially because they cannot offer a complete account of contract or tort. Tort retains too much strict liability to be thought of as a regime of no <b>liability</b> <b>without</b> <b>fault,</b> and contract has too many fault-based rules to be conceived of through strict liability. While these justifications for the distinction between contract and tort were questioned in ensuing generations, they still structure much of the debate over the current boundary between contract and tort...|$|E
40|$|For {{over one}} hundred years American courts {{expanded}} the rights of plaintiffs in products liability cases. First the courts eliminated the privity requirement, next the necessity of proving fault, and finally, the necessity of proving a production defect. The next logical step in this progression would be to eliminate the need to show any type of defect at all. In this Article, Professors Henderson and Twerski assert that this step cannot {{and will not be}} taken. They explore both the possibility of across-the-board <b>liability</b> <b>without</b> defect and the more limited idea of product-category <b>liability</b> <b>without</b> defect. They describe how a system of <b>liability</b> <b>without</b> defect would work, and then they demonstrate why such a system is neither workable nor desirable.

They also discuss the judicial system 2 ̆ 7 s flirtation with such an expansion.

40|$|A {{cornerstone}} of tort law in our Anglo-American system of jurisprudence is that liability is imposed, {{and the corresponding}} right to recovery is created, {{not because of the}} fact that the plaintiff is injured, but because the injury is the result of the defendant’s fault. Fault is either based upon the fact that the defendant was negligent in bringing about injury, or in the alternative, that the defendant intended or was substantially certain that the harm would result as the natural consequence of their behavior. The largest percentage of our tort litigation is involved with these issues. A smaller number however, are concerned with scenarios where culpability is not an issue. The defendant’s liability will result in these cases because our system of jurisprudence has dictated that blame is not an element of recovery. Instead, liability is imposed simply because of the relationship between the parties, or due to the fact that the defendant has undertaken the activity which resulted in injury. This is of course, <b>liability</b> <b>without</b> <b>fault,</b> or as it is more commonly known, strict liability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} design of {{objective}} tests of criminal responsibility for serious offences. It is argued that their design should reflect two fundamental principles. First, there is the principle {{that there should be}} no penal <b>liability</b> <b>without</b> <b>fault.</b> It follows from this principle {{that there should be no}} responsibility for failure to attain a standard that was beyond the capacities of the accused. Secondly, there is the principle of proportionality between culpability and penal liability. It follows from this principle that, if objective tests are to be used for serious offences, responsibility should be restricted to breaches of minimal standards of conduct that were attainable with reasonable ease. We should reject major penal sanctions for failure to attain idealistic or difficult standards. Moreover, in order to ensure that a standard could have been attained with reasonable ease, objective tests should be adaptable for any special handicaps of the accused. The paper uses these ideas to review the formulations of criminal negligence and of the objective elements in the defences of self-defence, provocation, duress and necessity...|$|E

40|$|Accidents occur; {{personal}} property is damaged and sometimes is lost altogether. Accident victims {{are likely to}} suffer anything from mere bruises and headaches to temporary or permanent disability to death. The personal and social costs of accidents are staggering. Yet {{the question of who}} should bear these costs has turned the heads of few philosophers and has occasioned surprisingly little philosophic discussion.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{critical}} evaluation of the compensation system for personal injury tort in Nigeria. The present compensation system under the law of tort leaves many victims of personal injury uncompensated in Nigeria. This stems from many factors, {{including the fact that}} traditional tort theory of no <b>liability</b> <b>without</b> <b>fault</b> has continued to be the principal basis for liability. This is in spite of the heavy criticisms of the tort regime as an ineffective mode of compensation. Through an analytical assessment of selected core heads of claims in tort, the paper reveals the inadequacy in the foundations of tort law and its regulation of claims for personal injury in Nigeria. Implications: It finds that fault as the primary foundation of tort law in Nigeria creates a large volume of uncompensated plaintiffs, who, without an efficient alternative social security to fall upon, have to personally bear their losses. In the light of this, the paper uses examples from other jurisdictions to recommend that tort law in Nigeria is in need of more legislative intervention. Value: The paper recommends that the provision of a sustainable compensation system for personal injury is imperative for social justice in Nigeria...|$|E
