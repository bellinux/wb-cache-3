40|$|Abstract: The plasma {{addressed}} {{liquid crystal}} display (PLAC) is a flat, <b>large</b> area, <b>full-colour</b> television and monitor technology made possible through the unique application of the properties of an ionized gas. Liquid crystal displays require an active switching element {{at the location of}} each pixel. The PALC display uses a plasma switch to address each of the display pixels, replacing typically used semiconductor devices. The use of the plasma switch permits the manufacture, in very large sizes, of a display possessing excellent image quality. The performance of the PALC display is intrinsically related to the behaviour of the plasma used as the switching element. This paper reviews the trends that {{led to the development of}} the PALC display, describes the operating principals, and examines, in detail, one of the many areas of ongoing plasma physics research. The successful development of a model, which agrees with the measured decay behaviour of the plasma, contributed to a significant improvement in the performance of the PALC display. 1...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years the {{architectural}} field has seen the development of the so-called “Deconstructivism”, showing a great tendency to break the rules regarding regularity and symmetry, right-angles, vertical and horizontal planes. These aspects had been proposed and tacitly accepted for centuries, becoming the prevailing compositional rules up to modern times (with a peak in neoclassical architecture) and characterising a great many public and private buildings; with some exceptions which, as anomalies, have become a great tourist attraction. Modern buildings following the new trend show conspicuous examples of perceptual incongruity. This visual property, with its emotional repercussions, constitutes its most salient feature, regardless of the usual philosophical references and of the rationalisations accompanying the designs at a theoretical level. The taste for incongruity is found both in the blueprints and in the final constructions, including examples by Frank O. Gehry, located in Europe or in the United States; or buildings, such as the UFA multiscreen cinema here in Dresden, designed by Wolf Dieter Prix, Helmut Swiczinsky and associates; or works by Daniel Libeskind, Peter Eisenman, Zaha Adid, Bernard Tshumi and others (Papadakis, 1994; Thiel-Siling, 1999). Continuity and novelty aspects, with respect to previous relatively incongruous buildings, have been carefully evaluated; and more in general, speaking of incongruity, we should quote Bruner & Postman (1949), Berlyne (1960), Venturi (1966). From a psychological standpoint, we found it interesting and useful to demonstrate the possibility of modifying – through appropriate verbal messages transmitted to beholders – the intensity of the perceptions of incongruity and their possible anxiety arousing power. These studies derive from previous investigations which had shown the possibility to manipulate perceptual incongruity and its correlates, by using verbal explanations which reduced the degree of “open conflict” when perceiving paradoxical configurations; or, depending on their content, managed to accentuate the conflict if this was initially “latent” (Bartoli, Biasi & Bonaiuto, 1989). Similar results there also obtained with non-verbal messages (colours and symbols). In the last experiment, the conflict-reducing procedure based on written verbal descriptions was applied with observers involved in examining slide projections of <b>large</b> <b>full-colour</b> pictures of two very incongruent buildings: the Dresden UFA multiscreen cinema just mentioned and the two parodoxical towers of Prague. Comparisons were made of the resulting effects of fitting interpretations and appropriate explanations, or of extraneous texts or even the absence of explanations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{presents}} a novel method for fabricating quantum dot light-emitting devices (QDLEDs) based on colloidal inorganic light-emitting nanoparticles incorporated into an organic semiconductor matrix. CdSe core/ZnS shell nanoparticles were inkjet-printed in air and sandwiched between organic hole and electron transport layers to produce efficient photon-emissive media. The light-emitting devices fabricated here were tested as individual devices and {{integrated into a}} display setting, thus endorsing the capability of this method as a manufacturing approach for <b>full-colour</b> high-definition <b>displays.</b> By choosing inkjet printing as a deposition method for quantum dots, several problems currently inevitable with alternative methods are addressed. First, inkjet printing promises simple patterning due to its drop-on-demand concept, thus overruling a need for complicated and laborious patterning methods. Secondly, manufacturing costs can be reduced significantly by introducing this prudent fabrication step for very expensive nanoparticles. Since there are no prior demonstrations of inkjet printing of electroluminescent quantum dot devices in the literature, this work dives into the basics of inkjet printing of low-viscosity, relatively highly volatile quantum dot inks: piezo driver requirements, jetting parameters, fluid dynamics in the cartridge and on the surface, nanoparticle assembly in a wet droplet and packing of dots on the surface are main concerns in the experimental part. Device performance is likewise discussed and {{plays an important role}} in this thesis. Several compositional QDLED structures are described. In addition, different pixel geometries are discussed. The last part of this dissertation deals with the principles of QDLED displays and their basic components: RGB pixels and organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) drivers. Work related to transistors is intertwined with QDLED work; ideas for surface treatments that enhance nanoparticle packing are carried over from self-assembled monolayer (SAM) studies in the OTFT field. Moreover, all the work done in this thesis project was consolidated by one method, atomic force microscopy (AFM), which is discussed throughout the entire thesis...|$|R

40|$|Solid-state {{lighting}} technology based on injection electroluminescence devices, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), already found numerous applications in traffic lights, automotive signage, <b>full-colour</b> video <b>displays,</b> {{liquid crystal display}} backlighting, optical measurements, phototherapy, and other niche applications. The development of white LEDs based on partial or complete conversion of short-wavelength radiation in phosphors and phosphor blends and recent progress in compound semiconductor and phosphor materials quality and photonic design of the chips resulted in that LEDs are also considered as promising candidates in general lighting. General lighting based on solid-state lamps has a high potential in energy saving, offers vast environmental benefits, and features unsurpassed longevity, reduced maintenance, and functionality. In industrialized countries where electrical lighting is very common, solid-state lighting meets high competition from conventional sources of light, such as incandescent, fluorescent, high-pressure sodium, and metal-halide lamps. Meanwhile in developing countries, especially in rural area, LEDs encroach on the lighting market occupied by fuel-based sources, such as firewood and kerosene lamps. Owing to high efficiency, compatibility with off-network and rechargeable-battery-based d. c. sources of electrical power, such as photovoltaic, hydro, wind, and pedal generators, LEDs are the most appropriate sources for such substitution with huge benefits in energy consumption, cost, {{as well as in}} resolving education and health issues [4, 5]. In particular, fuel-based sources have luminous efficiency below 0. 1 lm/W comparing to 15 - 80 1 m/W of present commercial LEDs with a potential of attaining 200 - 1 m/W efficiency in the nearest future. To this end, penetration of solid-state {{lighting technology}} to general lighting might be even faster in developing countries than in industrialized ones, especially with international support taken into account. Solid-state lamps are a novel source for general lighting with no well-established standards developed so far. However because of cost pressure, fabrication of solid-sate lamps for developing countries is drawn to local manufacturing facilities, which lack instrumental characterization. Meanwhile the conditions of exploitation of lighting devices in developing countries are much harsher than in industrialized ones and involve wide ranges of temperature and humidity, variation in driving voltage, and smoking from organic-fuel based stoves. This draws a need in international cooperation on characterization of solid-state lamps manufactured in developing countries. The present work aimed at the temperature, directional, and chromatic characterization of solid-state lamps manufactured for Rural Integrated Development Services-Nepal (RIDS-Nepal) village illumination programs...|$|R

In Australia and then Britain he held exhibitions of his work and in 1847 he published two works based on this time in New Zealand: a <b>large</b> volume of <b>full-colour</b> lithographs, The New Zealanders Illustrated and a travel narrative based on his journal, Savage Life and Scenes in Australia and New Zealand. These exhibitions and publications comprised the nineteenth century’s largest collection of works about Maori and Maori culture. This thesis is a study of the ‘more correct idea’ that Angas sought to provide: his creation of colonial knowledge about Maori. Angas is most commonly described in New Zealand as being an unremarkable artist but as providing a window onto New Zealand in the 1840 s. This thesis opens the window wider by looking at Angas’s works as a record of a cultural encounter and the formation of a colonial identity. The works were shaped by numerous ideological and intellectual currents from Britain and the empire, including humanitarianism and the aesthetic of the picturesque. Ideas about gender and the body form a central part of the colonial knowledge created in Angas’s work. Particularly notable is what this thesis terms ‘sartorial colonisation’ – a process of colonisation through discourse and expectations around clothes. Angas also travelled and worked in a dynamic middle ground in New Zealand and Maori played a vital role in the creation of his works. Angas represented Maori in a sympathetic light in many ways. Ultimately however, he believed in the superiority of the British culture, to the detriment of creating colonial knowledge that placed Maori as equal partners in the recently signed Treaty of Waitangi. This thesis also examines the ways in which Angas’s body of work has been engaged with by the New Zealand public through to the present. As a study of the products of a British traveller who spent time {{in other parts of the}} empire as well as in New Zealand, this thesis contributes to histories of New Zealand, and British imperial and transcolonial history...|$|R
