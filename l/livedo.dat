5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as <b>livedo</b> reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} {{experienced in}} cholesterol embolism depend {{largely on the}} organ involved. Non-specific symptoms often described are fever, muscle ache and weight loss. Embolism to the legs causes a mottled appearance and purple discoloration of the toes, small infarcts and areas of gangrene due to tissue death that usually appear black, and areas of the skin that assume a marbled pattern known as <b>livedo</b> reticularis. The pain is usually severe and requires opiates. If the ulcerated plaque is below the renal arteries the manifestations appear in both lower extremities. Very rarely the ulcerated plaque is below the aortic bifurcation and those cases the changes occur only in one lower extremity.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol {{embolism}} (often cholesterol crystal embolism or atheroembolism, sometimes blue toe or purple toe syndrome or trash foot or warfarin blue toe syndrome) {{occurs when}} cholesterol is released, usually from an atherosclerotic plaque, and travels as an embolus {{in the bloodstream}} to lodge (as an embolism) causing an obstruction in blood vessels further away. Most commonly this causes skin symptoms (usually <b>livedo</b> reticularis), gangrene of the extremities and sometimes renal failure; problems with other organs may arise, depending on the site at which the cholesterol crystals enter the bloodstream. When the kidneys are involved, the disease {{is referred to as}} atheroembolic renal disease (AERD). The diagnosis usually involves biopsy (removing a tissue sample) from an affected organ. Cholesterol embolism is treated by removing the cause and giving supportive therapy; statin drugs have been found to improve the prognosis.|$|E

CMTC is also used synonymously with congenital generalized phlebectasia, nevus vascularis reticularis, congenital phlebectasia, <b>livedo</b> telangiectatica, congenital <b>livedo</b> reticularis and Van Lohuizen syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Skin and mucous membranes: 20-30% {{of people}} with {{relapsing}} polychondritis have skin involvement, including aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, {{and a number of}} non-specific skin rashes including erythema nodosum, <b>livedo</b> reticularis, hives, and erythema multiforme.|$|E

50|$|Injection site {{reactions}} are allergic reactions {{that result in}} cutaneous necrosis that may occur at sites of medication injection, typically presenting {{in one of two}} forms, (1) those associated with intravenous infusion or (2) those related to intramuscular injection. Intra muscular injections may produce a syndrome called <b>livedo</b> dermatitis.|$|E
50|$|Other common findings, {{although}} {{not part of}} the APS classification criteria, are low platelet count, heart valve disease, and <b>livedo</b> reticularis. There are also associations between antiphospholipid antibodies and headaches, migraines, and oscillopsia. Some studies have shown the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood and spinal fluid of patients with psychological symptoms.|$|E
50|$|In this disease, {{symptoms}} {{result from}} ischemic damage to affected organs, often the skin, heart, kidneys, and nervous system. Generalised symptoms include fever, fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Muscle and joint aches are common. The skin may show rashes, swelling, ulcers, and lumps. Palpable purpura and <b>livedo</b> reticularis {{can occur in}} some patients.|$|E
5000|$|Sneddon's {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} condition that is usually misdiagnosed. [...] It occurs in families and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Sneddon's Syndrome most often becomes apparent in women in their thirties, though cases do occur in men and in children. Generally, <b>Livedo</b> precedes cerebrovascular involvement by roughly ten years, and many years of cerebrovascular involvement precede the development of dementia, when it occurs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Livedo</b> reticularis is {{a common}} skin finding {{consisting}} of a mottled reticulated vascular pattern that appears as a lace-like purplish discoloration of the skin. The discoloration is caused by swelling of the venules owing to obstruction of capillaries by small blood clots. The blood clots in the small blood vessels can be a secondary effect of a condition that increases a person's risk of forming blood clots, including {{a wide array of}} pathological and nonpathological conditions [...] Examples include hyperlipidemia, microvascular hematological or anemia states, nutritional deficiencies, hyper- and autoimmune diseases, and drugs/toxins.|$|E
