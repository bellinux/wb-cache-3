50|$|During {{his time}} in England he had {{gathered}} information about the application of chlorine to the bleaching of paper-stuff and lost no time in applying it to his mills in America. At that time paper was made from ground-up <b>linen</b> <b>rags,</b> which after fermenting and disintegrating needed to be bleached to make white paper. He witnessed the process first October 1795 in William Simpson's Polton Bank mill at Lasswade in Scotland, and later, in March 1796, in James Smith's mill at Maidstone, Kent. The process had been discovered by the French chemist Berthollet and introduced into Scotland by 1791 and England the following year.|$|R
60|$|Rags.--Charred <b>linen</b> <b>rags</b> {{make the}} tinder that catches fire most easily, that burns most hotly when blown upon, and smoulders most slowly when left to itself, {{of any kind}} of tinder that is {{generally}} to be obtained. In making it the rags are lighted, and when in a blaze and before they are burnt to white ashes, the flame is stifled out. It is usual to make this kind of tinder in the box intended to hold it; but it can easily be made {{on the ground in the}} open air, by setting light to the rag, and dropping pinches of sand upon the flaming parts as soon as it is desired to quench them. The sand is afterwards brushed away, and the tinder gently extricated.|$|R
50|$|The process {{started with}} paper made from cotton rags. Before the {{processing}} of wood pulp and chemical wood pulps in the mid-19th century, the dominant fibre source for paper making was cotton and <b>linen</b> <b>rags.</b> The cotton rag sheet produced for conversion to vulcanized fibre is made like a sheet suitable for saturating. A paper is made for saturating by omitting any sizing additive, either beater added or surface applied. Today most paper sheets made for writing, printing, and coating have internal (beater added) sizing provided by rosin, alkyl succinic anhydride (ASA), or alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and surface sizing provided by starch. A sheet made for saturating {{would have none of}} those chemical ingredients. The unsized saturating cotton fibre paper prepared for vulcanized fibre would be passed through a vat containing a zinc chloride solution.|$|R

Other examples of portraits with both animals and people in Freud's work include Guy and Speck (1980-81), Eli and David (2005-06) and Double Portrait (1985-86). He had a special passion for horses, having enjoyed riding at school in Dartington, where he sometimes slept in the stables. His portraits solely of horses include Grey Gelding (2003), Skewbald Mare (2004), and Mare Eating Hay (2006). Wilting houseplants feature prominently in some portraits, especially in the 1960s, and Freud also produced a number of paintings purely of plants. Other regular features included mattresses in earlier works, and huge piles of the <b>linen</b> <b>rags</b> with which he used to clean his brushes in later ones. Some portraits, especially in the 1980s, have very carefully painted views of London roofscapes seen through the studio windows.|$|R

Generally speaking, the political news, whether domestic or foreign, might be written to-day for the next ten years, with sufficient accuracy. Most revolutions in society have not power to interest, still less alarm us; but tell me that our rivers are drying up, or the genus pine dying out in the country, and I might attend. Most events recorded in history are more remarkable than important, like eclipses of the sun and moon, by which all are attracted, but whose effects no one takes the trouble to calculate.|$|R
5000|$|Paper {{can be said}} to {{have been}} born in ancient Egypt, circa 2000 B.C., with the {{invention}} of what the Romans called “papyrus”, based on an earlier Greek name for the material. Papyrus is not paper in the modern sense of the word, since it was formed from compressed sheets of reed stalks and not a pulp. Paper made from a pulped plant fiber can be credited to Ts’ai Lun of China in 105 A.D., when he first presented the Emperor a sheet of paper made from the inner bark of a mulberry tree. When the technique of papermaking found its way into Europe, paper was made not from trees but from a pulp of cotton and <b>linen</b> <b>rag</b> fibers. This technique of papermaking first came to America in Germantown, Pennsylvania in 1690 when William Rittenhouse established the first paper mill. Rittenhouse had been a papermaker in Amsterdam, the Netherlands before coming to America, bringing European techniques with him.|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} fine art inkjet papers {{meet the needs of}} {{professional}} photographers and artists. These papers share many characteristics with traditional watercolor, printmaking, and photographic papers. Fine art inkjet papers are designed to meet similar standards for longevity as traditional fine art papers: they should have a neutral pH, be lignin-free, and not include optical brighteners. Fine art inkjet papers differ from traditional fine art papers, in that they include coatings engineered to receive and hold ink. Fine art papers are usually made of <b>rag</b> <b>pulp</b> (100% cotton being the most common) but may also be have an alpha-cellulose base. Some descriptions and comparisons {{of fine art}} inkjet papers are here, here, here, and here. Some fine art papers are mold made, while others are machine made, and may vary considerably in surface texture. Many fine art papers are available in pre-cut sheets or in rolls.|$|R

Then with Billali's help I staggered off to see Leo. I found him dreadfully bruised, worse even than myself, perhaps owing to the excessive whiteness of his skin, and faint and weak with the loss of blood from the flesh wound in his side, but for all that cheerful as a cricket, and asking for some breakfast. Job and Ustane got him on to the bottom, or rather the sacking of a litter, which was removed from its pole for that purpose, and with the aid of old Billali carried him out into the shade {{at the mouth of the}} cave, from which, by the way, every trace of the slaughter of the previous night had now been removed, and there we all breakfasted, and indeed spent that day, and most of the two following ones.|$|R
50|$|Matthias Koops (active 1789-1805) was a British paper-maker {{who invented}} the first {{practical}} processes for manufacturing paper from wood pulp, straw, or recycled waste paper, without the necessity of including expensive <b>linen</b> or cotton <b>rags.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Paper {{was made}} one sheet {{at a time}} by hand until {{development}} of the Fourdrinier paper machine (c. 1801) which made a continuous sheet. [...] Paper making was severely limited by the supply of cotton and <b>linen</b> <b>rags</b> {{from the time of}} the invention of the printing press until the development of wood pulp (c. 1850s)in response to a shortage of rags. [...] The sulfite process for making wood pulp started operation in Sweden in 1874. Paper made from sulfite pulp had superior strength properties than the previously used ground wood pulp (c. 1840). The kraft (Swedish for strong) pulping process was commercialized in the 1930s. [...] Pulping chemicals are recovered and internally recycled in the kraft process, also saving energy and reducing pollution. [...] Kraft paperboard is the material that the outer layers of corrugated boxes are made of. [...] Until Kraft corrugated boxes were available, packaging consisted of poor quality paper and paperboard boxes along with wood boxes and crates. Corrugated boxes require much less labor to manufacture than wooden boxes and offer good protection to their contents. [...] Shipping containers reduce the need for packaging.|$|R

60|$|Nor did the Library {{produce any}} {{improvements}} in book making. That ancient world had no paper made in definite sizes from <b>rag</b> <b>pulp.</b> Paper was a Chinese invention {{and it did}} not reach the western world until the ninth century A.D. The only book materials were parchment and strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge. These strips were kept on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to and fro and read, and very inconvenient for reference. It was these things that prevented the development of paged and printed books. Printing itself was known in the world it would seem as early as the Old Stone Age; there were seals in ancient Sumeria; but without abundant paper there was little advantage in printing books, an improvement that may further have been resisted by trades unionism {{on the part of the}} copyists employed. Alexandria produced abundant books but not cheap books, and it never spread knowledge into the population of the ancient world below the level of a wealthy and influential class.|$|R

She assisted me cheerfully in my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old <b>linen</b> <b>rags</b> for the paper-makers, &c. We kept no idle servants; our table was plain and simple, our furniture of the cheapest. For instance, my breakfast was, for a long time, bread and milk (no tea), and I ate {{it out of a}} twopenny earthen porringer, with a pewter spoon: but mark how luxury will enter families, and make a progress in spite of principle; being called one morning to breakfast, I found it in a china bowl, with a spoon of silver. They had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife, and had cost her the enormous sum of three-and-twenty shillings; for which she had no other excuse or apology to make, but that she thought her husband deserved a silver spoon and china bowl as well as any of his neighbours. This was the first appearance of plate and china in our house, which afterward, in a course of years, as our wealth increased, augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value.|$|R

30|$|A {{survey of}} Bauer’s papers during the project {{demonstrated}} that he almost exclusively used high quality white, laid papers of Dutch origin. Almost {{all of these}} can be identified by their watermarks as papers from the mill of C&J Honig, imported in large quantities to England throughout the century. 8 As demand for white paper increased, so did demand for quality, white <b>linen</b> <b>rags</b> [35]. Cheaper, lower quality rags were used for efficiency, but resulted in papers with a yellow tinge. To visually counteract this, ‘blueing’ agents {{in the form of}} dyes, blue textile rags and pigments were added to the paper at the pulp stage [34 – 36]. The use of smalt for this purpose was widespread in the eighteenth century, as very little pigment was required to tint or neutralise the tone of the paper [35]. The practice likely originated in the Netherlands, whose mills were highly regarded for their blue papers [34], and smalt has been positively identified in Dutch eighteenth century white papers in a number of studies [34, 36, 37]. The source of cobalt in Bauer’s paintings is therefore more indicative of this practice, rather than the presence of smalt as a pigment. Furthermore, the presence of copper in almost all examples analysed by XRF, together with the positive identification of azurite in the earlier Madrid chart, strongly suggests that in addition to indigo, Bauer's tendency was to use copper blue pigments in his work.|$|R
50|$|Bond {{paper is}} a high quality durable writing paper similar to bank paper but having a weight greater than 50 g/m2. The most common weights are 60 g/m2 (16 lb), 75 g/m2 (20 lb) and 90 g/m2 (24 lb). The name comes from its having {{originally}} been made for documents such as government bonds. It is now used for letterheads, other stationery and as paper for electronic printers. Widely employed for graphic work involving pencil, pen and felt-tip marker, bond paper can sometimes contain <b>rag</b> fibre <b>pulp,</b> which produces a stronger, though rougher, sheet of paper.|$|R
5000|$|The oldest known paper {{document}} in the West is the Mozarab Missal of Silos from the 11th century, probably using paper {{made in the}} Islamic part of the Iberian Peninsula.

The first recorded paper mill in the Iberian Peninsula was in Xàtiva in 1056.Papermaking reached Europe as early as 1085 in Toledo and was firmly established in Xàtiva, Spain by 1150. It is clear that France had a paper mill by 1190, and by 1276 mills were established in Fabriano, Italy and in Treviso and other northern Italian towns by 1340. Papermaking then spread further northwards, with evidence of paper being made in Troyes, France by 1348, in Holland sometime around 1340-1350, in Mainz, Germany in 1320, and in Nuremberg by 1390 in a mill set up by Ulman Stromer. This was just about the time when the woodcut printmaking technique was transferred from fabric to paper in the old master print and popular prints. There was a paper mill in Switzerland by 1432 and the first mill in England was set up by John Tate in 1490 near Stevenage in Hertfordshire, but the first commercially successful paper mill in Britain did not occur before 1588 when John Spilman set up a mill near Dartford in Kent. [...] During this time, paper making spread to Poland by 1491, to Austria by 1498, to Russia by 1576, to the Netherlands by 1586, to Denmark by 1596, and to Sweden by 1612.|$|R

2500|$|Quilting {{originated}} in Sweden {{in the fifteenth}} century with heavily stitched and appliquéd quilts made for the very wealthy. These quilts, created from silk, wool, and felt, were intended to be both decorative and functional and were found in churches and in the homes of nobility. Imported cotton first appeared in Sweden in 1870, and began to appear in Swedish quilts soon after along with scraps of wool, silk, and linen. As the availability of cotton increased and its price went down, quilting became widespread among all classes of Swedish society. Wealthier quilters used wool batting while others used <b>linen</b> scraps, <b>rags,</b> or paper mixed with animal hair. In general, these quilts were simple and narrow, [...] made by both men and women. The biggest influence on Swedish quilting in this time period is thought to have come from America as Swedish immigrants to the United States returned to their home country when conditions there improved.|$|R
