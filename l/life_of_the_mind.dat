Kant's first critique is generally recognized as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both continental and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of transcendental consciousness, or the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> as conceived through universal categories of consciousness.|$|E

Whereas many Balzac stories focus on the external world, Louis Lambert examines many aspects of the thought process and the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind.</b> Many critics, however, condemn the author's disorganized style and his placement of his own mature philosophies into the mind of a teenage boy.|$|E

They assembled twelve couples who were interested not only in demanding physical labor but also in a <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> {{but none of them}} had enough money to embark on the project, which required much capital. Therefore, the poets undertook a lecture tour of England to raise funds; however, they never generated enough money and never emigrated.

2500|$|But he {{was also}} sure that Oldbuck's {{greatest}} resemblance was to his own author, and this view has been widely accepted by modern critics. [...] Scott's pursuit of antiquities {{was every bit as}} enthusiastic as Oldbuck's, and he could easily have said with the laird of Monkbarns “My great-great-great-grandfather – it's a shame to the English language that we have not a less clumsy way of expressing a relationship of which we have occasion to think and speak so frequently.” [...] A particular obsession of Scott's was the tracking down of Border ballads, which he edited in The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and likewise Oldbuck was “a diligent collector of these scraps of ancient poetry”. [...] In later years Scott repeatedly compared himself to Oldbuck when discussing his antiquarian pursuits in his letters. [...] The two men were equally capable of being taken in by fraudulent impositions on their credulity, as when Scott accepted the fake ballad “Barthram’s Dirge” and a manufactured Latin legend about a spectre knight from his friend Robert Surtees. [...] They were also equally prone to buying land purely for its historical associations, Scott being in the process of completing his acquisition of the entire wide-ranging site of the battle of Melrose while he was writing The Antiquary. [...] Oldbuck’s preference for publishing his scholarly papers and the proposed notes for Lovel's Caledoniad anonymously or pseudonymously recall the fact that The Antiquary, like all the earlier Waverley novels, first appeared without Scott's name. [...] Both men were careful in their daily expenditure, yet generous to others. [...] Scott gave to his creation many of his own family circumstances, legal training, and experiences in love, with the young Oldbuck's rejection by Eveline Neville echoing quite closely Scott’s own by Williamina Belsches, even to the retreat into antiquarianism as a distraction from his sorrows. [...] John Sutherland has suggested that the name of Oldbuck's house, Monkbarns, is analogous to that of Scott’s new home Abbotsford. [...] Scott and his brainchild took opposite sides in politics – [...] Oldbuck being a Whig, Scott a Tory – and many critics have been surprised at the defence of the French Revolution Scott allows Oldbuck to voice, but it has been claimed that Oldbuck's views on this question are identical with those expressed by Scott in his Life of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Revolution being for both of them a historical necessity.

6000|$|This {{statement}} {{puts the}} alternative {{in a very}} extreme form {{in which it is}} somewhat unreal. It may be said in reply that for those who have had the leisure and the opportunity to enjoy ``eternal truths'' it is easy to exalt their importance at the expense of sufferings which fall on others. This is true; but, if it is taken as disposing of the question, it leaves out of account the importance of thought for progress. Viewing the life of mankind as a whole, in the future {{as well as in the}} present, there can be no question that a society in which some men pursue knowledge while others endure great poverty offers more hope of ultimate good than a society in which all are sunk in slothful comfort. It is true that poverty is a great evil, but it is not true that material prosperity is in itself a great good.
