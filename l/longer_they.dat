5|$|According to Constantine VII, the Slavs rose {{up again}} in the early 840s, but were {{defeated}} by strategos Theoktistos Bryennios. In the south, the two tribes of the Ezeritai and Melingoi held out <b>longer.</b> <b>They</b> were eventually subdued and forced to pay heavy tribute, but retained their autonomy. These two tribes rose up again a century later, in 921. Again they were quickly subdued, this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times.|$|E
5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the <b>longer</b> <b>they</b> were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the family}} has to create budget cuts in their daily routine, such as Homer having {{to give up on}} buying beer and Marge having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly lottery ticket. Bart must get his hair cut at a local barber school, Lisa can no longer get her volumes of Encyclopedia Generica, and Maggie's clothes have to last a little bit <b>longer.</b> <b>They</b> {{eventually}} save up enough money for the operation, which is a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the morale of the family suffers and they take their annoyance out on Santa's Little Helper. Feeling unwanted, he runs away from home and goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken to the dog pound, and adopted by Mr. Burns, who trains him to be one of his vicious attack hounds. After a long brainwashing process, consisting of the Ludovico technique, Santa's Little Helper is turned into a bloodthirsty killer.|$|E

They shouted to him to run because they knew that running was no use. They urged the panther to leap because they fanned its rage with their screams.|$|R

5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the <b>longer</b> <b>they</b> are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Canadian Battalion {{successfully}} {{destroyed the}} bridges at Varaville and Robehomme after {{landing on the}} northern DZ. They then withdrew to defend Le Mesnil, where the brigade headquarters and the field ambulance were located. Meanwhile, by 02:50 only 150 men of the 9th Parachute Battalion had gathered at their assembly area, with virtually no heavy weapons or supplies. Unable to wait any <b>longer,</b> <b>they</b> headed for the Merville Gun Battery. The battalion captured the battery, but without explosives, could only damage two of its four guns. The battle had been costly, and only 85 men were left to head for their secondary objective, the village of Le Plein. The village was defended in strength by the Germans, and the weakened battalion could only dig in and wait the arrival of commandos from the 1st Special Service Brigade later that day. By nightfall the brigade was deployed facing east, along the ridge of high ground from Le Plein in the north to the Bois de Bavent in the south.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} two families, {{one in each}} {{half-hour of}} the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant {{version of the same}} meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to the chefs as well as how <b>longer</b> <b>they</b> think it will take to prepare it. The chefs are then given {{the same amount of time}} to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and the procedure is repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000; if the chefs win, the family receives $1,000 worth of kitchen supplies.|$|E

25|$|Men are 25% {{more likely}} to suffer strokes than women, yet 60% of deaths from stroke occur in women. Since women live <b>longer,</b> <b>they</b> are older on average when they have their strokes and thus more often killed. Some risk factors for stroke apply only to women. Primary among these are pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and the {{treatment}} thereof (HRT).|$|E

25|$|Autorack {{and flat}} car length quickly grew to 87 feet (26.52m) and then 89 feet (27.13m) to {{increase}} their loading capacity even further. This made them {{about as long as}} the average railroad passenger car of the time; if the cars were much <b>longer,</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't be able to operate in interchange service due to clearance on curves. Yet, the railroads could still do better.|$|E
25|$|Main deck ULDs and pallets are {{not only}} taller than lower deck ULDs, they are {{frequently}} two or four times <b>longer.</b> <b>They</b> are usually organized like an LD6, using {{the width of the}} plane and missing two profile corners, or two very long LD3s, stored in parallel to use the plane's width and each missing one profile corner, but often twice or four times as long from plane's nose to tail.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} graph (Figure 165) the {{depicted}} net benefits are averaged for people turning age 65 anytime {{during the years}} 2005 through 2045. (In other words, the disparities shown {{are not related to}} retirement.) However, we do see the impact of gender and wage level. Because women tend to live <b>longer,</b> <b>they</b> generally collect Social Security benefits for a longer time. As a result, they get a higher net benefit, on average, no matter what the wage level.|$|E

Once again though the only winner on day three was the weather {{with much of the}} day lost to the rain.|$|E
25|$|Like most Germanic languages, Dutch forms noun compounds, {{where the}} first noun modifies the {{category}} given by the second (hondenhok = doghouse). Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces, Dutch (like the other Germanic languages) either uses the closed form without spaces (boomhut = tree house) or inserts a hyphen (VVD-coryfee = outstanding member of the VVD, a political party). Like German, Dutch allows arbitrarily long compounds, but the <b>longer</b> <b>they</b> get, the less frequent they tend to be.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden, {{where the}} first Sunday of Advent marks {{the start of the}} Christmas and holiday season, {{continuing}} with Saint Lucy's Day on December 13, followed up by Christmas before the Mellandagsrea (between days sell off) traditionally begins on December 27 (nowadays often December 26 or even December 25) and lasts {{during the rest of the}} Christmas holiday. It is similar to Black Friday, but lasts <b>longer.</b> <b>They</b> last 34–35 days. Black Friday itself has also gained publicity in Sweden since the early-2010s.

25|$|By 18 June 1560, after Mary of Guise had died, the French at Edinburgh Castle {{realised}} their cipher was in English hands, {{and they}} advised the Leith garrison {{to continue to}} use the code in letters that might be captured, to spread disinformation that would be advantageous in the ongoing peace negotiations. The coded advice letter itself was intercepted by the English and deciphered. It also suggested the use of fire signals to advertise how much <b>longer</b> <b>they</b> could last, as food was short, {{for the benefit of}} the French diplomats at Edinburgh Castle. Signal beacons were to be lit on St Anthony's Church or the Citadel or both, half an hour before midnight.|$|E
500|$|Although {{more massive}} stars have more fuel to burn and might {{intuitively}} {{be expected to}} last <b>longer,</b> <b>they</b> also radiate a proportionately greater amount with increased mass. This is required by the stellar equation of state; for a massive star to maintain equilibrium, the outward pressure of radiated energy generated in the core not only must but will rise to match the titanic inward gravitational pressure of its [...] envelope. Thus, the most massive stars may remain on the main sequence {{for only a few}} million years, while stars with less than a tenth of a solar mass may last for over a trillion years.|$|E

When the plan goes awry, they accidentally sink the judge's houseboat and are once again brought into court. Just as Judge Harm is ready to bang her gavel, Judge Snyder comes back from his fishing trip and declares a verdict of [...] "Boys will be boys," [...] dismissing the case. While driving home afterwards, Marge makes the entire family promise not to break the law again for a whole year, which Homer instantly breaks when he runs over Hans Moleman.|$|E
