Easements <b>by</b> <b>estoppel</b> generally look to any promises not made in writing, any money spent by the benefiting party in reliance on the representations of the burdened party, and other factors. If the court finds that the buyer acted reasonably and in good faith and relied on the seller's promises, the court may create an easement <b>by</b> <b>estoppel.</b>|$|R

2500|$|<b>Estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{convention}} as {{understood in}} English law (also known as <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> agreement) occurs where two parties negotiates or operates a contract {{based on a}} shared assumption or mutual understanding of a legal effect (or interpretation) of that contract, they are bound by that belief, assumption or understanding if (i) they both knew the other operated under the same, and (ii) they both regulated their subsequent dealings on the same.

Both Halsbury's and Spencer Bower (see below) describe all three estoppels collectively as <b>estoppels</b> <b>by</b> representation. These <b>estoppels</b> can be invoked when a promisee/representee wishes to enforce a promise/representation when no consideration was provided by him. The court will only enforce this lack-of-consideration promise {{if and only if}} it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] for the promisor/representor to rescind from his promise/representation ("it's not fair!"). Estoppel when invoked in such a manner is often considered a rival or alternative to the doctrine of consideration under contract law. Only proprietary estoppel can create a cause of action in English law, though the other two can act in support of a cause of action or a reply to a defence. Under American jurisprudence, equitable estoppel is available only as a defense, while promissory estoppel can be used as the basis of a cause of action.|$|R
