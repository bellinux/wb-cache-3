25|$|Until 1916, mail {{carriers}} {{knocked on}} the door and waited patiently for someone to answer. Efficiency experts estimated that each mailman lost over 1.5 hours each day just waiting for patrons to come to the door. To correct this problem, the Post Office Department ordered that every household must have a mail box or <b>letter</b> <b>slot</b> in order to receive mail. This requirement was phased in, starting with new delivery locations, around 1912. Slowly, homeowners and businesses began to install mail slots or attached mailboxes to receive mail when they were either not at home or unable to answer the door. The requirement was made mandatory in 1923.|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} {{entry is}} a slightly asymmetrical gabled porch {{attached to the}} front of the projecting bay of the former office. Unlined internally, the porch retains the <b>letter</b> <b>slot</b> to the side of the panelled French entry doors.|$|E
50|$|Centrally {{located on}} the lower verandah, the main entry has a pair of timber {{panelled}} doors with brass handles and <b>letter</b> <b>slots.</b> Beyond the entry is a central corridor with offices to either side. The corridor contains the marble honour boards and the timber stair, which has turned balusters and newels. The honour boards, mounted on the southern wall of the ground floor corridor, list 1592 local servicemen from the First World War. The dedication inscription has not been completed.|$|R
50|$|Edward H. Taylor was {{the only}} {{postmaster}} serving the community of Gopher, after having been appointed in 1895. In that year, area citizens could pick up their mail at his house, about six miles (10 km) from Sheridan, {{on the east side}} of Gopher Valley Road. He later moved to the Hussey home, relocating the office to a small room near the front entry. A window and <b>letter</b> <b>slots</b> were cut into the wall. Different sources report receiving mail via stage three to seven times each week. Perhaps the delivery days had increased by the time the office was officially discontinued in 1905.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the first}} floor is divided into the postal lobbies and the large Postal Workroom, which {{encompasses}} approximately 90 percent of the floor area. The public spaces feature rose marble flooring and Tennessee Tarvernelle marble wainscoting. Elevator doors are sheathed in bronze and brass, and bronze trim frames the <b>letter</b> <b>slots</b> and service windows. An open screen of Greek key fretwork is above the service windows. Bulletin boards with bronze frames are alongside two classically detailed bronze writing tables, and a round writing table of similar design is near the service windows. Historic bronze light fixtures with octagonal frosted-glass pendants and eagle decorations adorn the lobby.|$|R

5000|$|John Boyd {{who had a}} {{saw mill}} on Brush Run a short {{distance}} from the construction site was contracted, with the help of members, to build the Meeting House. The congregation of Christian reformers was evolving from the Christian Association of Washington (Pennsylvania). The Meeting House was then used in conjunction with the [...] "Cross Roads" [...] log building, in which the Association had been meeting, and replaced a temporary shelter (often called a [...] "brush arbor") which had been used on this site for preaching—including Alexander Campbell's first sermon. This site was located on a [...] "Saddle Ridge" [...] between Hanen Creek and Brush Run on 2 acre of land transferred ($1.00 bill-of-sale) from the farm of William Gilchrist, {{an active member of the}} Association and one of four deacons in the new congregation. The building and congregation were soon known as the Brush Run Church, despite the fact that on the Ordination Certificate of Alexander Campbell (1812), the ordaining body is referred to as [...] "The First Christian Church of the Christian Association of Washington."The actual Meeting House, a post and beam structure pinned together with wooden pins, was a treasure in framing and could be taken down and moved. Never completely finished and having ceased to be used regularly, with churches now developed in the home communities of many members, the church building was sold to George McFadden, dismantled and moved to West Middletown in 1842. Here he used it as his blacksmith shop until appointed postmaster in 1869 at which time he located the post office in this building. When he retired William Anderson, the neighbor across the road, received the building as a gift for his willingness to move it. On the Anderson property it served as a barn and stable, until visitors from the 1909 Centennial Convention held in Pittsburgh, PA some thirty miles distance, instituted a program to reconstruct, from remaining timbers, the old Meeting House onto the Campbell Homestead in Bethany, WV.The picture reproduced above right is a drawing of the Meeting House when it served as a post office following several years as a blacksmith shop. This becomes evident by observing in the picture the <b>letter</b> <b>slot</b> in the door (i.e. post office) and the well worn chimney top (i.e. blacksmith furnace heat) remembering that this Meeting House, on its original location, had no means of heating. Subsequent paintings of the structure apparently used this drawing as an example, placing the slot in the door, worn chimney at roof ridge and showing the drooping clapboard siding on the front.|$|E

You see those bundles hurling into stations, {{catching}} trains by a hair's breadth, speeding on their way, breaking up, smaller bundles of them hurled with a fierce accuracy out upon the platforms that rush by, and then everywhere a division of these smaller bundles into still smaller bundles, into dispersing parcels, into separate papers, and the dawn happens unnoticed amidst a great running and shouting of boys, a shoving through <b>letter</b> <b>slots,</b> openings of windows, spreading out upon book-stalls. For {{the space of a}} few hours you must figure the whole country dotted white with rustling papers--placards everywhere vociferating the hurried lie for the day; men and women in trains, men and women eating and reading, men by study-fenders, people sitting up in bed, mothers and sons and daughters waiting for father to finish--a million scattered people reading--reading headlong--or feverishly ready to read. It is just as if some vehement jet had sprayed that white foam of papers over the surface of the land. [...] .|$|R

5000|$|Slot-based {{coding theory}} states that each letter {{in a word}} is {{connected}} to a particular location, or slot, within that word. One of the major theories that predict <b>letter</b> <b>slots</b> is the interactive activation model created by McClelland and Rumelhart (1981). [...] This model assumes that people are letter-position specific when detecting words, so our recognition of words is based on what letters it contains, where the letters are placed within that word {{and the length of}} the word itself. Another example is the bayesian reader model created by Norris (2006) which also assumes that the letters in a word are associated with their specific location. Many experiments (for example, Perea and Lupker, 2003) have shown if you use transposed-letter priming, (for example, priming judge with jugde) you will see a priming effect but if the prime is a word where two letters are changed to other letter (for example, priming judge with jupfe) there is no priming effect. According to the two models discussed we would assume jugde is no more similar to judge than jupfe because the letters are not in the correct slots. In another experiment, TL non-words {{were more likely to be}} (incorrectly) classified as actual words than are nonsense control words (Andrews, 1996). Andrew’s results are also inconsistent with the many slot-based coding models because even with two of the letters in the incorrect spot they read the word as if spelled correctly.|$|R

50|$|Letterboxing is the {{practice}} of transferring film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard-width video formats while preserving the film's original aspect ratio. The resulting videographic image has mattes (black bars) above and below it; these mattes {{are part of the}} image (i.e., of each frame of the video signal). LBX or LTBX are the identifying abbreviations for films and images so formatted. The term refers to the shape of a <b>letter</b> box, a <b>slot</b> in a wall or door through which mail is delivered, being rectangular and wider than it is high.|$|R
40|$|In this <b>letter,</b> a planar <b>slot</b> antenna with dual-band-notch {{characteristics}} {{is proposed}} for ultrawideband application. The basic antenna comprises a rectangular tuning stub and a ground plane with a tapered-shape slot. To create a notched band for WiMAX, one angle-shaped parasitic slit is etched out {{along with the}} tuning stub, while for WLAN, two symmetrical parasitic slits are placed inside the slot of the ground plane. By properly adjusting the size and location of the parasitic slits, {{it is found that}} the proposed antenna can achieve ultrawide operating band with dual-notched band without altering the overall antenna size. These notched bands will help to mitigate the possible interference between UWB and these narrow bands...|$|R

50|$|In total, twenty-four Tipsy B and Bc {{aircraft}} {{were built}} at Avions Fairey {{before the invasion}} of Belgium by Germany in World War II. About eight had open cockpits (Tipsy B) and the rest were enclosed (Tipsy Bc). The Tipsy {{seems to have been}} mostly nice to fly but, as with other aircraft with pointed wing tips, its low speed behaviour could be unforgiving, dropping a wing at the stall without much warning. During the British production run, some of these issues were addressed.The fourth British aircraft was the first to be modified. To improve the stalling behaviour, it had a strengthened wing with washout at the tips, so that this part of the wing should not stall first, and camber-changing flaps were added to the straight centre section to delay the stall. To meet British airworthiness concerns about control surface flutter, all were mass-balanced. The rudder balance was external, projecting from its leading edge just above the tip of the fin. The elevator was also revised to a single unit with a straight hinge and trailing edge, and the bottom of the rudder slightly cropped to allow it to move. Subsequent British Tipsys included these changes, and from the sixth aircraft onwards also featured fixed <b>letter</b> box <b>slots.</b> In August 1938, during the Certificate of Airworthiness tests at Martlesham Heath, there were concerns about rudder authority, so Tipsy Light Aircraft added 18% to the rudder area, leading to successful certification. At that point, the name of the aircraft changed from Tipsy B to Tipsy Trainer. The ninth aircraft was approved at an increased all up-weight of 1,200 lb (544 kg), and from then on the name was revised to Tipsy Trainer 1.|$|R

If the math is applied {{in everyday life}} can enable people in his world problem solving. From year to year {{growth in the number}} of motor vehicles has increased. In the year 2011 alone was recorded 85, 601, 351 pieces including passenger cars, buses, trucks and motorcycles (Central Bureau of Statistics). So the number of vehicles allocated to be provided much more than the number of vehicles that exist and that it is going to result in increasing multiples of code / serial end of the earth. And other problems that arise in the determination area code is pretty difficult to be identified so as to know still need to know or memorize it beforehand. To overcome these problems filling slots used to determine the utilization of numbering motor vehicle license plate. In that case, applied study conducted using the resources of the study literature such as books, journals and data from the internet. The first study of how to define the problem, gather information about the license plate and filling slots and finally manages to answer the formulation of the information mentioned. To establish measures numbering is done by determining the number of sample points of vehicle license plate numbering that applies to the use of filling slots rules, comparing the number of sample points obtained between the addition of one-digit numbers or <b>letters</b> with filling <b>slots</b> rules, slots filling and utilization to determine motor vehicle license plate numbering. Results of this study indicate that filling slots can be used to determine the vehicle license plate numbering. The new numbering formed not overhauled not only adds identity also reduced the area that is written on the top of the plate (eg Malang on motor vehicle license plate with the code defi N), the validity period of the license plate is placed on the left or right of the upper plate...|$|R
