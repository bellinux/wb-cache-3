5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in <b>Lilongwe</b> that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 kwacha per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department, and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in the Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi. In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.|$|E

50|$|While Blantyre is the {{commercial}} Capital of Malawi, <b>Lilongwe's</b> economy {{is dominated by}} the government and public institutions. Kanengo, in the north of the city, is the main industrial area, where food processing, tobacco storage and sales, maize storage, and other activities related to light industry take place. Finance, banking, retail trade, construction, transport, public administration, tourism, and tobacco manufacturing are the main economic activities in the city.76 percent of <b>Lilongwe's</b> population live in informal settlements, while poverty stands at 25 percent and unemployment at 16 percent.The civil service employs about 27 percent of all formal workers, while 40 percent work in the private sector and 2 percent are self-employed.|$|R
25|$|The country's {{infrastructure}} benefited through massive {{road construction}} programs. With {{the decision to}} shift the capital city from Zomba to <b>Lilongwe</b> (against vociferous objections from the British preference for the economically healthy and well-developed Blantyre), a new road was built linking Blantyre and Zomba to <b>Lilongwe.</b> The Capital City Development Corporation (CCDC) in <b>Lilongwe</b> was itself a beehive of infrastructure development, supported by planning and funds from apartheid-era South Africa. The British refused to finance the move to <b>Lilongwe.</b> The CCDC became the sole development agent for Lilongwe; putting up roads, the government seat at Capital Hill, etc. Other infrastructure entities were added, such as Malawi Hotels Limited, which undertook massive projects such as the Mount Soche, Capital Hotel and Mzuzu Hotel. On the industrial side, Malawi Development Corporation (MDC) was tasked with setting up industries and other businesses. Meanwhile, Dr. Banda's own Press Corporation Limited and MYP's Spearhead Corporation embarked on business initiatives that lead to an economic boom during the mid- to late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The {{first case}} of HIV/AIDS in Malawi was {{reported}} at <b>Lilongwe's</b> Kamuzu Central Hospital in 1985. President Hastings Banda, {{who was in}} power at the time, responded with several small-scale prevention initiatives and created the National AIDS Control Programme, {{a division of the}} Ministry of Health, to manage the growing epidemic. Banda believed that issues relating to sex, including HIV transmission, should not be addressed in the public sphere; during this time, it was illegal for Malawian citizens to discuss the epidemic openly. In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic, but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.|$|R

2500|$|The tense ndinábwera or ndidábwera [...] "I came" [...] can be {{made with}} either -na- or -da-. The {{difference}} is partly regional, since -da- is heard mainly in parts of the Central Region, especially in the area around <b>Lilongwe.</b> -da- was also chosen as the correct form to be used in written Chichewa by the first President of Malawi, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, in his wish to standardise the language and to make the Central Region variety the basis of that standard. Banda is said to have declared: [...] "The real Chichewa is what is spoken by the villagers in Dowa, <b>Lilongwe,</b> Dedza, Salima; in the Southern Region, Namkumba's area in Fort Johnston [...] ". Thus -da- has come to be used as the standard form in written Chichewa. In the older 1922 translation of the Bible, -na- is more commonly used than -da- (although -da- is used occasionally), whereas in the more recent translation of 1998, -da- is the usual past tense marker. Books describing the language prescriptively for Malawian schools therefore allow only -da- as the Remote Perfect tense-marker. Colloquially, however, -ná- seems to be more common, and is the form given in most books describing Chichewa grammar.|$|E
2500|$|The trio of Calder, Simon and Lange {{decided in}} 1974 {{that they had}} to get out of South Africa. [...] "We were {{politically}} very much opposed to the old apartheid regime" [...] says Simon. [...] They pooled together what little money they had and moved to London. [...] Having landed right in the middle of the British punk rock movement, they felt their experience would not be best utilized in marketing and promotion in such a different context. [...] Instead, they opted to create a publishing company and Zomba Corporation was officially registered in Switzerland in 1975, operating out of Calder's bedroom space in London. [...] The name [...] "Zomba" [...] referred to the capital of African country Malawi (<b>Lilongwe</b> superseded Zomba as Malawi's capital in 1974).|$|E
2500|$|In April 1992, Chakufwa Chihana, a labor unionist, openly {{called for}} a {{national}} referendum on the political future of Malawi. He was arrested before he finished his speech at <b>Lilongwe</b> International Airport. By October 1992, this mounting pressure from within and {{from the international community}} forced Banda to concede to hold a referendum on whether to maintain the one-party state. [...] The referendum was held on 14 June 1993, resulting in an overwhelming vote (64 percent) in favor of multiparty democracy. After this, political parties besides the MCP were formed and preparation for the general elections began. Banda worked with the newly forming parties and the church, and made no protest when a special assembly stripped him of his title of President for Life, along with most of his powers. The transition from a rigid authoritarian regime to democracy was fairly peaceful.|$|E
2500|$|Banda was {{the only}} African ruler to {{establish}} diplomatic ties with South Africa during apartheid {{as well as the}} Portuguese regime in Mozambique. After the cabinet crisis in 1964, Banda became increasingly isolated in African politics. On the other hand, his antipathy for Roy Welensky and what he denounced as the [...] "stupid federation" [...] was a smokescreen he used to reject the proposed Bangula Hydro-electric dam – proposed to be bigger than the Gezira Dam in Khartoum – that Welensky's Federation had sought and obtained funding for from the British government. Banda went on to blame everything including snails (likely to cause widespread Bilharzias) to abort the project. In turn, the British denied Banda the funding and budgetary support he needed to build his pet dream of a new capital city at <b>Lilongwe,</b> in his home region. Hence he turned to South Africa – itself playing geo-political games in the region – which gave him a soft loan of 300 million rand. The quid pro quo was that Banda had to support South Africa's apartheid policies among fellow African leaders. Hence, on one occasion he paid a state visit to South Africa where he met his South African counterparts at Stellenbosch. Banda once noted that, [...] "It is only contact like this [...] that can reveal to your people that there are civilized people other than white..." [...] Banda's staunch anticommunism also influenced his decision to seek warm relations with South Africa.|$|E
