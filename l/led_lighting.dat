5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2004 season, Millennium Force's seat belts were {{modified}} because of an incident on the Bizarro roller coaster at Six Flags New England. The new seat belts were shorter and some riders had difficulties with them. The roller coaster's layout was repainted over a three-year period of time, before the 2011, 2012 and 2013 season. In 2012, the park added a new <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> system.|$|E
40|$|The {{brown seaweed}} Sargassum horneri (Sargassaceae) is {{important}} for marine environment conservation. It {{could be used for}} a food material, medical applications, and future biofuel production. We compared the growth of S. horneri cultures under single wavelength blue and red light during the germling and immature stages. The growth rate based on the thallus area of S. horneri during the germling stage was faster under blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> than under red <b>LED</b> <b>light.</b> Furthermore, based on the wet weight of S. horneri, during the immature stage, blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> resulted in a faster growth rate than red <b>LED</b> <b>light.</b> Moreover, during the immature stage, compared with red <b>LED</b> <b>light,</b> blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> tended to increase the content of photosynthetic pigments. We conclude that use of blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> in indoor tanks during the germling and immature stages will improve the efficiency of S. horneri culture. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media DordrechtIn Press / Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R

5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were made.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the high}} {{lighting}} efficiency and long lifecycle, the light-emitting diode (LED) {{plays a major role}} in the green earth activities; energy saving and carbon offset. Since the <b>LED</b> <b>lights</b> have the better energy efficiency, they have gradually become the major source of LCD backlight. The luminance of <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> source must be adjusted suitably when used for the backlight source or lighting, therefore, the pulse wave modulation (PWM) is a commonly used technique for the <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> modulation. However, when the LED is applied to the field sequential color LCD for a long time, the trigger pulse will readily affect the <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> performance. This paper presents the impacts of PWM driving on the performances of LED; color temperature, luminance efficiency and lifecycle...|$|R

Regarding the impact on the reproductive and vegetative systems, the study showed that <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> is suitable to grow microvines in confined environments. Plants exposed to <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> exhibited similar leaf emergence rate but reduced vegetative and reproductive organ size compared to plants grown in the greenhouse. Photosynthesis for plants exposed to <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> was higher than what is usually observed on grapevine under natural conditions...|$|R
