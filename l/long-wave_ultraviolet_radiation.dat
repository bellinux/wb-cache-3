50|$|The {{context of}} a photogeochemical {{reaction}} is implicitly the surface of Earth, since that is where sunlight is available (although other sources of light such as chemiluminescence would not be strictly excluded from photogeochemical study). Reactions may occur among components of land such as rocks, soil and detritus; components of surface water such as sediment and dissolved organic matter; and components of the atmospheric boundary layer directly influenced by contact with land or water, such as mineral aerosols and gases. Visible and medium- to <b>long-wave</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> is {{the main source of}} energy for photogeochemical reactions; wavelengths of light shorter than about 290 nm are completely absorbed by the present atmosphere, and are therefore practically irrelevant, except in consideration of atmospheres different from that of Earth today.|$|E
40|$|Overexposure to short- and <b>long-wave</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiations</b> (UVB, UVA) may {{contribute}} to melanoma development through combined genotoxic and mitogenic effects in melanocytes. This study compares the impact of UVA- 1 versus UVB, and single versus fractionated exposures on melanocyte proliferation in hairless SKH- 2 mice. A single erythemal dose was compared with an equal dose fractionated over 8 d, and dose-dependency was studied. Proliferation (Ki- 67 positive-sign) in melanocytes (melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells- 1 positive or micropthalmia transcription factor positive) was ascertained in double-labeled skin sections. Single erythemal UVB exposures caused a delayed, dose-dependent increase of melanocyte proliferation. The highest, 17 -fold, increase (from 0. 05 % to 0. 8 % of melanocytes) occurred 4 d after UVB exposure, without any detectable effect on overall melanocyte numbers. Correspondingly, DNA repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum A (Xpa) mice proved exquisitely sensitive to melanocyte proliferation induction by UVB exposure. No discernable effects were measured from fractionated suberythemal UVB exposures, or from any UVA- 1 exposure regimen. Hence, melanocyte proliferation appears to be most efficiently induced by a single UVB overexposure. Moreover, the ineffectiveness of UVA- 1 radiation and the enhanced sensitivity of Xpa mice point at pyrimidine dimers as causative DNA lesions. Consequently, murine nevi and melanoma {{are expected to be}} most effectively induced by intermittent UVB overexposures...|$|R

In general, threshold doses for erythema and pigmentation were higher when UVA was administered at the lowest irradiance (5 mW/cm 2) than at the highest (50 mW/cm 2). Erythema was maximal immediately after exposure to UVA. The most intense responses (erythema with edema, or intense pigmentation) were induced more frequently by the highest irradiance. Components of both the erythema and the pigment response to UVA are therefore irradiance-dependent.

5000|$|Type Ia {{diamonds}} make {{up about}} 98% of all natural diamonds. The nitrogen impurities, up to 0.3% (3000 ppm), are clustered within the carbon lattice, and are relatively widespread. The absorption spectrum of the nitrogen clusters can cause the diamond to absorb blue light, making it appear pale yellow or almost colorless. Most Ia diamonds are a mixture of IaA and IaB material; these diamonds belong to the Cape series, named after the diamond-rich region formerly known as Cape Province in South Africa, whose deposits are largely Type Ia. Type Ia diamonds often show sharp absorption bands with the main band at 415.5 nm (N3) and weaker lines at 478 nm (N2), 465 nm, 452 nm, 435 nm, and 423 nm (the [...] "Cape lines"), caused by the N2 and N3 nitrogen centers.

Serial biopsy specimens taken up to 21 days postirradiation were stained with 8 commercially available lectins labeled with either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or biotin (followed by avidin D-FITC) : Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I (BSA), concanavalin A (Con-A), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA), soybean agglutinin (SBA), Ulex europeus agglutinin I (UEA), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). In normal guinea pig skin UEA staining was absent. Following PUVA treatment, UEA and DBA stainings became apparent or stronger in intensity after days 7 – 14 (UEA) and days 4 – 7 (DBA), respectively, and returned to negative or weak by days 14 – 21. Stainings with Con-A, SBA, and WGA gave remarkable decreases in intensity after days 2 – 4 and recovered to the baseline by days 7 – 14. Intensity of BSA, PNA, and RCA stainings was decreased {{to a lesser degree}} than the other lectins. Such changes were not produced by application of 8 -MOP, UVA radiation (< 10 J/cm 2), UVB radiation (900 – 2700 mJ/cm 2), or tape stripping.

40|$|Background. As <b>long-wave</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>radiation</b> penetrates the dermis, {{connective}} tissue cellular components and circulating blood cells can be possible targets for solar UVA. Basophils, {{involved in the}} effector phase of the inflammatory response, {{play a part in}} skin diseases such as chronic urticaria, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, fixed drug eruption, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria pigmentosa, systemic sclerosis and bullous pemphigoid. Objective. The evaluation of the in vitro effect of UVA on histamine release from human basophils. Methods. Basophils from healthy human volunteers were irradiated, respectively, with UVA at doses of 2. 5, 5, 7. 5, 10, 20 and 50 J/cm 2 and then incubated with an anti-IgE serum. A fluorimetric technique was employed to determine histamine release from samples: (i) incubated with 2 % HClO 4 (complete lysis of basophils); (ii) irradiated with increasing doses of UVA; and (iii) unirradiated (controls). Results. Histamine release was: 100 % for HClO 4 incubated basophils, 30 % for unirradiated and anti-IgE incubated cells (controls) and 27 %, 24 %, 34 %, 41 %, 60 % and 70 % for basophils irradiated with UVA doses, respectively, of 2. 5, 5, 7. 5, 10, 20 and 50 J/cm 2 and incubated with anti-IgE. Histamine releasability from irradiated samples was statistically significant (P < 0. 05), in comparison with controls, at UVA doses equal to 5, 10, 20 and 50 J/cm 2. Conclusions. UVA exerts, at least in vitro, a biphasic dose-dependent action on histamine release from human basophils incubated with an anti-IgE serum: at the lowest irradiation doses(< 5 J/cm 2) it exerts an inhibitory effect and at the highest doses (≥ 10 J/cm 2) histamine release increases significantly...|$|R

Ears of mice were treated with a 0. 5 % 8 -MOP solution topically plus UVA radiation (1. 5 – 2. 5 J/cm 2). After PUVA radiation, skin responses to intradermal injection with mast cell liberators, including compound 48 / 80 (2. 5 mg/ml, 10 μl) and concanavalin A (Con-A) (2. 0 mg/ml), or with a mixture of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and histamine as vasodilator (1. 0 mg/ml and 50 mM, respectively) were examined with time (2 h– 14 days). At each time point, an ear swelling response (ESR) was measured with a dial thickness gauge. The rate of mast cell degranulation and mast cell numbers were asssessed by light microscopy using toluidine blue-stained semithin (1 μm) sections. ESR induced by compound 48 / 80 or Con-A was significantly suppressed dose-dependently (> 42 % inhibition) by PUVA between 2 h– 3 days postirradiation as compared with that in nonirradiated control mice, and the value returned to normal levels by 7 – 14 days. Compound 48 / 80 - or Con-A-induced mast cell degranulation (%) was remarkably decreased between 2 h– 3 days (> 48 % inhibition) in accordance with the suppression in ESR and it was restored to the rates in nonirradiated controls by 7 – 14 days. Neither ESR nor percent degranulation was affected by UVA radiation only (< 3. 5 J/cm 2) or application of 8 -MOP only. 5 -HT plus histaminemediated ESR was not altered at all by PUVA throughout the experimental period. Since PUVA radiation itself at given doses did not produce measurable ESR, mast cell degranulation, or a reduction in mast cell numbers, and since PUVA did not affect a normal vascular response to vasodilator, it seemed that decreased skin reactivity to mast cell degranulators by PUVA might be due to a PUVA-induced noncytolytic alteration in mast cell release mechanisms...|$|R

Preirradiated CPZ was not toxic to the yeast culture. During irradiation the pH of the CPZ solution changed, indicating an accumulation of acid photoproducts. Nonphototoxic phenothiazines and related tricyclic drugs failed to change their pH following irradiation whereas phototoxic compounds behaved like CPZ. The low pH alone could not account for the inflammatory response in vivo, as neutralized irradiated CPZ solutions still induced inflammation, and acidified, nonirradiated solutions failed to cause a reaction. CPZ phototoxicity seems mainly to be due to the effect of photoproducts. The nature of these is not known, but it is suggested that the stable free radical of CPZ might be an active principle...|$|E

This effect was seen both in donor-recipient combinations that differ at the major histocompatibility complex and in those differing only at minor histocompatibility loci. Treatment with 8 -methoxypsoralen or long-wave UV radiation alone was ineffective in prolonging allograft survival, as were doses of mid-wave UV radiation (UVB, 280 – 320 nm) that produced greater inflammation than the PUVA protocol. Allografted, PUVA-treated animals also demonstrated decreased alloantigen reactivity against donor-strain spleen cells during the period of treatment by cytotoxicity assays. Allografts of skin in the murine system are highly immunogenic and are generally rejected faster than organ allografts; thus PUVA treatment appears to exert a potent effect on prolonging allograft survival. The systemic nature of the effect and the fact that adverse side effects from PUVA are largely limited to the skin suggest that PUVA might have a role in clinical organ transplantation management...|$|E

The absorption-and attenuation coefficient measurements {{revealed that the}} Makrofol® DE 1 - 1 is characterized by high absorbance in the energy range 6. 53 – 4. 43 eV but for a lower energy than 4. 43 eV, it is approximately transparent. Makrofol® DE 1 - 1 samples were irradiated with <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> of wavelength {{in the range from}} 250 (4. 28 eV) to 400 (3. 10 eV) nm in step of 10 nm and the corresponding photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were measured with a spectrofluorometer. It is found that the integrated counts and the peak height of the photoluminescence emission (PL) bands are strongly correlated with the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> wavelength. They are increased at the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> wavelength 280 nm and have maximum at 290 nm, thereafter they decrease and diminish at 360 nm of ultraviolet wavelength. The position of the PL emission band peak was red shifted starting from 300 nm, which increased with the increase the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> wavelength. The PL bandwidth increases linearly with the increase of the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> wavelength. When Makrofol® DE 1 - 1 is irradiated with <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> of short wavelength (UVC), the photoluminescence emission spectra peaks also occur in the UVC but of a relatively longer wavelength. The current new findings should be considered carefully when using Makrofol® DE 1 - 1 in medical applications related to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in penetration of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> {{has been reported}} currently over southern South America. It would affect the photoprotective responses in biotic elements of freshwater ecosystems. An experiment was designed using pigmented adult individuals of the species Daphnia dadayana (Paggi 1999), Boeckella antiqua (Menu-Marque & Balseiro 2000), and Parabroteas sarsi (Mrázek 1901), characteristic for shallow fishless ponds from South American plains (located between 41 and 53 °S latitude). The artificial <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> {{was involved in the}} experiment, with two levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which would exert a protective effect against <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation.</b> The results of this experiment showed that under conditions of low DOC concentrations, D. dadayana recorded a higher mortality, while under low DOC concentrations, B. antiqua and P. sarsi were not affected by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation.</b> Daphnids would be less tolerant to the exposure to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> than pigmented calanoid copepods...|$|R
25|$|Some oxygen was {{stimulated by}} solar <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> to form ozone, which {{collected}} in a layer near {{the upper part of}} the atmosphere. The ozone layer absorbed, and still absorbs, a significant amount of the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> that once had passed through the atmosphere. It allowed cells to colonize the surface of the ocean and eventually the land: without the ozone layer, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> bombarding land and sea would have caused unsustainable levels of mutation in exposed cells.|$|R
