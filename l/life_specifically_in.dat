It is argued that while certain elements of the marriage process are experiencing changes as a result of migration (higher brideprice, a delay of first marriage, spousal selection norms and so on), it is noted that migrants tend to remain especially conservative, staying rooted in traditional beliefs and behaviours.

This brief intervention was found to prevent further deterioration in anxiety and depression prior to treatment. Significantly more patients in the control group were found to experience greater anxiety and depression prior to treatment compared to the intervention group.

40|$|Metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) is a {{malignant}} disease without curative treatment. These patients are usually symptomatic and desperate for effective palliative treatment. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy are not effective in these patients. A multimodal approach consisting of cytoreductive nephrectomy, systemic therapy (which includes cytokines or targeted molecules), and metastasectomy {{have been shown}} to be useful in prolonging the survival and improving the quality of life in a select group of patients with metastatic renal cancer. Patients with oligometastatic disease, good performance status, and delayed presentation of the secondaries have better results following this integrated approach. Although there is some controversy regarding the order in which nephrectomy and systemic therapy are to be instituted, well-controlled studies like the South West Oncology Group and European organization research and treatment of cancer have shown that upfront nephrectomy gives better survival compared to neoadjuvant systemic therapy followed by nephrectomy. This order is the standard presently. Of late, with better understanding of the genetic basis and the biology of the various subtypes of renal cell carcinoma, targeted molecular therapies have emerged as an equally effective alternative therapy to cytokines.

40|$|Background: Hypoglycemia is {{the main}} side effect of {{intensified}} insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes and recognized as a limitation in achieving glycemic targets. Patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia have a threefold to sixfold increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring may help patients with type 1 diabetes to achieve better glycemic control with less hypoglycemic episodes. Accordingly, one may hypothesize that particularly type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia will profit most from this technology with improvements in their quality of life. However, this {{has not yet been}} established. This trial aims to study the effect of real-time continuous glucose monitoring on glycemia and quality of <b>life</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>in</b> type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with established impaired awareness of hypoglycemia. Methods/design: This is a two-center, randomized, cross-over trial with a 12 -week wash-out period in between intervention periods. A total of 52 type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia according to Gold et al. criteria will be randomized to receive real-time continuous glucose monitoring or blinded continuous glucose monitoring for 16 weeks. After a wash-out period, patients will cross over to the other intervention. The primary outcome measure is time spent in euglycemia. Secondary outcomes include (diabetes-specific) markers of quality of life and other glycemic variables. Discussion: It remains unclear whether patients with type 1 diabetes and impaired awareness of hypoglycemia benefit from real-time continuous glucose monitoring in real-life. This study will provide insight into the potential benefits of real-time continuous glucose monitoring in this patient population. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials. gov: NCT 01787903...|$|E

METHOD: a descriptive and cross-sectional study was undertaken at a kidney replacement therapy service in the interior of the state of SP. The 110 subjects who complied with the inclusion criteria answered the Subject Characterization Instrument, the WHOQOL-bref and WHOQOL-SRPB. RESULTS: most of the respondents were male (67. 27 %), with a mean age of 55. 65 years, Catholic (55. 45 %), with unfinished primary education (33. 64 %) and without formal occupation (79. 08 %).
