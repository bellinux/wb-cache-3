40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} cooling {{characteristics}} of cast components with varying <b>section</b> <b>size.</b> In this study aluminium alloy A 356 is selected {{because it is}} widely used at automotive and aircraft industries {{in the form of}} components with varying <b>section</b> <b>size.</b> This study investigates how cooling rate and mechanical properties vary with varying <b>section</b> <b>size.</b> Experiment is performed that aluminium alloy ingot is heated in muffle furnace and poured in the moulds having mould cavity of varying dimensions. Cooling rate was measured using K type thermocouple during solidification of aluminium alloy. In order to investigate the effect of cooling rate on microstructure and mechanical properties microstructure analysis, impact test, tensile test, hardness test were performed. The results showed that mechanical properties of cast component of smaller <b>section</b> <b>size</b> are better. This is due to fast cooling rate of smaller section cast component make refining of the grain size of the aluminium alloy...|$|R
50|$|The {{material}} has to undergo heat treatment involving normalization, {{quenching and tempering}} to develop the required austenitic microstructure, with subsequent tempering. Test plates were 1 inch. First they were normalized. They were charged in a furnace at 500F. Heated at 125F per hour to 1625-1725F. Held at 1750F for an hour per inch of <b>section</b> <b>size,</b> and then air-cooled to room temperature. Next the samples were austenized by repeating the process up to 1700F, and held for an hour per inch of <b>section</b> <b>size,</b> then oil quenched to below 125F. Finally, they were tempered by in an oven that started below 500F, increased at 100F per hour per inch of <b>section</b> <b>size,</b> and allowed to air-cool to room temperature.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As the fire-resistance {{performance}} of high-strength concrete {{has emerged as}} a social issue and Korean Ministry of Land, Transport & Maritime Affairs has announced the standard for the fire-resistance {{performance of}} the concrete, studies to improve its fire-resistance have been conducted actively. In this paper, the study to develop high-strength concrete mixed with fiber-cocktail, a hybrid of polypropylene fiber and steel fiber was conducted. The fire-resistance test of 100 MPa high-strength concrete and the analysis of steel bar temperatures for finding the optimal cross-sectional condition showed that the larger the <b>section</b> <b>size</b> is, the lower the temperature of steel bars is. It was also shown that the concrete columns with <b>section</b> <b>sizes</b> of 600 mm x 600 mm and 800 mm x 800 mm secure fire-resistance performance and the former is the optimal <b>section</b> <b>size</b> in terms of economic efficiency. The analysis of steel bar temperatures of the column having <b>section</b> <b>size</b> of 600 mm x 600 mm showed that the polypropylene fiber to steel fiber ratio of 1. 5 to 40 (㎏/㎥) is the optimal for the fiber cocktail...|$|R

However, the lifetime of such a network is directly dependant upon the lifetime of each of its individual sections (or clusters).

40|$|Abstract: Nonlinear {{hysteresis}} {{characteristics are}} usually {{used in the}} elastic-plastic seismic analysis {{of the structure of}} bridge. These characteristics may be described by the relationship of section bending moment and curvature. This relationship can be obtained by the <b>section</b> <b>size</b> and reinforcement, which is also a simple and timesaving method to evaluate the seismic behavior of the section. The thesis made a research of the effect of section bending moment and curvature first. Then chose five different sections and observed their effects on bending moment and curvature. The results indicated that, with the increasing of <b>section</b> <b>size,</b> the crack, the yield, the moment damage and the curvature of the section are increased. The increasing of <b>section</b> <b>size</b> is that the increasing of moment of inertia, so with the increasing of the moment of inertia, the resistance to crack, field and damage of the bridge pier is stronger. On the basis of this, the elastic-plastic time history analysis of Wu Guan super highway Gan Gou Zi Bridge is made. It showed that the capacity of energy dissipation by hysteretic of the Rectangular thin-wall pier is better than the twin shaft pier. So it is best to use rectangular thin-wall pier in the same condition...|$|R
