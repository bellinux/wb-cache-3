40|$|In a semi-industrial thermographic {{inspection}} system, newly {{installed at}} the Fraunhofer Institute for Wood Research, {{a great variety of}} different laminates and carrier materials were examined. Different examples of <b>laminated</b> <b>parquet</b> and floorings show the capability of this technique to detect delaminations and reduced adhesions even at high speed on large surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Thermography, {{especially}} pulse or transient thermography, is a non-contact {{non-destructive testing}} method that can rapidly detect internal defects such as delaminations, structural faults, cracks and reduced adhesion of large surfaces {{in a very}} short time. Using the semiindustrial thermographic inspection system, newly installed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wood Research, many delaminations and even reduced adhesion between veneers, decorative foils, high pressure decorative laminates (HPL), melamine films and its base materials (particle- or fibreboards) can be detected. Different examples on <b>laminated</b> <b>parquet,</b> furniture and glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) - coated particleboards show the capability to detect defects using this on-line thermographic inspection system. The results of such inspections can be used not only for 100 % on-line product inspection but also for feeding the results back to the machine controlling the process...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the surface properties of a UV-system applied on <b>laminated</b> <b>parquet</b> made with untreated and heat treated wood (ThermoWood). In this study, wood specimens prepared from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) wood were heat treated according to ThermoWood method at 190 ºC for 2 hours and at 212 ºC for 1 and 2 hours adhesion strength, pendulum hardness, surface roughness, colour and glossiness were determined. The UV-system was applied in two different types according to manufacturer recommendations. Results show that lightness and glossiness decreases and red colour tone increases with heat treatment. Pendulum hardness increased initially, decreasing afterwards with the intensity of the heat treatment. Tests showed that adhesion generally decreased with heat treatment. No significant differences were found for the surface roughness although a slight decrease was observed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Project CPR/ 87 / 008 {{enabled the}} Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory (XTMPF) to {{establish}} a blockboard production line and provide specialized consultancies in mill management, quality control and alternative wood utilization (other than blockboard). Training of technicians and staff, locally and abroad, {{in the manufacture of}} blockboard was also achieved. Since blockboard is not well known in China and the free market only became officially effective for the wood industry in Heilongjiang Province {{at the end of the}} project (November 1992), it is recommended that a marketing study for blockboard be formulated before the plant reaches full production. To assist the Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory in this new task, it is suggested that links with the Chinese Research Institute of the Wood Industry (CRIWI) be strengthened in order {{to establish a}} sound marketing strategy and to implement it. CRIWI could serve as a promoter of blockboard to other parts of the country, and assure the dissemination of information about the blockboard production unit at Xinqing in order to attract other investors or entrepreneurs. Since the blockboard production unit will consume only a part of the wood waste generated by the Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory, it is recommended that XTMPF create alternative products (other than blockboard) by developing items from ordinary timber, i. e. flooring, laminated furniture, <b>laminated</b> <b>parquet,</b> collapsible boxes, tooth picks, chopsticks, etc. Furthermore, maximizing the use of the existing wood drying kilns would enable kiln-dried wood to be sold at a higher price to local craftsmen who are always in need of dry wood for furniture making and other purposes. In conclusion, it was felt that the project had achieved its objectives. It is hoped that these achievements may enable Xinqing Timber Multi Processing Factory to obtain full industrial production of good quality blockboard in the near future...|$|E
