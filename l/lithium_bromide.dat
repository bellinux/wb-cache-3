5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and <b>lithium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E

25|$|The {{absorption}} {{cycle is}} similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump which raises the pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the refrigerant vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is needed by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of refrigerant, it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (refrigerant) with water (absorbent), and water (refrigerant) with <b>lithium</b> <b>bromide</b> (absorbent).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} applied {{compression}} {{on the nature}} of liquid flow and hence the movement of contaminants within municipal solid waste was examined by means of thirteen tracer tests conducted on five separate waste samples. The conservative nature of <b>bromide,</b> <b>lithium</b> and deuterium tracers was evaluated and linked to the presence of degradation in the sample. Lithium and deuterium tracers were non-conservative in the presence of degradation, whereas the bromide remained effectively conservative under all conditions. Solute diffusion times into and out of less mobile blocks of waste were compared for each test under the assumption of dominantly dual-porosity flow. Despite the fact that hydraulic conductivity changed strongly with applied stress, the block diffusion times were found to be much less sensitive to compression. A simple conceptual model, whereby flow is dominated by sub-parallel low permeability obstructions which define predominantly horizontally aligned less mobile zones, is able to explain this result. Compression tends to narrow the gap between the obstructions, but not significantly alter the horizontal length scale.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the long-term effects of soil texture and crop management on transport of <b>lithium</b> (Li+) and <b>bromide</b> (Br-) under unsaturated flow conditions. Treatments were two different soil textures of clay loam and sandy loam to be cropped with either wheat or alfalfa for 4 years. Undisturbed soil columns were taken for the steady-state ﬂow condition using tap water prior to applying a pulse of 0. 005 M (C 0) LiBr solution as the influent. Four pore volumes (4 PV) leaching for each column was obtained. <b>Bromide</b> and <b>lithium</b> concentrations of the effluent (C) were measured in 0. 2 PV intervals using bromide selective electrode and flame photometer, respectively. Relative concentrations (C/C 0) of Br- and Li+ in the effluent were drawn vs. pore volumes. The results showed that the effluent concentrations were significantly affected by crop type and soil texture (in combination by soil structure). The breakthrough curves illustrated the early appearance of Br- in the effluent due to anion repulsion and retarded movement of Li+ because of surface adsorption through the soil columns. Both Br- and Li+ concentrations decreased with time and converged at low levels justifying the minor effect of macropores on continuation of leaching and final transport via soil matrix. The Br- and Li+ concentrations were higher in the effluent of clay loam soil under alfalfa due to higher structural stability compared with sandy loam soil under the same crop. It was also shown that in both soil textures the concentrations of Br- and Li+ appeared to be higher under alfalfa than under wheat, indicating the importance of crop management in contaminant transport compared with soil texture. The trends of breakthrough curves of Li+ were similar to Br- with lower concentration in effluent {{as a result of its}} adsorbtion on active surfaces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a programme of research investigating horizontal fluid flow and solute transport through saturated {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) landfill. The purpose is to inform engineering strategies for future contaminant flushing. Solute transport between injection/abstraction well pairs (doublets) is investigated using three tracers over five separate tests at well separations between 5 m and 20 m. Two inorganic tracers (<b>lithium</b> and <b>bromide)</b> were used, plus the fluorescent dye tracer, rhodamine-WT. There was no evidence for persistent preferential horizons or pathways at the inter-well scale. The time for tracer movement to the abstraction wells varied with well spacing as predicted for a homogeneous isotropic continuum. The time for tracer movement to remote observation wells was also as expected. Mobile porosity was estimated as ~ 0. 02 (~ 4 % of total porosity). Good fits to the tracer breakthrough data were achieved using a dual-porosity model, with immobile regions characterised by block diffusion timescales {{in the range of}} about one to ten years. This implies that diffusional exchanges are likely to be very significant for engineering of whole-site contaminant flushing and possibly rate-limiting.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of injection-driven remediation techniques for non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) source zones {{is limited by}} the principle that fluid flow is focused along paths of least hydraulic resistance. The pressure pulse technology stands among a number of innovative methods that have been developed with the aim of overcoming or mitigating this limitation. The objective of this research was to observe and document differences in saturated groundwater flow and solute transport between an injection using a conventional or continuous pressure delivery approach and an injection using a pressure pulsing instrument. The underlying motivation was to identify engineering opportunities presented by pressure pulsing with the potential to improve remediation efficiency at contaminated sites. A series of tracer injections were conducted in the unconfined aquifer at the University of Waterloo Groundwater Research Facility at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Borden near Alliston, ON (homogeneous fine sand), and in the shallow aquifer at a groundwater research site located on the North Campus at the University of Waterloo (moderately heterogeneous with discrete layers varying from fine sand to silt). A single injection well was used at each site for both the conventional and pressure pulsing injections. Different tracers were used for consecutive injections. <b>Bromide,</b> <b>Lithium,</b> Chloride, and fluorescent dyes (Rhodamine WT and Sulforhodamine B) were used. Formation pressurization data was captured by pressure transducers. The spatial distribution of the injected tracers was monitored at a series of multilevel wells. A groundwater flow and solute transport modeling exercise (MODFLOW and MT 3 DMS numerical engines) simulating the rapid boundary pressure modulation that occurs in association with pressure pulsing was conducted to complement the field injections. A two-dimensional domain was used to conduct a parametric investigation of pressure modulation and its effect on flow and transport. A three-dimensional domain served to scale-up the two-dimensional results and for benchmarking against field observations. Pressure pulsing simulation results reveal that repeated sudden onset of injection cessation produces brief periods of gradient reversal near the injection well {{and the development of a}} mixing zone around the injection well. The spatial extents of this mixing zone are highly dependent upon the hydraulic diffusivity of the medium. Greater heterogeneity in combination with presence of high hydraulic diffusivity pathways maximized the extent of the mixing zone and the magnitude of transverse and reversal hydraulic gradients. Lower pulsing frequency and higher pulsing amplitude favoured a more significant mixing zone, though these effects were secondary to geologic properties. Use of the pressure pulsing tool did not manifest into distinct changes in tracer breakthrough at either field research site. Comparison between tracer tests was complicated by sorption of fluorescent dyes and ongoing well development. Solute transport simulation results demonstrated augmentation of dispersion arising from the mixing zone phenomenon, but no distinct changes in advection...|$|R
40|$|Solubility {{enhancement}} of poorly-soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) remains a scientific challenge and poses a practical {{issue in the}} pharmaceutical industry. The emergence of pharmaceutical cocrystals has contributed another dimension to the diversity of crystal forms available {{at the disposal of}} the pharmaceutical scientist. That pharmaceutical cocrystals are amenable to the design principles of crystal engineering means that the number of crystal forms offered by pharmaceutical cocrystals is potentially greater than the combined numbers of polymorphs, salts, solvates and hydrates for an API. The current spotlight and early-onset dissolution profile (2 ̆ 2 spring-and-parachute 2 ̆ 2 effect) exhibited by certain pharmaceutical cocrystals draw attention to an immediate question: How big is the impact of cocrystals on aqueous solubility? The scientific literature and in-house data on pharmaceutical cocrystals that are thermodynamically stable in water are reviewed and analyzed for trends in aqueous solubility and melting point between the cocrystal and the cocrystal formers. There is poor correlation between the aqueous solubility of cocrystal and cocrystal former with respect to the API. The log of the aqueous solubility ratio between cocrystal and API has a poor correlation with the melting point difference between cocrystal and API. Structure-property relationships between the cocrystal and the cocrystal formers remain elusive and the actual experiments are still necessary to investigate the desired physicochemical properties. Crystal form (cocrystals, polymorphs, salts, hydrates and solvates) diversity is {{and will continue to be}} a contentious issue for the pharmaceutical industry. That the crystal form of an API dramatically impacts its aqueous solubility (a fixed thermodynamic property) is illustrated by the histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist ranitidine hydrochloride and HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. For more than a century, the dissolution rate of a solid has been shown to be directly dependent on its solubility, cçterîs paribus. A century later, it remains impossible to predict the properties of a solid, given its molecular structure. If delivery or absorption of an API are limited by its aqueous solubility, aqueous solubility then becomes a critical parameter linking bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of an API. Since the majority of APIs are Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) Class II (low solubility and high permeability) compounds, crystal form screening, optimization and selection have thus received more efforts, attention and investment. Given that the dissolution rate, aqueous solubility and crystal form of an API are intricately linked, it remains a scientific challenge to understand the nature of crystal packing forces and their impact upon physicochemical properties of different crystal forms. Indeed, the selection of an optimal crystal form of an API is an indispensable part of the drug development program. The impact of cocrystals on crystal form diversity is addressed with molecular and ionic targets in ellagic acid and lithium salts. A supramolecular heterosynthon approach was adopted for crystal form screening. Crystal form screening of ellagic acid yields molecular cocrystals, cocrystal solvates/hydrates and solvates.
