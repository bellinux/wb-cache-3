25|$|In {{the classic}} test, the {{experimenter}} first {{played with the}} children, making sure that they <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> at least three times. Then, the rouge test was performed using a dot of rouge below the child's right eye. For their modified testing, the experimenter introduced a doll with a rouge spot under its eye and asked the child to help clean the doll. The experimenter would ask up to three times before cleaning the doll themselves. The doll was then put away, and the mirror test performed using a rouge dot on the child's face. These modifications were shown {{to increase the number}} of self-recognisers.|$|E

Like I didn't have a little stick figure anymore." [...] Bell has said that many of her characters are tomboys because she was [...] "not homely enough to play the nerdy girl and not nearly pretty enough to play the pretty girl".|$|E
500|$|Miss Rosa has {{a unique}} Hispanic accent which Rosenblat created and puts on. She drew {{inspiration}} from her scripts and costume. When she first placed a wig cap and <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> she began to envision how her character should sound. Though {{it was not until}} she filmed later episodes that she made a decision. Rosenblat told Anna Silman from Vulture that it was a scene involving Miss Rosa and Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), in which she states [...] "I could have been the jefa". Rosenblat said that the Spanish word made her realize that her character is Hispanic and her dialect is indicative of something Latin.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / <b>Looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E

2500|$|Hermione is {{extremely}} compassionate and {{is quick to}} help others, especially those who are defenceless, such as Neville Longbottom, first-years, House-Elves, fellow Muggle-borns, half-giants like Hagrid, and werewolves like Lupin. It was revealed by Rowling {{after the publication of}} the final book that Hermione's career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione had <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> of Erised, she would have seen Harry, Ron, and herself [...] "alive and unscathed, and Voldemort finished." [...] Hermione has also learned to ignore what bullies such as Draco say to her, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born witch, and states in Deathly Hallows that she is [...] "a Mudblood and proud of it".|$|E

2500|$|Pigeons {{are capable}} of passing a highly {{modified}} mirror test, but only after extensive training. In the experiment, a pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it, which the pigeon then turned to peck to obtain food. [...] Thus, the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment. Next, the pigeon was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. The latter training was accomplished {{in the absence of}} the mirror. The final test was placing a small bib on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror present yielded no pecking at the dot. When the mirror was revealed, the pigeon became active, <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib. However, untrained pigeons have never passed the mirror test.|$|E
2500|$|The album's , [...] "Who You Are", was {{released}} to the US iTunes Store on 22 February 2011. [...] It is the song from the album of which she is proudest. It's the song that draws the most messages from fans, on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. [...] "The other day I had a girl message me saying 'I was ready to take my life and then I heard [...] "Who You Are"'. That pressure is beautiful but scary at the same time. I {{want to be a}} positive role model for young people. I always say that I'm half-artist, half-therapist," [...] she laughs. She wrote the song {{at the end of a}} lonely three-month trip to Los Angeles when she was 20, having been shunted from studio to studio with various producers. [...] "I'm very much someone that lives to be happy. It's not just about the parties and I know so-and-so – I'm not that girl. So I <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and started to cry and said 'who am I?' Music is my therapy." ...|$|E

It never seemed to get any better, and I felt worse and worse," [...] she writes. Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with my cheek pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As I lay there, God touched my heart. He revealed to me that all my destructive efforts to shrink my body were not making me feel any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stewart {{grew up in}} a poor {{household}} {{with domestic}} violence from his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs. He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. [...] Stewart's father served with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was regimental sergeant major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, [...] "My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn't have one, but when I <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> just before I went on stage I saw my father's face staring straight back at me." ...|$|E
