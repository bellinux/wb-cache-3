25|$|The playfield is a {{planar surface}} {{inclined}} upward {{from three to}} seven degrees (current convention is {{six and a half}} degrees), away from the player, and includes multiple targets and scoring objectives. Some operators intentionally extend threaded <b>levelers</b> on the rear legs and/or shorten or remove the <b>levelers</b> on the front legs to create additional incline in the playfield, making the ball move faster and harder to play. It is important that the playfield be level left-to-right; a quick visual test compares the top of the back cabinet against a brick or block wall behind it, or to roll a marble {{down the center of the}} playfield glass. If it clearly rolls off to one side, a player may be inclined to stuff folded paper beneath the legs on the lower side to level the playfield. Additionally, leg <b>levelers</b> that are all extended fully make the game easier to nudge; when collapsed low, the entire game is more stable, and nudging becomes harder.|$|E
25|$|Leveling {{systems are}} not {{required}} by the North American regulations. A 2007 study, however, suggests automatic <b>levelers</b> on all headlamps, not just those with high-power light sources, would give drivers substantial safety benefits of better seeing and less glare.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles {{equipped}} with HID headlamps (except motorcycles) {{are required by}} ECE regulation 48 also to be {{equipped with}} headlamp lens cleaning systems and automatic beam leveling control. Both of these measures are intended to reduce the tendency for high-output headlamps to cause high levels of glare to other road users. In North America, ECE R48 does not apply and while lens cleaners and beam <b>levelers</b> are permitted, they are not required; HID headlamps are markedly less prevalent in the US, where they have produced significant glare complaints. Scientific study of headlamp glare has shown that for any given intensity level, the light from HID headlamps is 40% more glaring than the light from tungsten-halogen headlamps.|$|E
50|$|Because {{they carry}} heavy {{motorized}} equipment, the grade of the incline {{has to be}} shallow. The greater the height differential between truck and dock that a dock <b>leveler</b> can compensate for, the longer the <b>leveler</b> itself has to be. Moreover, the grade of the incline must not be {{so great that the}} vehicles cannot climb it. A height differential of between 7 and 8 inches generally requires a 6 ft <b>leveler</b> for an electric palette carrier. A height differential of between 17 and 18 inches generally requires a 12 ft <b>leveler</b> for a petrol-engined fork lift truck. Anyway, the lip has to be considered in the length of the <b>leveler,</b> as it is part of it. A telescopic lip (20 or 40 inches) can help to reduce the length of the <b>leveler</b> to 10 feet.|$|R
40|$|A gyro-less wing <b>leveler</b> and {{directional}} autopilot {{were developed}} and flight {{tested in a}} single-engine light airplane. The {{primary purpose of the}} project was to develop a simple, reliable, low-cost stability augmentation and autopilot system for light aircraft. The wing <b>leveler</b> used a fluidic inertial rate sensor, electronic signal processing circuitry, and vacuum operated servos. A strap-down magnetic heading reference of simple design provided the wing <b>leveler</b> with directional autopilot capability. Flight tests indicated that the performance of the gyro-less wing <b>leveler</b> was equal to that of a commercial wing <b>leveler</b> using a gyroscopic rate sensor. Drift-free, long-term, heading-hold capability of the magnetic heading reference was demonstrated...|$|R

"Republican {{institutions}} in America {{are in a}} transition state; {{they have not yet}} separated themselves from foreign and antagonistic ideas and traditions, derived from old countries; and the labors necessary for the upbuilding of society are not yet so adjusted that there is mutual pleasure and comfort in the relations of employer and employed. We still incline to class distinctions and aristocracies. We incline to the scheme of dividing the world's work into two orders: first, physical labor, which is held to be rude and vulgar, and the province of a lower class; and second, brain labor, held to be refined and aristocratic, and the province of a higher class.

5000|$|Dock <b>levelers</b> {{are more}} {{expensive}} devices than the comparatively light-weight dock plates and dock boards. The {{most common form of}} dock leveler is the recessed, or pit, dock leveler. As the name suggests, this type of leveler is contained in a recess, or pit, beneath the dock door and floor surface. Dock <b>levelers</b> are stronger than dock plates and have similar ranges to dock boards, making them suitable not only for motorized fork lift trucks but also for master conveyors (for which neither dock plates or dock boards are suitable). Safety, also, is very high for this kind of product: Safety rules as EN1398 (European Standard) specifies the safety requirements for design, construction, installation, maintenance and testing of dock <b>levelers</b> and for safety components on dock <b>levelers.</b> NOTE: edge of dock <b>levelers</b> have fixed positions which have restricted ranges making them unsuitable for nonstandard dock heights.|$|E
