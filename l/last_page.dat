5|$|Hama {{wrote out}} page-by-page plots {{for all of}} the issues he wrote, with most pages having four to six panels. He worked very closely with the artists in {{plotting}} the book, and wrote the series spontaneously, never knowing how an issue would end until he got to the <b>last</b> <b>page.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the <b>last</b> <b>page</b> of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E
5|$|As {{they read}} the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the <b>last</b> <b>page</b> and eats it, remarking that {{it is easier to}} chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E

5|$|On Halloween, Billie {{tells the}} Halliwells {{her older sister}} Christy Jenkins (Marnette Patterson) was kidnapped by a demon 15 years prior. Billie's {{memories}} are rekindled when she is finding {{the location of a}} demon named Dogan (Eric Steinberg) and recognizes similarities between him and Christy's kidnapper. After this revelation, Billie's storylines focus on her search for her sister; the Halliwells worry about Billie becoming obsessed with finding Christy as she takes more risks to get information, such as interrogating and torturing demons. Billie accuses her parents of choosing to forget Christy rather than trying to locate her. Billie's mother Helen (Barbara Niven) gives her Christy's diary, in which Billie finds a pentagram on the <b>last</b> <b>page.</b> The pentagram is a symbol for the demonic council known as Triad (Steven J. Oliver, Seren Oliver, and Leland Crooke). She eventually gains enough control over her powers to travel to the past, speak to Christy, and find her location.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, Amy, and Rory enjoy {{a picnic}} in New York's Central Park in 2012, with the Doctor {{reading from a}} pulp novel about a 1930s detective named Melody Malone. Despite Amy's insistence, the Doctor refuses to read ahead to reveal {{spoilers}} and tears out the <b>last</b> <b>page</b> of the book. Meanwhile, Rory goes to get coffee and is {{sent back to the}} 1930s by a cherub Weeping Angel. There, he meets River Song, who is playing the part of Melody Malone. In the present, the Doctor and Amy are shocked to find Rory written into the book. Amy insists on reading ahead, but the Doctor warns her that anything she reads will be destined to happen. Instead, they attempt to take the TARDIS back to the 1930s, finding the time machine struggling to make the journey.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the <b>last</b> <b>page,</b> and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

5|$|Scholar Andrew Spicer {{argues that}} British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism {{than to the}} expressionistic American mode of noir. Examples of British noir from the classic period include Brighton Rock (1947), {{directed}} by John Boulting; They Made Me a Fugitive (1947), directed by Alberto Cavalcanti; The Small Back Room (1948), directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; The October Man (1950), directed by Roy Ward Baker; and Cast a Dark Shadow (1955), directed by Lewis Gilbert. Terence Fisher directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions, including The <b>Last</b> <b>Page</b> (a.k.a. Man Bait; 1952), Stolen Face (1952), and Murder by Proxy (a.k.a. Blackout; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: Night and the City (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors—Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney—it is technically a UK production, financed by 20th Century-Fox's British subsidiary. The most famous of classic British noirs is director Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949), from a screenplay by Graham Greene. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, who had appeared together in Citizen Kane.|$|E
5|$|The first book, The Quest Begins, {{shows how}} {{each of the}} four bears are either {{abandoned}} or separated from their parents. Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas (killer whales) eat her mother, while her brother was still {{on the other side of}} the canal, thinking they were both dead. After this, Kallik travels to find her brother. Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother, Tobi, dies and his mother sees how the salmon is disappearing, and left Toklo to travel alone. Lusa was born and raised in a zoo. Her story intertwines with Toklo's after his mother is brought to the zoo and Lusa hears of the wild. Hoping to leave her home, she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo. Meanwhile, Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him; they begin to travel together. They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book. By Great Bear Lake, the four bears have joined together and they try to go to the Arctic. Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq, he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap a black bear cub. Taqqiq sees that what he did was wrong and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them. The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the Last Great Wilderness in the third book, where there is plentiful food and shelter. After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters, they finally make it to the Last Great Wilderness. However, even though they are there, Ujurak, who leads the journey, feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. In Fire in the Sky, the bears leave the Last Great Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic. In the sixth and final book of the first series, Spirits in the Stars, the four bears make it to Star Island, a place where many polar bears live. They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub. The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub. Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone. The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat, but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others. Yakone, a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears, is added to the group of bears on the <b>last</b> <b>page</b> of the book.|$|E

25|$|However, Christopher Awdry {{found himself}} {{increasingly}} coming {{into conflict with}} his publishers, which ironically arose through {{the success of the}} television series. The television series had made Thomas its central character, and therefore the most well-known of the engines. Consequently, the publishers were increasingly demanding stories that would focus on Thomas {{at the expense of other}} characters. As a compromise, volumes appeared that were named after Thomas but did not actually focus upon him. Thomas and the Fat Controller's Engines featured only one story about Thomas and Thomas Comes Home did not feature Thomas until the <b>last</b> <b>page.</b>|$|E
