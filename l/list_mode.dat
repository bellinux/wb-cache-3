50|$|Example: Given {{an eight}} scan line ANTIC Mode (Text Modes 2, 4, or 6) with the VS bit set on two {{adjacent}} Mode lines the scrolling region then {{consists of three}} Mode lines—the third line in the scrolling region is the first Mode line encountered without the VS bit set. When Vertical scrolling is not set in the Display List the three Modes lines would naturally result in 24 displayed scan lines. When the VS bits are set in the Display <b>List</b> <b>Mode</b> instructions as described and the VSCROL value is set to 2 then the first Mode line in the region begins displaying at scan line 2 showing scan lines 2 to 7 (six scan lines or 8 - VSCROL), the second Mode line is displayed completely (eight scan lines), and the final Mode line ends at scan line 2 showing scan lines 0 to 2 (three scan lines or VSCROL + 1).

30|$|All {{relevant}} acquisition data (PET <b>list</b> <b>mode</b> data, MR-derived attenuation map) {{were transferred}} to a separate workstation for offline data processing. Whole-body <b>list</b> <b>mode</b> PET data were reconstructed using the offline sorting and reconstruction programs included in the e 7 toolbox (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; version VA 20). To this end, every <b>list</b> <b>mode</b> file was first binned into sinograms. In order to investigate different acquisition durations, several sinogram sets were constructed by first using all data from the 300 -s scan, then with decreasing statistics by only {{taking into account the}} first 180, 90, and 30  s of <b>list</b> <b>mode</b> data, respectively, as described previously by Armstrong et al. [18]. Attenuation maps (AM) were generated from MR data (standard Dixon sequence-based segmentation of air, lungs, fat-, and water-like tissue). Between shoulder and pelvis, where MRI coverage of the arms is incomplete, maps were automatically complemented by attenuation data derived from the PET emission data using the maximum likelihood reconstruction of activity and attenuation (MLAA) algorithm [16]. Since the sinogram data are used for both the emission data and for MLAA-based attenuation correction (AC), and hence also for scatter correction (SC), several different combinations of emission/AM timings are possible.|$|E

30|$|PET <b>list</b> <b>mode</b> data {{acquisitions}} {{were performed}} on two widely used clinical PET/CT systems: Siemens Biograph 64 Truepoint TrueV (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and GE Discovery 690 (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The scanners have similar spatial resolutions when measured according to the NEMA NU 2 - 2007 using filtered back projection [13]: 4.4 [16] and 4.7  mm FWHM [17]. Both PET/CT systems include iterative PSF reconstruction algorithms that further improve the spatial resolutions. <b>List</b> <b>mode</b> data were divided into 10  min frames and reconstructed with PSF. The data were decay-corrected using the 18 F half-life and corrected for scatter and attenuation using CT images. For Siemens Biograph 64, <b>list</b> <b>mode</b> data were separated in prompt and random sinograms, and images were reconstructed using attenuation weighted ordered subset expectation maximization without PSF (Iterative 3 D) and with PSF (TrueX). For GE Discovery 690, <b>list</b> <b>mode</b> data were reconstructed using VuePoint FX SharpIR algorithm with time-of-flight (TOF) and PSF. Iterative reconstruction algorithms without resolution modeling are not available for GE Discovery 690. We explored the reconstruction algorithms with varying number of iterations (keeping the number of subsets constant), width of post-filters, {{and size of the}} reconstruction matrices with focus on high-resolution imaging of small lesions (see figures for details).|$|E
