Because {{of the limited}} available transmission bandwidth of mud channel, how to improve the bandwidth utilization becomes a critical problem in LWD research. In this paper, by discussing the information entropy of real <b>logging</b> <b>data,</b> {{we find that the}} original encoding of <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> is inefficient. To prune the data redundancy effectively and to improve the bandwidth utilization, we propose a novel compression method on the basis of Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM).

40|$|AbstractThe Measurement/Logging while Drilling (M/LWD) {{system is}} used to collect and {{transmit}} the <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> while drilling oil/gas wells, in which <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> is transmitted using Mud Pulse Telemetry.

This paper proposes a Compressive Sensing (CS) based Transmission (CST) scheme for <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> delivering in M/LWD systems. The CTS scheme is tolerant to transmission errors without Automatic Request for Repetition mechanism and error correcting code, and also provides an interface for field technicians to adjust the effective coding rate according to various transmission accuracy requirements. To further improve the communication efficiency of CST, we introduce the improved Bernoulli matrix as the measurement matrix in the CS framework. Extensive experiments results with the real <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> are presented to verify the performance of the CST scheme...|$|R

40|$|The Measurement/Logging While Drilling (M/LWD) {{system is}} a kind of sensors system which is used to help oil/gas {{drilling}} field technicians to steer well drilling. In M/LWD, several kinds of sensors are installed into drill string to measure the underground <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> during well drilling operations, and a sink within the drill string collects the <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> from the sensors and then transmits the collected data to the surface site by mud pulse telemetry. Since the drilling mud channel is an erasure channel with very limited feedback, the surface site has to protect against erasure by means of a suitable form of error control in real time. To improve the transmission efficiency of M/LWD system, this paper proposes a Raptor Codes based Transmission (RCT) scheme for reliable real-time <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> transmission in M/LWD systems, where the original <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> can be recovered at the surface site without traditional mechanisms, including erasure correction code (ECC) and Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ), which thus greatly improves the bandwidth efficiency. To further enhance the transmission performance, we introduce the Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) and short-length Raptor codes to the proposed RCT scheme. Extensive experiments performed with real <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> show that RCT scheme achieves good erasure decoding performance to provide precise enough results for drilling field technicians and also achieves good real-time performance...|$|R

Because of the concealed logging response of low-resistivity pay zones, it is critical to filter out the interferences of electrical, lithologic and physical properties on pay zone evaluation. BP algorithm is a functional method to identify low-resistivity pay zones. In this paper, the momentum backpropagation algorithm (MOBP), an improved algorithm of the traditional BP method, was used for <b>logging</b> <b>data</b> processing. In MOBP, momentum is introduced to the traditional BP algorithm to increase the speed of convergence, without compromising its capability in solving nonlinear problems.|$|R

This paper introduced a novel LWD data compression method {{on the basis of}} Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM). Our algorithm can optimize compression parameters to improve the compression efficiency and adjust compression parameters for different application.
