5000|$|Martin {{was one of}} 30 {{defensive}} {{tackles and}} 58 defensive <b>linemen</b> that participated in the February 2012 NFL Scouting Combine. [...] He {{ranked in the top}} four among defensive tackles in all six events. [...] His 36 repetitions in the bench press ranked second among defensive tackles, second among defensive <b>linemen,</b> and third at the entire combine (behind Michigan teammate David Molk who was second with 41). His 40-yard dash time of 4.88 ranked third among defensive tackles. He ranked fourth among the defensive tackles and 13th among defensive <b>linemen</b> in the vertical jump with a height of 33.5 in. [...] His standing long jump distance of 9 ft ranked first among defensive tackles, although that distance was only 14th among defensive <b>linemen.</b> He ranked third among defensive tackles with a 3 cone drill with a time of 7.19, which tied for 15th among defensive <b>linemen.</b> He was second among defensive tackles in the 20-yard shuttle with a time of 4.25, which placed sixth among defensive <b>linemen.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Linemen</b> {{should be}} {{evaluated}} regarding the presence of musculoskeletal symptoms to guide the identification of risk factors for development of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) and to allow the implementation of preventive measures. Objectives: To assess the occurrence of WMSD symptoms among <b>linemen</b> working at a regional branch of an electricity distribution company, to investigate whether there were differences in the proportions of symptomatic workers among the functions performed, and to perform a preliminary survey of the main risk factors present. Methods: Thirty male <b>linemen</b> (mean age 38. 1 ± 5. 5 years) were evaluated, divided into three teams according to their job function (Live Line <b>Linemen,</b> LLL; Maintenance/Emergency <b>Linemen,</b> MEL; Commercial <b>Linemen,</b> CL). Musculoskeletal symptoms were identified on a body map, qualified using the McGill questionnaire and quantified using a numerical scale. The DASH questionnaire was also applied to evaluate {{the impact of the}} shoulder symptoms on the workers' performance. Results: Seventy percent of the <b>linemen</b> presented at least one musculoskeletal symptom in the shoulders, back or knees. All of the LLL team presented musculoskeletal symptoms and these workers had the highest scores in the DASH questionnaire (28 ± 15). Sixty-seven percent of the MEL team presented symptoms, and their DASH score was 8 ± 11. Fifty percent of the CL team presented symptoms, but none of them had shoulder symptoms. The proportion of workers with shoulder symptoms was related to their job function (p= 0. 02). Conclusions: A high proportion of the <b>linemen</b> presented symptoms which varied according to the occupational activity. Interventions are needed {{to reduce the risk of}} WMSD among the <b>linemen</b> evaluated...|$|R
50|$|This rule will penalize {{offensive}} <b>linemen</b> 5 {{yards for}} abrupt snap down into 2 or 3 point stance. This rule {{is aimed at}} eliminating a tactic by offensive <b>linemen,</b> solely designed to draw the defence offside.|$|R
5|$|Entering the 2008 season, the Pittsburgh Steelers lost ten-year <b>lineman</b> Alan Faneca, {{after his}} {{contract}} expired, and {{he signed with}} the New York Jets. Allen Rossum, Jerame Tuman, and Clint Kriewaldt were released on February 22. The team also lost Dan Kreider, Verron Haynes, Brian St. Pierre, and eight-year veteran Clark Haggans to free agency.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Williams {{started in}} all 13 games {{and was named}} a second-team All-SEC player. The Wildcat's offense also broke the team record for most points scored in a season with 475 points in Williams' junior year. Williams was named the SEC's {{offensive}} <b>lineman</b> of the week for his play against the Florida Atlantic Owls on September 29. As a senior, Williams was again named to the All-SEC second-team after starting in 11 games. He was also named the team's most outstanding offensive <b>lineman</b> after allowing only a single sack the entire season. A knee injury caused Williams to miss two games as a senior. He finished his career at Kentucky with 45 games played and 39 starts.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Steve Hindman's selection as the game's MVP, Mississippi had two other players recognized for their achievements in the game: Robert Bailey {{was named the}} game's most outstanding defensive back and offensive tackle Worthy McClure was named the game's most outstanding offensive <b>lineman.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another scheme {{asks the}} {{offensive}} <b>linemen</b> {{to imagine a}} [...] "railroad track" [...] parallel to the running backs path and block everything they find on their way. This could be a linebacker, but also a slanting defensive <b>linemen</b> from somewhere else.|$|R
50|$|Shipley {{was invited}} to the 2009 NFL Scouting Combine where he bench pressed 33 reps of 225 lbs. (fifth among {{offensive}} <b>linemen</b> at the combine) and measured a 31-inch vertical jump (eighth among offensive <b>linemen</b> at the combine). He ran 7.46 in the 3 cone drill and 4.40 in the 20-yard shuttle (second and fifth, respectively, among offensive <b>linemen</b> at the combine). Shipley also scored a 40 on the Wonderlic Test—double the average score for NFL draft prospects.|$|R
5000|$|At the NFL Scouting Combine in February 2015, Marpet's {{performances}} {{identified him}} as one of the 2015 NFL Draft's most athletic offensive <b>linemen.</b> [...] Among offensive <b>linemen,</b> he ran the fastest 40-yard dash, with 4.98, and the fastest 10 yd split, at 1.71 seconds.

5|$|Six Michigan {{players were}} listed on preseason watch lists: (1) Denard Robinson for the Walter Camp Award (best college player), Maxwell Award (best {{offensive}} player), and Davey O'Brien Award (best quarterback), Paul Hornung Award (most versatile player), and Manning Award (best quarterback), (2) Mike Martin for the Bednarik Trophy (best defensive player), Outland Trophy (best interior <b>lineman),</b> and Lombardi Award (best <b>lineman),</b> (3) David Molk for the Outland Trophy, Lombardi Award, and Rimington Trophy (best center), (4) Kevin Koger for the John Mackey Award (best tight end), (5) Roy Roundtree for the Fred Biletnikoff Award (best wide receiver), and (6) Ryan Van Bergen for the Ted Hendricks Award (best defensive end).|$|E
50|$|Skill {{positions}} are often contrasted with <b>linemen</b> - players who line {{up along the}} line of scrimmage; that is, centers, guards, and defensive and offensive tackles (including nose tackles). Skill position players are generally smaller than <b>linemen,</b> but they must also be faster and have other talents (such as the ability to throw or catch the ball, cover an opposing receiver, or change directions abruptly) that are less of a priority to <b>linemen.</b> Skill {{positions are}} universally eligible receivers.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, nearly 1 in 10 retired National Football League (NFL) players polled in a {{confidential}} survey {{said they had}} used now-banned anabolic steroids while still playing. 16.3 percent of offensive <b>linemen</b> admitted using steroids, as did 14.8 percent of defensive <b>linemen.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} linebackers is {{dependent}} upon the formation {{called for in the}} play; formations can call for as few as none, or as many as seven. Most defensive schemes call for three or four, and they are generally named for the number of <b>linemen,</b> followed by the number of linebackers (with the 46 defense being an exception). For example, the 4-3 defense has four defensive <b>linemen</b> and three linebackers; conversely, the 3-4 defense has three <b>linemen</b> and four linebackers.|$|R
