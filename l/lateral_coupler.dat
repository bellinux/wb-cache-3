40|$|Most {{research}} on the vehicle dynamics of railway locomotives has currently been conducted in multi-body software packages with purely mechanical systems. Consequently little information is available regarding the simulation of locomotives as mechatronic systems {{that are capable of}} modelling traction and braking capabilities, along with the use of coupler forces from longitudinal train simulation to provide more detailed results. This paper discusses a methodology for the modelling of locomotives as complex systems in order to evaluate the effects of <b>lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> forces on locomotive wheel-rail forces when under traction in corners, with a focus on Australian railways. Longitudinal train simulation is used to help generate <b>lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> forces for use with multi-body locomotive models that contain simplified traction control algorithms and have been tested using a Locomotive Model Acceptance Procedure. Differences in locomotive traction control systems and bogie types are also considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of wagons {{is an important}} issue in railway industry especially in heavy haul networks. The stability largely depends on a number of factors such as loading conditions and wind conditions aerodynamic forces caused by crosswind, centrifugal force, and dynamic forces due to track parameters and characteristics. The different methodologies for study of wagon dynamics under different wind conditions and load factors as well as their implementation,are part of rolling stock standards. However these methodologies do not completely cover all issues for this field of research. This study presents new results for overturning due to cross winds and takes into account important factors such as real lateral track defects and estimated <b>lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> forces obtained from longitudinal train dynamics simulation for worst case scenarios. For this study, a combination of two simulation packages, CRE-LTS and Gensys multibody software, has been used. The analysis method is to complete a longitudinal train simulation with lateral defects and different wind loading parameters to obtain <b>lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> force data required for further vehicle dynamic analysis. The lateral forces are applied to a full multibody model to study the resulting wheel unloading and lateral to vertical wheel force ratio in order to determine compliance withthese parameters based on the existing standards. Therefore, in this paper, dynamic wagon behaviours are studied with the combined effectsof wind, <b>lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> forces, curving and lateral defectson a multibody vehicle model using computer simulation. The assessment methods are based on the estimation of the vehicle wheel unloading. The dynamic behaviour study combining these four factors will create opportunity in the new area of research...|$|E
40|$|Lateral force {{components}} and impacts from couplers can adversely affect wagon stability. These issues are significant in longer and heavier trains increasing risk of wagon roll over, wheel climb, wagon body pitch, bogie pitch and wagon lift off. Modelling of coupler angles {{has been added}} to normal longitudinal train simulation toallow comprehensive study of lateral components of coupler forces. <b>Lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> forces are then combined with centripetal inertia calculations to allow quasi static lateral forces, quasi static vertical forces and quasi static bogie L/V to be calculated allowing study of stringlining, buckling or wagon rollover risks. The approach taken allows for the different rollingstock lengths, overhang and coupling lengths and allows angles occurring in transitions to also be studied. Wagon body and bogie pitch is also studied with enhancements added to previous modelling to allow study of wagon lift off...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first unique {{design of a}} polarization-independent dual-wavelength {{splitter}} for wavelengths around 1. 3 [*]μm and 1. 55 [*]μm that is potentially {{of great interest to}} passive optical network (PON) applications. The filter design is simple compared with the other architectures and is based on ridge-type <b>lateral</b> directional <b>couplers</b> that can be readily integrated with other planar waveguide devices. Two design examples, based on InP/InGaAsP and Si/SiGe waveguides, are given. This polarization-independent wavelength splitting is achieved by exploiting the polarization dependence of the waveguides to produce coupling lengths that are sensitive to polarization and wavelength. We show that, to split the wavelengths without splitting the polarizations, the coupling lengths must be sufficiently different for TE and TM and for the different wavelengths in order to give the correct required ratios between the TE and TM coupling lengths for the two wavelengths of interest. We also show that the same approach {{can be applied to the}} design of a polarization splitter. The crosstalk, optical bandwidth, and fabrication sensitivity for the wavelength filter are evaluated.

40|$|Implementation {{of a new}} bogie {{concept is}} an {{integrated}} part of the vehicle design which must follow a rigorous testing and validation procedure. Use of multibody simulation helps {{to reduce the amount}} of time and effort required in selecting a new concept design by analysing results of simulated dynamic behaviour of the proposed design. However, the multibody simulation software mainly looks at the dynamics of a single vehicle; hence, forces from the train configuration operational dynamics are often absent in such simulations. Effects of longitudinal-lateral and longitudinal-vertical interactions between rail vehicles have been found to affect the stability of long trains [1, 2]. The effect of wedge design on the vertical dynamics of a bogie has also been discussed in [3, 4]. It is important to apply the lateral and vertical forces from a train simulation into a single multibody model of a wagon to check its behaviour when operating in train configuration. In this paper, a novel methodology for the investigation of new bogie designs has been proposed based on integrating dynamic train simulation and the multibody vehicle modelling concept that will help to efficiently achieve the most suitable design of the bogie. The proposed methodology suggests that simulation of any configuration of bogie needs to be carried out in three stages. As the first stage, the bogie designs along with the wagon configurations need to be presented as a multibody model in multibody simulation software to test the suitability ofthe concept. The model checking needs to be carried out in accordance with the wagon model acceptance procedure established in [5]. As the second stage, the wagon designs need to be tested in train configurations using a longitudinal train dynamics simulation software such as ‘CRE-LTS’ [2], where a train set consisting of the locomotives and wagons will be simulated to give operational wagon parameters such as <b>lateral</b> and vertical <b>coupler</b> force components. As the third stage, the detailed dynamic analysis of bogies and wagons needs to be performed with a multibody software such as ‘Gensys’ where <b>lateral</b> and vertical <b>coupler</b> force components from the train simulation (second stage) will be applied on the multibody model to replicate the worst case scenario. The proposed methodology enhances the selection procedure of any alternate bogie concept by the application of simulated train and vehicle dynamics. The simulated case studies show that simulation of wagon dynamic behaviour in multibody software combined with data obtained from longitudinal train simulation is not only possible, but it can identify issues with a bogie design that can otherwise be overlooked...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that active {{steering}} control can improve steering performance in two axle bogies whilst also improving high speed train stability. In freight operations passive steering three axle bogies have been produced in large numbers for reported benefits including improved adhesion performance and reduced wheel wear. However, passive steering bogie designs have been shown to perform similarly to straight rigid frame bogies under high traction forces due to the loss of longitudinal creep forces. These factors have not been modelled for hauling locomotives and published in public domain though commercial testing by locomotive manufacturers has occurred. A gap therefore exists in the knowledge of steering bogie performance in freight locomotive operations particularly for three axle bogies. The following thesis explored traction curving operations for hauling locomotives considering, and in particular, the effect of high adhesion levels, rail-wheel contact friction and <b>lateral</b> components of <b>coupler</b> forces. Both passive and active designs were analysed and new designs were proposed. Methods of active control and data measurement were also compared and discussed. The following three axle bogies were evaluated and compared. • Bogies with passive steering: Rigid, yaw relaxation, self steering, forced steering. • Bogies with actively controlled designs: Actuated Wheelset Yaw (AWY) bogies with creep force control; steering angle precedence control; yaw angle precedence control. • Bogies with new designs developed as part of this thesis: Actuated Yaw Force Steered (AY-FS) bogies with creep force control; precedence control; and curve estimation control; Actuated Yaw Variable Steering (AY-VS) bogies with precedence control and curve estimation control.

40|$|As {{heavy haul}} trains become longer and heavier, the {{resulting}} in-train forces {{are also being}} increased. However, locomotive dynamics studies are commonly focused on the dynamics of individual locomotives, which means that in-train forces are not attached to the locomotive or, in other words, external forces due to train configuration are not fully considered. Some published studies do apply an approximation of <b>lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> forces to replicate a locomotive’s dynamics in curves. This {{is very important for}} the analysis of locomotive dynamics given the significant variations in coupler forces when transiting a curve. However, this approach does not fully depict the real situation because it is necessary to also take account of vertical components of coupler forces along with locomotive pitch dynamics in order to correctly analyse the outcomes. One of the techniques to investigate such behaviour in vehicle dynamics studies is to use a cosimulation approach. This paper describes a methodology for the development of co-simulation between the multibody software and an in-house train dynamics code, as well as presenting numerical experiments for locomotive dynamics studies based on the developed methodology...|$|E
40|$|The {{tradition}} of treating train dynamics and wagons dynamics as two separate problems {{continues to be}} supported by both software and standards. The assumption that coupler angles are so small that the consequential vertical and lateral force components can be ignored does not necessarily hold as trains become heavier and longer and coupler forces become larger. In the Australian AS 7509 standard the wagon rollover risk from lateral forces is assessed only at slow speed and given an allowance of 100 % wheel unloading. Conversely, wagon unloading, in response to curve geometry at speed, is given a limit 60 % (excluding transients) and 80 % maximum when including effects of the track geometry and typical irregularities. If wind loads are added the criteria is lifted to 90 % wheel unloading. <b>Lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> forces, coupler misalignment due to empty wagons in loaded trains and wagon body and bogie pitch are examined. The effect of combining {{all of these issues}} is discussed. The results lead, logically, to a discussion of operational assessment verses wagon roadworthiness assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of defects and external forces influencing and {{acting on a}} running wagon raises a significant issue regarding the safety of operation. The studies performed {{in this area are}} commonly limited to one or two factors, and often present results taking these factors into account separately. This does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the response of the dynamic systems and it may be nonconservative to describe wagon dynamics by analysing results without the consideration of combined effects of wind, <b>lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> force, curving and track irregularities. The wagon dynamics behaviour assessment is generally relied on for the estimation of the fundamental parameters required for making a conclusion onsafety acceptance. Due to the presence of a great number of input parameters, a special methodology has been developed for the study of wagon behaviour using appropriate multibody simulation packages. This paper proposes a methodology generally based on the existing Australian Standard (AS 7509) safety limits to find the acceptable operational range of rail vehicle reaction. A worked example of the application of the developed methodology has been presented to analyse mineral wagon behaviour during heavy haul train operations...|$|E
30|$|The in-train {{stability}} {{problems have}} been reported in the area of long freight cars and locomotives. The signal synchronization, in-train forces and rotational angles of couplers are the main indicators to train derailment accident. A large number of scholars has focused on the theoretical and testing studies of longitudinal train dynamics. In Australia, Cole [3, 4] studied the in-train stability problems of freight cars. It was indicated that the lateral and vertical rotational behavior of coupler occurred during compressed in-train forces, which further arose train derailment accidents. Similar safety issues due to coupler jackknifing behavior had also been reported in Canada [5]. In China, the investigation of derailment accident in Da-Qin heavy haul railway showed that the <b>coupler</b> <b>lateral</b> rotations occurred under compressed forces. The lateral force components lead to a dramatic increase in wheel axle lateral forces which even causes the rail shift and rollover phenomenon [6, 7, 8]. The Association of American Railroads stipulates that the freight car should be able to pass the curve with a radius of 175  m under the buffer force of 890  kN [9]. According to UIC 530 - 2 [10], the allowable coupler force of freight cars is determined on the S-shaped curve with a radius of 150  m. Normally, the longitudinal impacts of EMUs in normal operations are not noticeable. However, according to previous studies, the in-train stability problem for train to train rescue scenarios cannot be neglected. Significant in-train force occurs due to the braking applied by the assisting train. The combination of coupler force and pitch motion leads to a vertical force component, which further causes the destruction to coupler yoke and the interference of in-train equipment. Based on theoretical and dynamic calculations, the coupler length, free rotational angle, braking level, train configuration as well as suspension clearance will affect the longitudinal train dynamic performance [11, 12].|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} of {{temperatures in the}} contact zone at the wheel and rail interface {{is a very complex}} and important issue for multidisciplinary studies. The knowledge of temperature in the contact interface between two bodies and with the possible presence of a third body layer allows making informed judgments on processes in areas such as lubricant choice, wear estimation, life cycle prediction, etc. This paper is focused on the development of a temperature modelling methodology in Gensys multibody code which also presents its implementation for the study of temperatures at various common areas of contact (top of rail, gauge corner and gauge face contacts). Under normal operational practice, all these contact areas have different coefficients of friction which should be characterised as velocity and slip dependant variables. In order to show the workability of the developed methodology, numerical experiments for a heavy haul locomotive equipped with a simplified bogie traction control has been performed on curved track, where a locomotive has been operated under maximum traction forces and with longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> forces attached in order to take into account train dynamics. For these experiments, both new and worn rail profiles have been used. Limitations of the proposed methodology as well as proposed future work and further improvements are discussed...|$|E
30|$|The {{longitudinal}} force that the draft gear absorbs usually {{leads to the}} failure of its components, especially, the draft pads. Garg and Dukkipati [2] specified the problems caused by {{longitudinal force}}s and attributed the failure of draft gears due to excessive longitudinal draft forces. Initial work on longitudinal train dynamics was aimed towards reducing longitudinal oscillations in passenger train. Work done in this context involved measurement and simulation of in-train forces to reduce longitudinal oscillations [3]. The relation between <b>lateral</b> <b>coupler</b> force components and wheel unloading were studied by El-Sibaie [4] and a new method was proposed for evaluating the curving stability of any freight railway car under buff and draw conditions. Chen [5] proposed a mathematical model to calculate transient responses of the coupler, whereas McClanachan et al. [6] conducted experiments to determine the occurrences of coupler impacts combined with pitching motions in the wagon body. Then these interactions were simulated using NUCARS, ADAMS/Rail and a train-wagon interaction model. Cole and Sun [7] evaluated fatigue life of autocoupler systems with and without self-locking features of the draft gear for three types of wagon connection coupling systems. Nasr and Mohammadi [8] studied the effect of train braking delay time on train longitudinal dynamics. They carried out simulations for three different cases of long, medium and short brake application times for three different train forward velocities.|$|E
