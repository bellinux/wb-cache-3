40|$|The LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} hollow flange section {{developed}} by OneSteel Australian Tube Mills using their patented dual electric resistance welding and automated continuous roll-forming technologies. It has a unique geometry consisting of torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a relatively slender web.

The LSB is considerably lighter than traditional hot-rolled steel beams and provides both structural and construction efficiencies.

50|$|Water gushing {{downward}} through strudel produces scour depressions in the seabed. This {{occurs at}} shallow water levels, within the two-meter bathymetry contour, {{and up to}} 8 meters. The depth of these depressions may reach 6 meters or more. This depends {{on a number of}} factors: seabed properties, water depth, flow velocity, flow duration and size and shape of the orifice. The width of individual strudel scours are generally in the order of 10-20 meters. An excavation rate of 2.5 km−2y−1 has been reported, as well as complete back filling by sediments within 2-3 years. Such rapid filling rates imply that most strudel scours are recent events. Strudel scours present risks to submarine pipelines if water action removes the soil from below a pipe segment such that it becomes a free span. The consequences include: vortex-induced oscillation, <b>lateral</b> <b>buckling</b> and overstress due to self-weight. Moreover, the presence of a pipeline may conceivably promote the generation of strudel because of the heat generated by this structure, which may thin and thus weaken the ice above it.|$|E

40|$|The current design {{procedure}} for steel frame structures is a two-step process including an elastic analysis to determine design actions {{and a separate}} member capacity check. This design procedure is unable to trace {{the full range of}} load-deflection response and hence the failure modes of the frame structures can not be accurately predicted. In recent years, the development of advanced analysis methods has aimed at solving this problem by combining the analysis and design tasks into one step. Application of the new advanced analysis methods permits a comprehensive assessment of the actual failure modes and ultimate strengths of structural steel systems in practical design situations. One of the advanced analysis methods, the refined plastic hinge method, has shown great potential to become a practical design tool. However, at present, it is only suitable for a special class of steel frame structures that is not subject to <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> effects. The refined plastic hinge analysis can directly account for three types of frame failures, gradual formation of plastic hinges, column buckling and local buckling. However, this precludes most of the steel frame structures whose behaviour is governed by <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling.</b> Therefore, the aim of this research is to develop a practical advanced analysis method suitable for general steel frame structures including the effects of lateral-torsional <b>buckling.</b> <b>Lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> is a complex three dimensional instability phenomenon. Unlike the in-plane buckling of beam-columns, a closed form analytical solution is not available for <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling.</b> The member capacity equations used in design specifications are derived mainly from testing of simply supported beams. Further, there has been very limited research into the behaviour and design of steel frame structures subject to <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> failures. Therefore in order to incorporate <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> effects into an advanced analysis method, a detailed study must be carried out including inelastic beam buckling failures. This thesis contains a detailed description of research on extending the scope of advanced analysis by developing methods that include the effects of <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> in a nonlinear analysis formulation. It has two components. Firstly, distributed plasticity models were developed using the state-of-the-art finite element analysis programs for a range of simply supported beams and rigid frame structures to investigate and fully understand their <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> behavioural characteristics. Nonlinear analyses were conducted to study the load-deflection response of these structures under <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> influences. It was found that the behaviour of simply supported beams and members in rigid frame structures is significantly different. In real frame structures, the connection details are a decisive factor in terms of ultimate frame capacities. Accounting for the connection rigidities in a simplified advanced analysis method is very difficult, but is most critical. Generally, the finite element analysis results of simply supported beams agree very well with the predictions of the current Australian steel structures design code AS 4100, but the capacities of rigid frame structures can be significantly higher compared with Australian code predictions. The second part of the thesis concerns the development of a two dimensional refined plastic hinge analysis which is capable of considering <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> effects. The formulation of the new method is based on the observations from the distributed plasticity analyses of both simply supported beams and rigid frame structures. The <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> effects are taken into account implicitly using a flexural stiffness reduction factor in the stiffness matrix formulation based on the member capacities specified by AS 4100. Due to the lack of suitable alternatives, concepts of moment modification and effective length factors are still used for determining the member capacities. The effects of connection rigidities and restraints from adjacent members are handled by using appropriate effective length factors in the analysis. Compared with the benchmark solutions for simply supported beams, the new refined plastic hinge analysis is very accurate. For rigid frame structures, the new method is generally more conservative than the finite element models. The accuracy of the new method relies on the user's judgement of beam segment restraints. Overall, the design capacities in the new method are superior to those in the current design procedure, especially for frame structures with less slender members. The new refined plastic hinge analysis is now able to capture four types of failure modes, plastic hinge formation, column buckling, local <b>buckling</b> and <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling.</b> With the inclusion of <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> mode as proposed in this thesis, advanced analysis is one step closer to being used for general design practice...|$|R

Typical wood I-joists are manufactured with a very slender section, which is desirable to achieve higher flexural capacities and longer spans; however, this makes them susceptible to <b>lateral</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> failure.
