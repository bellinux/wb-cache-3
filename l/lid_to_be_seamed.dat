5000|$|In {{the area}} of {{chemical}} analysis, crucibles are used in quantitative gravimetric chemical analysis (analysis by measuring mass of an analyte or its derivative). Common crucible use may be as follows. A residue or precipitate in a chemical analysis method can be collected or filtered from some sample or solution on special [...] "ashless" [...] filter paper. The crucible and <b>lid</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used are pre-weighed very accurately on an analytical balance. After some possible washing and/or pre-drying of this filtrate, the residue on the filter paper can {{be placed in the}} crucible and fired (heated at very high temperature) until all the volatiles and moisture are driven out of the sample residue in the crucible. The [...] "ashless" [...] filter paper is completely burned up in this process. The crucible with the sample and <b>lid</b> <b>is</b> allowed <b>to</b> cool in a desiccator. The crucible and lid with the sample inside is weighed very accurately again only after it has completely cooled to room temperature (higher temperature would cause air currents around the balance giving inaccurate results). The mass of the empty, pre-weighed crucible and lid is subtracted from this result to yield the mass of the completely dried residue in the crucible.|$|R

50|$|Lunokhod 1 was a {{lunar vehicle}} formed of a tub-like {{compartment}} {{with a large}} convex lid on eight independently powered wheels. Its length was 2.3 m. Lunokhod was equipped with a cone-shaped antenna, a highly directional helical antenna, four television cameras, and special extendable devices to test the lunar soil for soil density and mechanical properties. An X-ray spectrometer, an X-ray telescope, cosmic ray detectors, and a laser device were also included. The vehicle was powered by batteries which were recharged during the lunar day by a solar cell array mounted {{on the underside of}} the <b>lid.</b> <b>To</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> work in vacuum a special fluoride based lubricant was used for the mechanical parts and the electric motors (one in each wheel hub) were enclosed in pressurized containers. During the lunar nights, the lid was closed and a polonium-210 radioisotope heater unit kept the internal components at operating temperature. Lunokhod 1 <b>was</b> intended <b>to</b> operate through three lunar days (approximately three Earth months) but actually operated for eleven lunar days.|$|R

And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and, basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan <b>lid</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> let out and peeled.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{hydraulic}} conductivity fracture zone {{is the main}} channel causing inrush disaster in mine. This paper makes a few analysis {{on the effect of}} the location of primary key stratum through the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The results show that: (1).

50|$|The {{rear wheels}} and side pipes were changed. For the second film, the {{original}} Weiand blower, which was removed and subsequently lost, was replaced. Unlike {{in the first}} film, this time the supercharger was functional (connected directly to the engine's crankshaft pulley) {{and the effect of}} the blower being engaged or disengaged was created by placing the vehicle on a low loader, and while in motion, the interceptor's engine was simply started or stopped. The car was cosmetically modified for the new post-apocalyptic setting {{with the addition of a}} pair of large cylindrical fuel tanks fitted in the rear (requiring the back window and boot <b>lid</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed) and its general appearance was given a more used look by painting the vehicle in matte rather than gloss black, and the paint <b>was</b> scrubbed off <b>to</b> appear rusty. The front end was also modified by removing the air dam. A duplicate car was also put together for the film. When the script required it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> destroyed by rolling down an embankment and eventually exploding, the duplicate interceptor was used, leaving the original vehicle intact.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Waste Package Closure System (WPCS) project <b>is</b> <b>to</b> assist in the disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and associated high-level wastes (HLW) at the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada.

40|$|Apparatus {{for testing}} for leaks in a {{gas-filled}} pack {{is placed in}} a packaging line and comprises two upper conveyors (10 A, 10 B), each connected to a load cell (12 A, 12 B) and positioned above a lower, synchronized conveyor (8). A gas-filled pack on the lower conveyor (8) passes under and is compressed by {{the first and second}} conveyors (10 A, 10 B), in succession, the pack being detected by sensors (16) connected to a control unit (6) which causes the force required to displace the pack <b>lid</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> measured by a respective load cell (12 A, 12 B) at regular intervals of travel. A microprocessor determines from a comparison of the two force/displacement relationships so generated whether the pack leaks. In an alternative arrangement using just one load cell, the lid of the pack is displaced by a vertically reciprocal load cell whilst the load cell is moved along the packaging line by a chain drive moved at the speed of a pack by a stepper moter.

50|$|Pressure cookers {{usually have}} two safety valves to prevent explosions. On older designs, {{one is a}} nozzle upon which a weight sits. The other is a sealed rubber grommet which is ejected in a {{controlled}} explosion if the first valve gets blocked. On newer generation pressure cookers, if the steam vent gets blocked, a safety spring will eject excess pressure and if that fails, the gasket will expand and release excess pressure downwards between the lid and the pan. Also, newer generation pressure cookers have a safety interlock which locks the lid when internal pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, to prevent accidents from a sudden release of very hot steam, food and liquid, which {{would happen if the}} <b>lid</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed when the pan is still slightly pressurised inside (however, the lid will be very hard or impossible to open when the pan is still pressurised).|$|R

[...] (Tiger Woods) who suddenly jumps into the scene in a fanfare and proceeds to help Billie by firing his golf clubs at the obstacle although she argues that he can make it so much easier {{for both of them}} if he just solves the problem without using his clubs! This distraction causes Tiger to lose his concentration and when he fires his clubs they always miss hit their target and bounce off objects and usually end up hitting Tiger in the face and then he takes out his putter and fires it (over Billie's continuous protests) and that too misses its target, bounces off trees and hits Billie in the face! Tiger then says he's either had enough or goes off to find his clubs leaving Billie fuming over the narrator's annoying speech [...] "and so once again, Tiger Hood has saved the day!"
