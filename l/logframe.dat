40|$|This article compares key attributes, {{strengths}} and weaknesses of three different approaches to monitoring development interventions: the logical framework approach, participatory monitoring and evaluation (PM&E) and feedback systems. Academic and practitioner literature describes how <b>logframes</b> meet the needs of senior decision?makers to summarise, organise and compare projects. PM&E meets the needs of field staff to work sensitively with intended beneficiaries and support their learning and empowerment. Feedback systems appear to link the two, providing performance data for managers and creating incentives for implementing staff to focus on their intended beneficiaries. Feedback systems build on the rich heritage of PM&E and are compatible with <b>logframes.</b> They may help provide a manageable and effective approach to accountability that links the means and the ends of development interventions. Feedback systems are at an early stage of development. There is a lot to learn about how and where they work best...|$|R

40|$|International aid {{projects}} are broadly concerned with fostering change. Frequently, the ‘theory of change ’ within an aid project is communicated using Logical Framework Analysis, or the ‘logframe’. The <b>logframe</b> {{may be viewed}} from at least two philosophical perspectives—functionalist and interpretist. Functionalism {{is found to be}} useful for problem analysis and project design since it enables a deconstruction of the goal into functional components. Interpretivism is found to assist project monitoring and evaluation since it draws attention to the role of human actors within the social change process, thereby clarifying the social research plan.

5000|$|Practitioners have {{developed}} logic models and logical frameworks as strategies and tools {{to plan and}} evaluate social change programs. While these models well articulate the goals and resources of an initiative or organization, they give less focus to the complex social, economic, political and institutional processes that underlie social and societal change. Thus, while logic models and <b>logframes</b> {{have developed}} an Implementation Theory behind their work, they can lack an underlying Theory of Change.Theory of Change also contrasts with logic models and <b>logframes</b> by beginning with a participatory process to clearly define desired outcomes and to air and challenge one another’s assumptions. Theory of Change begins by first working out program goals or desired impact and working backwards on outcome pathways, rather than engaging in conventional forward oriented “so-that” reasoning. As an example of [...] "so-that" [...] reasoning: a grantee decides to increase media coverage {{on the lack of}} health insurance among children so that public awareness increases so that policymakers increase their knowledge and interest so that policies change so that more children have health insurance. In Theory of Change, by contrast, the group begins not with its intervention but with its long-term goal and outcomes and then works backward (in time) toward the earliest changes that need to occur. Only when the pathway has been developed is it time to consider which interventions will best produce the outcomes in the pathway.|$|R
40|$|Participatory Impact Pathways Analysis (PIPA) is a {{practical}} planning, and monitoring and evaluation approach developed for use with complex projects {{in the water and}} food sectors. PIPA begins with a participatory workshop where stakeholders make explicit their assumptions about how their project will achieve an impact. Participants construct problem trees, carry out a visioning exercise and draw network maps to help them clarify their 'impact pathways'. These are then articulated in two logic models. The outcomes logic model describes the project's medium term objectives in the form of hypotheses: which actors need to change, what are those changes and which strategies are needed to realise these changes. The impact logic model describes how, by helping to achieve the expected outcomes, the project will impact on people's livelihoods. Participants derive outcome targets and milestones which are regularly revisited and revised as part of project monitoring and evaluation (M&E). PIPA goes beyond the traditional use of logic models and <b>logframes</b> by engaging stakeholders in a structured participatory process, promoting learning and providing a framework for 'action research' on processes of change.

Alongside the December 2009 SLP meeting in Addis Ababa, Ranjitha Puskur (ILRI) shares some lessons {{coming out of}} the DFID-funded Fodder Innovation Project. Similar to the Fodder Adoption Project, it looks at fodder scarcity and how to address it, but from the perspectives of capacities, policies and institutions. This current second phase of the project, she says, emerged from the realisation that the availability of technologies is not really the limiting factor, policy and institutional factors are the major bottlenecks. She briefly introduces the innovation systems approach that underpins the project: Essentially, the aim is to form and facilitate a network of different actors in a chain or continuum of knowledge production and its use, mobilizing all their various resources and capacities to address a problem. What outcomes and changes has she seen? At the farm level, farmers are changing their livestock feeding and management practices; there is an emerging demand for technologies, inputs and services that, ironically, were earlier promoted without success. "Farmers are seeing the need for knowledge and can articulate demands to service providers. " She emphasizes that "getting a network of actors isn't an easy process, it takes time". Different organizations with different interests and motives have to be brought around the table to contribute and benefit. "It needs great facilitation skills and negotiating skills which are not very often core competences of researchers like us. " Beyond facilitation of this network formation, "we also see that linkages don't happen automatically" [...] . we need a facilitating or broker organisation to create them. In her project, they work through key partner organisations: "This works well, but they needed much support and mentoring from us. " She concludes with two final observations: Policies are a very critical factor and it is important to engage policy makers from the outset, ensuring that we know what they really want, and that the evidence base is solid. Traditional project management approaches don't seem to work in such projects: We need nimble financial management, and very responsive project management.

40|$|The problem {{statement}} underlying {{the study was}} the observable shortcomings of community stakeholder participation and involvement in management of ESPs, difficulties {{in the setting of}} the projects objectives and inadequate review of the set objectives and difficulties in monitoring and evaluation of the projects due to lack of elaborate logframes that would highlight on the indicators of project progress. This study aimed at analyzing the logical framework approach as a tool in results based management and its effect on project design and execution of Economic Stimulus Programmes (ESP) in Nairobi County. The study was guided by specific objectives which are;' to investigate the influence of stakeholder participation and involvement on project design and execution; to determine the effect of objective setting and review on project design and execution; to examine the effect of the <b>logframe</b> matrix in project design and execution. The research design was descriptive design and aimed at describing relationships between the independent and dependent variables of the study. The target population of the study was sixty two ESP projects in Nairobi County. The Sampling design selected for the study was stratified sampling under which nineteen projects were selected; industrialization (Jua Kali Sheds) and Fresh Produce Markets (local government) and education projects. The research instrument used were semi-structured questionnaires that were distributed to respondents. To analyze data, qualitative data was grouped under common descriptive characteristics and analyzed. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse quantitative data presented using tables, bar charts and pie-charts. A summary of findings, conclusion and recommendations was provided. The findings revealed that the stakeholders were involved in the design and execution of ESP largely through representation by Committee members including the clergy, men, women and youth representatives, school principals and school administration and Jua Kali traders committee.. Data also showed that every project had set objectives and milestones which were in some cases reviewed to reflect on the changing environmental forces. Data also revealed that in some cases not all stakeholders were in agreement of all the project objectives. The components of the <b>logframe</b> were used in the monitoring and evaluation of the projects, and though most projects did not have an elaborate <b>logframe</b> matrix the components of the <b>logframe</b> existed in a fragmented manner in the work plans, schemes of work and bill of quantity. Recommendations made were that the logical framework should be used in management of ESP projects to assist in the planning and design, time scheduling, risk analysis and monitoring and evaluation.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Framework {{separates}} into two parts. The first part looks at standards, frameworks and guidelines for conforming to good M&E practice. This includes a discussion on the rationale for adopting participatory methods {{in the design and}} data collection processes throughout the programme. This document also looks at frameworks the African Universities’ Research Approaches (AURA) programme will draw upon in its assessment of improvements to research and teaching practices in the partner institutions. The intention is to draw upon well-established frameworks as a first step, modifying or refining the framework(s) as required {{over the course of the}} programme. Finally, this document will discuss the M&E model that will be used to measure the cost-effectiveness, impact and effectiveness of the partnership and product, namely the Facilitated Self-Evaluation (FSE). The latter part of this document covers material that is more practical in nature. The section entitled ‘Data collection for M&E’ (section 4) includes a set of guidelines and templates that will be used to collect evidence throughout the programme. The broad aim of this section is to capture evidence of the AURA project’s ability to achieve its programme targets. Naturally, many of these targets come from the <b>logframe</b> that’s been agreed between the AURA project consortium (i. e. IDS-ITOCA-Loughborough University) and the donor, the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID). The <b>logframe</b> defines the contractual obligations that should be achieved / delivered in this programme, and these obligations are articulated as impacts at: an individual, institutional and sectoral level. As a result, the data collected from monitoring and evaluation processes needs to link to the outcomes and indicators outlined in the AURA <b>logframe.</b> We aim to strike a careful balance in capturing the required information, without overburdening the project team with unnecessary details or processes. For this reason we propose that the data gathering templates used in this document (see the Appendices) are subject to continuous review during the course of the programme, so that these continue to respond to our ever evolving needs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} has analysed {{monitoring and evaluation}} (M&E) activities based on the Outcome Mapping (OM) methodology within the St 2 eep project, an education for sustainability project in Zimbabwe. The vast majority of development programmes {{in the public sector}} are being guided by conventional M&E-approaches based on the <b>logframe.</b> Although research is indicating significant problems with the implementation of these approaches, there are only few documented examples of experiences with alternative M&E frameworks. The case of St 2 eep allowed us to compare three years of experiences with M&E based on the <b>logframe,</b> with two years of M&E based on OM. We evaluate how the project team and VVOB have perceived the performance of OM with regards to the two main aims of M&E activities: accountability and learning. This is complemented with an analysis of monitoring documentation. The project team refers to the collaborative nature of M&E in St 2 eep, the principles of self-assessment and peer-assessment, combined with public recognition for project successes, as the key factors supporting learning and accountability through M&E in St 2 eep. Double-loop learning would require improved data collection and more skills to monitor behaviour changes in the project to push critical reflection at a higher level. ...|$|E

40|$|To follow are 31 {{different}} retrospective logframes representing coded {{data from}} the NC-Exchange Community NETworker Demonstration. In my approach, I have taken interview data from project participants in three categories - NC-Exchange staff, NETworkers, and host organization directors - {{in addition to the}} original NETworker project proposal, and coded the information using the structure of the logical framework. In all, I have coded 26 separate items from different project sources. More specifically, I have placed each statement (or portion of a statement) made by the participants (or sentences, {{in the case of the}} proposal) into the box in the <b>logframe</b> matrix that I feel best represents the statement's meaning relative to its position within the overall system of the NETworker project. In this way, each statement becomes a disaggregated Wider Objective, Immediate Objective, Output, Activity, Indicator of Achievement, Means of Verification, or Assumption of the project. Because the individual retrospective logframes based on statements from the full interview transcripts are quite long (in some cases, more than 40 pages), I have also produced synthesized versions of several retrospective logframes in which I capture the main points in bullet-point format. In the long versions of the retrospective logframes, statements have been left intact; in the short versions, individual statements have been shortened or summarized into their key themes. In summarizing them, I have sought to leave the phrases in the same language used by the respondents in order to preserve the intended meanings.

The Committee was informed of progress on the external review of the Systemwide Genetic Resources Program (SGRP), and the study on marginal lands. It discussed possible refinements of the external review process, concentrating on the role of external reviews commissioned by the centers themselves. TAC reviewed center medium term plans (MTPs) for the period 1999 to 2001, concentrating on changes in 1999, and proposals {{for the end of the}} period. A center by center commentary appears in the report. The Committee discussed the report of a workshop on the CGIAR <b>logframe</b> and activity classification held in Feldafing in February. A final proposal would be discussed at TAC 75. TAC endorsed the recommendations of the CGIAR panels on Proprietary Science and Technology, and General Issues in Biotechnology, and prepared commentaries for the CGIAR on each, included in the report. It suggested that a nine center proposal presented by ICARDA for work in Central Asia needed to be more integrated. TAC agreed on criteria for the 1998 King Baudouin Award...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{application}} of logical framework analysis (LFA) for implementing continuous quality improvement (CQI) across multiple settings in a tertiary care hospital. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a multiple case study approach. LFA is implemented within three diverse settings, namely, intensive care unit, surgical ward, and acute in-patient psychiatric ward. First, problem trees are developed in order to determine the root causes of quality issues, specific to the three settings. Second, objective trees are formed suggesting solutions to the quality issues. Third, project plan template using logical framework (<b>LOGFRAME)</b> is created for each setting. Findings: This study shows substantial improvement in quality across the three settings. LFA proved to be effective to analyse quality issues and suggest improvement measures objectively. Research limitations/implications: This paper applies LFA in specific, albeit, diverse settings in one hospital. For validation purposes, it would be ideal to analyse in other settings within the same hospital, as well as in several hospitals. It also adopts a bottom-up approach when this can be triangulated with other sources of data. Practical implications: LFA enables top management to obtain an integrated view of performance. It also provides a basis for further quantitative research on quality management through the identification of key performance indicators and facilitates the development of a business case for improvement. Originality/value: LFA is a novel approach for the implementation of CQI programs. Although LFA has been used extensively for project development to source funds from development banks, its application in quality improvement within healthcare projects is scant...|$|E
40|$|Report of the Impact Assessment and Evaluation Group (IAEG) to CGIAR International Centers Week 1999, {{the last}} {{report of the}} IAEG before {{becoming}} an external standing panel of TAC on evaluation, which later {{became known as the}} TAC Standing Panel on Impact Assessment (SPIA). The report discussed the evolving mandate and structure of the IAEG, and the roles of the IAEG and TAC in the ex ante, current, and ex post phases of evaluation, and the importance of independence in the evaluation function. These considerations had led the Group to approve replacement of the IAEG with an external standing panel on evaluation, served by a wing of the TAC Secretariat. Its role in the impact assessment cycle and in TAC's structure {{was the subject of a}} tentative proposal prepared by TAC Chair-designate Emil Javier, which would integrate the standing panel into the existing TAC Standing Committee on Priorities and Strategies, in order to tie the results of ex post impact assessment directly to TAC priority-setting and strategic planning. The IAEG agreed with this approach. Progress reports were presented on IAEG's portfolio of seven ongoing or planned impact studies: 1. Impact of CGIAR Germplasm Improvement on Food Production 2. Impact of CGIAR Integrated Pest Management Research 3. CGIAR Contributions to Poverty Alleviation 4. Impacts of CGIAR Innovations on the Environment 5. CGIAR Contributions to Strengthening Scientific Capacity and Partnerships 6. Implications for the CGIAR of Impact Assessment and <b>Logframe</b> 7.
