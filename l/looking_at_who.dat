You shall stop here; don't be afraid. And you'll be a good girl, Susan, and wear smart little caps and aprons and bright ribbons, and you'll look nice and pretty, and dust the furniture, won't you?"

50|$|Looking at {{the federal}} budget in a {{different}} way professor R. Frey notes that „the swiss federal budget is to a considerable extent a transfer budget.“ What this means is that by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> uses the money (and not what it is being spent on) an overwhelming 74.6% (2010) of the federal budget is merely transferred to other institutions, as for example the Swiss cantons, municipalities and the various institutions of social welfare. In this view, the confederation uses merely 20.5% of its budget for own expenditures (personnel-, operating- and defense related expenditures). The reason for these low own costs are that in Switzerland the orderly implementation and control of national laws is often not part of the competences of the confederation but of the individual cantons. Exceptions are national defense, border control, foreign relations, etc. But other expensive posts such as schooling, police or public transportation are (mostly) organized and financed on the cantonal level.|$|E

That’s led to a breakdown of the relationship. [...] Rolfe added a good relation was needed where prison officers could encourage prisoners to work or study and help prisoners turn their lives round. Rolfe has also described Swaleside as [...] "a particularly difficult place to work" [...] because of an [...] "acute staff shortfall" [...] and high levels of violence.Former Swaleside governor, John Podmore, said prisons were “undoubtedly dangerous” and added: We should be sending fewer people to jail in absolute terms but we need to be <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> we are locking up, why we are locking them up and how we deal with the way in which they are offending against society.

5000|$|Violence and Activism At The Border {{is a book}} by University of Texas {{professor}} Kathleen Staudt, {{in which}} the author discusses violence against women in the border city Ciudad Juarez. [...] As Staudt states when discussing the roadmap of the book, “The book contains conceptual, empirical and strategic analyses of interest to multiple audiences concerned with violence, borders, activism, and women and gender.” She does this by composing a review on existing knowledge of violence to women in Cuidad Juarez, showing data surveys from the survivors {{of violence in the}} city, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> exactly are the victims, how they reacted, their reasoning to how the violence happened and how much do they fear for their safety in their home. [...] Chapter 4 is more concerned to how activism from local and transnational feminist organizations spread awareness to the violent situation in the border city with its biggest protest in 2004 bringing in approximately 5,000 to 8,000 people to protest against femicide (the murders of women being unsolved and ignored by local law enforcement). This was the peak of the movement but it did bring necessary change as law enforcement in Ciudad Juarez did step up to the concerns of the community and the activists of human rights groups.|$|E

It would look at what human trafficking is and how it differs from human smuggling by examining the five different stages of trafficking. There would be an examination of the legislation that is currently in place to try to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking, with attention paid to the United Nation Convention on Human Trafficking. The extent of the Britain trafficking markets would be examined and the question of who the victims are would be explored and the reasons why these women are being trafficked. The traffickers would also be examined, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> they are and where they come from. The final part of this paper would then examine whether or not criminological perspectives can be used to explain human trafficking with particular reference to strain theory.

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} social media is shortening {{the distance between}} people. Social activities, e. g., tagging in Flickr, bookmarking in Delicious, twittering in Twitter, etc. are reshaping people’s social life and redefining their social roles. People with shared interests tend to form their groups in social media, and users within the same community likely exhibit similar social behavior (e. g., going for the same movies, having similar political viewpoints), which in turn reinforces the community structure. The multiple interactions in social activities entail that the community structures are often overlapping, i. e., one person is involved in several communities. We propose a novel co-clustering framework, which takes advantage of networking information between users and tags in social media, to discover these overlapping communities. In our method, users are connected via tags and tags are connected to users. This explicit representation of users and tags is useful for understanding group evolution by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> is interested in what. The efficacy of our method is supported by empirical evaluation in both synthetic and online social networking data...|$|E

40|$|It {{is quite}} {{astonishing}} how little {{attention is paid}} to users in the published literature on evaluation. To some extent, this can be explained by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> does evaluation and is prepared to talk about it. Essentially, we find three classes: Researchers or manufacturers concerned with system development: The researchers do not have the re-sources to carry out any systematic enquiry into what a group of users might actually want. The developers mainly come into contact with users through their customer support services. In both cases, when a user is taken into account, it is an abstract, ideal user, whose needs correspond to those the researcher or system developer thinks he would have. Funding agencies, especially, in this context, ARPA: since what they are primarily interested in is the de-velopment of a core technology, evaluation is seen as an assessment of a system’s ability to perform a pre-determined task taken to reflect the barriers the core technology should be attacking. In this perspective, thinking of an ultimate user is premature and irrelevant.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the Nazi Party 2 ̆ 7 s ideals regarding women in Germany from 1933 - 1945.

These stages are, childhood, single adulthood, and finally, motherhood. This paper studies these stages in reverse order. It starts by examining the pedestal that mothers were put on in Nazi Germany before <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>who</b> the ideal woman would have been to be a German mother, and finally how girls were prepared even in childhood {{to grow up to be}} the ideal Nazi woman and mother.
