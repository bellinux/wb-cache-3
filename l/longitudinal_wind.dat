The coarser ash particles fell one to {{two weeks after the}} eruptions, but the finer ash particles stayed in the atmosphere from a few months up to a few years at altitudes of 10 - 30 km. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>winds</b> spread these fine particles around the globe, creating optical phenomena. Prolonged and brilliantly coloured sunsets and twilights were frequently seen in London between 28 June and 2 July 1815 and 3 September and 7 October 1815. The glow of the twilight sky typically appeared orange or red near the horizon and purple or pink above.The estimated number of deaths varies depending on the source. Zollinger (1855) puts the number of direct deaths at 10,000, probably caused by pyroclastic flows. On Sumbawa island, 38,000 deaths were due to starvation, and another 10,000 deaths occurred due to disease and hunger on Lombok island. Petroeschevsky (1949) estimated about 48,000 and 44,000 people were killed on Sumbawa and Lombok, respectively. Several authors use Petroeschevskys figures, such as Stothers (1984), who cites 88,000 deaths in total. However, Tanguy et al.. (1998) claimed Petroeschevskys figures to be unfounded and based on untraceable references. Tanguy revised the number based on Zollinger, who spent several months on Sumbawa after the eruption, and Sir Thomas Raffless notes. Tanguy pointed out {{that there may have been}} additional victims on Bali and East Java because of famine and disease. Their estimate was 11,000 deaths from direct volcanic effects and 49,000 by post-eruption famine and epidemic diseases. Oppenheimer (2003) stated a modified number of at least 71,000 deaths in total. [...] Reid takes note of the total direct and indirect deaths caused beyond Sumbawa, in Bali and elsewhere, and suggests that a figure of perhaps 100,000 deaths is an appropriate estimate.|$|R

In particular, the survey shows that, as expected, the flux excess effect at high latitudes is almost completely absent during sunspot minimum but is almost the same as within the streamer belt at sunspot maximum.

This study presents two different approaches for the demonstration of the damping effect due to wind action on cable-stayed bridge. The fi rst approach uses a simplifi ed analysis method to study the reaction force at the cable end. A beam element was adopted for modelling the cables and a plate element for modelling the bridge’s deck. The second approach {{is based on the}} selected damper system applied at the cable end to determine the reaction response at the bridge models. Two methods are presented in this report with the consideration of bridge geometric effect. The effect of pretension of the cable and the exact treatment of cable sag with the cable weight is ignored.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{turbulence}} spectra and cospectra derived frommore {{than five years}} of eddy-covariance measurements at two urban sites inŁód´z, central Poland. The fast response wind velocity components were obtained using sonic anemometers placed on narrow masts at 37 and 42 m above ground level. The analysis follows Kaimal et al. (Q J R Meteorol Soc 98 : 563 – 589, 1972) who established the spectral and cospectral properties of turbulent flow in atmospheric surface layer {{on the basis of}} the Kansas experiment. Our results illustrate many features similar to those of Kaimal et al., but some differences are also observed. The velocity (co) spectra from Łód´z show a clear inertial subrange with − 2 / 3 slope for spectra and − 4 / 3 slope for cospectra. We found that an appropriate stability function for the non-dimensional dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy calculated from spectra in the inertial subrange differs from that of Kaimal et al., and it can be satisfactorily estimated with the assumption of local equilibrium using standard functions for the non-dimensional shear production. A similar function for the cospectrum corresponds well to Kaimal et al. for unstable and weakly stable conditions. The (co) spectra normalized by their spectral values in the inertial subrange are in general similar to those of Kaimal et al., but they peak at lower frequencies in strongly stable conditions. Moreover, our results do not confirm the existence of a clear “excluded region” at low frequencies for the transition from stable to unstable conditions, for <b>longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>wind</b> components. The empirical models of Kaimal et al. with adjusted parameters fit well to the vertical velocity spectrum and the vertical momentum flux cospectrum. The same type of function should be used for <b>longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>wind</b> spectra because of their sharper peak than occurs for the Kansas data. Finally, it should be stressed that the above relationships are well-defined for averaged values. The results for individual 1 -h periods are very scattered and can be significantly different from the generalized functions.

Therefore, in this contribution, we focused on monitoring the quality of work of a hose reel irrigation machine. For determining the <b>longitudinal</b> uniformity of <b>winding</b> a hose on a reel, {{the development of a}} digital device was necessary. During the development, we had to design its two basic parts – the hardware and software. After construction of the device, its function was tested directly in working conditions of the particular reel hose irrigation machine. The results of our developed device were compared with the results of the Ecostar 4000 (Bauer, Austria) microcomputer, both with the same hose winding speed. On the microcomputer, we set the hose winding speed to + 2. 1 m*h- 1. The average measured value of speed using the first device Speedmeter SM 1 (2000, KSVS) was 11. 7 m*h- 1.

40|$|A helical {{flight path}} {{trajectory}} (helix) involves flying exact circles {{over the ground}} while climbing or descending at a given flight path angle and speed profile. The manoeuvre is challenging to fly in windy conditions, since the path reference is inertial whereas the aircraft naturally tends to move with the air mass. Tracking a helix introduces periodical lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wind</b> shears in turn. This makes the helix an excellent manoeuvre for testing autopilot control laws, allowing to evaluate co-ordination of longitudinal and lateral modes, tracking accuracy along a curved flight path, combined tracking of inertial (flight path) and air mass-based references (airspeed), and to evaluate the trade-off between behaviour in turbulence and wind shear. Since helical flight path trajectories are not a standard option in most autopilot / flight management systems, this chapter derives generally applicable reference variables and high-level control strategies for use with typical autopilot structures.

These preview wind measurements {{can be used in}} feedforward control systems designed to reduce turbine loads. However, the degree to which such preview-based control techniques can reduce loads by reacting to turbulence depends on how accurately the incoming wind field can be measured. Past studies have assumed Taylor’s frozen turbulence hypothesis, which implies that turbulence remains unchanged as it advects downwind at the mean wind speed. With Taylor’s hypothesis applied, the only source of wind speed measurement error is distortion caused by the LIDAR. This study introduces wind evolution, characterized by the longitudinal coherence of the wind, to LIDAR measurement simulations to create a more realistic measurement model.

The wind models, originally developed for the Shuttle program, are based on wind measurements at the NASA 150 -m meteorological tower at Cape Canaveral, FL. The current application is for the design and/or protection of the CLV from wind effects during on-pad exposure during periods from as long as days prior to launch, to seconds or minutes just prior to launch and seconds after launch. The evaluation of vehicle response to wind will influence the design and operation of constraint systems for support of the on-pad vehicle. <b>Longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>wind</b> component time series are simulated at critical vehicle locations. The PSD model for wind turbulence {{is a function of}} mean wind speed, elevation and temporal frequency. Integration of the PSD equation over a selected frequency range yields the variance of the time series to be simulated. The square root of the PSD defines a low-pass filter that is applied to adjust the components of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of Gaussian white noise. The first simulated time series {{near the top of the}} launch vehicle is the inverse transform of the adjusted FFT. Simulation of the wind component time series at the nearest adjacent location (and all other succeeding next nearest locations) is based on a model for the coherence between winds at two locations as a function of frequency and separation distance, where the adjacent locations are separated vertically and/or horizontally. The coherence function is used to calculate a coherence weighted FFT of the wind at the next nearest location, given the FFT of the simulated time series at the previous location and the essentially incoherent FFT of the wind at the selected location derived a priori from the PSD model.

Avoidance responses inside closed houses are slightly smaller than those in the open. Wind responses: A transverse wind elicits a tropic response into the wind, increasing with wind speed. A <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wind,</b> up or down, elicits a transient negative growth response to a step-up in wind speed, and vice versa. It is proposed that all of the effects listed involve wind sensing. This proposal is supported by measurements of aerodynamic effects of barriers and houses on random winds. The wind sensing is discussed in terms of the hypothesis that a gas is emitted by the growing zone (not water or any normal constituent of air), the concentration of which is modified by the winds and monitored by a chemical sensor. This model puts severe constraints on the physical properties of the gas...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} windshear {{identification and}} detection problems by utilizing random process and statistical analysis techniques. A 3 D windshear/turbulence model is developed, which covers {{a broad spectrum}} of windshear situations and can be utilized in the design of optimal and guidance trajectories. The existence of windshear patterns is justified from the analysis of simulated and real wind data. Random processes and their properties are discussed for the design of the correlation signal detectors. Numerical results demonstrate that the detection system is sensitive to the occurrence of a windshear encounter and is robust vis-a-vis noise effects. The results of this thesis make an early windshear detection possible, since computation can be performed onboard in real time. Application of the proposed detection system to the case of Flight Delta 191 leads to the conclusion that a windshear alert could have been issued 31 to 65 sec before impact, {{depending on the type of}} measurement employed in the crosscorrelation detector, specifically: 40 sec before impact for the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wind,</b> 31 sec before impact for the vertical wind, and 65 sec before impact for the total wind. Therefore, if the Lockheed L- 1011 aircraft of Flight Delta 191 had been hypothetically equipped with the present crosscorrelation detector, the pilot could have been warned 65 sec before impact, a time interval more than sufficient to avoid the crash by executing a safe abort landing maneuver...|$|E
40|$|The {{turbulence}} intensity, {{defined as}} the standard deviation of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wind</b> speeds divided by the mean wind velocity, {{is one of the}} important turbulent characteristics in atmospheric boundary layers. In-situ measurements of turbulence intensities above heights of 10. m are, however, limited by the availability of suitable instrumentation. The present study discusses a method to estimate turbulence intensity from the turbulent kinetic Energy Dissipation Rate (EDR) {{through the use of a}} turbulent length scale model. Provided that the EDRs can be extracted directly from raw measurements taken by remote sensing techniques, the proposed method is applicable for estimating the turbulent velocity fluctuations where only remotely sensed EDRs are available. The validity of the proposed method was evaluated in two case studies. When the measurements taken by a Doppler sodar under various weather conditions were adopted to calculate both the longitudinal turbulent velocity fluctuations and to extract the EDRs, the comparisons between the observed and estimated turbulent velocity fluctuations quantitatively show the validity of the proposed method. It has been found that the proposed method is valid when (a) there are no topographic obstacles upstream, (b) the wind speed in a typhoon boundary layer is high enough to make the selected turbulent length scale model applicable and (c) the EDR values are large enough to ignore any noise contained in the EDR data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The Monin-Obukhov {{similarity}} theory (MOST) functions fepsi; and fT, of the {{dissipation rate}} of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), ¿, {{and the structure}} parameter of temperature, CT 2, were determined for the stable atmospheric surface layer using data gathered {{in the context of}} CASES- 99. These data cover a relatively wide stability range, i. e. ¿ = z/L of up to 10, where z is the height and L the Obukhov length. The best fits were given by f¿ = 0. 8 + 2. 5 ¿ and fT= 4. 7 [1 + 1. 6 (¿) 2 / 3], which differ somewhat from previously published functions. ¿ was obtained from spectra of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wind</b> velocity using a time series model (ARMA) method instead of the traditional Fourier transform. The neutral limit f¿ = 0. 8 implies that there is an imbalance between TKE production and dissipation in the simplified TKE budget equation. Similarly, we found a production-dissipation imbalance for the temperature fluctuation budget equation. Correcting for the production-dissipation imbalance, the 'standard' MOST functions for dimensionless wind speed and temperature gradients (Øm and Øh) were determined from f¿ and compared with the Øm and Øh formulations of Businger and others. We found good agreement with the Beljaars and Holtslag [J. Appl. Meteorol. 30, 327 - 341 (1991) ] relations. Lastly, the flux and gradient Richardson numbers are discussed also in terms of f¿ and fT...|$|E
