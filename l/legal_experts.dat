5|$|Sotomayor's {{circuit court}} rulings {{led to her}} being {{considered}} a political centrist by the ABA Journal and other sources and organizations. Several lawyers, <b>legal</b> <b>experts,</b> and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations. In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues. Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints. A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role. Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose. Some <b>legal</b> <b>experts</b> have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.|$|E

The episode included interviews with several gay men, psychiatrists, <b>legal</b> <b>experts</b> and cultural critics, interspersed with footage of a gay bar and a police sex sting. The Homosexuals garnered mixed critical response. The network received praise from some quarters and criticism from others for even airing the program.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's set {{of civil}} laws, the Code Civil—now often {{known as the}} Napoleonic Code—was {{prepared}} by committees of <b>legal</b> <b>experts</b> {{under the supervision of}} Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, the Second Consul. Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts. The development of the code was a fundamental change {{in the nature of the}} civil law legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law. Other codes ("Les cinq codes") were commissioned by Napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law; a Code of Criminal Instruction was published, which enacted rules of due process.|$|E

50|$|There {{may be a}} lack of {{consensus}} over what distinguishes a <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system from a knowledge-based system (also called an intelligent knowledge-based system). While <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems are held to function {{at the level of}} a human <b>legal</b> <b>expert,</b> knowledge-based systems may depend on the ongoing assistance of a human <b>expert.</b> True <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems typically focus on a narrow domain of expertise as opposed to a wider and less specific domain {{as in the case of}} most knowledge-based systems.|$|R
5000|$|SHYSTER is a {{specific}} example of a general category of <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems, broadly defined as systems that make use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to solve legal problems. Legal AI systems {{can be divided into}} two categories: legal retrieval systems and legal analysis systems. SHYSTER belongs to the latter category of legal analysis systems. Legal analysis systems can be further subdivided into two categories: judgment machines and <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems. SHYSTER again belongs to the latter category of <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems. A <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system, as Popple uses the term, is a system capable of performing at a level expected of a lawyer: “AI systems which merely assist a lawyer in coming to legal conclusions or preparing legal arguments are not here considered to be <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems; a <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system must exhibit some legal expertise itself." ...|$|R
5|$|The Weiquan {{movement}} is a non-centralized group of lawyers, <b>legal</b> <b>experts,</b> and intellectuals in China {{who seek to}} protect and defend {{the civil rights of}} the citizenry through litigation and legal activism. The movement, which began in the early 2000s, has organized demonstrations, sought reform via the legal system and media, defended victims of human rights abuses, and written appeal letters, despite opposition from Communist Party authorities. Among the issues adopted by Weiquan lawyers are property and housing rights, protection for AIDS victims, environmental damage, religious freedom, freedom of speech and the press, and defending the rights of other lawyers facing disbarment or imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} El-Sherbini {{immediately}} resulted in international reactions, {{with the most}} vocal responses coming from predominantly Muslim nations. The Egyptian public and media focused attention on the religious and racial hatred aspect of the killing, especially as the initial confrontation between the victim and perpetrator had happened because she wore an Islamic headscarf. In response to anti-German sentiments and public protests in Egypt and other countries, the German government issued a statement of condolence nine days after the incident. Wiens's trial for murder and attempted murder occurred under strict security measures and was observed by national and international media, diplomats and <b>legal</b> <b>experts.</b>|$|E

5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, <b>legal</b> <b>experts</b> conclude that in practice {{it is unlikely}} that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.|$|E

In accordance with the legal suppression, the release was not distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet. Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays will carry a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series is not for sale, distribution or exhibition in Victoria. <b>Legal</b> <b>experts</b> said Victorians who bought the box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, but anyone who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia.

5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) {{had made}} several {{attempts}} {{to create a}} framework for protecting international investments, but its efforts revealed conflicting views on how to provide compensation for the expropriation of foreign direct investment. In 1961, then-General Counsel of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Aron Broches developed {{the idea for a}} multilateral agreement on a process for resolving individual investment disputes on a case by case basis as opposed to imposing outcomes based on standards. Broches held conferences to consult <b>legal</b> <b>experts</b> {{from all parts of the}} world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia, to discuss and compose a preliminary agreement. The IBRD staff wrote an official draft of the agreement and consulted with legal representatives of the IBRD's board of directors to finalize the draft and have it approved. The board of directors approved the final draft of the agreement, titled Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, and the Bank president disseminated the convention to its member states for signature on 18 March 1965. Twenty states immediately ratified the convention. The convention establishing the ICSID entered into force on 14 October 1966.|$|E

40|$|Most <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> systems {{attempt to}} {{implement}} complex models of legal reasoning. Yet {{the utility of}} a <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system lies not in {{the extent to which}} it simulates a lawyer's approach to a legal problem, but in the quality of its predictions and of its arguments. A complex model of legal reasoning is not necessary: a successful <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system can be based upon a simplified model of legal reasoning. Some researchers have based their systems upon a jurisprudential approach to the law, yet lawyers are patently able to operate without any jurisprudential insight. A useful <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system should be capable of producing advice similar to that which one might get from a lawyer, so it should operate at the same pragmatic level of abstraction as does a lawyer—not at the more philosophical level of jurisprudence. A <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system called SHYSTER has been developed to demonstrate that a useful <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system can be based upon a pragmatic approach to the law. SHYSTER has a simple representation structure which simplifies the problem of knowledge acquisition. Yet this structure is complex enough for SHYSTER to produce useful advice. SHYSTER is a case-based <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system (although it has been designed so that it can be linked with a rule-based system to form a hybrid <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system). Its advice is based upon an examination of, and an argument about, the similarities and differences between cases. SHYSTER attempts to model the way in which lawyers argue with cases, but it does not attempt to model the way in which lawyers decide which cases to use in those arguments. Instead, it employs statistical techniques to quantify the similarity between cases. It decides which cases to use in argument, and what prediction it will make, on the basis of that similarity measure. SHYSTER is of a general design: it provides advice in areas of case law that have been specified by a <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> using a specification language. Four different, and disparate, areas of law have been specified for SHYSTER, and its operation has been tested in each of those legal domains. Testing of SHYSTER in these four domains indicates that it is exceptionally good at predicting results, and fairly good at choosing cases with which to construct its arguments. SHYSTER demonstrates the viability of a pragmatic approach to <b>legal</b> <b>expert</b> system design. ...|$|R
