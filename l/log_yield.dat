30|$|The logs {{with the}} highest {{potential}} yield gain could be found among the logs with a low yield when sawing horns down and centered. This indicates that the largest possibilities for optimization lie {{in this type of}} logs. The (negative) correlation between <b>log</b> <b>yield</b> and potential yield gain for all logs was not high enough to draw any definite conclusions, even if it is significant at the 0.05 probability level, but it points in the same direction. The same is true for log age, which had a positive and significant correlation to potential <b>log</b> <b>yield</b> gain. This is reasonable since the product in question had strict rules for dead knots, something which is found more frequently in older trees than in younger ones. This results in a low yield when not controlling the process with full information on knots, which means increased possibility to optimize the process when such information is available. The latter is the case when a CT scanner is used to scan logs and detect knots inside them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Conformance {{checking}} is {{an important}} field in the process mining area. In brief, conformance checking provides us with insights how well a given process model matches a given event log. To gain these insights, we typically try to replay the event log on the process model. However, this replay problem may be complex and, as a result, may take considerable time. To ease {{the complexity of the}} replay, we can decompose the given process model into a collection of (smaller) submodels, and associate a (smaller) sublog to every submodel. Instead of replaying the entire event log on the entire process model, we can then replay the corresponding sublog on every submodel, and combine the results. This paper tests this divide-and-conquer approach on a number of process models and event logs while using existing replay techniques. Results show that the decomposed replay may indeed be faster by orders of magnitude, but that success is not guaranteed, as in some cases a smaller model and a smaller <b>log</b> <b>yield</b> a more complex replay problem. ...|$|E
40|$|This MSc {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. The first part deals with the need for {{information}} from forest campartments selected for clear cutting, in connection with planning in an integrated forest- and sawmill enterprise. A review of literature is followed by a case stud y, where present conditions in a Swedish forest company are compared with current research in the area. The seeond part consists of a simulation stud y, which aims at camparing the accuracy of inventory estimates using different methods. The estimates are delivery forecasts, covering one month consumptian of timber in a large sawmill. The range of inventory designs includes systematic circular plot sampling as well as the use of register data in combination with a data base containing tree data. The results, i. e the forecasts and their standard errors, are presented separately for tree species, log type and diameter class. In many Swedish sawmill campanies of today, there is a trend in productian philosophies towards a greater adaption to customer demands. As a component in this process, the requirements on the flow of raw material will change. The right assortment, of the right quality, must be delivered at the exact right time. Due to the time span between harvest and delivery of timber from the forest, the mills will depend upon adequate forecasts. This implies controlied bucking to meet the demands from the mill, as well as improvment of existing models for predieting <b>log</b> <b>yield</b> from single forest stands. The stand data must allow flexible computerized bucking simulation, allowing adjustment to specific requirements at different points in time, generating prognoses for the distribution of logs into log classes after harves ting. Data used in the models can be collected through forest in ventory or by using stand register data. In the latter case, the diameter distribution must be constructed from the known stand charactaristics, by the use of mathematical models or by assignment from a data base with stem data. It might seem obvious that the information used in the models should be the best possible, but inventory actions are costly. The "total cost" of an inventory consists of two parts, one being the cost of performing the inventory and the other the expected loss, due to inoptimal decisions caused by erroneous data. The optimal solution is given by the minimization of the two components. Customer orientated production in a sawmill might entail great losses, due to lack of precision in prognoses regarding raw material, for products produced in close cooperation with important customers compared to standard products. Thus, different data acquisition policies should be used in stands containing different kinds of timber, to create prognoses adapted to the actual requirements in the industry. The integration between forest management and the sawmill industry, creating a customer oriented flow of raw material, is slowed down because of difficulties in expressing the demands on the raw material - the timber. In addition to this, the ability to forecast <b>log</b> <b>yield</b> is unsufficient, as well as the routines for follow-up between sawmills and forest departments. Large Swedish forest enterprices have the best prospects for overcoming these obstacles, due to large forest holdings as well as a modern sawmill industry. The use of information from forest stands harvested, for adapting the composition of the timber deliveries to the demands from the mills, will constitute a competitive edge for these companies. The development of systems such as computerized bucking control, information technology, including cordless communications, and positioning by satellite, creates the technical apportunities for tailoring the wood flow to customer requirements. Normally, when studying sampling methods for estimating <b>log</b> <b>yield</b> after clear cutting, the results are presented as total volumes of timber for pine and spruce. The results from the stud y indicate that the marginal benefit of sampling 25 sample plats, instead of 10, is small. The standard error of the estimate of total volumes is lowered by only l...|$|E

40|$|An isotopic {{spectrum}} from localized air samples {{has potential}} technical information {{to provide a}} rapid first-order yield estimate of an underground nuclear explosion (UNE) or a simple yes/no detection of a UNE {{in the context of}} On-site Inspection (OSI). The isotopic spectrum is presumed to be derived from environmental air samples near the location of the UNE containing nuclear products from the fission reaction of the explosion. Additionally, a seismic spectrum is derived from the sensed ground motion caused by the coupled energy of the UNE to the earth. A mathematical representation of these two measurements has two essential terms in common—the origin time of the event t 0 and the <b>log</b> <b>yield</b> W = log 10 Y of the explosion (kilotons TNT). A critical component of the mathematical framework for yield estimation from nuclear measurements is the mathematical representation of isotopic gas migration through rock to the air. This research will complete the scientific development leading to a mathematical representation of isotopic gas migration through rock, and validate the mathematics through simulation studies. If successful, this research has the potential to fully enable a rapid, first-order estimate of the yield of a UNE, or UNE yes/no detection in many monitoring settings...|$|E

40|$|Volume {{effects are}} a {{fundamental}} determinant of structural failure. A material exhibits a volume effect if its failure properties {{are dependent on}} the specimen volume. Many brittle ceramics exhibit volume effects due to loading a structure {{in the presence of}} “critical” flaws. The number of flaws, their locations, and the effect of stress field within the stressed volume play a role in determining the structure’s failure properties. Since real materials are imperfect, structures composed of large volumes of material have higher probabilities of containing a flaw than do small volumes. Consequently, large material volumes tend to fail at lower stresses compared to smaller volumes when tested under similar conditions. Volume effects documented in brittle ceramic and composite structures have been proposed to affect the mechanical properties of bone. We hypothesized that for cortical bone material, (1) small volumes have greater yield strengths than large volumes and (2) that compared to microstructural features, specimen volume was able to account for comparable amounts of variability in yield strength. In this investigation, waisted rectangular, equine third metacarpal diaphyseal specimens (n = 24) with nominal cross sections of 3 × 4 mm and gage lengths of either 10. 5, 21, or 42 mm, were tested monotonically in tension to determine the effect of specimen volume on their yield strength. Yield strength was greatest in the smallest volume group compared to the largest volume group. Within each group of specimens the logarithm of yield strength was positively correlated with the cumulative failure probability, indicating that the data follow the two-parameter Weibull distribution. Additionally, <b>log</b> <b>yield</b> strength was negatively correlated with log volume, supporting the hypothesis that small stressed volumes of cortical bone possess greater yield strength than similarly tested large stressed volumes...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} {{investigated}} profitability {{of a small}} stand of fast-grown Eucalyptus nitens in Canterbury for sawn timber production. This stand was pruned and thinned and then harvested at 15 years old. An estimate of per-hectare <b>log</b> <b>yields</b> and diameters was made from the stand. Sample logs were sawn, dried and profiled, then products quantified. Log prices were estimated using the residual value method. Prices were summed for sawn products from each log, from which processing expenses and sawmill profit were deducted for an estimate of log value. In the absence of market prices for sawn E. nitens products empirical estimates of price were derived from market survey data. Predictive models were produced from estimated stand <b>log</b> <b>yields</b> along with predicted product revenues and processing costs from sample logs. These were used for estimating per-hectare log residual values from the case study stand trees. Financial returns to the grower were then calculated as discounted cash flows from the estimated log residual values per hectare, taking into account grower costs along with harvesting and transport costs. Best-practice processing methods were identified from the literature and applied as a productivity benchmark. Methods were developed with the view to standardising data across research efforts that seek to improve grade recoveries for E. nitens. A range of factors were investigated that potentially influenced E. nitens log residual value in this case study, including log diameter and log position. Outcomes included a reasonably favourable return on investment for the grower. However, this depended {{on a number of}} factors such as land price, distance from processor, product prices, grading methods, drying methods and level of sawmill profit.

40|$|The {{factors of}} quality which affect the sawing yield were {{researched}} for poplar plantations, from {{the aspect of}} the application of national standards for roundwood. The research was performed in the period 2002 - 2003 on two temporary sample plots, in poplar plantations Populus×euramericana I- 214 aged 25 years. The sample plots were selected depending on the clone species, planting pattern, and plantation flood risk, and branch pruning. The analyzed quality factors are: knots, minimal dimensions, sweep, false heart, ovality and tapering. The measured data were processed according to the original methodology. Based on the study results, the significance of quality factors was ranked in two different stand situations. Of all the study factors, knots have the highest effect on <b>log</b> <b>yield,</b> which is especially significant in marking for cross cutting of the larger trees. The sweep of trees in poplar plantations with higher flood risk is greater compared to the sweep of trees in plantations which are in the zone protected from floods. In poplar plantation Populus×euramericana I- 214 which is exposed to frequents flooding (OP- 2), sweep is the third significant factor, compared to the plantation protected from floods (OP‑ 3), where sweep is the fifth factor according to significance. The effect of sweep in the plantation exposed to flooding is 2. 4 {{times higher than the}} effect of sweep in the plantation protected from floods. Total value of the assortments made of tree trunk grows with the increase of tree diameter on both sample plots.

Rank correlations of sire and cow evaluations from the three models were close to unity. Ranks of top sires were similar, but differences in ranks of top cows were large across the three models. A model accounting for heterogeneous variances at several production levels is feasible if variance estimates are available. If heterogeneity of variances are ignored, untransformed yields should be used instead of <b>log</b> transformed <b>yields...</b>|$|R
40|$|Process-aware Information Systems {{typically}} log events (e. g., in transaction logs or audit trails) {{related to}} the actual business process executions. Proper analysis of these execution <b>logs</b> can <b>yield</b> important knowledge that can help organizations {{to improve the quality}} of their services. Starting from a process model, which can be discovered by conventional process mining algorithms, we analyze how data attributes influence the choices made in the process based on past process executions. Decision mining, also referred to as decision point analysis, aims at the detection of data dependencies that affect the routing of a case. In this paper we describe how machine learning techniques can be leveraged for this purpose, and we present a Decision Miner implemented within the ProM framework...|$|R

In addition to the traditional unit root tests, we split the data into 10 -year segments and use frequency domain analysis to test {{for the presence of}} unit roots in the dividend yield data. The results strongly suggest the existence of bubbles in both the US and Finnish markets. Finally we develop a novel dividend yield-based method to track periods when stock prices divert their fundamental levels. This indicator produces promising results, as it seems to have some forecasting ability concerning booms and busts in the stock markets. equity price; bubble; rolling ADF...|$|R
50|$|Also {{during that}} Winter and at Pirson's request, Cook built {{a model of}} an oil well with an {{electric}} <b>logging</b> system. This <b>yielded</b> data and curves which Prof. Pirson felt should be published, so Cook wrote Laboratory Tests of Electrolog Resistivity Interpretation, {{which was published in}} The Producers Monthly. On the strength of that research Pirson nominated Cook for membership in Sigma Xi, the national research honorary, in which Cook remained a lifelong member.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 There are {{a number}} of wood {{properties}} which affect the quality of forest products such as lumber and pulp. Of these, wood density is considered by some to be the single most important physical characteristic because it is an excellent predictor of strength, stiffness, hardness, and paper-making capacities. Accurately assessing density in real-time can be a challenge for log supply managers wanting to segregate logs into different product classes based on density. Mechanized harvesting machines are frequently fitted with computer technology and rudimentary sensor systems for measuring external stem dimensions. Research into technologies for measuring stem quality attributes is progressing on a number of fronts with varying levels of success. Some of these scanning technologies could be integrated into the design of mechanized harvesting systems. In this dissertation: •	It is shown how Douglas-fir wood density can be predicted from near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy measurements of chain saw chips, ejected as a stem is cut into logs by a mechanized harvester, •	it is provided an analysis of the potential use of NIR technology for log segregation based on wood density, •	it is presented a general methodology to estimate log prices of Douglas-fir based on the net return obtained when logs of different wood density classes are processed and converted into end products (lumber and pulp), •	it is demonstrated how wood density could be included in optimal bucking procedures, and •	it is analyzed the effect of market requirements for density on <b>log</b> <b>yields,</b> total volume and revenue from a representative sample of Douglas-fir stems. New sensor technologies are likely to lead to measurement, segregation and supply of a wider range of wood properties for forest product markets...|$|R
