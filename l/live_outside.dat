5|$|After BC {{became a}} Canadian {{province}} in 1871, Crease devoted {{the next few}} years to fighting for judicial independence—specifically the right of judges to <b>live</b> <b>outside</b> their districts. In 1881 the BC Supreme Court, including Crease, ruled in the Thrasher case that the province's attempts to regulate judges were unconstitutional. This decision was overturned two years later by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E

In 2014, Marinković's sentence was reduced to three years on appeal. Four other men were indicted in relation to the officers' mistreatment, but all four <b>live</b> <b>outside</b> Croatia, and are not subject to prosecution by the Croatian judiciary.|$|E

5|$|Wright rarely played <b>live</b> <b>outside</b> of Pink Floyd {{compared}} to the other members. Along with Gilmour, he played in 1970 on Barrett's second solo album, Barrett, and helped with its production. He later recalled working on the album as a way of helping Barrett in any way possible. He guested at a concert by Sutherland Brothers & Quiver in 1974 at Newcastle Polytechnic.|$|E
5|$|Writer Rhianna Pratchett {{has said}} that the game's story {{examined}} why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal choices were very limited. It also looked at reasons people might have for attempting to <b>live</b> <b>outside</b> the system and what could result from this. The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between what George Orwell described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.|$|E

5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{described}} as an outcaste and impure. Her association with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities, considered to be polluted in Hindu society. These social groups deal in occupations deemed inauspicious and polluted like collection of waste, meat-processing and working in cremation grounds. In a Nepali context, such groups are collectively called Matangi, who collect waste—including human waste—and other inauspicious things, and often <b>live</b> <b>outside</b> villages. Thus she is associated with death, pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society.|$|E

5|$|On 22 May 1957 the BBC {{produced}} a <b>live</b> <b>outside</b> broadcast from the railway, during which Wynford Vaughan Thomas and Huw Weldon commentated {{on a trip}} from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500passengers carried, and this increase in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience. The following year locomotive No.1 Talyllyn returned to steam after an extensive overhaul.|$|E

5|$|The Labour Party {{rejected}} the line, stating {{that they did}} not want any transport that made it easier to <b>live</b> <b>outside</b> the municipal boundary, to keep tax money within the municipality. The final permission from Oslo City Council was granted after a vote with 49 to 35 in May 1913. Concession from the ministry was granted from Sjømannsskolen to Ljan on 7 October, and from Oslo Hospital to Sjømannsskolen on 11 December. On 5 June 1914, permission was granted where the concession was transferred from Thune-Larsen and Helliesen to the company Ekebergbanen, which was founded on 27 March 1914. The company received a share capital of NOK850,000, later increased to 2.5 million. Engineer Jørgen Barth became the first director.|$|E
5|$|Thedas is a {{world in}} which race and class combine to {{determine}} social class. Elves are often viewed as second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are treated with respect. Mages, on the other hand, are cloistered by the Chantry: they have access to the Fade, the unconscious realm that is the home of spirits, and a single lapse in vigilance could cause them to be possessed by demons. Apostate mages, who <b>live</b> <b>outside</b> the Chantry's control, are considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them by any means necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what it once was before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.|$|E
5|$|Cats who <b>live</b> <b>outside</b> of the Clans {{are split}} into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander {{into the forest}} to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
