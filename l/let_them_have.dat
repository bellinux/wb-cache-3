The following month it enacted the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which provided for the retirement or dismissal of all Jewish civil servants, along with political opponents of the government. As a veteran of the First World War, Franck was exempt, but he submitted his resignation anyway on 17 April 1933. He once commented that science was his God and nature was his religion.

500|$|From the West, Vivekananda revived {{his work}} in India. He {{regularly}} corresponded with his followers and brother monks, offering advice and financial support. His letters from this period reflect his campaign of social service, and were strongly worded. He wrote to Akhandananda, [...] "Go from door to door amongst the poor and lower classes {{of the town of}} Khetri and teach them religion. Also, <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> oral lessons on geography and such other subjects. No good will come of sitting idle and having princely dishes, and saying [...] "Ramakrishna, O Lord!"—unless you can do some good to the poor". In 1895, Vivekananda founded the periodical Brahmavadin to teach the Vedanta. Later, Vivekananda's translation of the first six chapters of The Imitation of Christ was published in Brahmavadin in 1889. Vivekananda left for India on 16 December 1896 from England with his disciples Captain and Mrs. Sevier and J.J. Goodwin. On the way they visited France and Italy, and set sail for India from Naples on 30 December 1896.

500|$|Although ensconced with Chávez and his entourage, Bartley and ÓBriain felt a {{disconnect}} from {{the events of}} the outside world. During a [...] "chaotic" [...] road-trip with Chávez, they [...] "knew something was coming", and divined that Chávez's trip was intended to bolster his support and [...] "get people used to being on the streets". Chávez had recently [...] "upped the ante" [...] with the introduction of the Land Law. Increasing tensions further, in February 2002, Chávez took control of PDVSA; the private media stepped up its criticism of Chávez, which for Bartley and ÓBriain [...] "marked the beginning of an exciting phase". By April 2002, Bartley and ÓBriain were in Caracas and spent much of their time filming at the presidential palace, following Chávez and his staff. As the 11April crisis unfolded, Bartley and ÓBriain filmed outside the palace, first capturing footage of the demonstrations and subsequent violence, then events inside the palace during the afternoon, evening and early hours of 12April. Through their previous contacts at the palace, Bartley and ÓBriain were able to continue filming without interference: [...] "no one paid any attention to us—we just blended in." [...] Later that day, Bartley and ÓBriain stayed away from the palace through fears for their safety. Unable to leave the country—the international airport was closed—the filmmakers instead took to the streets, [...] "to document the repression [...] were witnessing". At the same time, a press office cameraman was in the palace, [...] "reluctant to lose his job despite the change in government". He filmed the formation of the interim government. When Bartley and ÓBriain returned to the palace on 13April, the cameraman <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> his footage. They remained filming in Venezuela until July 2002, interviewing residents and recording [...] "witness" [...] accounts from those who had been present during the coup—ministers, security guards and journalists.|$|E
