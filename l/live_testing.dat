After a total blackout of the Public Grid in the Netherlands, the restoration process shall start with so-called black-start units. To increase {{the probability that the}} re-energizing of the Public Grid indeed succeeds, the Dutch transmission system operator obliges units to prove their black-start capability by performing a <b>live</b> <b>test.</b> A crucial step in the re-energizing of the Public Grid is the energizing of large transformers. Problems can be expected due to the inrush current of the transformers. For one such generating unit extended simulations of the inrush phenomena of the transformers and calculation of inrush currents and overvoltages were performed. Based on the simulation results well-founded decisions were made on the most suitable start-up procedure. The simulations were followed by <b>live</b> <b>tests</b> of the black-start procedure...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{researchers}} took it {{upon themselves}} to serve as crash test dummies. Colonel John Paul Stapp USAF propelled himself over 1000km/h on a rocket sled and stopped in 1.4 seconds. Lawrence Patrick, then a professor at Wayne State University, endured some 400 rides on a rocket sled in order to test the effects of rapid deceleration on the human body. He and his students allowed themselves to be smashed in the chest with heavy metal pendulums, impacted in the face by pneumatically driven rotary hammers, and sprayed with shattered glass to simulate window implosion. While admitting that it made him [...] "a little sore", Patrick has said that the research he and his students conducted was seminal in developing mathematical models against which further research could be compared. But while data from <b>live</b> <b>testing</b> was valuable, human subjects could not withstand tests which went past a certain degree of physical injury. To gather information about the causes and prevention of injuries and fatalities would require a different kind of subject.|$|E

The three most stable systems were then deployed “live ” with real callers. This paper presents the results of the <b>live</b> <b>tests,</b> and compares them with the control test results. Results show considerable variation both between systems and between the control and <b>live</b> <b>tests.</b> Interestingly, relatively high task completion for controlled tests did not always predict relatively high task completion for <b>live</b> <b>tests.</b> Moreover, even though the systems were quite different in their designs, we saw very similar correlations between word error rate and task completion for all the systems.

50|$|Efforts in the United States soon shifted towards {{developing}} miniaturized Teller-Ulam {{weapons that}} could easily outfit intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. By 1960, with the W47 warhead deployed on Polaris ballistic missile submarines, megaton-class warheads were as small as 18 inches (0.5 m) in diameter and 720 pounds (320 kg) in weight. It was later found in <b>live</b> <b>testing</b> that the Polaris warhead did not work reliably {{and had to be}} redesigned.

50|$|Due to the {{inability}} to perform <b>live</b> <b>testing</b> on earth, research is focused primarily on computational modeling of such a system. It was previously mentioned that the specific impulse {{could be as high}} as or higher than 3000 s. However, results of computational modeling point towards this number being somewhat optimistic. When thermal hydraulics were modeled more completely for a typical base injection stabilized recirculation bubble gas core rocket by D. Poston, the specific impulse dropped from >3000 s to <1500 s. In the base injection stabilized recirculation bubble gas core rocket concept, it is thought that some additional method of fuel confinement will be beneficial. As mentioned earlier, relying completely on magnetic containment of the fuel bubble is not yet practical. However, a magnetic field may be able to assist in containment or help suppress turbulence that would lead to fuel-propellant mixing.|$|E
