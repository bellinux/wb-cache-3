Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia. Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( [...] BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in lung collagen content, and decreased <b>lung</b> <b>compliance.</b> A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to document the pathophysiologic changes induced by pneumothorax, and to evaluate the benefit of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to treat pneumothorax. Forty-six ASA physical status I and II patients scheduled for laparoscopic fundoplication were monitored extensively; heart rate, mean arterial pressure, end-tidal CO 2 (PETCO 2), oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (Spo 2), minute ventilation, tidal volume, dynamic total <b>lung</b> thorax <b>compliance,</b> and airway pressures were recorded. In 25 patients, oxygen uptake, CO 2 elimination and arterial blood gases were also measured. Pneumothorax was diagnosed in seven patients. It resulted in the following pathophysiologic changes: decrease in total <b>lung</b> thorax <b>compliance,</b> increase in airway pressures, and increase in CO 2 absorption. Consequently, PACO 2 and PETCO 2 also increased. Spo 2, however, remained normal. The use of PEEP largely corrected these respiratory changes. None of these pneumothoraces required drainage. These data suggest that pneumothorax is common during laparoscopic fundoplication. Early diagnosis is possible by simultaneous monitoring of PETCO 2, total <b>lung</b> thorax <b>compliance,</b> and airway pressures.

Since the applied input pressure to the lungs is, in general, nonnegative and cannot be arbitrarily large, as not to damage the lungs, a sliding mode control with bounded nonnegative control inputs is proposed. The controller only uses output information (i. e., the total volume of the lungs) and automatically adjusts the applied input pressure so that the system is able to track a given reference signal in the presence of parameter uncertainty (i. e., modelling uncertainty of the lung resistances and <b>lung</b> <b>compliances)</b> and system disturbances. Controllers for both matched and unmatched uncertainties are presented. Specifically, a Lyapunov-based approach is presented for the stability analysis of the system and the proposed control framework is applied to a two-compartment lung model to show the efficacy of the proposed control method.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{framework}} for determining optimal respiratory airflow patterns for a multicompartment lung mechanics system with nonlinear resistance and compliance parameters. First, a nonlinear multicompartment lung mechanics model that accounts for nonlinearities in both the airway resistances and the <b>lung</b> <b>compliances</b> is developed. In particular, {{we assume that the}} resistive losses are characterized by a Rohrer-Type model with resistive losses defined as the sum of linear and quadratic terms of the airflow. The proposed model is more realistic than those presented in the literature, since it takes into account the heterogeneity of lung anatomy and function as well as the nonlinearity of <b>lung</b> resistance and <b>compliance</b> parameters. This model can be used to provide a better understanding of pulmonary function as well as the process of mechanical ventilation. Next, using the proposed nonlinear multicompartment lung model, we develop {{a framework for}} determining optimal respiratory airflow patterns. Specifically, an optimization criterion that involves the minimization of the oxygen consumption of the lung muscles and lung volume acceleration for the inspiratory phase, and the minimization of the elastic potential energy and rapid airflow rate changes for the expiratory phase is formulated and solved. The solution to the formulated optimization problem is derived using classical calculus of variation techniques. Finally, several illustrative numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed nonlinear multicompartment lung model and the corresponding optimal airflow patterns. Comparison with experimental data shows that our nonlinear resistance model predicts the airflow patterns more accurately than linear resistance models. Moreover, the optimization criterion used in this paper also provides a more accurate prediction of the optimal airflow patterns.

30|$|Driving {{pressure}} was {{inversely proportional to}} compliance of respiratory system and had two common definitions: the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP {{and the difference between}} peak inspiratory pressure and PEEP [21]. There was no study compared different modes of ventilation during ECMO, and pressure-controlled mode appears to be advocated [12]. With pressure-controlled ventilation, pressure is maintained constant throughout inspiration, and flow decreases during inspiration and is often followed by a period of zero flow at end inspiration. Peak inspiratory pressure and peak alveolar pressure (plateau pressure) may be equal during no flow status [22]. Therefore, we used the difference between peak inspiratory pressure and PEEP as calculation of “dynamic” driving pressure. In fact, the most correct form can be obtained using transpulmonary driving pressure by esophageal manometry, but {{it is not easy to}} use in clinical practice. Reduction in dynamic driving pressure were found after ECMO initiation, and the values of survivors continued decreasing and exhibited significantly lower than nonsurvivors until day 7 (Fig.  2). Better <b>lungs</b> <b>compliance</b> and larger proportion of recovered functional lung size could have benefitted the survivors. Manipulation of driving pressure could be applied for ventilator management beside by adjusting the tidal volume and PEEP [18].
