5|$|The seat of Ayyubid {{government}} from Saladin's rule from the 1170s up to al-Adil's reign in 1218 had been Damascus. The city provided a strategic {{advantage in the}} constant war with the Crusaders and allowed the sultan {{to keep an eye}} on his relatively ambitious vassals in Syria and al-Jazira. Cairo was too remote to serve as a base of operations, but had always served as the economic foundation of the empire. This rendered the city a critical constituent in the repertoire of the Ayyubid possessions. When Saladin was proclaimed sultan in Cairo in 1171, he chose the Fatimid-built Lesser Western Palace (part of a larger palace complex in Cairo isolated from the urban sprawl) as the seat of government. Saladin himself resided in the former Fatimid vizier palace, Turan-Shah took up a former Fatimid prince's <b>living</b> <b>quarter,</b> and their father occupied the Pearl Pavilion which was situated outside of Cairo overlooking the city's canal. The successive Ayyubid sultans of Egypt would live in the Lesser Western Palace.|$|E

Yet, there is evidence of organized communal arrangements, a man-made water reservoir (3.5m x 1.4 m surface, 1.5 m depth, and 8 cubic meters volume); a stone basin for grinding grain by hand; and two well-like openings, probably used for retrieval and storage of water. The grotto contains two main rooms: a large <b>living</b> <b>quarter</b> and the grave-yard room.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1810s Alexander I invited Menelaws to {{redesign}} the Alexander's Park in Tsarskoye Selo, starting {{with an old}} dilapidated menagerie. The new plan proposed by Menelaws created an illusion of a completely novel design, yet carefully preserved {{the structure of a}} regular park shaped in the previous century; according to Lvov, Menelaws [...] "merged the art of Kent and Le Nôtre". Menelaws designed and built 12 structures, including the Egyptian Gates and three park pavilions: the large Arsenal (1819–1834) built on the site of Mon Bijou built by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1750s, the White Tower (1821–1827), a house for the young Grand Dukes and the Chapel (1825–1828), a folly providing <b>living</b> <b>quarter</b> to the palace chaplain. Use of an eclectic, pan-European romanticism was justified {{as a symbol of the}} New Europe shaped at the Congress of Vienna, but was also a sign of Alexander's turn to mysticism. Alexander's Park was occupied by Nicholas I, then heir presumptive, who also leaned to eclecticism and medieval legacy, as would be evidenced later by his reign.|$|E
