40|$|A three-step {{experimental}} design {{has been carried}} out to add evidence about the existence of the RN gene, with two segregating alleles RN- and rn+, having major effects on meat quality in pigs, to estimate its effects on production traits and to map the RN locus. In the present article, the experimental population and sampling procedures are described and discussed, and effects of the three RN genotypes on growth and carcass traits are presented. The RN genotype had no major effect on growth performance and killing out percentage. Variables pertaining to carcass tissue composition showed that the RN- allele is associated with leaner carcasses (about 1 s. d. effect without dominance for back fat thickness, 0. 5 s. d. effect with dominance for weights of joints). Muscle glycolytic potential (GP) was considerably higher in RN- carriers, with a maximum of a 6. 85 s. d. effect for the live longissimus muscle GP. Physico-chemical characteristics of meat were also influenced by the RN genotype in a dominant way, ultimate pH differing by about 2 s. d. between homozygous genotypes and meat colour by about 1 s. d.

In the first trial 40 pigs of the initial body weight of 55 kg were used. Animals were homogeneously allocated to two groups: a control group traditionally fed and a clinoptilolite group in which feed contained the additive at 2 %. Pigs were slaugh- tered at about 160 kg body weight. Blood samples were taken to determine blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In the second trial a total of 116 piglets from 12 litters was used. Six litters were fed from the 7 th day of life a diet containing clinoptilolite at 2 %. According to the dietary treatment of the suckling period, 84 weaned piglets were homogeneously allocated to two groups fed up to 33 kg body weight a diet containing or not clinoptilolite at 2 %. In both trials daily weight gain, feed intake and pigs’ health were regularly recorded. The dietary inclusion of clinoptilolite at 2 % did not resulted in any modification either of growing performances or of uraemia. Piglets on clinoptilolite diet showed a significant (P< 0. 05) improvement of faecal dry matter content.

40|$|A {{vast array}} of both {{resources}} and cattle breeds are available for beef production in the United States. Although feeding concentrates has provided for a relatively high degree of uniformity in the growing-finishing segment of beef production, resources used for cow-calf production have remained {{and will continue to}} remain very diverse. In the United States, stocking rates range from one cow per 2 acres or less to only one cow per 300 or 400 acres because of differences in climate, land, and feed resources. The germ plasm base for beef cattle production in North America was broadened considerably during the 1970. s, primarily, {{as a result of the}} introduction of new breeds of European origin made possible by the development of appropriate quarantine facilities and procedures by Agriculture Canada. The newly introduced breeds, in addition to those already available, provide a wide range of performance characteristics in beef cattle. In 1969, the Roman L. Hruska U. S. Meat Animal Research Center implemented a program to characterize a broad range of biological types of cattle as represented by breeds that differ widely in characteristics such as growth rate, carcass composition, mature size and milk production level.

40|$|Richmond Ltd. has {{recently}} undergone {{a change in}} strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An {{example of this is}} converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i. e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i. e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50 °C myosin (45 % to 50 % of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60 °C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70 °C actomyosin (22 % of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation {{is due to the fact}} that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i. e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62 °C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65 °C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7 D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62 °C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62 °C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65 °C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N. Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e. g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> <b>fat</b> <b>ratio,</b> not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i. e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i. e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75 mm racks frenched 25 mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i. e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected...|$|E

40|$|Overweight {{and obesity}} have reached {{epidemic}} proportions and appetite control {{may be important}} for its clinical management. Leptin is a plasma protein secreted from adipose tissue that is involved in body weight regulation. The role of leptin in regulating human appetite is not well established. Human feeding studies report that an increased dietary carbohydrate <b>to</b> <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> is associated with increased circulating leptin concentrations compared to a decreased dietary carbohydrate <b>to</b> <b>fat</b> <b>ratio.</b> These investigations have generally used diets with extreme variations in macronutrient intake that do not represent normal patterns of consumption.

The overall aim of this research was to determine the potential clinical relevance of the effects of altering the dietary carbohydrate <b>to</b> <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> on circulating leptin concentrations. Methods: Three short-term controlled human feeding studies were conducted involving 68 female subjects (age 37 - 9 (SD) yrs, BMI 26. 8 - 4. 1 kg/m 2). Study 1 and Study 2 were single-blind parallel design trials where realistic high carbohydrate (carbohydrate:fat= 60 : 20) or high fat (carbohydrate:fat= 40 : 40) iso-caloric diets were provided. Study 3 was a double-blind cross-over trial where high carbohydrate (carbohydrate:fat= 60 : 20) and extreme high fat (carbohydrate:fat= 25 : 55) diets were provided. The primary outcomes were fasting leptin concentrations and subjective satiety measured on a multi-dimensional and single-dimension visual analogue scales. In Study 3 ad libitum intake was also assessed at a post-intervention buffet breakfast. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyse the effect of the intervention diets over time on the outcome measures. Results: There was no between group difference in fasting leptin concentrations when realistic high carbohydrate and high fat controlled diets were consumed in Study 1 and Study 2 (p 3 ̆e 0. 4). This finding was similar when leptin concentrations were adjusted for body composition. Within subjects, changes in recent dietary carbohydrate and fat intake predicted a decrease in leptin concentrations during the intervention, but effects were small.

40|$|What is {{the ideal}} milk {{composition}} for cheese manufacture? How close is Wisconsin milk to that ideal, {{and how does it}} compare with milk from other leading dairy states? What can Wisconsin’s dairy farmers and cheese processors do to ensure that milk produced in the state improves the state’s cheese industry from farm to wholesale product? These questions are addressed in this report, which supports Rethinking Dairyland leaflet No. 7. WHAT COMPOSITION AND QUALITY OF MILK DO CHEESE PROCESSORS NEED? The ideal milk for making a whole milk cheese, e. g. Cheddar, would contain 14 - 15 percent total solids and have a casein-to-fat ratio of about 0. 7. This would typically be milk with about 4. 2 percent fat and about 3. 6 percent true protein. Few, if any, cows produce milk of this composition. So cheese makers standardize their milk using a variety of processes. Fat content may be reduced through cream separation. Solids content may be increased through vacuum pasteurization or by adding additional nonfat milk solids to the raw milk in the form of condensed skim milk, nonfat dry milk or ultrafiltered milk concentrate. Basically, the two main ingredients of milk that a cheese maker needs are casein and fat. The amount of fat {{that can be used in}} a cheese make procedure is limited by the amount of casein present <b>to</b> hold the <b>fat</b> in a stable system. Thus, the casein <b>to</b> <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> is a critical one determining the cheese making potential of a milk supply. The final composition of a cheese will dictate what amount of casein and <b>fat</b> are required <b>to</b> make that cheese.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry to measure milk ketone bodies to detect hyperketonemic cows and compare this method with milk <b>fat</b> <b>to</b> protein <b>ratio</b> to detect hyperketonemia. Plasma and milk samples were obtained weekly from calving to wk 9 postpartum from 69 high-producing dairy cows. The reference test for hyperketonemia was defined as plasma concentration of ß-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) = 1, 200 µmol/L. The weekly prevalence of hyperketonemia during the first 9 wk of lactation was, on average, 7. 1 %. Both BHBA and acetone in milk, determined by FTIR, had a higher sensitivity (80 %) to detect hyperketonemia compared with milk <b>fat</b> <b>to</b> protein <b>ratio</b> (66 %). Specificity was similar for the 3 diagnostic tests (71, 70, and 71 %). In conclusion, FTIR predictions of BHBA or acetone in milk can detect cows with hyperketonemia in early lactation with a higher accuracy compared with the use of milk <b>fat</b> <b>to</b> protein <b>ratio.</b> Because of the high proportion of false-positive tests, there are concerns about the practical applicability of FTIR predictions of acetone, BHBA, and <b>fat</b> <b>to</b> protein <b>ratio</b> in milk to detect hyperketonemic cows...|$|R

40|$|Estimates of the {{repeatability}} and heritability of 19 {{measures of}} performance in Jersey cows were obtained using an animal {{model with a}} relationship matrix and a derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood algorithm. The data consisted of 935 records for 374 cows by 69 sires over the period 1969 - 1987. The estimates {{were similar to those}} obtained by ordinary least squares methods reported for the same data set and in other studies, but had smaller error variances. A likelihood ratio test showed agreement between these heritability estimates and those in the literature. The heritability estimates of milk, fat, protein, lactose-mineral, solids-not-fat, and total solids yields were about 0. 25; for the corresponding percentages, and for the protein <b>to</b> <b>fat</b> and solids-not-fat <b>to</b> <b>fat</b> <b>ratios,</b> the estimates were 0. 50. Heritability estimates were 0. 10 or less for the time from parturition to first breeding and for three measures of somatic cell counts. These estimates of heritability in a dairy cattle population in a subtropical environment were not different from those of populations in temperate climates...|$|R

This was conducted through a chart review of orders and notes from a midwest teaching hospital. The {{results showed that}} MRs prescribed on average 300 NPC more than RDs (n= 102, SD ± 651. 136, t = 4. 45, df = 93, p = < 0. 001). Additionally, despite recommendations from the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, MRs prescribe more macronutrients for obese patients and less macronutrients for normal and underweight patients when compared to RDs (PRO: F (3, 95) = 3. 39, p = 0. 021; NPC: F (3, 95) = 6. 22, p = 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} increasing dietary polyunsaturated fat intake on fat absorption in Crohn's patients, normal subjects and subjects with inactive Crohn's disease consumed a high polyunsaturated <b>to</b> saturated <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> diet. Subjects participated in breath tests before and {{after six months of}} a high polyunsaturated <b>to</b> saturated (P/S) <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> diet <b>to</b> measure their response to [1 - 13 C] 10 : 0 and [1 - 13 C] 16 : 0 ingested with a test meal. Whole body absorption-oxidation of C 10 : 0 was not affected by the diet treatment. Before diet treatment, whole body absorption-oxidation of C 16 : 0 in Crohn's patients was 80 % of that observed for control subjects. After consuming a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet, subjects increased oxidation of C 16 : 0 by 85 % compared to before the diet treatment period. It is concluded that (1) absorption of labelled C 16 : 0 from a test meal is reduced in Crohn's patients, and (2) consumption of a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet improves the utilization of dietary C 16 : 0 by Crohn's patients...|$|R

In addition, the association between circulating sex hormones and body fat distribution in premenopausal women is debated. METHODS: Blood was drawn from 20 patients with PCOS and compared with 15 controls, matched for body mass index and age. Regional fat distribution was assessed using dual x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with PCOS had a higher trunk <b>to</b> extremity <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> (T/E <b>fat),</b> were more insulin resistant (higher homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and lower SHBG concentrations), and had higher levels of highly sensitive C-reactive protein...|$|R

40|$|Changes in the {{genotypic}} {{structure of}} cows, yield of milk, fat and protein, fat and protein content of milk, relationships between milk components, i. e. the protein <b>to</b> <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> (PFR) {{and the difference}} between fat and protein content (DFP) were examined using data from the Polish Federation of Cattle Breeders and Dairy Farmers for 2001 – 2009. In addition, analysis was made of changes in the length of calving interval and age at first calving. Average yield of milk and its components was found to increase in all milk recorded cows. Changes in the relationship between basic milk components differed between the breeds. A decrease in fat content was found in the milk from Polish Black-and-White Holstein-Friesian, Jersey, Montbeliarde and Polish Red-and-White cows, and an increase in protein content was recorded in the milk from Polish Black-and-White Holstein-Friesian, Polish Red-and-White, Simmental and Montbeliarde cows. These changes had a favourable effect on the PFR ratio in Polish Holstein-Friesian cows, especially those of the Black-and-White variety. Calving interval and age at first calving were found to increase in all the cows except the Montbeliarde breed...|$|R
