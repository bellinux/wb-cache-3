Farmers {{in the area}} also opine that yams grown with mineral fertilizers tend to have shorter shelf life than those grown without mineral fertilizers.

The selected (wound-free and about similar size) tubers were stored in a shaded but well ventilated traditional barn. Weight loss from tubers of eleven cultivars (ten cultivars were developed at IITA and the 11 th one was a local best, Cv. Nwopoko.) of white yam (Dioscorea rotundata) was monitored monthly for six months following harvest in November at Nsukka, southeastern Nigeria. The tubers were from plots that received 15 : 15 : 15 NPK fertilizer mixture and those that did not receive any fertilizer.

40|$|Context: In {{pancreatic}} cancer, {{the presence}} of obesity or weight loss is associated with higher mortality. Objectives: To explore the relationships among body mass index, longitudinal body composition alterations, and clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients. Methods: Records of 41 patients with inoperable locally advanced pancreatic cancer who participated in a prospective chemoradiation study were reviewed. Body composition was analyzed from two sets of computed tomography images obtained before and after radiation treatment (median interval 104 days). Results: Median age was 59 years and 56 of patients were female. Twenty-four (59) patients were either overweight (22) or obese (37). Sarcopenia was present in 26 (63) patients. At follow-up, weight loss was experienced by 33 (81) patients. The median losses () before and after treatment were weight 5 (P < 0. 001), skeletal muscle (SKM) 4 (P = 0. 003), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) 13 (P < 0. 001), and subcutaneous adipose tissue 11 (P = 0. 002). SKM loss positively correlated with age (P = 0. 03), baseline body mass index (P < 0. 001), and VAT (P = 0. 04) index. Obese patients experienced higher <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> (P = 0. 009), SKM (P = 0. 02), and VAT (P = 0. 02). Median survival was 12 months. In univariate analysis, age, baseline obesity, sarcopenic obesity, and <b>losses</b> () <b>in</b> <b>weight,</b> SKM, and VAT were associated with worse survival. In multivariate analysis, only age (hazard ratio = 1. 033, P = 0. 04) and higher VAT loss (hazard ratio = 2. 6 and P = 0. 03) remained significant. Conclusion: Our preliminary findings suggest that obese patients experience higher <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight,</b> SKM, and VAT, which may contribute to poorer survival in these patients.

The quality of guava fruits was observed in terms of physiological <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight,</b> acidity, firmness, ascorbic acid and total soluble solids. In all the treatments; physiological <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> increased with storage duration, intensity and duration of vibration, where as ascorbic acid and firmness decreased with increasing storage period.
