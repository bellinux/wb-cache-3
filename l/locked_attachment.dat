40|$|A {{particle}} cassette for a needleless syringe is provided, {{the manufacture}} of which avoids the potentially detrimental use of heat when affixing a final membrane to the cassette or otherwise sealing the cassette after a filling procedure has been carried out. The particle cassette is assembled using first and second cassette parts that are attachable together so as to create a chamber for the confinement of particles between two membranes. A third cassette part {{may be used to}} provide for a <b>locking</b> <b>attachment</b> of the first and second parts. A kit of parts for use in {{the manufacture of}} a particle cassette is also provided, as is a method of assembling a particle cassette. In certain cassette embodiments, {{one or both of the}} first and second cassette parts can be annular, tapered and/or have detents or recesses to provide for a snap fit...|$|R
5000|$|There is also [...] "an {{upstream}} connected {{frangible disc}} safety relief device" [...] {{located on the}} valve assembly which {{is also known as}} the [...] "tri-dimensional burst disk". This burst disk protects the user against a situation where the pressure in the bottle would increase with exposure to heat during a fire. It prevents unwanted failures somewhere else in the bottle. It is set to release at 7200 psi, or 400 °F. It is [...] "tri-dimensional" [...] in that, if it is activated, it would disperse the air from the bottle in three directions so as not to throw the user off his or her balance. The high pressure male coupling, included in high pressure bottle connections, is set to met the Compressed Gas Association Standards #346 and #347.Also included in the assembly are the dual-sided pressure gauge (which reads the cylinder pressure directly from the cylinder), elastomeric bumper (a protective, rubber like stop), and hangar plate (for positive <b>locking</b> <b>attachment</b> of the assembly to the backframe).|$|R
50|$|The Miracle of Love {{teaches that}} this {{material}} plane of existence {{is one of}} duality, with inevitable pain, suffering, and death, to which we are <b>locked</b> by our <b>attachments,</b> and these attachments cause us to be reborn in a cycle of reincarnation.|$|R
2500|$|The Vortex Flash Hider is a flash {{suppressor}} made by Smith Enterprise {{and has been}} called the [...] "most effective flash hider available short of a (sound) suppressor" [...] by writer and gunsmith Patrick Sweeney, when used on an AR-15. The Vortex made for AR-15 type rifles weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 inches in length and does not require a <b>lock</b> washer for <b>attachment</b> to the barrel.|$|R
40|$|The current {{situation}} regarding self-ligating brackets is reviewed. Recent developments, clinical advantages, and remaining imperfections are described. The question of active versus passive ligation is scrutinized. The evidence regarding treatment efficiency is reviewed. Suggested clinical tips and changes of treatment mechanics are summarized and illustrated. Self-ligating brackets {{have reached a}} stage of design and production control, where the advantages are significantly greater than the remaining imperfections. Index words: Clinical tips, self-ligation, treatment effectiveness. Introduction and history Self-ligating brackets have an inbuilt metal labial face, which can be opened and closed. Brackets of this type have existed for a surprisingly long time in orthodontics — the Russell <b>Lock</b> edgewise <b>attachment</b> being described b...|$|R
50|$|The Vortex Flash Hider {{made for}} AR-15 type rifles weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 {{inches in length}} and {{does not require a}} <b>lock</b> washer for <b>attachment</b> to the barrel of an AR-15. The use of a lock washer or crush washer was {{rejected}} as their use can increase visible flash from the shooter's perspective. The Vortex is tightened by hand and repeated firing of the rifle causes the Vortex to tighten to the barrel.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{clinically}} oriented course, {{which covers}} topics {{that were not}} included in the basic courses of both removable partial denture fabrication and complete denture fabrication. Topics including denture repairs, overdentures, implant supported dentures, single dentures, and combination case will be covered on the complete denture side of the course. Topics on the removable partial denture side of the course will include rotational path removable partial dentures, swing <b>lock</b> and precision <b>attachment</b> removable partial dentures, as well as repair and maintenance phase information...|$|R
40|$|The RFID Door Lock is a lock that {{is simple}} {{to install and}} allows the user to easily lock and unlock doors. It will contain a RFID reader/writer and a {{magnetic}} door lock for simple use. All the user will need is an RFID tag {{to be able to}} unlock and lock the door. A LED will be used to let the user know when the door is in fact locked. The components included in the module are small and compact. Additionally, the door lock is simple and easy to install. It does not require the consumer to disassemble the door or doorframe as the door <b>lock</b> are merely <b>attachments.</b> This is also leaves the consumer with the option of using their original lock and key if they so choose. All in all, this RFID door lock should be a simple and cost effective upgrade to the average consumer’s security and convenience...|$|R
5000|$|Sako {{accessories}} for the TRG system {{includes an}} auxiliary iron sights for emergency use, a muzzle brake/flash-hider, a match sight mounting set, a telescopic sight mounting sets, a STANAG 2324 (Picatinny rail), an accessory ITRS tri-rail (top) and accessory rail (bottom) TRG forestock, a night sight adapter, a sound suppressor, a muzzle thread protector, various slings and swivels, cleaning kits, soft case, and a heavy-duty transit case. Several versions of TRG-specific bipods were produced that all <b>lock</b> into an <b>attachment</b> {{point in the}} aluminium bedding block {{at the end of}} the forestock. The latest bipod version is one of a few rifle bipods that lets the rifle swivel or [...] "hang" [...] just above its bore axis offering a more stable shooting position with large and heavy aiming optics mounted. It has a narrower leg angle due to complaints that the previous version interfered with some night vision systems mounted forward of the telescopic sight. Further versions of accessories are the ITRS tri-rail NV attachment point with an optional extended aluminium bedding block. This extended bedding block also can feature an optional STANAG 2324 Picatinny rail in the bottom of the block.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design an {{elevating}} legrest for a wheelchair that will improve circulation in the user’s legs by allowing the knees to be straight when the legrest is in the elevated position, and the hips and upper legs to be stationary. Individuals with Spinal Bifida, Cerebral Palsy, and Muscular Dystrophy need the assistance of mobility devices such as a wheelchair to enable their independence. These wheelchairs need to provide proper support for comfort and need to allow the individual to reposition one’s self in the chair. Changing one’s position on the wheelchair is necessary for facilitating circulation in the limbs and decreasing the under-leg soreness. The design team began by creating functional requirements for the device and analyzing the fundamental governing equations. Three preliminary designs were then generated for each aspect of the device: motion of the legrest, user interface, <b>locking</b> mechanism, and <b>attachment</b> mechanism. Analyses of these design concepts through prioritization of functional requirements and creation of design matrices produced a final design. The device fits on the chair and matches the arc of legs within a 13 - 17 inch range. Adjustments to the pivot location can be made vertically and horizontally at 1 / 8 ” intervals, which will accommodate the use of various sized cushions and different femur lengths between users. The pivot adjustment can work for knee locations differing by as much 3 inches, both vertically and horizontally. The team concluded by suggesting few improvements for the device such as: introducing a new material to reduce the friction between the upper and the lower section of the legrest, developing a new locking mechanism that increases the degree of leg flexion, etc...|$|R
