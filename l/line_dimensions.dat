50|$|Clock {{signals are}} {{typically}} loaded {{with the greatest}} fanout and operate at the highest speeds of any signal within the synchronous system. Since the data signals are provided with a temporal reference by the clock signals, the clock waveforms must be particularly clean and sharp. Furthermore, these clock signals are particularly affected by technology scaling (see Moore's law), in that long global interconnect lines become significantly more resistive as <b>line</b> <b>dimensions</b> are decreased. This increased line resistance {{is one of the}} primary reasons for the increasing significance of clock distribution on synchronous performance. Finally, the control of any differences and uncertainty in the arrival times ofthe clock signals can severely limit the maximum performance of the entire system and create catastrophic race conditions in which an incorrect data signal may latch within a register.|$|E

40|$|With systems {{operating}} at higher frequencies, parasitic effects are taking larger {{shares of the}} voltage and timing budget of a circuit. Also smaller devices have shrunken landscape for components, increasing coupling between critical physical features. These undesired loading on otherwise uniform transmission lines introduce impedance discontinuities which degrades signal quality and strains the performance metrics. This paper introduces a concept of compensating coupling effects by modifying transmission line physical characteristics.

A new second leaky wave has been revealed in addition to the dominant bound and leaky waves known up to now. The evolution of its dispersion characteristics in dependence on the <b>line</b> <b>dimensions</b> is presented. Possible excitation of this new leaky wave brings down the upper cut-off frequency of pure bound wave propagation. Consequently the new leaky wave associated with simultaneous leakage into two surface waves can significantly deteriorate circuit performance, especially in the mm-wave band.

40|$|Motivation: Reverse Logistics {{is part of}} {{the concept}} of Sustainable Supply Chain Management, which is the supply chain {{consideration}} of the economic, environmental and social goals of all the stakeholders. These considerations should be balanced in a so-called Triple Bottom Line approach. However, literature approaching the social aspects is almost inexistent and the Triple Bottom Line approach is not common when examining the supply chain problems. The study focuses on companies operating in the Swedish market, since the country is an example in many TBL aspects. Moreover, the study is limited to the fashion apparel industry due to its high amount of returns.   Objectives: The {{purpose of this study is}} to explain how Reverse Logistics in the fashion industry can contribute to the social dimension of Triple Bottom Line, as well as to identify the tools and strategies used by the fashion companies to balance the trade-offs between the Triple Bottom <b>Line</b> <b>dimensions</b> in the context of Reverse Logistics and explain the reasons behind the decisions.   Approach: This is a multiple case study of six companies. Both primary (semi-structured interviews) and secondary (corporate reports and websites) sources were used to collect data. The empirical data was analyzed using pattern matching, first each case individually and thereafter cross-case analyses were performed.   Conclusions: The social contribution of Reverse Logistics in the fashion industry is mainly limited to donations to charity. In addition, it is not focused on the workforce, as suggested by the literature. Regarding the trade-offs in Triple Bottom Line, most of the fashion firms do not recognize them in the context of Reverse Logistics. Therefore, companies do not need to prioritize the Triple Bottom <b>Line</b> <b>dimensions</b> or use tools to balance them...|$|E

Our findings suggest that government intervention plays a dominant role in governing the supply chain firms’ behaviors in the context of environmental and public health sustainability.

The analysis is applied to study the effect of technology scaling using ITRS data, wherein the effects of increasing interconnect (Cu) resistivity with <b>line</b> <b>dimensions</b> and the effect of a finite barrier metal thickness have been included. Finally, we have also quantified the reliability implications for minimum sized vias in optimally buffered signal nets.

30|$|The {{stress levels}} {{resulting}} due to mismatch in CTE {{can also lead}} to hillock formation, a stress-induced diffusional relaxation process, during the IC fabrication process (Timma et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2001). After depositing capping nitride material at above 380  °C two hillock formation modes were observed: (i) grain boundary sliding mode leading to single grain extrusion hillock and (ii) diffusion dominated hillock formation mode leading to smaller hillocks (Timma et al. 2010). Post nitride hillocks preferentially nucleate at the triple junction of the grain boundary. It is believed that interface Cu/TaN diffusion dominates diffusion mechanism at smaller <b>line</b> <b>dimensions</b> compared to grain boundary diffusion (Timma et al. 2010). The hillocks can be potential area for localized peaks in electric field which can result in early failure by dielectric breakdown. Even though copper has same CTE in all the directions, the anisotropy in elastic moduli of copper leads to development of different stress levels in adjacent grains in turn promoting grain boundary sliding potentially leading to hillock formation.|$|E
40|$|Clock routing is {{critical}} in nano-scale VLSI circuit design. Clock routing needs to be precise to minimize circuit delay. Clock signals are strongly affected by technology scaling, the long global interconnect lines become highly resistive as <b>line</b> <b>dimensions</b> are decreased. The control of clock skew can also severely limit the maximum performance of the entire system and create catastrophic race conditions in which an incorrect data signal may latch within a register. Thus, we propose a clock routing synthesis module that applies non-zero skew (or called useful-skew) method to reduce the system-wide minimum clock period to improve the performance of synchronous digital circuit. We implemented Useful-Skew Tree (UST) algorithm {{which is based on}} the deferred-merge embedding (DME) paradigm, as the clock layout synthesis engine. The synthesis module is integrated with the UTM in-house design graph accelerator to enhance the computation performance. The novel contribution of this work is clock skew scheduling is performed simultaneously with clock tree routing. This way, the computation result of proposed synthesis module can generate a clock signal distribution routing path with minimum wire length and, ensures the reliability of data synchronization for nano-scale VLSI design...|$|E
