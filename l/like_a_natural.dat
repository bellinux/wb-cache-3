A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 TCB, a band {{based in}} the Washington area, created a spinoff sound from go-go called bounce beat. Bounce beat is a heavier version of its {{ancestor}} that relies on timbales, drums, keyboards and bass to form its signature sound. At a time when bands like Backyard, UnCalled 4, and Raw Image were moving the genre toward a more driving sound by using a more forceful “breakdown” beat, bounce beat seems, in retrospect, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> progression. Still, the music was initially dismissed by all but a core of believers. It took fans time to realize TCB’s innovation wasn’t a rejection of “traditional” go-go, but a shift. Instead of paying homage to the genre’s early greats by copying their style, bounce beat built on a strong foundation and showed that the music still had more ideas to explore, limited only by percussive innovation and imagination. Fans of bounce beat, like the sound itself, tend to be much younger than the traditional go-go crowd. The rototom-dependent subgenre was initially maligned—some called it “noise,” others argued that it wasn’t go-go at all. Criticism of bounce beat was similar to what was said about the trap rap bubbling in other cities around the same time: It was blasted for its sometimes suggestive lyrics, its thwacking beat, its tempos that vacillated between syrupy and frenetic. But over time, bounce beat made inroads.|$|E

500|$|To {{address these}} {{business}} concerns, an aspect weaver enables {{the use of}} widely adopted languages like Java with aspect-oriented programming through minor adaptations such as AspectJ which work with existing tools. Instead of developing an entirely new language, the aspect weaver interprets the extensions defined by AspectJ and builds [...] "woven" [...] Java code which can then be used by any existing Java compiler. This ensures that any existing object oriented code will still be valid aspect-oriented code and that development will feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> extension of the object-oriented language. The AspectC++ programming language extends C++ through the use of an aspect weaver, offering the additional efficiency over AspectJ that is necessary for embedded systems while still retaining the benefits of aspect-oriented programming.|$|E

During the very much talked about performance, singer-songwriter Carole King {{had been watching}} Carey perform, taking interest in her and her material. One year later, during the recording sessions for Carey's second studio album, Emotions (1991), King contacted Carey, asking if she {{would be interested in}} covering [...] "(You Make Me Feel <b>Like)</b> <b>A</b> <b>Natural</b> Woman", a song she had written alongside Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. Carey declined, feeling uneasy about covering a song one of her musical influences executed so perfectly. Still determined to work with Carey, King flew out to New York City for one day, in hopes of writing and composing a ballad of some sort. Throughout the day, the two songwriters exchanged musical ideas and melodies on the piano until [...] "If It's Over" [...] came into conception. In an interview following the collaboration, King said the following regarding Carey: [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." ...|$|E

The Aulic Council disagreed {{on account of the}} Danube River splitting the forces of Charles and his brother John. [...] They instead suggested that the main attack should be launched south of the Danube so as to maintain safer communications with Vienna. [...] In the end, they had their way, but not before precious time had been lost. The Austrian plan called for the Bohemian corps, the I under Bellegarde, consisting of 38,000 troops, and the II of 20,000 troops under Kollowrat, to attack Regensburg (Ratisbon) from the Bohemian mountains by way of Cham, the Austrian center and reserve, comprising 66,000 men of Hohenzollern's III, Rosenberg's IV, and Lichtenstein's I Reserve Corps, to advance on the same objective through Scharding, and the left wing, made up of the V of Archduke Louis, Hiller's VI, and Kienmayer's II Reserve Corps, a total of 61,000 men, to move forward toward Landshut and guard the flank.|$|E

500|$|Several other {{candidates}} arrived in Cincinnati with delegates pledged to them. [...] Former Representative Henry B.

In April 1880, the New York Star published a tale that Tilden had bowed {{out of the race}} and instructed the Irving Hall faction to back Payne for the presidency. Tilden never confirmed the rumor, but after his letter of June 1880 to the New York delegation, many of his supporters did consider Payne among their likely choices. [...] Payne, like Bayard, had served on the Electoral Commission of 1876, but had nevertheless maintained Tilden's friendship. He maintained his loyalty to Tilden until the convention, when his withdrawal was certain. [...] Payne was hindered by a fellow Ohioan, Senator Allen G. Thurman, who controlled their home state's delegation. Thurman looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> successor to Tilden, as a popular conservative from a swing state with a background as an attorney, but he, like Bayard, had earned Tilden's enmity by serving on the Electoral Commission. Thurman was also less wedded to the gold standard than some Northeastern delegates would tolerate.|$|E

500|$|Numerous reviewers {{commented on}} Morgan's writing and story. In The Seattle Times, {{journalist}} and science fiction author Nisi Shawl tied the writing {{quality to the}} action scenes, [...] "Morgan's talent for tension-building is matched by the clarity with which he describes the sideswiping, rubber-burning, rear-end-ramming, full-contact racing scenes. And both these skills are quietly eclipsed by his word-for-word writing ability. Apt metaphors and similes abound." [...] However, science fiction critic Robert K. J. Killheffer, in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, wrote [...] "it's not his best – it lacks the dense and evocative background of his Takeshi Kovacs books, and Morgan is not as sure-handed with near-future situations and characters – but it takes chances and largely succeeds." [...] Likewise, in the San Francisco Chronicle the reviewer wrote [...] "In its present form, the novel feels bloated and obvious, despite the sharpness of the descriptive writing {{and a couple of}} first-rate fight sequences. With the right artist, Market Forces might still make a compelling—and necessarily shorter—graphic novel." [...] The Library Journal review ended with a recommendation: [...] "Morgan's sf suspense belongs in most sf collections." [...] The reviewer in Booklist concluded [...] "It's not a particularly pleasant future, but Morgan paints it in broad strokes, drawing us into his future world and making it feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> outgrowth of today's corporate chicanery. The novel might have been unremittingly bleak if it weren't for the moral center provided by Faulkner, who is a genuinely likable guy. Fans of Morgan's gritty, noirish brand of sf will ﬂock to this one." ...|$|E

5000|$|The binding of a bsMab to {{its target}} antigens {{can lead to}} a variety of effects.

Catumaxomab, one of the first trifunctional antibodies approved for therapeutic use, binds both CD3 on cytotoxic T cells and EpCAM on human adenocarcinomas. The Fc region additionally binds to a cell that expresses Fc receptors, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> macrophage, <b>natural</b> killer cell or dendritic cell. Since the Fc region is still intact, this allows for the bsMab to trigger common immune responses when recognized by an Fc receptor, such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity.|$|R
500|$|For Japan, the {{war began}} with the {{undeclared}} war and invasion of China in 1937, which the Japanese authorities called [...] "The China Incident". The government dispatched a [...] "pen brigade" [...] to write and film the action in China with [...] "humanist values". Tomotaka Tasaka's Mud and Soldiers (1939) for instance, shot on location in China, Kōzaburō Yoshimura's Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, and Sato Takeshi's Chocolate and Soldiers (1938) show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes fighting bravely. Once war with the United States was declared, the Japanese conflict {{became known as the}} Pacific War. Japanese film critics worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed to represent native Japanese values. The historian John Dower found that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as [...] "losers do not get reruns", yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought Chocolate and Soldiers unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking officers, not samurai, calmly devoted to his men and his country. These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred, though Great Britain could figure as the [...] "cultural enemy". For Japanese film-makers, war was not a cause but more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> disaster, and [...] "what mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies, especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as an [...] "innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people". Dower comments that the perversity of this image [...] "is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others." ...|$|E

[...] The publication as well pointed out that [...] " [...] does sound empowered, even if it doesn't sound especially dangerous {{for her in the}} wake of her 2014 collaboration 'Love Me Harder' with The Weeknd." [...] Writing for Idolator, Robbie Daw, Carl Williot and Mike Wass reviewed [...] "Dangerous Woman" [...] during their [...] "Pop Perspective" [...] article, with Daw calling it [...] "one walk of danger worth taking", Williot praising her vocal performance and highlighting the [...] "clever little flip of '(You Make Me Feel <b>Like)</b> <b>A</b> <b>Natural</b> Woman'", and Wass naming it a [...] "decent song" [...] but noting that [...] " [...] still hasn't found her own lane." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy praised Grande's vocals, describing as [...] "angelic" [...] and completed writing it [...] "almost sound too pure over the seductive guitar line and prowling beat, which threatens to blindfold you and tie up your wrists within one listen.". Reviewing the album with the same name, the editor from Sputnikmusic described the song as [...] "the first moment that the album really shows flashes of becoming something special," [...] and continued, [...] "as it sways to a seductive beat that feels like it was extrapolated from the most revealing scene of a James Bond film."

500|$|Additionally, {{aside from}} the three men, Carey worked with Carole King, a female singer-songwriter who had been {{predominantly}} popular in the 1970s.

After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly. Still determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to try to create a ballad of some sort. The two ladies sat together by a piano {{over the course of the}} day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled [...] "If It's Over." [...] After working with Carey, King said in an interview [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." [...] After recording [...] "If It's Over," [...] Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory. When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him, and begin singing different notes and tunes she was thinking of, while he would follow her with the piano. In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as [...] "very unique," [...] and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies. While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and Clivillés proved different; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and key.|$|E
