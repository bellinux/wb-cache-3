5|$|Bacteria, often <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria,</b> such as Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, in {{combination}} with yeasts and moulds, {{have been used for}} thousands of years in the preparation of fermented foods, such as cheese, pickles, soy sauce, sauerkraut, vinegar, wine and yogurt.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> have {{a useful}} role in {{winemaking}} converting malic acid to lactic acid in malolactic fermentation. However, after this function has completed, the bacteria {{may still be}} present within the wine, where they can metabolise other compounds and produce wine faults. Wines that have not undergone malolactic fermentation may be contaminated with <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria,</b> leading to refermentation of the wine with it becoming turbid, swampy, and slightly effervescent or spritzy. This can be avoided by sterile filtering wine directly before bottling. <b>Lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> can also be responsible for other wine faults such as those below.|$|E

25|$|Sorbate {{is often}} used as a yeast-inhibitor by home winemakers to stop {{alcoholic}} fermentation {{in the production of}} sweet wines.

25|$|Sorbic acid is a {{winemaking}} additive used {{often in}} sweet wines as a preservative against fungi, bacteria and yeast growth. Unlike sulfur dioxide, {{it does not}} hinder {{the growth of the}} <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In the European Union, the amount of sorbic acid that can be added is limited — no more than 200mg/l. Most humans have a detection threshold of 135mg/l, with some having a sensitivity to detect its presence at 50mg/l. Sorbic acid can produce off flavors and aromas which can be described as “rancid”.

40|$|The {{fermentation}} of {{the batter}} of idli, a fermented food of India, was studied.

In the later stages of fermentation, growth of Streptococcus faecalis and, still later, of Pediococcus cerevisiae becomes significant. The fermentation of idli demonstrates a leavening action caused by the activity of the heterofermentative <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacterium,</b> L. mesenteroides.

25|$|LAB (<b>Lactic</b> <b>Acid</b> <b>Bacteria)</b> were {{classified}} and grouped {{in the early}} 1900s after gaining scientists' attention after observing the bacteria's interactions in different foods, especially dairy products.

40|$|Xanthomonas albilineans is a {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} leaf scald disease in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) This disease causes {{the death of}} seedlings and consequently results in economic losses for sugarcane growers. The objective of this work was to isolate a <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacterium</b> with antimicrobial activity against X. albilineans from sugarcane crops and to evaluate its antimicrobial activity and its <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> production kinetics, biomass yield, and substrate consumption in three different fermentation substrates. To isolate the <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacterium,</b> samples were collected {{from different parts of}} infected and non-infected sugarcane plants of var. CC 85 - 92. Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis was isolated from the leaves of healthy crops, and showed in vitro antimicrobial activity against the pathogen. Batch fermentations of this isolate (at 32 °C, agitation of 100 rpm, and pH 6) were performed using a commercial substrate (MRS), a commercial substrate supplemented with glucose (MRSG), and a substrate produced from agricultural crop residues (ACR). The highest antimicrobial activity was 5. 83 mm in the ACR substrate after 6 h of fermentation. The maximum biomass production of 3. 37 g L- 1 and the maximum <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> production of 12. 1 g L- 1 were obtained in the MRSG substrate. The <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> production did not show any significant differences between the substrates.

25|$|<b>Lactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>bacteria</b> are fastidious {{organisms that}} cannot {{synthesize}} {{on their own}} all of their complex nutritional requirements.
