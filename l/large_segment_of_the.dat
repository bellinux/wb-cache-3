5|$|Rosenberg {{traveled}} from San Francisco to Hawaii, possibly on a whaler, arriving in Oahu sometime before December 1886. At that time, Hawaii was a predominantly Christian kingdom; Christian missionaries had successfully converted a <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population after traditional Hawaiian religion was suppressed by the monarchy. In the 1880s, however, King Kalākaua encouraged {{the revival of}} Hawaiian traditions, hoping to inspire nationalistic sentiment. He revived traditional Hawaiian music and dance, including hula, and observed some practices of Hawaiian religion. Kalākaua became a powerful king, unconstrained by political factors.|$|E
5|$|The city {{started to}} lose its {{importance}} under the reign of Maria Theresa's son Joseph II, especially after the crown jewels were taken to Vienna in 1783 {{in an attempt to}} strengthen the union between Austria and Hungary. Many central offices subsequently moved to Buda, followed by a <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nobility. The first newspapers in Hungarian and Slovak were published here: Magyar hírmondó in 1780, and Presspurske Nowiny in 1783. In the course of the 18th century, the city became a centre for the Slovak national movement.|$|E

5|$|Dozens {{of birth}} control clinics opened across the United States during the 1920s, but not without incident.Robinson, Caroline Hadley (1930), Seventy Birth Control Clinics, Williams and Wilkins (70 clinics in U.S. and Britain by 1930, cited by Kennedy, p. 291). In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing {{contraceptive}} information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled that use of contraceptives to space births farther apart was a legitimate medical treatment that benefited {{the health of the}} mother. The trial, in which many prominent physicians served as witnesses for the defense, brought a <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medical community onto the side {{of birth control}} advocates.|$|E
5|$|Industrial belts within Greater Dhaka {{is a major}} {{manufacturing}} hub, {{bounded by}} the Buriganga, Meghna, Dhaleshwari, Balu and Turag Rivers. The city has a growing middle class, driving the market for modern consumer and luxury goods. Restaurants, shopping malls and luxury hotels continue to serve as vital elements in the city's economy. The city has historically attracted numerous migrant workers. Hawkers, peddlers, small shops, rickshaw transport, roadside vendors and stalls employ a <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population – rickshaw-drivers alone number as many as 400,000. Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganised labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. The unemployment rate in Dhaka was 23% in 2013. Dhaka has improved congestion and inadequate infrastructure; the national government has recently implemented a policy for rapid urbanization of surrounding areas and beyond {{by the introduction of}} a ten-year relief on income tax for new construction of facilities and buildings outside Dhaka.|$|E

5|$|In 634 CE Gaza was {{besieged by}} the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As {{following}} the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It {{was captured by}} Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by 'Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, although its Byzantine garrison was massacred. The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city), which was later rebuilt by Sultan Baibars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century, a <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population swiftly adopted Islam, Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i religious code, {{one of the four}} major Sunni Muslim schools of law (fiqh). Security, which was well-maintained during early Muslim rule, was the key to Gaza's prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain wine production, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported mainly to Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the Vietnam War a <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American {{population}} came to be opposed to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. Public opinion steadily turned against the war following 1967, and by 1970 only a third of Americans believed that the U.S. had not made a mistake by sending troops to fight in Vietnam. During the late-1960s opponents of the war turned to teach-ins and street protests, such as those at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and the 1969 Vietnam Moratorium, in an effort to turn U.S. political opinion.|$|E

25|$|A {{native of}} central Vietnam, Thi was the {{commander}} of I Corps, which oversaw the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam and the 1st and 2nd Divisions. He was known to have the “deep rooted” loyalty of his soldiers. A <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Vietnamese military was the Regional and Popular Forces, which were militias who served in their native areas, and they appreciated a commander with a regionalistic rapport. The support from the Buddhists, his troops, and the regional tendencies gave Thi a strong power base and made it hard for the other generals and the Americans to move against him.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} three other major {{projects}} on the table.

If these two projects are completed, then the Belgrano Norte Line would be the only diesel line to run through the city. The third and most ambitious is to build a series of underground tunnels between three of the city's railway terminals with a large underground central station underneath the Obelisk, connecting all the commuter railway lines in a network dubbed the Red de Expresos Regionales.|$|E
25|$|Limited amateur radio {{operations}} have occurred, using moon bounce or Earth–Moon–Earth communication, in which radio signals {{aimed at the}} Moon are reflected back to Earth. The first of these operations was on June 13–14, 1964, using the call KP4BPZ. A dozen or so two-way contacts were made on 144 and 432MHz. On July 3 and July 24, 1965, KP4BPZ was again activated on 432MHz, making approximately 30 contacts on 432MHz during the limited time slots available. For these tests, a very wide-band instrumentation recorder captured a <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receiving bandwidth, enabling later verification of other amateur station callsigns. These were not two-way contacts. From April 16–18, 2010, again, the Arecibo Amateur Radio Club KP4AO conducted moon-bounce activity using the antenna.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the example}} of the Prophet, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz sent out emissaries to China and Tibet, {{inviting}} their rulers to accept Islam. It was during the time of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz that Islam took roots and was accepted by a <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population of Persia and Egypt. When the officials complained that because of conversions, the jizya revenues of the state had experienced a steep decline, Umar wrote back saying that he had accepted the Caliphate to invite people to Islam and not to become a tax collector. The infusion of non-Arabs in large number into the fold of Islam shifted the center of gravity of the empire from Medina and Damascus to Persia and Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Ham, {{founder and}} chief {{executive}} officer of the Young Earth creationist (YEC) ministry Answers in Genesis (AiG), challenged Nye, a science educator best known for hosting the 1990s television series Bill Nye the Science Guy, to the debate after taking exception to a YouTube video featuring Nye lamenting the refusal of a <b>large</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. population to accept the theory of evolution. Tickets to the event sold out within minutes, and according to a Christian public relations firm an estimated 3 million people viewed the event live via video streams on the Internet.
