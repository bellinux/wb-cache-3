60|$|I have, in conclusion, {{to relate}} an {{incident}} I onco witnessed, and {{which does not}} show the Monedula in a very amiable light. I was leaning over a gate watching one of these wasps feeding on a sunflower. A small <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>bee</b> was hurrying about with its shrill busy hum in the vicinity, and in due time came to the sunflower and settled on it. The Monedula became irritated, possibly at the shrill voice and bustling manner of its neighbour, and, after watching {{it for a few}} moments on the flower, deliberately rushed at and drove it off. The leaf-cutter quickly returned, however--for bees are always extremely averse to leaving a flower unexplored--but was again driven away with threats and demonstrations {{on the part of the}} Monedula. The little thing went off and sunned itself on a leaf for a time, then returned to the flower, only to be instantly ejected again. Other attempts were made, but the big wasp now kept a jealous watch on its neighbour's movements, and would not allow it to come within several inches of the flower without throwing itself into a threatening attitude. The defeated bee retired to sun itself once more, apparently determined to wait for the big tyrant to go away; but the other seemed to know what was wanted, and spitefully made up its mind to stay where it was. The leaf-cutter then gave up the contest. Suddenly rising up into the air, it hovered, hawk-like, above the Monedula for a moment, then pounced down on its back, and clung there, furiously biting, until its animosity was thoroughly appeased; then it flew off, leaving the other master of the field certainly, but greatly discomposed, and perhaps seriously injured about the base of the wings. I was rather surprised that they were not cut quite off, for a <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>bee</b> can use its teeth as deftly as a tailor can his shears.|$|E
6000|$|Doubtless to bees, as to men, revenge is {{sweeter than}} honey. But, {{in the face}} of mental science, can a {{creature}} as low down in the scale of organization as a <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>bee</b> be credited with anything so intelligent and emotional as deliberate anger and revenge, [...] "which implies the need of retaliation to satisfy the feelings of the person (or bee) offended?" [...] According to Bain (Mental and Moral Science) only the highest animals--stags and bulls he mentions-can be credited with the developed form of anger, which, he describes as an excitement caused by pain, reaching the centres of activity, and containing an impulse knowingly to inflict suffering on another sentient being. Here, if man only is meant, the spark is perhaps accounted for, but not the barrel of gunpowder. The explosive material is, however, found in the breast of nearly every living creature. The bull--ranking high according to Bain, though I myself should place him nearly on a level mentally with the majority of the lower animals, both vertebrate and insect--is capable of a wrath exceeding that of Achilles; and yet the fact that a red rag can manifestly have no associations, personal or political, for the bull, shows how uniutcllectual his anger must be. Another instance of misdirected anger in nature, not quite so familiar [...] .as that of the bull and red rag, is used as an illustration by one of the prophets: [...] "My heritage is unto me as a speckled bird; the birds round, about are against it." [...] I have frequently seen the birds of a thicket gather round some singularly marked accidental visitor, and finally drive him with great anger from the neighbourhood. Possibly association comes in a little here, since any bird, even a small one, strikingly coloured or marked, might be looked on as a bird of prey.|$|E

5000|$|Most Anthidium {{species are}} <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>bees</b> who use conifer resin, plant hairs, earth, or a {{combination}} of these as material for the nest walls. Their abdominal bands are usually interrupted in the middle. There is no lobe (arolium) between their claws. Anthidium manicatum is commonly known as the wool carder bee which uses comblike mandibles to [...] "comb" [...] plant fibers into its brood cell walls. It has spread from Europe to North and South America. The males are much larger (ca. 18 mm) than the females (ca.12 mm) which is not uncommon among Megachilidae, but very rare among other bee families (e.g., the true honey bees, genus Apis). The males also have three [...] "thorns" [...] at their abdominal apex which they use as weapons when defending their territory.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAs {{with most}} solitary bees, larvae of the alfalfa <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>bee,</b> Megachile rotundata Fab., eat a diet blended from pollen and nectar of unknown proportions. In this study, we {{developed}} protocols to isolate and quantify sugars from larval provision masses. The method removed {{free amino acids}} that leach from pollen and confound chromatography, but without autohydrolyzing sucrose. Pollen sugars were a negligible fraction of provision mass sugars. Glucose and fructose constituted {{about half of the}} provision fresh weight. Sucrose in alfalfa pollen and nectar is absent from the provision, presumably enzymatically hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose in the provision. Provision masses are composed of two to three times more floral equivalents in pollen than nectar. Female M. rotundata, and other solitary bees with pasty provisions, gather proportionally more pollen than nectar compared with the resource needs of colonies of social honeybees and bumblebees...|$|E
40|$|The pollinators and {{breeding}} system of {{two species of}} Vellozia (Velloziaceae) from high-altitude quartzitic grasslands in SE Brazil were studied. Vellozia leptopetala is shrubby and grows solely on rocky outcrops, V. epidendroides is herbaceous and grows on stony soils. Both bear solitary, hermaphrodite flowers, and have massive, short-lasting annual blooms. We evaluated the level of self-compatibility and need for pollinators of 50 plants of each species and 20 - 60 flowers per treatment: hand self- and cross-pollination, spontaneous pollination, agamospermy and control. The behavior of floral visitors on flowers and within plants was recorded. Both species are mostly self-incompatible, but produce {{a small number of}} seeds by self-fertilization. The pollen-ovule ratio suggests facultative xenogamy. They were visited primarily by bees, of which the most important pollinators were two <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>bees</b> (Megachile spp.). Vellozia leptopetala was also pollinated by a territorial hummingbird. Low natural seed production compared to cross-pollination seed numbers suggests that pollen limitation is the main cause of low seed set. This was attributed to the combined effect of five mechanisms: selfing prior to anthesis, enhanced geitonogamy as a result of large floral displays, low number of visits per flower for the same reason, pollen theft by many insect species, and, in V. leptopetala, delivery of mixed pollen loads on the stigma as a consequence of hummingbird promiscuity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany {{insects are}} {{tolerant}} of hypoxic conditions, but survival may {{come at a}} cost to long-term health. The alfalfa <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>bee,</b> Megachile rotundata, develops in brood cells inside natural cavities, and may be exposed to hypoxic conditions for extended periods of time. Whether M. rotundata is tolerant of hypoxia, and whether exposure results in sub-lethal effects, has never been investigated. Overwintering M. rotundata prepupae were exposed to 10 %, 13 %, 17 %, 21 % and 24 % O 2 for 11 months. Once adults emerged, five indicators of quality — emergence weight, body size, feeding activity, flight performance, and adult longevity, — were measured to determine whether adult bees that survived past exposure to hypoxia were competent pollinators. M. rotundata prepupae are tolerant of hypoxic condition and have higher survival rates in hypoxia, than in normoxia. Under hypoxia, adult emergence rates did not decrease over the 11 months of the experiment. In contrast, bees reared in normoxia had decreased emergence rates by 8 months, and were dead by 11 months. M. rotundata prepupae exposed to extended hypoxic conditions had similar emergence weight, head width, and cross-thorax distance compared to bees reared in standard 21 % oxygen. Despite no significant morphological differences, hypoxia-exposed bees had lower feeding rates and shorter adult lifespans. Hypoxia {{may play a role in}} post-diapause physiology of M. rotundata, with prepupae showing better survival under hypoxic conditions. Extended exposure to hypoxia, while not fatal, causes sub-lethal effects in feeding rates and longevity in the adults, indicating that hypoxia tolerance comes at a cost...|$|E
