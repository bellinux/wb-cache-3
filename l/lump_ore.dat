Based on the analysis of its composition and mechanical properties, I infer that the natural iron <b>lump</b> <b>ores</b> can charge directly into reduction furnace without any prior treatment, so that the cost of whole process without additional enrichment and sintering will be reduced quite much.

Improving the quality of <b>lump</b> <b>ore,</b> through a simple yet innovative mineral processing, can maximize recovery of reserves, decrease waste generation, and increase the productivity and sustainability of mines by allowing transition to lower quality iron ores. An example of the application of such principle is described here in which both siliceous and dolomitic banded iron formation rocks (BIFs) were subjected to chemical, physical, and mineralogical characterization before undergoing beneficiation processes in pneumatic jigs and log washer equipment. These processes were found to increase product quality and reduce the levels of contaminants, including SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, and fines. The gain in quality led to a reduction in the cut-off grade, from 60 % to 58 % Fe, while maintaining products specifications.

By using these indexes, it was possible to conclude that this manganese <b>lump</b> <b>ore</b> did not present significant disintegration at room temperature.

40|$|The {{high-temperature}} behaviour {{of reducing}} ferrous materials is quantified using a laboratory softening and melting test. Using {{a combination of}} standard, non-standard and quenched tests supported by optical image analysis this work has highlighted some important differences in behaviour between lump, pellets and sinter {{as well as between}} the lump ores and the pellets. One <b>lump</b> <b>ore</b> is denser than the other and there is also a denser pellet. In both cases, the denser ore/pellet is also higher in silica content. Densification of the ferrous bed leads to reduced bed permeability. Studies indicate that densification can happen through two mechanisms. Results show that material density and silica content are two key factors causing increased bed densification. Material density influences reduction efficiency and wustite levels while silica influences the level of fayalite formed. Fayalite is formed by reactions between wustite and silica. Results also show that the behaviour of fluxed sinter is superior to ore and acid pellets because lime preferentially reacts with silica to form dicalcium silicate, a high melting temperature compound.

40|$|The {{softening}} and {{melting test}} {{is widely used}} to assess the behaviour of ferrous materials in the cohesive zone of a blast furnace. It is generally agreed that the performance of lump ores is inferior to sinter in the test. To understand the factors determining material behaviour, tests were terminated by quenching samples at different temperatures. The samples were then studied under an optical microscope. The formation of a low temperature liquid fayalite caused beds of lump ores to rearrange and contract earlier. Beds of fluxed sinter remained essentially intact with reduction until higher temperatures. The study also showed that results obtained for a mixed burden of 80 % sinter and 20 % <b>lump</b> <b>ore</b> – a ratio used in many blast furnaces – are not different to results obtained from tests using only sinter. This difference increases as the <b>lump</b> <b>ore</b> level is increased.

40|$|Brazilian {{chromite}} ores need to {{be crushed}} to a size below 1 mm to allow concentrations that decrease the content of gangues.

Because of its refractoriness and low rate of dissolution in gangue, the chromite minerals participation in liquid phase formation during the sintering process is low, and the gangue also shows a solidus temperature of ∼ 1400 °C. This paper attempts to analyse these fundamental aspects by characterising chromites, with estimates of the liquidus temperatures of chromite grains and gangue.

40|$|Seven {{iron ore}} pellets, two sinters, and one <b>lump</b> <b>ore</b> were studied in CO-CO₂-H₂-N₂ atmospheres from 350 °C to 750 °C, {{simulating}} the upper stack of the ironmaking blast furnace. Experiments were {{performed in a}} flowing gas reactor on single specimens of each type of substrate. Two different measurements were made: (1) the carbon deposition and concurrent iron oxide reduction rate at 550 °C in 30 %CO, 10 %CO₂, 2 %H₂, and 58 %N₂; and (2) {{the amount of carbon}} deposited during a programmed increase in temperature and change in CO-CO₂ ratio simulating the descent of an ore specimen in the blast furnace stack. The rates of the concurrent reaction were determined from mass balances based on gas chromatographic analyses of the CO, CO₂H₂, and N₂ in both the inlet and outlet gases and the continuously recorded mass of the specimen. The materials were examined as to chemical composition, internal structure, porosity, and surface area. Elemental analyses of single iron oxide grains were made by electron microprobe. Slag materials and composition, and crystallinity were determined by microprobe and X-ray diffraction. The results of the experiments show that carbon deposition occurs only in the presence of metallic iron which is produced from the concurrent reduction of Fe₃O₄. The degree of reduction is controlled largely by the structure of the substrate, but the carbon deposition is controlled only by the chemical composition of the substrate [...] specifically, silicon in the iron and the CaO to MgO ratio. In the blast furnace simulation, the carbon deposition increases for pellets fluxed with dolomite to a maximum with lime-fluxed pellets. The effects of H₂ and CO₂ on the reactions were investigated in the isothermal experiments using an Empire pellet. The CO₂ controlled only the reduction, and this by diffusion of the CO₂. The hydrogen in very small amounts enhanced the deposition of carbon, probably by eliminating the presence of the inactive iron carbides. Under blast furnace conditions, the changes in the operation when the chemistry of the ore feed is changed to fluxed pellets will be due more to the shifts in the available heat within the stack from carbon deposition than to the low temperature reduction of the ores, which does not change with the addition of the flux materials...|$|E
40|$|Softening {{deformation}} of iron ore {{in the form}} of sinter, pellet, and <b>lump</b> <b>ore</b> in the cohesive zone of an ironmaking blast furnace is an important phenomenon that has a significant effect on gas permeability and consequently blast furnace production efficiency. The macroscopic softening deformation behavior of the bed and the microscopic deformation behavior of the individual particles in the packed bed are investigated in this study using wax balls to simulate the fused layer behavior of the cohesive zone. The effects of softening temperature, load pressure, and bed composition (mono - single melting particles, including pure or blend particles vs binary  two different melting point particles) on softening deformation are examined. The principal findings of this study are: 1. At low softening temperatures, an increase in load pressure increases the deformation rate almost linearly. 2. At higher softening temperatures, an increase in load pressure dramatically increases the deformation rate, and after a certain time there is no more significant change in deformation rate. 3. The bed deformation rate of a mono bed is much greater than that of a binary one. 4. In a binary system, the softening deformation rate increases almost proportionally with the increase in the amount of lower melting point wax balls. 5. In a mono system with blend particles, the content of the lower melting point material has a more significant effect on overall bed deformation than the higher melting point one. 6. The macro softening {{deformation of}} the bed behaves the theory of creep deformation. 7. A mathematical model for predicting bed porosity change due to softening deformation based on creep deformation theory has been developed. 8. Increase in load pressure also reduces the peak contact face number of the distribution curves, and this is more prominent with higher porosity values. 9. The contribution of contact face number to bed porosity reduction is more pronounced in a mono system than in a binary system. 10. The porosity reduction in a binary bed is more due to the contact face area increase, presumably of the lower melting point particles. 11. The mono system has a single peak contact face number distribution pattern while the binary system exhibits a bimodal distribution pattern once the higher melting point material starts to deform. 12. In a binary system, an increase in deformation condition severity tends to reduce the contact face number of the higher melting point material without having to increase the contact face number of the lower melting point material accordingly to achieve a given porosity...|$|E
