[...] For the purpose of increasing the heating value, injecting propane and butane is a solution. [...] For the purpose of decreasing heating value, nitrogen injecting and extracting butane and propane are proved solutions. [...] Blending with gas or LNG can be a solutions; however all of these solutions while theoretically viable can be costly and logistically difficult to manage in large scale. <b>Lean</b> <b>LNG</b> price in terms of mmbtu is [...] lower to the rich LNG price.|$|E
