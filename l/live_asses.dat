50|$|The Queen Bitch is {{the leader}} of a nest of Graboids and Ass Blasters in Tremors 5. She is of a different, more evolved breed that is only seen in Africa. During the movie, she protects a nest with several Ass Blasters and another Graboid in hopes of {{propagating}} their species through the dozens of eggs in their nest. The nest is discovered by poachers, one of whom tricks Burt into going to Africa in order to capture a <b>live</b> <b>Ass</b> Blaster. The Queen Bitch, as Burt dubs her, acts as the nest's main line of defense, attacking anything that gets close while the other Ass Blasters begin targeting a nearby village and reserve to keep their eggs safe. After a poacher is chased near the nest by her sentient tentacles, the Queen Bitch reveals herself emerging from the ground, flying high in the air and swallowing the poacher whole. After Dan Bravers arrives in his helicopter to pick up Burt and Travis, the Queen Bitch uses her Grabbers to kill his co-pilot and drags Dan out of the helicopter personally. However, Dan unloads a shotgun into her stomach, causing her to spit him out. Following the destruction of the nest by Burt with the helicopter's rocket pods, the Queen Bitch travels to the nearby village where a little girl has the last egg, intending on retrieving it to preserve its bloodline. The Queen Bitch confronts the villagers who draw her into a trap where a lightning strike forces her to the surface. As Burt, Nandi and Baruti fire upon her, the Queen Bitch receives a direct lightning strike down her gullet, killing her and causing her to explode.|$|R
50|$|Decoration Day is a rock album {{released}} by Drive-By Truckers in 2003. The album was recorded mostly live over {{two weeks at}} Chase Park Transduction Studios in Athens, Georgia, and was produced by noted producer and former Sugar bassist David Barbe. The album is the Truckers fifth, including their <b>live</b> album Alabama <b>Ass</b> Whuppin, following the critically acclaimed Southern Rock Opera. The album features a more mellow, stripped down, and reserved sound compared to Southern Rock Operas heavy hitting southern rock.|$|R

According to Patterson Hood, [...] "(the album) was recorded in Birmingham, upstairs in a uniform shop during an early September heat wave, with no air-conditioning. We had to turn the fans off when we were recording, and we worked from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. So Southern Rock Opera was fun to write, {{but we had a}} miserable time making it." ...|$|R

50|$|African wild asses {{are well}} suited to life in a desert or semidesert environment. They have tough {{digestive}} systems, which can break down desert vegetation and extract moisture from food efficiently. They can also go without water for a fairly long time. Their large ears give them an excellent sense of hearing and help in cooling.Because of the sparse vegetation in their environment wild <b>asses</b> <b>live</b> somewhat separated from each other (except for mothers and young), unlike the tightly grouped herds of wild horses. They have very loud voices, which can be heard for over 3 km, which helps them to keep in contact with other asses over the wide spaces of the desert.|$|R
2500|$|Diamond Head are {{probably}} most famous among heavy metal fans for {{their influence on}} Metallica. Metallica have acknowledged them as an important early influence and have covered Diamond Head songs at gigs such as [...] "Sucking My Love", [...] "Am I Evil" [...] and [...] "The Prince." [...] The earliest known recordings of these songs are a rehearsal demo recorded at then-bassist Ron McGovney's house in March 1982. The Metal Up Your <b>Ass</b> <b>live</b> demo, recorded in November of that year, featured a live rendition of [...] "Am I Evil." [...] "The Prince" [...] was also played, but the tape ran out too soon to catch it. [...] "Sucking My Love" [...] exists on various bootlegs that have been circulating since 1982 along with a recording on the early demo No Life Til Leather.|$|R
5000|$|... "The kyangs or wild <b>asses,</b> <b>live</b> {{together}} in smaller groups, each {{headed by a}} stallion, lording it over anything from ten to fifty mares. I {{was struck by the}} noble appearance of these beasts; and, in particular, by the beautiful line of head and neck. Their coat is light brown on the back and whitish below the belly, and their long thin tails are almost black; the whole representing excellent camouflage against their natural background. They look wonderfully elegant and graceful when you see them darting across the steppes like arrows, heads stretched out and tails streaming away behind them in the wind. Their rutting season is in the autumn, and then the stallions are at their most aggressive as they jealously guard their harems. The fiercest and most merciless battles take place {{at this time of the}} year between the stallion installed and interlopers from other herds. When the battle is over the victor, himself bloody and bruised from savage bites and kicks, leads off the mares in a wild gallop over the steppe.|$|R
500|$|The band {{initially}} {{intended to}} title the album Metal Up Your Ass with the cover featuring a hand clutching a dagger {{emerging from a}} toilet bowl. However, Zazula convinced them to change this as he thought distributors would not stock it. The final cover featured {{the shadow of a}} hand letting go of a bloodied hammer. Burton was credited with coming up with the name Kill 'Em All—referring to timid record distributors, saying, [...] "Those record company fuckers... kill 'em all!"—as a response to the situation. Ulrich thought Kill 'Em All was a good name, and Zazula agreed. Burton suggested to Gary L. Heard, also responsible for the Metallica photograph on the back cover, to feature a bloodied hammer on the album art. According to Hammett, [...] "Cliff carried a hammer with him everywhere he went. He always had a hammer in his luggage, and he would take it out occasionally and start destroying things." [...] Even though the original title was unused, the band did later release a [...] "Metal Up Your Ass" [...] T-shirt with the proposed artwork. A live bootleg recording of a 1982 performance at the Old Waldorf, titled Metal Up Your <b>Ass</b> (<b>Live),</b> featured the original cover artwork. Original pressings of the album came with an inner sleeve that included pictures and lyrics as well as a silver label on the vinyl. Subsequent pressings had a blank white sleeve and standard album label. The 1988 reissue re-introduced the lyrics and photos. The original release can be distinguished by the words [...] "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" [...] {{at the top of the}} back cover. This was dropped from the reissue. The phrase [...] "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" [...] was dedicated to San Francisco fan Ray Burch, known for his headbanging at the band's early shows.|$|R
5000|$|Metallica {{was formed}} in 1981 in Los Angeles by drummer Lars Ulrich and vocalist James Hetfield. Before {{settling}} on a definitive lineup, Metal Blade Records owner Brian Slagel asked Metallica to record a song for {{the first edition of}} his Metal Massacre compilation. Hetfield and Ulrich chose [...] "Hit the Lights" [...] from Hetfield's previous band Leather Charm, and recorded it with Hetfield's childhood friend Ron McGovney on bass, and temporary guitarist Lloyd Grant. The band's first lineup featured Hetfield, Ulrich, McGovney, and guitarist Dave Mustaine, who was acquired through a newspaper advertisement. The band practiced in McGovney's garage and inquired to play gigs at local clubs. Metallica's first show was on March 14, 1982, at the Radio City in Anaheim. The nine-song setlist consisted of two originals ("Hit the Lights" [...] and an unfinished version of [...] "Jump in the Fire" [...] from Mustaine's earlier band Panic) and covers of new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands such as Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, Savage, and Sweet Savage. The gig was notorious because Mustaine had problems with the guitar distortion pedal and broke a string during a song. Metallica's second gig was March 27 at Hollywood's Whisky a Go Go, opening for Saxon. Although Mötley Crüe was originally scheduled to open the show, the group canceled because of its growing popularity. Metallica recorded a three-song demo to persuade the venue's management to allow the band to open for Saxon. Metallica's third concert was in April, at which was premiered [...] "The Mechanix", written by Mustaine during his tenure with Panic. Mustaine interacted with the fans at Metallica's earliest shows because Hetfield was shy. To get attention from club owners, Metallica recorded the Power Metal demo which featured [...] "Motorbreath" [...] in addition to the already-performed originals. The logo, displaying the band's name with the first and last letter drawn larger with sharp serifs and italicized, was designed by Hetfield. The No Life 'til Leather demo was recorded in July 1982, and it created a buzz in the underground tape trading circles. No Life 'til Leather featured a re-recorded version of [...] "Hit the Lights", which appeared on the second pressing of Metal Massacre, in addition to new songs such as [...] "Phantom Lord", [...] "Seek & Destroy", and [...] "Metal Militia". The recording and mastering was financed by Kenny Kane, owner of the punk label High Velocity, and distributed by Ulrich and his friend Pat Scott. Because of tensions with Mustaine, McGovney left the band in December. Ulrich was impressed by Cliff Burton's performance with Trauma at The Troubadour and offered to let him join the group. Burton joined on the condition that Metallica would relocate to the San Francisco area. Moving to El Cerrito in February 1983, the band stayed and rehearsed at Exodus manager Mark Whitaker's house, which they called the [...] "Metallica Mansion". Metallica intended to record its debut in Los Angeles on Slagel's independent label on an $8,000 budget. Slagel could not afford the record, and Ulrich contacted Jon Zazula, a New Jersey record store owner and promoter of heavy metal bands on the East Coast who had already heard No Life 'til Leather. Metallica rented a U-Haul truck and drove to New Jersey in late March, and upon arrival, allowed Zazula to sell copies of No Life 'til Leather to help him found Megaforce Records, because no label wanted to finance the album's recording. [...] Hetfield and Ulrich fired Mustaine on the morning of April 11 after a gig in New York, because of his drug and alcohol problems, overly aggressive behavior, and clashes with bandmates. On Whitaker's recommendation, Metallica recruited Kirk Hammett, who played in Exodus and was a one-time student of Joe Satriani. Hammett learned the songs on his flight to New York, and started recording the album with Metallica barely a month later. Metallica met producer Paul Curcio at Music America studios in Rochester, and recorded the album in two weeks. Unable to afford a hotel during the recording sessions, the band members lived in people's houses in Rochester and at the Music Factory in Jamaica, Queens, where Anthrax held rehearsals. Curcio had set the studio equipment as if he were recording an ordinary rock band. He thought the initial tapes sounded very distorted, and tried to compensate by turning down the knobs. Metallica resented Curcio's involvement because he seemed uninterested and had little impact on the sound. Although Zazula wanted Hammett to replicate Mustaine's solos, Hammett's guitar solos on the album were partially based on Mustaine's original solos, with the first four bars of most solos written by Mustaine before his departure. Despite their differences, Mustaine's contributions to the early years of Metallica were still acknowledged, and he received four co-writing credits on Kill 'Em All. Zazula was not satisfied with the initial mix because he thought the drums were too loud and the guitars were too low in the mix. The remix was done by sound engineer Chris Bubacz, according to Zazula's instructions. The final cost for the record was $15,000, which nearly bankrupted Zazula. [...] "This was mortgage money I'm spending, not something I've got put by I'm going to invest," [...] he said later. Zazula had a hard time finding a distributor for the record, but he eventually convinced Relativity Records to distribute the album in the U.S. and Canada, and Music for Nations in Europe. The band initially intended to title the album Metal Up Your Ass with the cover featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a toilet bowl. However, Zazula convinced them to change this as he thought distributors would not stock it. The final cover featured the shadow of a hand letting go of a bloodied hammer.
