5|$|Before the September 29, 2008, Steelers game at Heinz Field, Baltimore Ravens wide {{receiver}} Derrick Mason stomped on a Terrible Towel. The Ravens {{then went on}} to <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> three of their 2008 season games against the Steelers, including the 2008 AFC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|While Hazel {{caused the}} most {{damage in the}} Carolinas, the storm did not <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> of its intensity. Going north, Hazel turned extratropical by midday when it merged with a cold front; however, it {{retained}} hurricane-strength winds and it was continuing to drop heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium {{has five}} ionic {{oxidation}} states ranging from +3 to +7 when forming chemical compounds, {{which can be}} simultaneously observed in solutions. It is the heaviest actinide that can <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> its valence electrons in a stable compound. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds.|$|E
50|$|Stramazzo: if {{the bidder}} wins all the points without winning all the tricks, {{or if he}} <b>loses</b> <b>all</b> the points without <b>losing</b> <b>all</b> the tricks, that is, if the tricks won by the losing side contain less than one point, the amount won or lost is then multiplied by three.|$|R
50|$|Each {{players will}} be given 10 or 20 points in the {{beginning}} and the game lasts until a player <b>loses</b> <b>all</b> of his points. If a player <b>loses</b> <b>all</b> his points, the player with the highest points will be declared winner. The player with the next higher point will be declared a runner-up.|$|R
50|$|The game ends if {{at least}} one side <b>loses</b> <b>all</b> lives, or the stage is {{completed}} with at least 80% captured area. If one side <b>loses</b> <b>all</b> lives, the other side with remaining lives win. If the stage is completed with at least 80% captured area, the side with most captured area wins.|$|R
5|$|San Marino's first {{match in}} a FIFA sanctioned {{competition}} was against Switzerland on 14 November 1990 in a qualifier for the 1992 European Championships. San Marino lost 4–0, {{and went to}} <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> eight qualifiers. The team particularly struggled in away matches, losing every one by at least four goals. San Marino scored only one goal, a penalty in a 3–1 defeat at home by Romania, and conceded 33 goals in total.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, London {{began working}} for Lucha Libre USA as the masked Sydistiko, {{taking over the}} role {{previously}} held by T.J. Perkins. He teamed up with Rellik to defeat Dinastia (El Oriental and Tinieblas Jr.) on December 12, 2010. The pair participated in three way match to decide the new LLUSA Tag Team Championship but this time El Oriental and Tinieblas Jr. would {{get the better of}} the pair. As Sydistiko, he would go on to <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> his matches including LLUSA Championship number one contendership lucha roulette elimination.|$|E
5|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> three hydraulic systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main gear tire exploded in the wheel well area. The damage in the left wing area caused total fluid loss from the number 1 and the number 2 hydraulic systems. The number 3 system was dented but not penetrated. DC-10s still have no fuse protection {{for any of the}} three hydraulic systems {{in the event of an}} exploding main gear tire.|$|E
50|$|Stars {{and lives}} for each player are tracked {{separately}} on the screen. Some rooms are in darkness where players must anticipate useful tiles and enemies well in advance. If one player <b>loses</b> <b>all</b> of his lives, {{then the other}} player must continue to play until he also <b>loses</b> <b>all</b> of his lives.|$|R

5|$|Saman was {{released}} in 1998 after winning the 1997 Jakarta Art Institute novel writing contest. In 1998, Saman won the Jakarta Arts Council Novel Competition. In 2000, it received the Prince Claus Award. By 2005, it had been translated into Dutch and English; the English translation {{took a long time}} to write because Utami was concerned that an overexplanation of the novel caused it to <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> of its sensuality. It has also been translated into French, Czech, and Japanese (by two separate translators). , a translation into Korean is underway. By 2004, the book had sold 100,000 copies, a large figure for an Indonesian novel.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji first {{expressed}} interest in becoming a music critic in 1914, and he started contributing criticism to The New Age in 1924, after it had published some of his letters to the editor. By 1930, Sorabji had become disillusioned with concert life and developed a growing interest in gramophone recordings, believing that he would eventually <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> reason to attend concerts. In 1945 he stopped providing regular reviews and only occasionally submitted his writings to correspondence columns in various journals. While his earlier writings reflect a contempt for the music world in general—from its businessmen to its performers—his later reviews {{tend to be more}} detailed and less caustic.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} role of the rōnin Shiren, who travels through thirty areas {{on his way to the}} Land of the Golden Condor. The game is turn-based, with all enemies and {{characters}} in an area moving whenever the player performs an action, such as attacking or moving. If the player falls in battle, they <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> their progress and are forced to restart from the beginning of the game: to counter-act this, they can choose to store powerful items in warehouses, and pick them up again on further playthroughs; the Nintendo DS release also adds rescue quests, where a player can save other players who have fallen, allowing them to continue from where they left off.|$|E

5|$|When cooled below a point {{called the}} {{critical}} temperature, materials can undergo a phase transition {{in which they}} <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> resistivity to electric current, in {{a process known as}} superconductivity. In BCS theory, this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. These Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance. (Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100nm, so they can overlap each other.) However, the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|At the Quahog Gay Pride Day festivities, in a raffle {{sponsored}} by Weenie and the Butt, Brian wins tickets to see Celine Dion in Las Vegas. As they prepare to travel, Stewie convinces Brian {{to use the}} new teleportation device he has been working on instead. Stewie's device appears to have malfunctioned, and he believes it failed to work, when it instead created a duplicate set of Brian and Stewie which was teleported to Vegas. The real Brian and Stewie then travel by plane to Vegas. As the duplicated pair check into the Bellagio hotel, their luck makes itself present immediately with the duplicated Brian winning a large jackpot at the slot machines near the entrance. The real Brian and Stewie arrive to find their room has been already taken. As the duplicated pair have the time of their lives, the real pair find themselves in a third-rate hotel. Trying their luck, they quickly <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> of the money they brought.|$|E

5|$|Back in her bedroom, Rapunzel is {{suddenly}} flooded by memories from her past. Realizing Gothel is a fraud, she finally finds {{the courage to}} rebel against her. However, Gothel, unwilling to lose Rapunzel, chains her up and gags her with a white handkerchief. When Flynn, having managed {{to escape from the}} castle, arrives at the tower, Gothel stabs him. Desperate to save him, Rapunzel promises to do whatever Gothel pleases in return. Gothel complies, but just as Rapunzel is about to heal him, Flynn cuts her hair short, causing it to turn brown and <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> of its magical powers and might never be long again, resulting in Gothel's death. Flynn dies in Rapunzel's arms and she cries bitterly. However, the flower's magic manifests itself through Rapunzel's tears and returns Flynn to life. Flynn returns Rapunzel to the palace, where she is finally reunited with her parents.|$|E
5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies if they <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> their hit points. As most roguelikes feature {{the concept of}} permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the spring}} molt is complete, {{the body of}} the male is a {{brilliant}} lemon yellow, a color produced by carotenoid pigments from plant materials in its diet, with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight. The female is mostly brown, lighter on the underside with a yellow bib. After the autumn molt, the bright summer feathers are replaced by duller plumage, becoming buff below and olive-brown above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The autumn plumage is almost identical in both sexes, but the male has yellow shoulder patches. In some winter ranges, the goldfinches <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> traces of yellow, becoming a predominantly medium tan-gray color with an olive tinge evident only on close viewing.|$|E

5|$|One day, Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, two {{teenagers}} {{from the city}} of Twin Seeds, go through failures. Elliot is a basketball player who enjoys a game with his friends. He is challenged by a group of older school students and suffers a humiliating defeat on the court. Claris is a talented singer and her ambition is to perform on stage. She auditions for a part in the events commemorating the centenary of the city of Twin Seeds. Standing in front of the judges, she is overcome by stage fright and does not perform well, which causes her to <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> hopes of getting the role. When they go to sleep that night, both Elliot and Claris suffer nightmares that replay the events. They escape into Nightopia and find that they both possess the rare Red Ideya of Courage, the only type that Wizeman cannot steal.|$|E
5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{began its}} {{football}} program with several students forming a loose-knit troop of footballers called the Blacksmiths. The first season saw Tech play three games and <b>lose</b> <b>all</b> three. Discouraged by these results, the Blacksmiths sought a coach {{to improve their}} record. Leonard Wood, an army officer who had played football at Harvard and was then stationed in Atlanta and taking graduate courses at the school, volunteered {{to serve as the}} team's player-coach. In 1893, Tech played its first game against the University of Georgia (Georgia). Tech defeated Georgia 28–6 for the school's first-ever victory. The angry Georgia fans threw stones and other debris at the Tech players during and after the game. The poor treatment of the Blacksmiths by the Georgia faithful gave birth to the rivalry now known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate.|$|E
