5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their <b>long</b> <b>winter</b> hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E

In Sabucedo, unlike in other rapas, the aloitadores ("fighters") each take on their task with no assistance.|$|E
25|$|Hebard was a {{tumbleweed}} of activity. Summers {{often found}} her bouncing along Wyoming's sagebrush rangeland, sometimes by horse and wagon {{and later by}} automobile, searching for Oregon Trail ruts or seeking to locate yet another historic site or pioneer to corner for an interview. Only after the High Plain's <b>long</b> <b>winter</b> had retreated would conditions become favorable for Hebard's expeditions. Although the record shows that she sometimes strapped on snowshoes to continue her explorations in the winter. But even summer treks presented difficulties. Thunder boomers easily turned the primitive tracks that then served as roads into impassable quagmires of Wyoming mud.|$|E
25|$|Larocque {{spent the}} <b>long</b> <b>winter</b> {{in a nearby}} workshop, {{carefully}} supervising the assembly of the arches that were to form the domed roof. The 12 main arches were supplemented by 24 secondary ones and 72 smaller arches. His work also aroused some interest from Ottawa since the blueprints had failed to earn a permit, and more generally {{because he was not}} a registered architect. When they heard construction had begun nonetheless, they tried to have the work stopped. Bishop Paul Piché hired an engineering consultant to visit the building, who told him it was sturdy enough to last another 200 years.|$|E

25|$|Scandinavian {{shipbuilding}} technology {{failed to}} advance {{beyond that of}} the Viking days. The traditional Viking ships performed quite well in the relatively tranquil summer seas of the medieval warm period, but the stormier climates rendered these vessels particularly dangerous {{to the point of}} obsolescence. Viking technology spread earlier throughout Europe, and craftsmen along the Atlantic seaboard of western Europe began to develop ships capable of withstanding heavy seas and the gales that struck commonly even during mid-summer. Rarely did a medieval mariner without a death wish dare to venture beyond easy sight of port during the <b>long</b> <b>winter</b> season.|$|E
25|$|Town {{began their}} Conference {{campaign}} with a 1–0 win at big-spending promotion favourites Crawley Town. Inconsistency followed, {{with the club}} managing to perform and get results {{against some of the}} league's top sides but struggling to beat the teams {{at the lower end of}} the table. After a <b>long</b> <b>winter</b> break due to postponements, Grimsby started the new year scoring 13 goals in 2 games, beating Mansfield Town 7–2 at home and Histon 6–1 at Bridge Road. After this, yet another inconsistent period followed that saw only 2 wins in 9 games and saw the club's play-off aspirations take a severe hit. As a result of this, Neil Woods was relieved of his duties on 24 February 2011 after 15 months in charge. He left the club in 9th position in the Conference National.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} in which the Inuit lived inspired a mythology filled with adventure tales of whale and walrus hunts. <b>Long</b> <b>winter</b> months of waiting for caribou herds or sitting near breathing holes hunting seals gave birth to stories of mysterious and sudden appearance of ghosts and fantastic creatures. Some Inuit looked into the aurora borealis, or northern lights, to find images of their family and friends dancing in the next life. However, some Inuit believed that the lights were more sinister and if you whistled at them, they would come down and cut off your head. This tale is still told to children today. For others they were invisible giants, the souls of animals, a guide to hunting and as a spirit for the angakkuq to help with healing. They relied upon the angakkuq (shaman) for spiritual interpretation. The nearest thing to a central deity was the Old Woman (Sedna), who lived beneath the sea. The waters, a central food source, were believed to contain great gods.|$|E

25|$|The first snowmobiles were large, multipassenger {{vehicles}} {{designed to}} help people get around during the <b>long</b> <b>winter</b> months. Snowmobiles were used in rural Quebec to take children to school, carry freight, deliver mail, and as ambulances. His invention filled a very particular need {{in the region and}} soon business was booming. In1941 Armand opened a new factory in Valcourt. Then a major setback hit the growing business: the Second World War was well underway and the Canadian government issued wartime rationing regulations. Bombardier customers had to prove that snowmobiles were essential to their livelihood in order to buy one. To keep his business going, Armand shifted his focus and developed vehicles for the military. After the war, Bombardier experienced another setback in his snowmobile business. In1948, the Quebec government passed a law requiring all highways and local roads to be cleared of snow; the Bombardier company's sales fell by nearly half in one year. Armand Bombardier therefore decided to diversify his business, first by producing tracked snowplows sized specifically for use on municipal sidewalks (replacing horse-drawn vehicles), then by making all-terrain vehicles for the mining, oil, and forestry industries.|$|E
25|$|De Smet, South Dakota, attracts {{many fans}} with its {{historic}} sites from the books By the Shores of Silver Lake, The <b>Long</b> <b>Winter,</b> Little Town on the Prairie, These Happy Golden Years, and The First Four Years. The Ingalls {{family moved to}} De Smet from Minnesota in 1879, and {{most members of the}} family lived there (or nearby) {{for the rest of their}} lives. Locations in the area that have been restored and are open to visitors include: the Surveyors' House, where the family stayed during the winter of 1879–80 (the house was moved into town in 1885 from its original location on Silver Lake); the Ingalls Homestead southeast of town; a replica of the Brewster School, where Wilder taught as a teenager; and a house on Third Street built by Charles Ingalls in 1887 (Wilder herself never lived there, as she was already married when the house was built). Charles, Caroline, Mary, Carrie, and Grace Ingalls, and the unnamed infant son of Laura and Almanzo Wilder are buried in the De Smet Cemetery. Laura and Almanzo Wilder stayed briefly in Westville, Florida, in the 1890s, and they moved permanently to Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, {{she lost}} her mother, and, as her father had {{in the same year}} been elected member of the Provincial Parliament, necessitating his {{presence}} in Quebec for a considerable portion of the year, the family was, for the time being, broken up; and the above-mentioned uncle, Timothy, sent his son the <b>long</b> <b>winter</b> drive through Vermont and Canadian snowdrifts to bring this favored niece under his own roof. And here, and in the house of another uncle, Thomas Woolson, she spent the next four years, at Claremont, N. H. At the close of this time, her father gathered his family once more about him, in Oberlin, Ohio, where he afterwards held offices of trust under the United States Government. She joined him at that place, and in 1837 entered Oberlin College which had recently been established there, at first with no thought of taking a college course of study; but, as her perception of its advantages widened, she dropped her desultory work and, preparing herself in the languages, entered the class of 1844, becoming one of the earliest young women who pursued a liberal course of education in a co-educational environment She was then at the head of her father's family and found it necessary to do much of her studying at night. When she neared the close of her junior year, her eyesight failed, and it was many years before she regained substantial use of her eyes. In 1845, she received the degree of AB. in 1845.|$|E
