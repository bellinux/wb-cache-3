50|$|Nucleophilic acyl {{substitution}} {{describe a}} class of substitution reactions involving nucleophiles and acyl compounds. In this type of reaction, a nucleophile - such as an alcohol, amine, or enolate - displaces the leaving group of an <b>acyl</b> <b>derivative</b> - such as an acid halide, anhydride, or ester. The resulting product is a carbonyl-containing compound in which the nucleophile has taken {{the place of the}} leaving group present in the original <b>acyl</b> <b>derivative.</b> Because <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives</b> react {{with a wide variety of}} nucleophiles, and because the product can depend on the particular type of <b>acyl</b> <b>derivative</b> and nucleophile involved, nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions can be used to synthesize a variety of different products.|$|R

In comparing the sensitivity of two serotypes of herpes simplex virus it was found that Ara-C and its ester, as well as its cyclo-C counterpart, were more active against the type 2 than the type 1 strain.

40|$|Metal {{carbonyl}} complexes (MCCs) {{are potentially}} useful {{for a range}} of biomedical applications, including cell imaging and bioassay. However, the poor solubility and stability of MCCs in water remain obstacles to their use in these applications. This thesis addresses this challenge via an investigation of the self-assembly behaviour of hydrophobic Fp (Fp: CpFe(CO) 2) or Mp (Mp: CpMo(CO) 3) <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives</b> in water. Hydration of these hydrophobic molecules results in aqueous colloids with aggregation induced functions. The Fp and Mp <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives,</b> used in this research, synthesized by the migration insertion reaction (MIR) of Fp and Mp alkyl compounds in the presence of phosphine ligands, e. g. triphenylphosphine (PPh 3), possessed a highly polarized acyl CO group. This group was readily hydrated via water-carbonyl interactions (WCIs) during the aggregation of the molecules in water. This aggregation, driven by hydrophobic forces, resulted in highly integrated metal carbonyl vesicles (MCsomes) with liposome-like bilayer membranes. The polarized CO groups associated {{on the surface of the}} colloid created a strong local electric field, which induced an aggregation-enhanced IR absorption (AEIRA). When the colloids were exposed to a focused continuous-wave near-IR (NIR) laser beam, a strong gradient (trapping) force was generated, allowing laser-trapping of the MCsome. This strong force resulted from the sharp contrast in the refractive index (RI) between the building blocks (RI = ca. 1. 8) and water (RI = 1. 33). Blue-light–emitting MCsomes were created via the synthesis and self-assembly of a bithiophene tethered Fp <b>acyl</b> <b>derivative.</b> The bithiophene groups, associated within the membrane, generated an aggregation-induced emission (AIE). The separation of the bithiophene group from the metal carbonyl group, by an alkyl spacer, prevented AIE being quenched by the iron elements. The AEIRA, AIE and laser manipulation render the MCsomes potentially useful for vibrational and photoluminescent sensing applications. In addition, the redox activity of the iron on the surface of the colloids in water was explored. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) results showed two oxidation peaks separated by a redox coupling (ΔE½). The value of ΔE½ is inversely related to the separation distance between the adjacent Fp units located at the surfaces of the colloids, and was used to probe the degree of hydration of the hydrophobic domain. Taking advantage of this redox behaviour, the contribution of hydrophobic hydration to the formation and stabilization of the colloids, assembled from Fp <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives</b> including hydrophobic and amphiphilic molecules, was systematically investigated. The results indicate that the hydrophobic interaction and hydration are significantly important for colloidal stability. In conclusion, a novel group of vesicles, MCsome, with multiple functions has been created via the aqueous self-assembly of Fp or Mp <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Hydrophobic hydration and interaction are crucial forces for the formation and stabilization of the colloids...|$|R

50|$|There {{are five}} main types of <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Acid halides {{are the most}} {{reactive}} towards nucleophiles, followed by anhydrides, esters, and amides.

50|$|Esters exhibit less {{resonance}} stabilization than amides, so {{the formation}} of a tetrahedral intermediate and subsequent loss of resonance is not as energetically unfavorable. Anhydrides experience even weaker resonance stabilization, since the resonance is split between two carbonyl groups, and are more reactive than esters and amides. In acid halides, there is very little resonance, so the energetic penalty for forming a tetrahedral intermediate is small. This helps explain why acid halides are the most reactive <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{major factor}} in {{determining}} the reactivity of <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives</b> is leaving group ability, which is related to acidity. Weak bases are better leaving groups than strong bases; a species with a strong conjugate acid (e.g. hydrochloric acid) {{will be a better}} leaving group than a species with a weak conjugate acid (e.g. acetic acid). Thus, chloride ion is a better leaving group than acetate ion. The reactivity of acyl compounds towards nucleophiles decreases as the basicity of the leaving group increases, as the table shows.|$|R
50|$|Acid halides are {{the most}} {{reactive}} <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives,</b> and can easily be converted {{into any of the}} others.

The compounds were synthesized {{to improve the}} lipophilicity and potentially the cellular delivery of parent polar 22 ̆ 6 feet;, 32 ̆ 6 feet;-dideoxynucleoside (ddN) analogs. Three different fatty acids with varying chain length of suberic acid (octanedioic acid), sebacic acid (decanedioic acid), and dodecanedioic acid {{were used for the}} conjugation with the nucleosides.

Further preformulation studies were done on the FLT-conjugate by determining the lipid solubility (partition coefficient) and solution state degradation. The compound was found to be stable in acidic and alkaline conditions. The partition coefficient (Log P) of FLT conjugate was found to be - 0. 34. The derivative was also evaluated in dissolution studies using four different hydrogels with and without a thermogelling polymer. Gel formulations of the compound were manufactured using non-ionic (HPC-SL) and anionic (Carbopol) polymers with and without the inclusion of a thermo-reversible gelling (Pluronic F- 127) polymer.

While still membrane associated, the ligand was rapidly converted to its <b>acyl</b> <b>derivative</b> and then more slowly transferred to specific granules and, to a lesser extent, azurophilic granules. In contrast, neutrophils did not metabolize [3 H]PAF at 4 degrees C but rather gradually accumulated it in their alkaline phosphatase-enriched membrane subfractions. These same subfractions contained receptors for the ligand, as determined by their capacity to bind [3 H]PAF specifically. Binding was readily saturated, partially reversible, and fit a two receptor model; dissociation constant (Kd) values for high and low affinity sites were 0. 2 and 500 nM, respectively. Receptors with similar affinities were detected in whole cells. Furthermore, the potencies of several structural analogues in inhibiting binding of [3 H]PAF to membranes correlated closely with their respective potencies in stimulating degranulation responses. Finally, quantitative studies suggested all or most of the cell's receptors were membrane associated. We conclude that PAF rapidly enters cellular membranes to bind with specific receptors that trigger function. The intramembranous ligand is also deacetylated, acylated, and then transferred to granules. This metabolism may be sufficiently rapid to limit ligand-receptor binding and distort quantitative analyses of receptors...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the importance of}} increased hydrophobicity at the amino end of antimicrobial peptides, a dermaseptin derivative {{was used as a}} template for a systematic acylation study. Through a gradual increase of the acyl moiety chain length, hydrophobicity was monitored and further modulated by acyl conversion to aminoacyl. The chain lengths of the <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives</b> correlated with a gradual increase in the peptide's global hydrophobicity and stabilization of its helical structure. The effect on cytolytic properties, however, fluctuated for different cells. Whereas acylation gradually enhanced hemolysis of human red blood cells and antiprotozoan activity against Leishmania major, bacteria displayed a more complex behavior. The gram-positive organism Staphylococcus aureus was most sensitive to intermediate acyl chains, while longer acyls gradually led to a total loss of activity. All <b>acyl</b> <b>derivatives</b> were detrimental to activity against Escherichia coli, namely, but not solely, because of peptide aggregation. Although aminoacyl derivatives behaved essentially similarly to the nonaminated acyls, they displayed reduced hydrophobicity, and consequently, the long-chain acyls enhanced activity against all microorganisms (e. g., by up to 12 -fold for the aminolauryl derivative) but were significantly less hemolytic than their acyl counterparts. Acylation also enhanced bactericidal kinetics and peptide resistance to plasma proteases. The similarities and differences upon acylation of MSI- 78 and LL 37 are presented and discussed. Overall, the data suggest an approach {{that can be used to}} enhance the potencies of acylated short antimicrobial peptides by preventing hydrophobic interactions that lead to self-assembly in solution and, thus, to inefficacy against cell wall-containing target cells...|$|R
