5000|$|Devils first {{appear in}} the first edition Monster Manual (1977), which {{includes}} the barbed devil (<b>lesser</b> <b>devil),</b> the bone devil (<b>lesser</b> <b>devil),</b> the erinyes (<b>lesser</b> <b>devil),</b> the horned devil (malebranche) (greater devil), the ice devil (greater devil), the lemure, the pit fiend (greater devil), and the arch-devils Asmodeus, Baalzebul, Dispater, and Geryon. The imp, a frequent servant of devils, also {{first appeared in the}} original Monster Manual. The Monster Manual was reviewed by Don Turnbull in the British magazine White Dwarf #8 (August/September 1978). As part of his review, Turnbull comments on several new monsters introduced in the book, considering the devils the most prominent among them. Turnbull notes that [...] "they are all pretty strong and compare not unfavourably in this respect with the Demons we already know".|$|E
5000|$|The black abishai, blue abishai, green abishai, red abishai, {{and white}} abishai (<b>lesser</b> <b>devil),</b> the bearded devil (<b>lesser</b> <b>devil),</b> the nupperibo (least devil), the spined devil (least devil), {{appeared}} in the first edition Monster Manual II (1983), along with the princess of Hell Glasya, the dukes of Hell Amon, Bael, Hutijin, and Titivilus, and the arch devils Belial, Mammon, Mephistopheles, and Moloch. Ed Greenwood's follow-up article, [...] "The Nine Hells Revisited" [...] in Dragon #91 (November 1984) introduced the greater devils Armaros, Azazel, Cahor, Dagon, Duskur, Kochbiel, Malarea, Nisroch, Rumjal, and the arch-devil Gargoth.|$|E

50|$|As {{the master}} of Hell, he has {{complete}} power over <b>lesser</b> <b>devils,</b> including other lords of Baator. Several times he has permanently changed their physical forms at a whim. He transformed Mammon into a humanoid/serpent hybrid, and cursed Baalzebul with {{the form of a}} gigantic slug with tiny, useless arms.|$|R
50|$|Malbolge {{is now a}} noisy place {{populated}} by tormented lemures, cornugons, and the occasional spinagon. Large numbers of <b>lesser</b> <b>devils</b> on this layer are missing {{all or part of}} at least one limb, or have some other sort of disfigurement or infirmity—a testament to the days when Baalzebul and Moloch ruled here, both of whom delighted in the torture of their subjects.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>devil</b> ray, Mobula hypostoma, is {{an eagle}} ray in the genus Mobula. They occur along {{the coasts of}} the western Atlantic, from North Carolina to {{northern}} Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The {{devil fish}} {{is larger than}} its close {{relative}} the <b>lesser</b> <b>devil</b> ray. It grows to a maximum recorded length of 5.2 m, {{making it one of}} the largest rays. It possesses a spiny tail.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>devil</b> ray has tasty {{flesh to}} some {{and can be}} a source of oil. They are known to swim at very high speeds and leap out of the water, often a great distance.|$|E
25|$|Structured {{around its}} protagonist and named after his main alias, Kir Ianulea recounts how {{one of the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>devils</b> is {{assigned}} the mission of assessing the evil and negativity of women. In order to accomplish this task, he must live {{the life of a}} mortal, and chooses Bucharest as his city of residence. The main part of the story recounts his unhappy marriage to the tyrannical and dishonest Acrivița, his realization that his future among humans was compromised, and his narrow escape from his creditors. The third part shows the devil possessing aristocratic young women as part of a scheme to reward his one human benefactor, the peasant Negoiță. The narrative ends with a fall-out between Negoiță and Ianulea, and the latter's hasty return to Hell upon being threatened by a potential reunion with Acrivița.|$|R
50|$|The proud Rumjal {{is another}} former {{lieutenant}} to Geryon. Exiled to Avernus for the molestation of Geryon's consort, Cozbi, this very resentful Duke wields his frustration by tormenting <b>lesser</b> <b>devils</b> and weak non-Baatezus. However, Rumjal appears {{to the world}} as surprisingly good-natured, polite and straightforward devil who enjoys art, dark poetry and wit. He still considers himself a rightful Duke of Hell who temporarily fell from prestige. Now that both Geryon and Cozbi are dead, he wishes to reintegrate the hierarchy of Hell by acting in a loyal, very useful way. This might happen since Asmodeus appreciates him and sometimes plays chess with him for recreation. Rumjal is a tall, heavily muscled, hairless humanoid of gray skin and white horns. He sports a white tail that ends in three curving points.|$|R

5000|$|A {{series of}} {{articles}} appearing in Dragon in 1983 greatly expanded upon the devils and their home, the Nine Hells, and presented numerous new devils and arch-devils. The article [...] "From the Sorcerer's Scroll: New Denizens of Devildom" [...] by Gary Gygax in Dragon #75 (July 1983) introduced the black abishai, blue abishai, green abishai, red abishai, and white abishai (<b>lesser</b> <b>devil),</b> the bearded devil (<b>lesser</b> <b>devil),</b> the spined devil (least devil), the princess of Hell Glasya, the dukes of Hell Amon, Bael, Bitru, Hutijin, and Titivilus, and the arch devils Belial, Mammon, Mephistopheles, and Moloch. Dozens of unique devils appeared in a two-part article by Ed Greenwood, including the greater devils Bist, Caim, and Nergal, the dukes of Hell Agares, Alocer, Amduscias, Arioch, Balan, Bathym, Biffant, Caarcrinolaas, Chamo, Focalor, Gaziel, Gorson, Herodias, Machalas, Malphas, Melchon, and Merodach, and the princesses of Hell Cozbi, Lilis, and Naome in [...] "The Nine Hells Part I" [...] in Dragon #75, and the dukes of Hell Abigor, Adonides, Barbas, Barbatos, Bele, Bifrons, Bileth, Buer, Bune, Morax, Neabaz, Rimmon, Tartach, Zagum, and Zepar, the princesses of Hell Baalphegor, Baftis, and Lilith, the chancellor of Hell Adramalech, the queen of Hell Bensozia, and the inquisitor of Hell Phongor in [...] "The Nine Hells Part II" [...] in Dragon #76 (August 1983).|$|E
60|$|What a World do we inhabit! {{where there}} is not only with us a great Roaring-Lyon-Devil daily seeking whom of us he may devour, and innumerable Millions of <b>lesser</b> <b>Devils</b> {{hovering}} in the whole Atmosphere over us, nay, and for ought we know, other Millions always invisibly moving about us, and perhaps in us, {{or at least in}} many of us; but that have, besides all these, a vast many counterfeit Hocus Pocus Devils; human Devils, who are visible among us, of our own Species and Fraternity, conversing with us upon all Occasions; who like Mountebanks set up their Stages in every Town, chat with us at every Tea-Table, converse with us in every Coffee-House, and impudently tell us to our Faces that they are Devils, boast of it, and use a thousand Tricks and Arts to make us believe it too, and that too often with Success.|$|R
5000|$|In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy roleplaying game, [...] "rabble of devilkin" [...] {{is a term}} {{applied to}} the <b>lesser</b> unique outcast <b>devils</b> {{dwelling}} on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main part}} of the story, in which the focus is on Tivisoc and Tivismoc, sees the unborn boys {{accompanying}} their future father on a quest to find a suitable mother, and later their trip to the mill, where they seem prone to do all things backwards and manage to literally lose their own heads (having to recover them from hungry dogs). The real adventure starts when birds transport them to Scaunu dreptății ("The Seat of Justice"), a mock version of the Last Judgment, which provides the setting for anticlerical jokes and satire of Christian mythology: God is depicted as aging and incompetent, Jesus as a young man [...] "dozing off and scratching his thin beard", Mary as [...] "a middle-aged woman with blue, terrified eyes". The two boys intervene to stop the <b>lesser</b> <b>devils</b> from pulling on the scales to send more people into Hell, but are upset to note that God himself is inclined to pardon a swindling tavern-keeper because he had not kept tabs on a priest. Saint Peter allows the two boys to bribe their way into Heaven, whose human population has been driven to disgust by the endless supply of milk and mămăligă—while in there, they repeat the story of Adam and Eve and taste unpalatable fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. The weight of this sin drags them into Hell, but they are able to easily impress the naīve devils, and eventually drive them away by burning some frankincense (an illustration of the Romanian expression a fugi ca dracul de tămâie, [...] "to run away like a devil from frankincense").|$|R
50|$|The bentfin {{devil ray}}, <b>lesser</b> <b>devil</b> ray, smoothtail devil ray, smoothtail mobula, or Thurston's devil ray (Mobula thurstoni) is {{a species of}} fish in the family Myliobatidae.

It likely occurs in many other locations in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate oceans. It is found both offshore and near the coast.|$|E
40|$|The skin of {{the rays}} Dasyatis uarnak and D. jenkinsii are used as an {{excellent}} source ofleather. It is expensive due to its high durability.

50|$|The site is an {{alluvial}} meadow {{next to the}} River Ray in the Vale of Aylesbury. It has clay soil and is liable to flooding. A regime of a hay cut followed by cattle grazing, {{without the use of}} artificial fertilisers, has resulted in a diverse grassland habitat now rare in England. Herbs include meadow buttercup, <b>lesser</b> knapweed and <b>devil's</b> bit scabious. Ditches and the riverbank provide a permanently wet habitat, encouraging wading birds such as snipe and curlew. Invertebrates include damselflies.|$|R
50|$|The {{period between}} 1605 and 1620 {{may be viewed}} as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had {{produced}} all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy Catiline (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success and the comedies Volpone (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), Epicoene, or the Silent Woman (1609), The Alchemist (1610), Bartholomew Fair (1614) and The Devil is an Ass (1616). The Alchemist and Volpone were immediately successful. Of Epicoene, Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate, since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet Epicoene, along with Bartholomew Fair and (to a <b>lesser</b> extent) The <b>Devil</b> is an Ass have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled {{than it had been in}} the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.|$|R

Some wide-ranging elasmobranch species are frequently reported to occur at topographic highs, which are topographic prominences that rise from the sea floor and provide significant positive and structural relief in an otherwise level landscape. Examples of places where some sharks and rays appear to concentrate include Saint Paul's Rocks, the Bahamas, the Cocos Islands, Galapagos Islands, Hawaiian Islands, Aldabra Atoll, Johnston Atoll, and the Marshall Islands. In the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, an array of topographic highs comprising submerged hard-banks and reefs, and offshore petroleum platforms are notable. Among these features are the Flower Garden Banks, the northernmost coral reef communities on the North American continental shelf, where divers have reported several species of elasmobranchs aggregating. This paper reports on the biological and ecological diversity of elasmobranchs occurring at several topographic highs in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, including the Flower Garden Banks; describes the seasonal habitat use, social organization and behavior of elasmobranchs at the sites surveyed; and evaluates topographic highs as habitat for some elasmobranch species. Species found utilizing the topographic highs surveyed include the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum), whale shark (Rhincodon typus), tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), dusky shark (C. obscurus), Caribbean reef shark (C. perezi), sandbar shark (C. plumbeus), scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini), southern stingray (Dasyatis americana), roughtail stingray (D. centroura), spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari), <b>lesser</b> <b>devil</b> ray (Mobula hypostoma), sicklefin devil ray (M. tarapacana), and manta ray (Manta birostris). Occurrence data indicate these species form three temporal assemblages: the winter pelagics, summer pelagics, and resident assemblages. Data also show that dissimilar topographic highs (mid-shelf, shelf-edge, and artificial shelf-edge) function as seasonal feeding, nursery, or mating habitat for different life stages and species. A model and postulate simplifying elasmobranch-topographic high habitat associations are presented from which future research and conservation plans may be organized...|$|E
