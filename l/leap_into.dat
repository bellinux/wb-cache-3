5|$|Fans were {{enthusiastic}} about winning the Central League, and repeated the celebratory <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> Dōtonbori Canal. However, {{instead of the}} individual leapers representing the players, over 5,300 fans plunged into the canal.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> Dōtonbori {{canal and}} the Curse of the Colonel is usually {{associated}} {{only with a}} Hanshin Tigers victory, in 2002, when Japan beat Tunisia in the World Cup, some 500 fans jumped into the canal as a celebration, in spite of heavy police security.|$|E
5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite {{to continue with the}} next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E

25|$|By 1973, Cargolux {{had five}} CL-44s {{and made the}} <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> the jet age by {{acquiring}} a Douglas DC-8. This enabled the company to speed up its cargo deliveries. In 1974, Loftleiðir and Cargolux amalgamated their maintenance and engineering departments, and by 1975, Cargolux enjoyed new facilities consisting of central offices and two hangars.|$|E
25|$|Yves Klein {{had been}} a {{precursor}} of performance art with the conceptual pieces of Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle (Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility) 1959–62, Anthropométries (1960), and works like the photomontage, Saut dans le vide (<b>Leap</b> <b>into</b> the Void). In the late 1960s Earth artists as diverse as Robert Smithson, Dennis Oppenheim, Michael Heizer and Carl Andre created environmental pieces that predict the performance art of the 1970s. Works of conceptual artists in the early 1980s, like Sol LeWitt, who converted mural-style drawing into an act of performance by others, were influenced by Yves Klein and the Earth artists as well.|$|E
25|$|He bowls {{fast and}} {{obviously}} scorns to conserve his strength. He is {{in a hurry}} to be at the batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> the air—a leap which one feels should be accompanied by a yell. At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E

25|$|Combat in Mass Effect: Andromeda {{takes place}} in real-time, and unlike {{previous}} installments in the series, pausing the game to aim or use skills from a menu {{is no longer a}} feature. During action sequences, the player has direct control of Ryder from an over-the-shoulder perspective, who can move around the battlefield in a variety of ways, including a side-to-side dash or vertical <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> the air using a jetpack. When the player approaches an object, Ryder will automatically take cover, providing the player with protection in battle. The game encourages players to keep moving during combat with large, open battlefields and enemies that attack from all angles, but also allows for both aggressive and defensive strategies.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 1962, {{the group}} was {{reactivated}} as part of 4th Marine Aircraft Wing at Naval Air Station Dallas, and designated a Marine Air Reserve Training Detachment (MARTD). At that time MAG-41 consisted of three fighter squadrons, (VMF-111, VMF-112, VMF-413,) and two medium helicopter squadrons, (HMM-777, HMM-762). The fighter squadrons flew the FJ-4B and AF-1E Fury, while the helicopter squadrons flew the UH-34 Seahorse. The following year, VMF-413 and HMM-762 were deactivated. By August 1963, VMF-111 and VMF-112 made the <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> supersonic flight with the F-8A Crusader. Vought, the manufacturer of the Crusader, had a plant adjacent to the runway of NAS Dallas, making the transition more than convenient for squadron pilots and support personnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} {{this version of the}} story is that the 18-pounders were on the lower deck, so it would take a very lucky drop to reach them from high above. Captain Pearson speculated that either a grenade had been thrown {{through a hole in the}} hull, from Bonhomme Richard’s gun deck, or that the charge had been ignited by accident. Whatever the cause, the effect was devastating. As the ignited charge blew up, it {{scattered}} burning gunpowder, setting off other charges nearby, and ultimately the chain reaction covered the entire rear half of Serapis’ lower gun-deck, killing or severely burning many of the gunnery crewmen, forcing some to <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> the sea to extinguish their burning clothes, and putting five guns out of action. In the confusion, some of the crew clambering back on board after jumping into the sea were nearly mistaken for American boarders.|$|E

25|$|In either case, {{the voices}} from the Well reveal that Corypheus' dragon {{is the key to}} {{stopping}} him; it is not a true Archdemon but a facsimile of one, and Corypheus has invested so much of his power in creating it that if the beast is killed, then Corypheus' ability to <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> other bodies would be disrupted, rendering him vulnerable. The Inquisitor then confronts Corypheus as he reopens the Breach, forcing a final confrontation, and defeats Corypheus and his dragon, resealing the Breach permanently and hurling the darkspawn magister to the Fade, destroying his physical body in the process. After finding Corypheus's orb destroyed, a dismayed Solas departs the Inquisition. The epilogue, narrated by Morrigan, details the outcomes of the Inquisitor's decisions for the Mage-Templar war, the Grey Wardens, and the leadership of Orlais. Depending on the player's choices, either Cassandra, Leliana or Vivienne can be appointed as the new Divine, taking on the title of Divine Victoria.|$|E
25|$|That same evening, {{his fellow}} friends, about 25 {{students}} from the medical and dental faculties of the College of Medicine decided to give Yoong a proper burial within {{the grounds of the}} hospital. One of the five trenches dug out earlier for air raid purposes was converted into a grave for Yoong. As the grave was being prepared, they were spotted by Japanese gunners which began pouring a heavy barrage of shells at the defenceless students. Some quick-footed students managed to flee to safety towards the College building. However, those left behind only had time to <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> the trenches and Yoong's grave. As a result, 11 of the students were killed, three were wounded and only two managed to escape injury in the aftermath. Those who were killed instantaneously were given a burial on the morning of 16 February, a day after the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese, in the trenches where they fell.|$|E
25|$|Greenhough first {{played for}} Lancashire {{as early as}} 1951, after coming from the League club Fieldhouse, but until 1956 he played very little for the first eleven. That season, however, he took 66 wickets for less than {{eighteen}} runs apiece, and formed a remarkable trio of spinners with Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton. In 1957, however, Greenhough seemed to lack spin and in 1958 played only eight games out of twenty eight for the first eleven. It was thus a surprise that, in the dry summer of 1959, Greenhough was able to not only displace both Tattersall and Hilton, but even <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> the Test side against India. Although he did well even when India's lack of batting prowess was taken into account, Greenhough was soon reported for persistently running down the pitch during his follow-through. Once Greenhough corrected this problem he bowled as well as before. Greenhough's record of 93 wickets in eighteen county games suggested that, had he not missed five games correcting his run-up, he would probably have taken around 150 wickets, which would have made him the leading wicket-taker in England.|$|E

500|$|The {{existence}} of the gaming engine surprised many critics when it was unveiled in E3 2012. Kotaku described the graphics of the game engine preview as [...] "jaw dropping" [...] and [...] "stunning", and called it a real competitor to Unreal Engine 4. VG24/7 called the graphics [...] "drop dead gorgeous". IGN cited the technology as a [...] "hurdling <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> the future", and other reviews emphasised realistic 3D modeling of the human eye and real time rendering of graphics.|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez {{describes}} Lennon's [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] as [...] "the greatest <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> the future" [...] of the Beatles' recording career {{up to this}} point. The recording includes reverse guitar, processed vocals, and looped tape effects, accompanying {{a strongly}} syncopated, repetitive drum-beat. Lennon adapted the lyrics from Timothy Leary's book , which equates the realisations brought about through LSD with the spiritually enlightened state achieved through meditation. Originally recorded as [...] "Mark I", the eventual title came via a Ringo Starr malapropism.|$|E
500|$|Donnelly {{considered}} Octavarium to be [...] "somewhere between Images and Words, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and Train of Thought".

[...] Tammy La Gorce of AllMusic noted that [...] "a post-hardcore edge - call it a <b>leap</b> <b>into</b> 2005 - has invaded [...] pledge of allegiance to theatrical heavy rock... What's changed is Dream Theater's commitment to carrying on their reputation as underground progressive rock's classicists, and it seems well-timed." [...] Critics noted a strong Muse influence on some tracks, on some cases generating negative reviews.|$|E
