25|$|Intuitively, {{this means}} that we can express the jet of a curve through p {{in terms of its}} Taylor series in <b>local</b> <b>coordinates</b> on M.|$|E
25|$|<b>Local</b> <b>{{coordinates}}</b> mean {{a set of}} coordinates {{that travel}} with the particle, and have orientation determined by {{the path of the}} particle. Unit vectors are formed as shown in the image at right, both tangential and normal to the path. This coordinate system sometimes is referred to as intrinsic or path coordinates or nt-coordinates, for normal-tangential, referring to these unit vectors. These coordinates are a very special example of a more general concept of <b>local</b> <b>coordinates</b> from the theory of differential forms.|$|E

[...] Note that the Christoffel symbol does not transform as a tensor, {{but rather as}} an object in the jet bundle. More precisely, the Christoffel symbols {{can be considered as}} functions on the jet bundle of the frame bundle of , independent of any <b>local</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. Choosing a <b>local</b> <b>coordinate</b> system determines a local section of this bundle, which can then be used to pull back the Christoffel symbols to functions on , though of course these functions then depend on the choice of <b>local</b> <b>coordinate</b> system.|$|R
25|$|D is an {{elliptic}} {{differential operator}} from E to F. So in <b>local</b> <b>coordinates</b> {{it acts as}} a differential operator, taking smooth sections of E to smooth sections of F.|$|E
25|$|If M and N are two smooth manifolds, how do {{we define}} the jet of a {{function}} ? We could perhaps attempt to define such a jet by using <b>local</b> <b>coordinates</b> on M and N. The disadvantage {{of this is that}} jets cannot thus be defined in an equivariant fashion. Jets do not transform as tensors. Instead, jets of functions between two manifolds belong to a jet bundle.|$|E
25|$|Thus the {{differential}} is a linear transformation, between tangent spaces, associated to the smooth map φ at each point. Therefore, in some chosen <b>local</b> <b>coordinates,</b> it {{is represented by}} the Jacobian matrix of the corresponding smooth map from Rm to Rn. In general {{the differential}} need not be invertible. If φ is a local diffeomorphism, then the pushforward at x is invertible and its inverse gives the pullback of T'φ(x)N.|$|E

25|$|A (topological) {{surface is}} a topological {{space in which}} every point has an open {{neighbourhood}} homeomorphic to some open subset of the Euclidean plane E2. Such a neighborhood, together with the corresponding homeomorphism, {{is known as a}} (coordinate) chart. It is through this chart that the neighborhood inherits the standard coordinates on the Euclidean plane. These coordinates are known as <b>local</b> <b>coordinates</b> and these homeomorphisms lead us to describe surfaces as being locally Euclidean.|$|E
