On the other hand, bad manual lifting can generate pain in several operator body segments, such as hand, back, waist and thigh. Leave from those reality, it is needed to do some working method analysis and improvement based on biomechanical principle. NIOSH method used to know <b>lifting</b> <b>safety</b> limit and Chaffin-Anderson equation used to predictable the force that happened on abdominal segment, L 5 /S 1 and operators hand segment. This study shows that RWL value for lifting to pick up car is 8, 223 kg and lifting to the box car is 6, 208 kg. The LI value for lifting to pick up car is 2, 311 and for lifting to box car is 3, 060. The improvement of working method was done by rearrange the gallon position and add amount of table. The high of the table is 52 cm and the gallon position would be in front of operator sagital line exactly. This improvement changes RWL value for lifting to pick up become 13, 820 kg and 11, 475 kg for lifting to the box car. LI value for lifting to the pick up descend become 1, 374 and LI value for lifting to the box car become 1, 6557. Keywords : manual lifting, biomechanical, RWL, LI, L 5 /S 1 segment...|$|E

50|$|From {{the time}} it was built one shaft was {{specifically}} used by the British Standards Institution (BSI) for type testing of <b>lift</b> <b>safety</b> components at the time under the BS5655 and BS EN81 standards. Safety Gear testing involved putting the lift cars (frame) into free fall conditions with rated mass at tripping speeds as required by the designers of the safety gear to ensure the lift cars decelerated and stopped within the requirements of the standard. Buffer testing involved impacting them with the maximum and minimum mass at tripping speeds to ensure decelerations were within that requirement by the standard in both cases the aim was to ensure if the lift ever went into free fall or uncontrolled downward movement the safety components stopped the lift without causing any serious injury to the occupant. BSI ceased using the test tower soon after the site was acquired for housing in 1997-98.|$|R

40|$|Gas lift valves {{are widely}} used in oil {{production}} fields to pump recycled gas and nitrogen into the production tubing, to sustain production by aerating the oil and lifting {{it to the ground}} or sea surface. Today's industry standard, a pressure-actuated valve, is susceptible to various modes of failure, including corrosion and jamming. Safety mechanisms are needed to seal the valve in case of a backflow event, in which oil flows backward through the production tubing. Since human monitoring is difficult to implement at deep level underground, these safety mechanisms have to be highly sensitive and autonomous. This thesis documents the design of an electronically-actuated gas <b>lift</b> <b>safety</b> system that builds on a prior invention based on shape-memory alloy, but, among other features, can handle the slowly changing temperature conditions downhole. The newly-designed control circuit is integrated into the original shape memory alloy (SMA) scheme. The selection criteria and features of various sensors in this circuit are reviewed in relation to oil's physical and chemical characteristics. System functionality is proved through model-scale prototype testing within a controlled environment. At the same time, the system is modeled with heat transfer and structural analysis to predict its behavior in different environments with air or water, or their mixture with oil. Overall, our concept satisfies many of the key operational needs in artificial gas lift. by Changkuan Yu. Thesis (S. M.)
