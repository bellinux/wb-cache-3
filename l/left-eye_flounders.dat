5000|$|As {{with most}} <b>left-eye</b> <b>flounders</b> {{they can change}} the color and pattern of their dark side to match the {{surrounding}} bottom, and are also capable of rapidly burrowing into muddy or sandy bottoms. The back, which may vary in overall color from light brown to dark gray, is marked with four large and quite conspicuous black [...] "eye-like" [...] spots edged with a much lighter color, two of them situated at each margin of the body. The teeth are sharp and well developed. The underside is pale pinkish, almost translucent in certain areas. Data collected from fishing trawlers suggests adults average about 10 to 12 inches long with 16 inches likely being the maximum size. Adults are predatory and mostly piscivorous, preying on any small fish such as sand lance and Atlantic silverside, as well as squid.|$|E
50|$|Paralichthys dentatus (Linnaeus, 1766), {{also called}} a fluke, {{is a member}} of the large-tooth {{flounder}} family Paralichthyidae. There are typically 5 to 14 ocellated (eye-like) spots on the body. Like most members of the <b>left-eye</b> <b>flounders,</b> they can change the color and pattern of their dark side to match the surrounding bottom, and are also capable of rapidly burrowing into muddy or sandy bottoms. The teeth are quite sharp and well developed on both upper and lower jaws. The average summer flounder reaches sexual maturity at 2 years and weighs 1 to 3 pounds, typically 15 to 20 inches in length, though they may grow as large as 26 pounds and live up to 20 years with females making up the largest and oldest specimens. Adults are highly predatory and considered mostly piscivorous, often lying buried with only their head exposed to ambush prey which includes sand lance, menhaden, atlantic silverside, mummichog killifish, small bluefish, porgies, squid, shrimp, and crabs. While primarily considered a bottom fish, they are rapid swimmers over short distances and can become very aggressive, feeding actively at middepths, even chasing prey to the surface.|$|E
50|$|The fine {{flounder}} {{was first}} collected by Charles Darwin in the Galapagos Islands and {{was described in}} 1842 as Hippoglossus kingii, which would have placed it in the <b>left-eye</b> <b>flounder</b> family. However, the description of H. kingii has been determined to lack sufficient information to absolutely determine which species it describes and is thus considered ambiguous and therefore is not valid.|$|R
