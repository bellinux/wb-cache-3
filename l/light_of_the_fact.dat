5|$|By {{the time}} Hope was exhibited, Watts had already {{committed}} himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, {{and although he}} received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include Hope in this donation, in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it was already being considered {{one of his most}} important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy {{more than any}} other Dharmic faith loses more credence when viewed in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of The World as Will and Representation in 1818. Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism. They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence. Other scholarly work questions how similar Schopenhauer's philosophy actually is to Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|Single-mother and lower-class {{families}} {{have a much}} more difficult time negotiating childcare or finding sustainable childcare options. The breadwinner-homemaker family and economic model does not apply to single-parent families because the single-parent must be both roles at all times. Because child care services cost a substantial amount, low-income mothers spend a higher percentage of their income on child care than middle class mothers do. Few low-income mothers are happy with their childcare arrangements especially in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that low-income childcare arrangements suffer from frequent disruptions. In the United States, state assistance for childcare is nowhere near the level of other developed countries and has actually decreased.|$|E

Coward went to St. James's Palace to plead his case by acting out the play himself and assuring the censor that with artful direction the scene would be presented in a dignified and unobjectionable manner.

25|$|In China, {{due to the}} {{political}} situation, research on the Kaifeng Jews and Judaism in China came to a standstill {{until the beginning of}} the 1980s, when political and economic reforms were implemented. In the 1980s, the Sino-Judaic Institute was founded by an international group of scholars to further research the history of the Jewish communities in China, promote educational projects related to the history of the Jews in China and assist the extant Jews of Kaifeng. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Israel in 1992 rekindled interest in Judaism and the Jewish experience, especially in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that 25,000 Jewish refugees fled to Shanghai during the Nazi period.|$|E
25|$|In <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir since 1908 and {{exhibited}} with Georges Braque at Berthe Weill's gallery, introduced to Picasso by Max Jacob and Guillaume Krotowsky (who already signed his works Guillaume Apollinaire), and {{in view of}} the similarities between the two works, it is probable that Metzinger's Bathers was painted the same year; 1908. The differences between the two paintings suggest that, while Metzinger may have been influenced by Picasso (unlike Albert Gleizes), his intention was certainly not to copy or even resemble the Spaniard, as would soon Braque (or visa versa). His intention was to create his own brand of art, dependent on his own lived experience.|$|E

With this, the increasing demand for psychological and counseling assistance can be better attended to, and made available to university students in need.|$|R

25|$|Cysteine {{residues}} {{in class}} III β-tubulin are {{actively involved in}} regulating ligand interactions and microtubule formation. Proteomic analysis has revealed that many factors bound to these cysteine residues {{are involved in the}} oxidative stress and glucose deprivation response. This is particularly interesting in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that class III β-tubulin first appears in the phylogenetic tree when life emerged from the seas and cells were exposed to atmospheric oxygen. In structural terms, constitutive Class I (TUBB) and Class IVb (TUBB2C) β-tubulins contain a cysteine at position 239, while βIII-tubulin has a cysteine at position 124. Position 239 can be readily oxidized while position 124 is relatively resistant to oxidation. Thus, a relative abundance of βIII-tubulin in situations of oxidative stress could provide a protective benefit.|$|E
25|$|Don Giovanni was {{originally}} {{to have been}} performed on 14 October 1787 for a visit to Prague of the Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, niece of the Emperor Joseph II, and her new husband, Prince Anthony of Saxony; however, the production could not be prepared in time and Le nozze di Figaro was substituted instead {{on the order of}} the emperor himself. The score was completed on 28 or 29 October 1787 after Da Ponte was recalled to Vienna to work on another opera. Reports about the last-minute completion of the overture conflict; some say it was completed the day before the premiere, some on the very day. More likely it was completed the day before, in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Mozart recorded the completion of the opera on 28 October.|$|E
25|$|Rajah Buayan City (1966): Under Republic Act No. 4413, the then-municipality of General Santos in {{what was}} then the unified {{province}} of Cotabato was to be formally converted into a city named after a historical ruler in Mindanao on January 1, 1966, provided that majority of qualified voters in the municipality vote in favor of cityhood in a plebiscite. In December 1965 the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) proclaimed the cityhood of Rajah Buayan, with 4,422 people voting for and 3,066 voting against. However, two residents of the new city challenged this by arguing in the courts that {{the number of people who}} voted in favor of cityhood did not form a majority in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there were 15,727 voters in the city. The court issued an injunction on January 4, 1966 restraining city officers from performing any acts authorized by or pursuant to provisions in RA 4413. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld this decision on October 29, 1966 and declared that the city charter was not accepted by majority of voters, thus rendering RA 4413 null and void. The municipality of General Santos would later be converted into a city under the same name in 1968.|$|E

When Black Flag returned to the East Coast in 1981, Rollins attended as many of their concerts as he could. At an impromptu show in a New York bar, Black Flag's vocalist Dez Cadena allowed Rollins to sing [...] "Clocked In", a song Rollins had asked the band to play in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he had to drive back to Washington, D.C. to begin work.|$|E

[...] In the essay [...] "Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality" [...] (2007), Abigail Luthmann views the character less favorably, stating that [...] "he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low-visibility disguise for her crime-fighting alter-ego, and while her information-locating skills may have been useful to her extra-curricular activities no direct examples are given." ...|$|E
500|$|Among the {{influences}} of the verdict include Sega v. Accolades effect on the criteria for fair use and the responsibilities of trademark holders in legal examinations. [...] Although Accolade had copied entire Genesis games {{in order to identify}} the TMSS, the court gave little weight to the criterion on the amount of the copyrighted work being copied, in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Accolade had done so in order to create their own compatible software. [...] Likewise, the nature of the work was also given less weight, essentially establishing a two-factor approach to evaluating fair use in the purpose of use and impact on the market.
