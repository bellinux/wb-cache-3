5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{the stars}} of TGS, decide {{they want to help}} the sick crew. They think about getting the crew soup but are too lazy to do it; instead they decide that <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very {{unsuccessful}} show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over the crew, as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating her for it.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, actor Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{nominated}} for a Golden Globe Award {{for his role in}} the drama feature Hard To Watch but realizes that in order to win the award he needs to act as a serious actor. As a result, Tracy buys the rights to his new comedy movie, The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas, in order to block the distribution of the feature and improve his chances at winning the award. Later, Tracy decides to do a charity event by screening Hard To Watch—a story of an inner-city boy living in the ghetto—for a women's shelter. At the charity event, Tracy introduces the movie but decides against showing it, realizing that <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> the best medicine and instead screens The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas. The people in the shelter find the movie hilarious thus making Tracy happy.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{the level}} of {{stimulation}} current increased the duration and intensity of laughter.For example, at low currents only a smile was present, while at higher currents a louder, contagious <b>laughter</b> <b>was</b> induced.

25|$|The Prahasanas(broad farces) of Chilakamarti can be {{classified}} into three kinds. As a matter of rule and as the word Prahasana connotes, it should create much laughter and hence known as a broad farce. Even a farce must have a purpose. Unless it conveys a message, it cannot be called genuine Prahasana. Keeping this in view, Chilakamarti wrote almost half of his prahasanas with specific aim of conveying a message. The second category is purely {{for the sake of}} farce; loud <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> sometimes produced by mere dialogue and its articulation. The third category is much like an essay through which comment and caustic criticism is offered on the evils prevailing in the society.|$|E
25|$|Chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans show laughter-like vocalizations in {{response}} to physical contact, such as wrestling, play-chasing, or tickling. This is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees. Common chimpanzee <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> not readily recognisable to humans as such, because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and panting. Instances in which nonhuman primates have expressed joy have been reported. One study analyzed and recorded sounds made by human babies and bonobos when tickled. Although the bonobo's laugh was a higher frequency, the laugh followed a pattern {{similar to that of}} human babies and included similar facial expressions. Humans and chimpanzees share similar ticklish areas of the body, such as the armpits and belly. The enjoyment of tickling in chimpanzees does not diminish with age.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{kindness}} towards Mimì, Marcello tries to silence him, {{but she has}} already heard all. Her weeping and coughing reveal her presence, and Rodolfo hurries to her. Musetta's <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> heard and Marcello goes {{to find out what}} has happened. Mimì tells Rodolfo that she is leaving him, and asks that they separate amicably (Mimì: Donde lieta uscì—"From here she happily left"); but their love for one another is too strong for the pair to part. As a compromise, they agree to remain together until the spring, when the world is coming to life again and no one feels truly alone. Meanwhile, Marcello has found Musetta, and the couple quarrel fiercely about Musetta's flirtatiousness: an antithetical counterpoint to the other pair's reconciliation (quartet: Mimì, Rodolfo, Musetta, Marcello: Addio dolce svegliare alla mattina!—"Goodbye, sweet awakening in the morning!").|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} scene, the two aliens Kang and Kodos {{introduce}} a variety show, {{with a live}} audience consisting of aliens. While they tell jokes, canned <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> played, but the audience appears unamused. The Simpson family sits on the couch, with Homer appearing as the jack-in-the-box from [...] "Treehouse of Horror II", Marge as the witch from [...] "Treehouse of Horror VIII", Bart as the half-fly mutant from [...] "Treehouse of Horror VIII". Maggie is the alien/human mutant from [...] "Treehouse of Horror IX" [...] and Lisa {{is the victim of}} an axe murder.

500|$|... "Angel" [...] {{begins with}} a laugh and an echo, panning from left to the right. The song is built on an {{ascending}} hook consisting of three chord sequence, which serves for the verse and chorus. It consists of a constant 8th rhythm throughout the song, making it sound similar to the songs of the band Machine. Vocal harmonies are also added beneath the main chorus. It is a two-bar phrase song, and <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> again added as the song slowly fades out. Madonna sings in her lower register at the beginning, and shifts to the higher one in the line [...] "I {{can see it in}} your e-e-e-eyye-e-s". The line was taken from the song [...] "Death Disco" [...] (1979), by the British musical group Public Image Ltd. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by Alfred Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a medium tempo of 133 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major, with Madonna's voice spanning from the high-note of G3 to the low-note of B4. The song has a basic sequence of Am–Bm–C as its chord progression. The lyrics continuously repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's saviour.|$|E
500|$|Robert Avila of the San Francisco Bay Guardian called The Group: [...] "in-your-face {{comedy in}} a droll send-up of EST-like {{self-actualization}} programs," [...] and a spoof of [...] "recent incarnations" [...] including The Secret and Landmark Forum. Avila gave the play a positive review, noting its [...] "inspired writing, sharp humor, and simple yet slick production". In {{a review of}} the play for the San Jose Mercury News, Karen D'Souza wrote: [...] From est to 'The Secret,' this is a playful lampoon of 'healing philosophies'". D'Souza also reviewed the play positively, writing: [...] " [...] Writer-director Robert Quillen Camp slyly pokes fun at reducing the human experience to one-size-fits-all platitudes and besmirching belief systems with [...] "cash-only" [...] workshops." [...] Pat Craig wrote in Contra Costa Times: [...] "After a lifetime of enduring various human potential programs, from the chanted mantras of transcendental meditation to the institutionalized loathing of est, 'The Group' seems a bit tame for satire to a veteran of the high-profit mind games." [...] In a review for the San Francisco Examiner, Leslie Katz said, [...] "In the end, the show provides excellent therapy. As those who aren't swayed by expensive self-help seminars know, <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> indeed the best medicine." ...|$|E

2500|$|The show {{features}} a laugh track, something Ullman was hesitant about using. [...] "That's a very BBC thing to do. I hate {{things like that}} on a show.

It's not too arch or bleak." [...] All <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> genuine and was captured via live screenings before a studio audience at BBC Radio Theatre.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the primary}} {{expressions}} of the ancient world's conceptions of <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> the text that survives {{in the form of}} apocryphal letters of [...] Hippocrates about Democritus (Hippocratic Corpus, Epistles 10–21). The laughter of Democritus had a philosophical character, being directed at the life of man and at all the vain fears and hopes related to the gods and to life after death. Democritus here made of his laughter a complete conception of the world, a certain spiritual premise of the man who has attained maturity and has awakened. Hippocrates finally perfectly agreed with him.|$|E
2500|$|Crying is {{a normal}} and natural part of grieving. It has also been found, however, that crying {{and talking about the}} loss is not the only healthy {{response}} and, if forced or excessive, can be harmful. Responses or actions in the affected person, called [...] "coping ugly" [...] by researcher George Bonanno, may seem counter-intuitive or even appear dysfunctional, e.g., celebratory responses, laughter, or self-serving bias in interpreting events. Lack of crying is also a natural, healthy reaction, potentially protective of the individual, and may also be seen as a sign of resilience. Science has found that some healthy people who are grieving do not spontaneously talk about the loss. Pressing people to cry or retell the experience of a loss can be harmful. Genuine <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> healthy.|$|E
2500|$|The première of Il Muto {{initially}} goes well, {{until the}} voice of the Phantom suddenly cuts through the performance, enraged that Box 5 was not kept empty for him. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotta reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a [...] "little toad". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces Carlotta's voice to a frog-like croak. Firmin quickly tries to calm the situation by telling the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, moving forward the ballet to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the corpse of Joseph Buquet drops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Firmin and André plead for calm as mayhem erupts and the Phantom's diabolical <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> heard throughout the auditorium ("Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh").|$|E
