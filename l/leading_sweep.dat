50|$|The {{resulting}} design {{featured a}} shoulder-mounted cropped-delta wing with just over 21 ft of span and a leading-edge sweep of about 30 degrees. Cropped-delta elevators were also used, although featuring {{a much greater}} 50 degree <b>leading</b> <b>sweep.</b> The large canopy extended a fair distance above the fuselage midline, in relative terms, so twin rudders were used on either side to provide clean airflow. All of the controls were strictly mechanical, using pushrods. In {{order to deal with}} the increasing control stiffness with increased speed, the design initially specified two control sticks, a small side-stick with limited leverage for low speeds, and a full-sized one mounted in front of the seat with much more leverage for high speeds.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional {{sidewall}} compression scramjet inlets with <b>leading</b> edge <b>sweeps</b> of 30 and 70 degrees {{have been}} tested in the Langley Hypersonic CF 4 Tunnel at Mach 6 and a ratio of specific heats of 1. 2. The effects of cowl position, contraction ratio, and Reynolds number were investigated. The models were instrumented with 42 static pressure orifices distributed on the sidewalls, baseplate, and cowl. Schlieren movies were made of each test for flow visualization of the entrance plane and cowl region. In order to obtain an approximate characterization of the flow field, a modification to two-dimensional inviscid oblique shock theory was derived to accommodate the three-dimensional effects of <b>leading</b> edge <b>sweep.</b> This theory qualitatively predicted the reflected shock structure/sidewall impingement locations and the observed increase in spillage (flow upturning) with increasing <b>leading</b> edge <b>sweep.</b> The primary effect of moving the cowl forward is capturing the flow which would have otherwise spilled out ahead of the cowl. Increasing the contraction ratio (moving the sidewalls closer together) increases the number of internal shock reflections and hence incrementally increases the sidewall pressure distribution. Significant Reynolds number effects were noted over a small range of Reynolds number...|$|R

This report gives results of Phase 2 where the analyses were extended to include maneuvers flown at wing <b>leading</b> edge <b>sweep</b> values of 50 and 75. 5 degrees at subsonic and supersonic speeds and the responses examined were expanded to include vertical shear, bending moment, and hingeline torque of {{the left and right}} horizontal tails.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{characteristics}} of canard, tailless, and aft tail configurations were compared in tests on a general research model (generic fuselage without canopy, inlets, or vertical tails) at Mach 1. 60 and 2. 00 in the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel. Two uncambered wing planforms (trapezoidal with 44 deg <b>leading</b> edge <b>sweep</b> and delta with 60 deg <b>leading</b> edge <b>sweep)</b> were tested for each configuration. The relative {{merits of the}} configurations were also determined theoretically, to evaluate the capabilities of a linear theory code for such analyses. The canard and aft tail configurations have similar measured values for lift curve slope, maximum lift drag ratio, and zero lift drag. The stability decrease as Mach number increases is greatest for the tailless configuration and least for the canard configuration. Because of very limited accuracy in predicting the aerodynamic parameter increments between configurations, the linear theory code is not adequate for determining {{the relative merits of}} canard, tailless, and aft tail configurations...|$|R

Seven wings with <b>leading</b> edge <b>sweep</b> angles from - 20 deg to 60 deg were tested on a common body over an angle of attack range from - 12 deg to 10 deg. All wings had a common span, aspect ratio, taper ratio, planform area, and thickness ratio. Wings were translated longitudinally on the body to make tests possible with the total and exposed mean aerodynamic chords located at a fixed body station. Aerodynamic forces were found to be independent of wing sweep and translation, and pitching moments were constant when the exposed wing mean aerodynamic chord was located at a fixed body station. Thus, the Hypersonic Isolation Principle was verified.

40|$|Extensive {{experimental}} and numerical investigations on a highly swept generic unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) configuration of lambda type with a variable leading edge contour have been conducted. Within these investigations {{it was shown}} that the flow field is dominated by complex vortex systems including vortex-to-vortex and vortex-to-boundary layer interactions. The vortex dominated flow field has a strong nonlinear influence on the aerodynamic behavior of the configuration.

The shock interaction was produced by the intersection of a planar incident shock (16. 8 deg shock angle relative to the freestream, generated by a 9 deg wedge) with the bow shock formed around a O. 5 -inch diameter cylindrical leading edge fin. Heating distributions along the leading edge stagnation line have been obtained using densely spaced thin film resistive-type sensors.
