40|$|The use of {{diffusion}} theory in calculations on photon waves necessitates {{a new look}} at boundary conditions, since the stan-dard boundary conditions have been derived under static conditions. When the underlying process satisfies the transport equation, the proper boundary conditions are obtained by solving the Milne problem. This paper presents benchmark-quality values for extrapolation distances calculated by transport theory, for various values of absorption and three models of the phase function—isotropic, linearly anisotropic and Henyey-Greenstein scattering. The results show that the static boundary conditions are perfectly adequate up to photon wave frequencies of 1 GHz or even more. Specifically, the quantity Σtrd, where Σ′tr = Σtr- ik, where Σtr is the macroscopic transport cross section and k the wave number in the medium and d the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> <b>distance,</b> is essentially independent of frequency over this range. We have also examined the ratio of the diffusion length as given by transport theory to that given by {{diffusion theory}} itself.

This study {{is a continuation of}} a recent paper published as 'A new technique for extracting the red edge position from hyperspectral data: the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> method'. The method was validated experimentally for estimation of foliar nitrogen concentrations of rye, maize and mixed grass/herb. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the utility of the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> method under different conditions including variable canopy biophysical parameters, solar zenith angle, sensor noise and spectral bandwidth. REPs were extracted from synthetic canopy spectra that were simulated using properties optique spectrales des feuilles (PROSPECT) and scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves (SAILH) radiative transfer models. REPs extracted by the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> method involving wavebands at 680, 694, 724 and 760 nm produced the highest correlation (R 2 = 0. 75) with leaf chlorophyll content with minimal effects of leaf and canopy biophysical confounders (leaf area index, leaf inclination distribution and leaf dry matter content) compared to traditional techniques including the linear interpolation, inverted Gaussian modelling and polynomial fitting techniques. In addition, the new technique is insensitive to changes in solar zenith angle. However, the advantage of using the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> method compared to the various alternative methods diminishes with increasing sensor noise and decreasing spectral resolution. In summary, the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> technique confirms its high potential for leaf chlorophyll estimation.

While system-size-independent thermal conductivities {{can be obtained}} with less than 1000 atoms for both materials using the GK method, the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> procedure [Schelling et al., Phys. Rev. B 65, 144306 (2002) ] must be applied to direct method results for multiple system sizes.

To understand this discrepancy, we perform lattice dynamics calculations to predict phonon properties and from these, length-dependent thermal conductivities. From these results, we find that the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> procedure is only accurate when the minimum system size used in the direct method simulations is comparable to the largest mean-free paths of the phonons that dominate the thermal transport.

40|$|Summary Methods to {{determine}} {{the contribution of the}} chromatographic equipment to the total band broadening which involve replacing the column by a union or a capillary tube are not suitable as they involve a fundamental change in the chromatographic system. The <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> method, based on the estimation of the relative influence of the instrument variance on solutes with different capacity factors, is a more attractive alternative method since the column remains in the chromatographic system. This method is only valid when a number of conditions are satisfied. By meeting these conditions the error in the instrument variance by using the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> method was determined. At the same time, ways to minimise these errors were studied. Use of the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> method in combination with conventional columns of 4. 6 mm i. d. appears to yield inaccurate results. In combination with microbore columns the method can be used, provided the columns have a maximum length of 5 cm and contain a packing material with a particle size of 2 or 3 µm.

In this study, we assessed the utility of a new technique for extracting the REP, the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> method recently proposed by Cho and Skidmore [Remote Sens. Environ. (in press) ]. The assessment was based on synthetic canopy reflectance spectra using the PROSPECT and SAILH models. The models were parameterised to represent a wide range of canopy characteristics. REP calculated by the new method involving wavebands at 680, 694, 724 and 760 nm yielded the highest correlation with leaf chlorophyll content (R 2 = 0. 75) and with minimal effects of leaf and canopy biophysical confounders such as LAI, leaf inclination distribution and leaf dry matter content compared to traditional techniques including the wavelength of maximum first derivative, linear interpolation, inverted Gaussian modelling and third order polynomial fitting, respectively. However, the advantage of using the new method compared to the other REP extraction techniques diminishes with increasing bandwidth. In summary, the <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation</b> technique shows high potential for leaf chlorophyll estimation with {{radiative transfer}} models.

40|$|The {{possible}} risk of induced malignancies in astronauts, as {{a consequence}} of the radiation environment in space, is a factor of concern for long term missions. Cancer risk estimates for high doses of low LET radiation are available from the epidemiological studies of the A-bomb survivors. Cancer risks at lower doses cannot be detected in epidemiological studies and must be inferred by extrapolation from the high dose risks. The standard setting bodies, such as the ICRP recommend a <b>linear,</b> no-threshold <b>extrapolation</b> of risks from high to low doses, but this is controversial. A study of mechanisms of carcinogenesis may shed some light on the validity of a <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation.</b> The multi-step nature of carcinogenesis suggests that the role of radiation may be to induce a mutation leading to a mutator phenotype. High energy Fe ions, such as those encountered in space are highly effective in inducing genomic instability. Experiments involving the single particle microbeam have demonstrated a "bystander effect", ie a biological effect in cells not themselves hit, but in close proximity to those that are, as well as the induction of mutations in cells where only the cytoplasm, and not the nucleus, have been traversed by a charged particle. These recent experiments cast doubt on the validity of a simple <b>linear</b> <b>extrapolation,</b> but the data are so far fragmentary and conflicting. More studies are necessary.
