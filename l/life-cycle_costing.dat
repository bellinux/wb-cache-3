50|$|Variance {{analysis}} is a systematic {{approach to the}} comparison of the actual and budgeted costs of the raw materials and labour used during a production period.

The informal waste sector consists mostly of waste pickers who scavenge for metals, glass, plastic, textiles, and other materials and then trade them for a profit. This sector can significantly alter or reduce waste in a particular system, but other negative economic effects come with the disease, poverty, exploitation, and abuse of its workers.|$|E

40|$|To further {{enhance the}} {{application}} of fiber reinforced composites in construction, {{it will be important}} to assess the <b>life-cycle</b> <b>costs</b> of replacing conventional construction materials with advanced composites. However, the lack of sufficient reference data or maintenance records for advanced-composite applications in construction makes it difficult to make a credible assessment for <b>life-cycle</b> <b>costs.</b> The available reference data are limited to include performance information from recent applications, initial cost figures, some deterioration models, and its material properties. ^ Therefore, a practical method is required that would allow probable assessment of the <b>life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> of advanced composite applications in construction in relation to conventional materials. The overall objective of this research was to develop a performance-based probable <b>life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> assessment model for composite materials in construction. To achieve these objectives, the research focused on a specific application of composites in construction: FRP bridge deck panels. The model thus developed can then be used for other applications of composites in construction. ^ The <b>life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> assessment model for FRP bridge deck panels comprises of a life-cycle performance module (module- 1) and a <b>life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> optimization module (module- 2). The objective of module- 1 is to develop an analytical model that is capable of predicting the structural deterioration over time in order to assess the deterioration rating per year (CR/year) of FRP bridge deck panels. The objective of module- 2 is to develop an analytical model that is capable of assessing the optimal <b>life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> of FRP bridge deck panels. Three case studies were conducted to validate the logic and results of the process algorithm for the <b>life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> assessment. The main results of this research include: (1) a model for the probable <b>life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> assessment of composite materials in construction; (2) a method for comparative assessment of composite and conventional materials through deterioration models; (3) life-cycle performance curves at three levels: material, component, and structural levels; (4) performance enhancement due to MR 2 ̆ 6 R actions; (5) feasible MR 2 ̆ 6 R strategies for composite materials; (6) a method for analyzing the <b>life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> issues of new construction materials, which could potentially affect the future direction of the construction industry as a whole. ...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Atkinson Committee for Terotechnology {{found that it was}} hampered in its task of making recommendations to the Secretary of State for Industry {{due to the lack of}} research and information regarding the application, by manufacturing industry, of terotechnological practices. It was this lack of research and information which provided a major justification for pursuing this research work. This research has attempted to provide a contribution to our knowledge in the fields of terotechnology and <b>life-cycle</b> <b>costing.</b> This has been achieved by investigating the historical development of terotechnology, examining the way in which the concept should be interpreted, developing a 'levels-of-care' model and, by industrial field research, examining the extent to which. terotechnological practices, as defined within this dissertation, have been applied by manufacturing industry. The field work was based on a sample of six manufacturing organisations in which detailed research was undertaken. A further sixteen organisations were visited to obtain a more general and wider view of application. The comparative organisational analysis, was based on the differences observed due to differing levels of production system mechanisation. The results of the field research are presented and comparisons made, to the limited extent possible, with the findings of other work. A major part of the terotechnological approach to physical asset life-cycle management is based on the comparative economic evaluation of assets over their life-cycles. <b>Life-cycle</b> <b>costing</b> is a quantitative economic evaluation technique which can be used for such comparisons. The historical development of <b>life-cycle</b> <b>costing</b> has been determined. A postal questionnaire survey,of experienced practitioners in the United States and Sweden, was undertaken to determine the general body of knowledge and experience required to utilise the technique. The results of the survey are presented. One of the major constraints on the application of <b>life-cycle</b> <b>costing</b> has been the lack of any procedural model to facilitate such application within manufacturing industry. This research has conceived and developed such a procedural model. An example of the application of the model,based on real data, is presented. Future developments in the concept and practice of terotechnology and <b>life-cycle</b> <b>costing</b> are postulated. Suggestions for further research work are outlined...|$|E

40|$|In a {{decision-making}} framework {{within the}} context of performance-based design, <b>life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> can be regarded as a suitable benchmark performance variable to quantify and measure performance objectives for a set of (discrete) limit states. <b>Life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> criteria is identified as an economic term expressed in monetary units; it accounts for the initial construction costs, the repair costs taking into account also the loss of revenue due to down time, and finally the maintenance <b>cost.</b> The expected <b>life-cycle</b> <b>cost</b> is used for retrofit design of an existing reinforced concrete bridge infrastructure that is located in south of Italy.

Several {{recent studies have}} recognized {{the potential benefits of}} <b>Life-Cycle</b> <b>Cost</b> analysis and call for use of such analyses when making infrastructure investments, including investments in bridges. The <b>Life-Cycle</b> <b>Cost</b> of a bridge consists of the total investment throughout the life of the bridge.

The ability to accurately determine the <b>Life-Cycle</b> <b>Cost</b> of a bridge will help agencies evaluate the asset value of existing bridges, make better decisions on the design and construction of new ones, and choose improved methods and approaches for rehabilitating existing structures. Research has shown that timely maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation can lower the <b>Life-Cycle</b> <b>Cost</b> of a bridge. However, this is a complex and nonlinear problem, and previous studies have failed to develop a satisfactory model. One effective technique for solving nonlinear problems with complicated functions is an Artificial Neural Network.
