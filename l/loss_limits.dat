50|$|In health insurance, {{coinsurance}} {{is sometimes}} used synonymously with copayment, but copayment is fixed while the coinsurance is a percentage that the insurer pays after the insurance policy's deductible is exceeded, {{up to the}} policy's stop loss. It can be expressed {{as a pair of}} percentages with the insurer's portion stated first, or just a single percentage showing what the insured pays. The percentage due from the insured can range up to 100% (100% meaning the insured pays all costs until reaching the out of pocket maximum). Once the insured's out-of-pocket expenses equal the stop loss the insurer will assume responsibility for 100% of any additional costs. 70-30, 80-20, and 90-10 insurer-insured coinsurance schemes are common, with stop <b>loss</b> <b>limits</b> of $1,000 to $3,000 after which the insurer covers all expenses.|$|E
50|$|Responsible Gambling Features (RGFs) are {{features}} that online gambling sites use to promote responsible behavior and harm minimization. These include limiting amounts {{that can be}} bet or deposited over a designated period of time, self-assessment tests for gambling problems, and warning signs of prolonged play or high expenditure. RGFs are usually opt in features for players and are required by certain jurisdictions. For example, Denmark Germany, and Spain operators must provide deposit limits, but Australian operators only have to do so voluntarily. A sample of online poker players from Sweden indicated that Responsible Gaming Features increase their trust of a company and reduce their anxiety about winning from other players. However, in jurisdictions that mandate Responsible Gambling Features, {{only a small percentage}} of customers use them. In Australia, 0.8% used the deposit limit on SportsBet and 6% used deposit <b>loss</b> <b>limits</b> on BetFair Australia.|$|E

40|$|When riverboat casinos began {{operating}} in Iowa in April 1991 a strict regulatory struc-ture, consisting of mandated sailing, wagering and <b>loss</b> <b>limits,</b> and casino space restric-tions, was imposed.

40|$|Abstract. Traders {{with short}} horizons and privately known <b>loss</b> <b>limits</b> {{interact}} {{in a market}} for a risky asset. Risk-averse, long horizon traders generate a downward sloping residual demand curve that faces the short-horizon traders. When the price falls close to the <b>loss</b> <b>limits</b> of the short horizon traders, selling of the risky asset by any trader increases the incentives for others to sell. Sales become mutually reinforcing among the short term traders, and payoffs analogous to a bank run are generated. A “liquidity black hole ” is the analogue of the run outcome in a bank run model. Short horizon traders sell because others sell. Using global game techniques, we solve for the unique trigger {{point at which the}} liquidity black hole comes into existence. Empirical implications include the sharp V-shaped pattern in prices {{around the time of the}} liquidity black hole. 1...|$|E

40|$|Motivation: As an {{insurance}} regulator, I regularly see instances where maximum <b>limit</b> <b>losses</b> {{are removed from}} incurred and/or paid losses prior to application of the development factors. In some of these instances, the triangles and LDFs are created with <b>limited</b> <b>losses,</b> as opposed to unlimited losses. Method: This paper simulates loss development triangles that include maximum <b>limit</b> <b>losses.</b> It compares exclusion vs. inclusion of maximum <b>limit</b> <b>losses</b> to show how each option affects {{the accuracy of the}} results. This paper provides simulated empirical probabilities obtained by randomly dispersing large losses throughout a triangle, then calculating the ultimate <b>limited</b> <b>losses</b> by two different methods. Conclusion: If limited LDFs are calculated using triangles that include truncated maximum <b>limit</b> <b>losses,</b> then excluding maximum <b>limit</b> <b>losses</b> prior to application of the LDF produces an understated ultimate and reserve...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide new}} data {{on capital gains}} realizations using a five-year {{stratified}} panel of taxpayers covering 1985 - 1989. We find, as earlier studies have, that capital gains realizations are very concentrated among the highest income groups. We use these data and data from the Federal Reserve Board Survey of Consumer Finances to draw inferences from a simulation model of the effects on progressivity and efficiency of alternative tax treatment of capital gains. Tax payments alone are not an accurate indication {{of the burden of}} a tax. Taxes generally create costs beyond the dollar value collected by causing persons to change their behavior to avoid the tax. Risk is also affected by the tax system. Beneficial risk-sharing characteristics of the tax system are frequently overlooked when examining the treatment of capital gains, We find that reforms comprising reductions in the capital gains tax rate offset by increases in the tax rate on other investment income are efficiency reducing. Surprisingly, we find that for taxpayers for whom <b>loss</b> <b>limits</b> are not binding a switch to accrual taxation is also efficiency reducing. For those taxpayers for whom <b>loss</b> <b>limits</b> are potentially binding, we find that large efficiency gains can be achieved by increasing the amount of capital losses that may be deducted against ordinary income. These results are partly attributable to changes in risk-sharing encompassed in these reforms. ...|$|E
