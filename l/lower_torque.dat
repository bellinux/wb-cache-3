2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2008, another world-first [...] seven-speed DSG {{transaxle}} (Volkswagen Group internal code: DQ200, parts code prefix: 0AM) became available. [...] It differs from the six-speed DSG, in that it uses two single-plate dry clutches (of similar diameter). This clutch pack was designed by LuK Clutch Systems, Gmbh. This seven-speed DSG is used in smaller front-wheel-drive cars with smaller-displacement engines with <b>lower</b> <b>torque</b> outputs, such as the latest Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Polo Mk5, and the new SEAT Ibiza. It has been paired to engines with up to [...] It has considerably less oil capacity than the six-speed DQ250; this new DQ200 uses just [...] of transmission fluid.|$|E
2500|$|Dual-clutch {{transmissions}} use two {{fundamentally different}} types of clutches: either two wet multiplate clutches, bathed in oil (for cooling), or two dry single-plate clutches. The wet clutch design is generally used for higher torque engines that can generate [...] and more (the wet multiplate clutch DCT in the Bugatti Veyron is designed to cope with [...] ), whereas the dry-clutch design is generally suitable for smaller vehicles with <b>lower</b> <b>torque</b> outputs up to [...] However, while the dry-clutch variants may be limited in torque compared to their wet-clutch counterparts, the dry-clutch versions offer an increase in fuel efficiency, {{due to the lack}} of pumping losses of the transmission fluid in the clutch housing.|$|E
2500|$|The type of {{work they}} do means that they require a [...] "slip-clutch" [...] which engages when the drill bit jams and {{sufficient}} torque is put onto the [...] "slip-clutch" [...] mechanism. [...] This stops the violent wrenching motion that a drill without a clutch would cause when stopped suddenly from full speed, protecting the drill from damage. [...] The slip-clutch also protects the operator, but does not always prevent injury. [...] Some manufacturers have introduced additional technology to protect the operator. [...] Hilti has a technology called [...] "ATC" [...] or [...] "Active Torque Control" [...] which works by disengaging the drive from the motor when the tool body begins to rotate excessively through the action of a secondary magnetic clutch {{in addition to the}} standard slip-clutch. [...] DeWALT has a related system called [...] "CTC" [...] or [...] "Complete Torque Control" [...] which utilizes a two-position slip-clutch so that the operator can select the <b>lower</b> <b>torque</b> setting for greater safety.|$|E

For the same global machine geometry, it is shown {{that some are}} easier and cheaper to produce, while others have a higher output <b>torque,</b> <b>lower</b> cogging <b>torque,</b> better efficiency or higher power density. Apart from the different lamination stack geometries, also different magnet geometries are studied. By evaluating the different combinations of lamination stacking methods and magnet shapes, it is shown that some combinations suffer from local saturation, <b>lower</b> output <b>torque</b> and higher losses. The simulations are performed by a multilayer 2 D and a simplified 3 D finite element model.

40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} aimed at an energetically {{efficient}} control method for biped walking. The walking cycle is composed of successive single-support phases and passive impacts. A parametric trajectory optimization method is implemented that finds symmetric, periodic, low torque walking gaits for a planar 5 -link biped robot offline. The robot’s configuration is then regulated by RHC (receding horizon control) with the same optimization criterion online. Only the geometric evolution of the robot’s configuration is controlled, but not the temporal evolution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using simulated walking control. The results show <b>lower</b> <b>torques</b> and more robustness from the proposed controller compared to a hand-tuned PD servo based walking controller. Key Words: biped walking, gait optimization, receding horizon control...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{conventional}} rear-wheel drive layout, the transmission system normally contained two sections, the [...] "gearbox" [...] or [...] "transmission" [...] mounted behind the engine, and the [...] "final drive" [...] {{mounted in the}} rear axle {{at the rear of}} the car. The reason for this separation of duties between the front and back of the car was to allow the drive shaft to run at <b>lower</b> <b>torque,</b> by using higher RPM. As power is the product of RPM and torque, running the shaft at higher RPM allowed more power to be transferred at <b>lower</b> <b>torque.</b> Doing so reduced the torque the driveshaft had to carry, and thus the strength and weight it required.|$|E
50|$|During the {{oscillating}} action, the fitted accessory {{moves along}} a minimal arc of 3.2 angular degrees. This {{allows for a}} greater degree of control by the operator as the <b>lower</b> <b>torque</b> means the tool has less power to move itself per oscillation, increasing safety while still completing the task at hand.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We propose {{an optimal}} control method for {{periodic}} tasks for systems with discontinuous dynamics. We {{take advantage of}} a parametric trajectory optimization method to find an optimal periodic trajectory for a periodic task. Then we use Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) to further optimize it and generate linear local models of the optimal control law in the neighborhood of the optimal trajectory. By formulating the optimal control problem with an infinite time horizon, the local models are time invariant and can be used to construct a state feedback law. The utility of the proposed method is evaluated using simulated walking control of a five-link biped robot. The results show <b>lower</b> <b>torques</b> and more robustness from the proposed controller compared to a PD servo controller...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The ankle sprain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{injuries}} in athletes. Direct evaluation of the ligament laxity can be obtained through the objective measurement of extreme passive inversion and eversion movements, but there are few studies on the use of the evaluation of the passive resistive torque of the ankle to assess the capsule and ligaments resistance. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the inversion and eversion passive torque in athletes with and without ankle sprains history. Method: 32 female basketball and volleyball athletes (16. 06 +/- 0. 8 years old; 67. 63 +/- 8. 17 kg; 177. 8 +/- 6. 47 cm) participated in this study. Their ankles were divided into two groups: control group (29), composed of symptom-free ankles, and ankle sprain group, composed of ankles which have suffered injury (29). The resistive torque at maximum passive ankle movement was measured by the isokinetic dynamometer and the muscular activity by electromyography system. The athletes performed 2 repetitions of inversion and eversion movement at 5, 10 and 20 degrees/s and the same protocol only at maximum inversion movement. Results: The resistive passive torque during the inversion and eversion was lower in the ankle sprain group. This group also showed <b>lower</b> <b>torques</b> at the maximum inversion movement. No differences were observed between inversion and eversion movement. Conclusions: Ankle sprain leads to <b>lower</b> passive <b>torque,</b> indicating reduction of the resistance of the lateral ankle ligaments and mechanical laxity...|$|R
50|$|Overdrive mode—A {{portion of}} the {{rotational}} energy produces electricity, because the ICE's full power is not needed to maintain speed. This electrical energy is used to drive the sun gear in the direction opposite its usual rotation.

50|$|In high {{precision}} {{areas such as}} aerospace applications motor or pneumatic torque wrenches are set at a <b>lower</b> <b>torque</b> value after which the final torque is set with a manual mechanical torque wrench, they are calibrated before every use, if a wrench breaks or loses calibration every fastener done with that wrench is redone.|$|E
50|$|While {{the engine}} itself {{is capable of}} {{a great deal of}} power, its {{limiting}} factor was the PG1 Powertrain Ltd gearbox it was coupled with which could not handle the torque. As a result, the engine is electronically limited to a <b>lower</b> <b>torque</b> output than it is easily capable of, giving the engine a very 'flat' overall torque curve.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether muscle strength is selec-tively more affected at shorter lengths of thigh muscles as result of stroke {{and to determine}} whether this is associated with impaired neural activation at shorter muscle lengths. Design: Case-control study. Subjects: Fourteen patients with sub-acute stroke, and 12 able-bodied controls. Methods: In patients (bilaterally) and able-bodied controls torque and activation was measured during maximal volun-tary isometric contractions of knee extensors and flexors at 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° knee flexion. Results: The paretic knee extensors showed <b>lower</b> normal-ized maximal <b>torques</b> (73 %) and lower normalized activa-tion (71 %) compared with control at 30 °. The paretic knee flexors showed <b>lower</b> normalized maximal <b>torques</b> at 60 ° (64 %) and 90 ° (45 %) with non-significantly lower normal-ized activation (~[*] 79 % and ~[*] 67 %, respectively). Conclusion: As a result of stroke, <b>lower</b> muscle <b>torque</b> at shorter muscle lengths of the knee extensors {{is associated with a}} length-dependent lower voluntary activation, which may also be the case for the flexor muscles, but not with al-tered co-activation. We recommend investigating the role of specific training of paretic knee extensors and flexors in es-pecially shortened positions to improve recovery of function after stroke.

50|$|As the {{material}} further warms during initial {{rotation of the}} serrated disk and the rubber begins to shear, the viscosity <b>lowers</b> and <b>torque</b> required decreases. Eventually, the torque will reach an inflection point, where the rubber begins to vulcanize and torque begins increasing. A shear pin on the machine prevents damage as the testing material stiffens. Comparing the torque versus time curves for different materials allows direct correlation of material viscosity and scorch time.|$|R

50|$|Although {{graphite}} shafts, {{made from}} composite {{materials such as}} carbon fiber, are now standard in woods, especially drivers, shafts for irons are still most often made from steel, which has <b>lower</b> <b>torque</b> than graphite, allowing less clubhead twisting, which gives better accuracy.

50|$|Long {{drive shafts}} differ from {{standard}} shafts. The main difference is stiffness, as a shaft not stiff enough will lag in an inconsistent manner, causing {{a loss of}} control.

40|$|Background. We {{quantified}} age-related {{decreases in}} the ability of female participants to generate whole leg movements about the hip. Methods. We measured maximum hip strength and hip velocity in 12 young and 12 older healthy women. Both capabilities could help fall prevention by contributing to fast leg movements. We also measured maximum velocities as a function of isotonic load. Results. Young participants produced 107. 6 6 25. 4 N-m (mean 6 SD) isometric torque in flexion and 109. 3 6 22. 3 N-m in extension. Older participants produced 22 % and 31 % <b>lower</b> <b>torques,</b> respectively (p,. 001). Young participants generated maximum velocities of 362. 8 6 51. 5 8 /s in flexion and 371. 5 6 54. 2 8 /s in extension. Older participants produced 16 % lower velocities in both directions (p,. 001). Older participants also produced lower velocities as a function of load (p,. 001), and lower maximum power (p,. 001). Conclusion. Both maximum strength and velocity contribute to reduced ability to move the leg quickly with age.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a complete setup {{of an electric}} driveline consisting of a permanent magnet synchronous machine, PMSM, converter and a control system. In order to model the system, {{the parameters of the}} selected machine parameters needed to be characterised. Comparison between the simulations and tests confirmed that the parametrisation was accurate and the system could be operated in both motor and generator mode. Moreover, simulations of an open circuit fault was performed and a resonant controller implemented to reduce the torque ripple which occurred due to the fault. Similar tests was performed in the lab-setup, which confirmed that the machine was able to continue to operate during an open circuit fault using only a PI-controller if the wye node current is controlled. The same resonant controller was implemented in the control system in the lab, however, due to high frequency noise in the current measurements, it became unstable. As a replacement, a look-up table using the output from the simulated resonant controller was implemented which <b>lowered</b> the <b>torque</b> ripple significantly. From this it is concluded that the resonant controller shows very good performance in simulations and would theoretically do so in lab implementation.
