500|$|Lucy granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, {{became a}} fan of MOBA after seeing the {{portrait}} in a newspaper. She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted Coca-Cola from her nose in astonishment. The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: [...] "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> only has one breast. I'm not sure {{what happened to her}} arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from." ...|$|E
500|$|Rhimes {{discussed}} costuming {{choices in}} the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As {{if they were in}} mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> didn’t know this was coming." [...] Following Denny's death, Heigl approached Rhimes to ask when her character would next have a romantic liaison. Rhimes explained that [...] "Izzie doesn't sleep around". Heigl expressed a desire for Izzie to reunite with Alex, explaining: [...] "I believe on some level, there's a connection between Izzie and Alex. He can do honorable things even though he's cutting and sarcastic. I would like to ultimately see them together, if not this season, then next." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy, [...] "Disturbia" [...] is [...] "yin to the yang of Chris Brown's 'Wall to Wall' which {{features}} creepy crawly chicks climbing {{the walls in}} latex." [...] He later, listed the video at number five on the [...] "Buzzworthy's Top 5 Most Paranoid Music Videos" [...] stating: [...] "In Rihanna's 'Disturbia' video, obsession manifests itself in freaky-deaky tarantulas, wigs, wolves, and a creepy dude in an eye patch. And S corsets. Paranoia never looked so supernaturally sexy!". Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly also reviewed the video commenting: [...] "It <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> accidentally wandered into Nine Inch Nails 'Closer' video, or else some sort of freaky Victorian mental hospital". He later continued saying that the video is not what he expected from a dance-pop song, but it's also cool that Rihanna is trying something new. Jillian Mapes of Billboard wrote that in the video, Rihanna created [...] "a memorable and edgy image akin more to Marilyn Manson than her Top 40 colleagues." [...] The video was voted the sixth best music video of the 2000s in a Billboard poll.|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} {{primarily}} filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, {{which is the}} headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are genuine medical supplies, including the MRI machine. Prior to being cast, Sara Ramirez was seen by ABC executives, in her Broadway performance of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, which ultimately led in her choosing Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", a statement she deemed rare. Ramirez's character was given recurring status in the second season, having been conceived as a love interest for George O'Malley. At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Grey's relationship. When asked of this, Torres said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] Discussing Izzie Stevens' relationship with Alex Karev, Katherine Heigl described her character as naive enough to believe she can save him, assessing that: [...] "Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her, she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over." [...] Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny, regarded by her as [...] "undeniably handsome and totally charming". Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she’s around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free." [...] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie [...] "seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny." [...] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: [...] "Is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the wire for love so does that make her action understandable?" [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> didn't know this was coming." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goody was {{evicted from}} the Big Brother house on 19 January 2007, {{receiving}} 82 {{percent of the}} vote when she was up against Shetty. Channel 4 prevented crowds from gathering outside the house, and cancelled her scheduled press conference. In an interview with Davina McCall shortly afterwards, Goody said she was [...] "disgusted with self" [...] after seeing a video of the alleged bullying. Her much-publicised return to the Big Brother house was called [...] "a terrible decision" [...] by publicist Max Clifford: [...] "It <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> has ruined a very lucrative career". At this time Goody was a supporter of the anti-bullying charity Act Against Bullying, which dropped her. In an interview with the Daily Star, Goody said that her abuse of Shetty ruined her girl-next-door image.|$|E
2500|$|Jennifer Morrison has {{received}} praise for her portrayal of Emma. In a review from the [...] St. Louis Post-Dispatch, TV critic Gail Pennington had {{high marks for}} Morrison. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times gave excellent reviews for Morrison's character: [...] "Her Emma is predictably cynical and prickly– fairy-tale princess, my Aunt Fanny– but she's sharp and lively enough to keep audiences begging for 'just a few more pages' before they go to bed." [...] For TVLive, [...] "Morrison does a nice job of mirroring the viewer's disbelief of this fantastical dilemma– and Emma <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> could become a worthy adversary for Regina." [...] For Daniel Fienberg, [...] "Jennifer Morrison is very good in the lead". On less favorable reviews, Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe was not enthusiastic of Morrison's portrayal and called her a [...] "wooden lead".|$|E

2500|$|Non-Scientologists Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos {{described}} in a 1990 article in the LA Times how Scientologists believe that when a person dies—or, in Scientology terms, when a thetan abandons its physical body—they go to a [...] "landing station" [...] on the planet Venus, where the thetan is re-implanted and told lies about its past life and its next life. The Venusians take the thetan, [...] "capsule" [...] it, and {{send it back to}} Earth to be thrown into the ocean off the coast of California. They quote Hubbard as saying, [...] "If you can get out of that, and through that, and wander around through the cities and find some girl who <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> is going to get married or have a baby or something like that, you're all set. And if you can find the maternity ward to a hospital or something, you're OK. And you just eventually just pick up a baby." ...|$|E

But what's the purpose of this?" [...] In response to Trump's remarks, Bill O'Reilly said in his program The O'Reilly Factor, [...] "Mr. Trump is correct. By setting up a contest and awarding $10,000 for a depiction of the Prophet Mohammed, the American Freedom Defense Initiative spurred a violent attack. (...) Insulting a religion with more than a billion followers does not advance the cause of defeating the fanatical jihadists. It hurts the cause." ...|$|R
