Following the announcement, Wam stated that NSB would continue to operate the service, and use the Timetoget concept. An internal document the newspaper Varden received access to showed that NSB needed to calm down the heated discussions with the <b>labor</b> <b>unions,</b> and that their negativity to Timetoget was a tactical move to satisfy the <b>labor</b> <b>unions.</b> Minister of Transport, Terje Moe Gustavsen from the Labour Party, stated in a meeting with two parliamentarians from Telemark, that he would allow a new private company, without NSB ownership, to operate the line.|$|E

5|$|After Nixon won re-election, {{inflation}} was returning. He reimposed price controls in June 1973. The price controls became unpopular {{with the public}} and businesspeople, who saw powerful <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> as preferable to the price board bureaucracy. The controls produced food shortages, as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss. Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.|$|E

The [...] "Colored" [...] National <b>Labor</b> <b>Union</b> was a post-civil war organization founded in December 1869 by an assembly of 214 African American mechanics, engineers, artisans, tradesmen and trades-women, and their supporters in Washington D.C. This organization was created in pursuit of equal representation for African Americans in the workforce. The <b>labor</b> <b>union</b> was organized by Isaac Myers, and elected its first president; civil rights activist Frederick Douglass was selected the president of the CNLU in 1872.

5|$|Because of {{religious}} and ethnic discrimination, Roman Catholics in the late 19th century were regularly excluded from <b>labor</b> <b>unions,</b> popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism could be compatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men {{to be proud of}} their American-Catholic heritage.|$|E

Advocacy by Herter Committee members, including Nixon, led to congressional passage of the Marshall Plan.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHow is activist {{expertise}} {{regarding the}} use of strikes transmitted in France’s service sector ? To respond to this question, I draw upon ethnographic observation of the training and activist support work carried out by one of the CGT’s territorial <b>labor</b> <b>union</b> structures. In fact, in sectors lacking a robust tradition of <b>labor</b> <b>union</b> agitation, training for new activists in the techniques of <b>labor</b> <b>union</b> action mainly takes place in local spaces of <b>labor</b> <b>union</b> organization. I first consider the technical and political apprenticeships through which members are in various and competing ways initiated into the use of strikes. I then underscore the many factors that obstruct transmission of such practical activist expertise as well as the principles of activist action {{in the use of the}} strike. Two matters are thus considered here : on the one hand, the organizational limits of training <b>labor</b> <b>union</b> members in activist practices and the principles of action with which their confederation identifies; on the other hand, the impediments to expanding strikes in professional domains characterized by a low rate of <b>labor</b> <b>union</b> participation...|$|R

5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas.

Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan).|$|E
