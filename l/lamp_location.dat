40|$|UV {{sterilisation}} technologies {{appear to}} be an energy efficient way of ensuring clean air supply. Future designs need to maximise sterilisation performance while reducing energy consumption. This study uses CFD analysis to consider how the position of a UV lamp in a duct influences the performance. Validated steady state CFD simulations using Fluent (ANSYS) are used to model UV dose distribution for seven different lamp locations. Results show that <b>lamp</b> <b>location</b> has significant impact on UV dose distribution. With only one lamp, a significant number of particles receive a dose that is higher or lower than the average; in some cases it can account for a difference of up to 17 % on the average UV dose of the system...|$|E
40|$|In-duct UVC air {{sterilisation}} is {{a technology}} that can help in the reduction and control of airborne diseases. Nevertheless, improvements in sterilisation performance efficiency are required for the technology to succeed in an increasingly restricted energy society. Computational fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to systematically improve the performance of in-duct UVC air sterilisation systems. The Discrete Ordinates method (DO) was used to model lamp irradiation, and a user defined function (UDF) to model the injection of microorganisms inside the duct to then calculate the average UV dose of the system, with this {{it was possible to}} reproduce test results published by EPA. After the CFD model was validated, operation parameters such as wall reflectivity, <b>lamp</b> <b>location,</b> lamp position, air velocity and airflow patterns were analysed. It was found that accurate information of UVC susceptibility for microorganisms in air was essential for the correct modeling of UVC air sterilisation systems using CFD, and current available data contain considerable variations that needed to be analysed and interpreted in an appropriate manner. It was also found that the DO method was appropriate to model lamp irradiation and could account for reflectivity, and that CFD was robust enough to reproduce lab tests results. Moreover it was found that airflow patterns, and <b>lamp</b> <b>location</b> and position influenced the sterilisation performance of a UVC system. Results include a comprehensive list of microorganisms UVC susceptibilities in air (Chapter 3); a set of CFD models {{that can be used for}} validation or calibration for future studies and a confirmation that CFD is capable to model in-duct UVC air sterilisation systems (Chapter 5). Ultimately this research presents a series of conclusions that will help on the design of more efficient in-duct UVC air sterilisation systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{dimensional}} analysis of an ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) air disinfection system within a diffusely reflective enclosure {{is performed using}} the Buckingham pi theorem. The eight dimensionless parameters obtained include the duct aspect ratio, the lamp aspect ratio, the reflectivity, and terms that incorporate the UV dose, airflow, duct dimensions, and lamp loca-tion coordinates. Computer simulation of the dose absorbed by an airborne microbe is used to predict system performance for several thousand combinations of the dimensionless parameters. Statistical analysis of these results is performed to determine the significance {{of each of the}} dimensionless parameters and their interactions. Conclusions regarding performance are sum-marized. The most significant parameters that determine performance of diffusively reflective UVGI systems are shown to be the dose, the reflectivity, the duct geometry, the lamp aspect ratio, <b>lamp</b> <b>location,</b> and various combined functions of these parameters. Practical implica-tions of this research may include the improvement or optimization of UVGI air disinfection sys-tems for in-duct and recirculation unit applications, with a consequent improvement in energy efficiency...|$|E

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993 the University of Texas at Arlington Physical Plant Department {{submitted}} a request to the Energy Systems Lab to conduct a lighting study to determine the most cost-effective method of implementing energy-saving lighting retrofits in U. T. Arlington classrooms without compromising the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) recommended minimum lighting levels. A preliminary series of field tests was undertaken to get a sampling of classroom lighting levels on the U. T. Arlington campus and to determine whether <b>lamp</b> <b>locations</b> within the fixture would impact the amount of light output. This {{was followed by a}} series of lab tests conducted at the Energy Systems Lab, located on the Texas A&M University campus, to compare the light output of fixtures with different combinations of <b>lamp</b> types and <b>locations</b> within the fixture. In order to evaluate the impact of the proposed lighting retrofit, a study was made to determine the capital investment required as weighed against energy cost savings. The results of the study are presented in the paper and a summary table is provided to take into account lamp and ballast performance compared with capital expenditure with respect to meeting IES minimum footcandle levels. Based on the report findings it was recommended that a full, comprehensive survey be undertaken at UTA, to ensure that minimum lighting levels will be maintained, while also ensuring that the capital investment is the most cost-effective...|$|R

Public spaces are typically {{under the control of}} public works, parks, and highway departments. Streets, being the most common public spaces in a community, are the most frequently regulated. Public Space Standards for streets are typically described with dimensioned cross-sections and/or plan views showing travel lane widths, sidewalk widths, street tree and street <b>lamp</b> placement, <b>locations</b> of transit lanes, and the placement of architecture.

40|$|The {{installation}} of upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) devices in ventilated rooms {{has the potential}} to reduce transmission of infections by an airborne route. However, the performance of such devices is dependant on several factors including the location of the lamp and the ventilation airflow in the room. This study uses a CFD model to evaluate the performance of UVGI devices by considering the cumulative UV-C dose received by the bulk room air in a ventilated room. By evaluating the UV dose rather than the resulting micro-organism inactivation the methodology can be used to optimise UVGI systems at the design stage, particularly when the source location of bioaerosol contaminants is not known. The study investigates the relationships between the <b>lamp</b> <b>location,</b> lamp power, ventilation system and room heating in a small, ventilated room. The results show that with ventilation air supplied at low level and extracted at high level the UVGI system performs better than with the air supplied at high level and extracted close to the floor. In addition the results show the presence of a heater in the room is unlikely to have a detrimental effect on performance and may promote mixing to increase the extent of disinfectio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel power and {{location}} aware {{medium access control}} (MAC) protocol called <b>LAMP</b> (<b>Location</b> Aware MAC Protocol). LAMP is designed for location aware mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). Specifically MANETs such as Sensor Networks or Ubiquitous Computing Environments where; node location {{is important to the}} over all objective of the network and mobility is bounded. LAMP uses the concept of cellular geographical network division in order to build a distributed time division multiple access (TDMA) based schedule for transmission, reception and sleep. It allows hosts to avoid overhearing the network and instead sleep and conserve power. Power saving is a significant concern in MANETs as most mobile hosts operate with a limited amount of power available to them. LAMP trades an increase in latency for a reduction in energy consumption, while maintaining fairness in the network. The proposed MAC protocol allows hosts to reduce energy consumption by powering their radio transceivers off while still maintaining a responsive, connected and fair network. As in cellular networks this approach uses location information to partition the network into hexagonal cells. Once a host knows which cell it is in and can synchronize its clock, it can build a TDMA based transmission and reception schedule. This is a novel advancement over empirically tuned low duty cycle power conservation, as it not only intelligently minimizes power consumption but also avoids interference...|$|E

The number of the baskets or the number {{and the color of}} the <b>lamps</b> indicated the <b>location,</b> i.e. in which district of Istanbul the fire outbroke. As a response, the Watch Tower of Icadiye on the Anatolian side of the Bosphorus then fired 7 volleys to inform the citizens of the fire. 20 fire fighters were stationed in the Beyazıt Tower until 1923.

30|$|IgLONs are a {{group of}} {{adhesion}} molecules with three extracellular C 2 domains and a GPI anchor attach to the membrane. Four genes are presently identified in this family: LAMP (limbic system-associated membrane protein), OBCAM (opioid-binding cell adhesion molecule), Ntm (neurotrimin), and Kilon. The LAMP, Ntm, and OBCAM molecules interact homophilically with themselves and heterophilically with each other (Lodge et al., 2000; Gil et al., 2002). During development, IgLONs show both overlapping and distinct patterns in protein localization. For example, Kilon is distributed in axons and pre-synaptic terminals at early stages, but is mainly observed in the post-synaptic sites of dendritic and somatic synapses in adults (Miyata et al., 2003; Hashimoto et al., 2008). <b>LAMP</b> alters its <b>location</b> from restriction at post-synaptic sites to wide expression on somata, dendrites, and axons {{in the process of}} maturation (Pimenta et al., 1996).|$|R

5000|$|In November 1885 {{electrical}} engineer William Stanley, Jr., a sometimes Great Barrington resident working for George Westinghouse, began installing a demonstration transformer based alternating current lighting system. Stanley felt AC was {{an improvement over}} the direct current system being used by Thomas Edison, and Stanley {{was trying to get}} Westinghouse to adopt it. Stanley had developed a series transformer that he thought would make AC practical. He built his components at the [...] "Old Rubber Factory" [...] south of Cottage Street and installed a Westinghouse steam engine powering a 500 volt Siemens generator. Stringing the power lines from tree to tree down the street, in March 1886 Stanley powered the system up and was able to expand it {{to the point where it}} could light 23 businesses along Main Street with very little power loss over 4000 feet. The system's 500 AC volt current was stepped down to 100 volts using the new Stanley transformer to power incandescent <b>lamps</b> at each <b>location.</b> This was the world's first practical demonstration of a transformer/alternating current system and the basis of the AC systems that Westinghouse would begin installing later that year.|$|R

5000|$|In North America the {{inventor}} and entrepreneur George Westinghouse entered the electric lighting business in 1884 {{when he started}} to develop a DC system and hired William Stanley, Jr. to work on it. Westinghouse became aware of the new European transformer based AC systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal Engineering. He grasped that AC combined with transformers meant greater economies of scale could be achieved with large centralized power plants transmitting stepped up voltage very long distances to be used in arc lighting as well lower voltage home and commercial incandescent lighting supplied via a [...] "step down" [...] transformer at the other end. Westinghouse saw a way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents. The Edison DC system of centralized DC plants with their short transmission range also meant there was a patchwork of un-supplied customers between Edison's plants that Westinghouse could easily supply with AC power. Westinghouse purchased the US patents rights to the Gaulard-Gibbs transformer and imported several of those as well as Siemens AC generators to begin experimenting with an AC-based lighting system in Pittsburgh. William Stanley used the Gaulard-Gibbs design and designs from the ZBD Transformer to develop the first practical transformer. The Westinghouse Electric Company was formed at the beginning of 1886. In March 1886 Stanley, with Westinghouse's backing, installed the first multiple-voltage AC power system, a demonstration incandescent lighting system, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Expanded {{to the point where it}} could light 23 businesses along main street with very little power loss over 4000 feet, the system used transformers to step 500 AC volts at the street down to 100 volts to power incandescent <b>lamps</b> at each <b>location.</b> By fall of 1886 Westinghouse, Stanley, and Oliver B. Shallenberger had built the first commercial AC power system in the US in Buffalo, New York.|$|R
