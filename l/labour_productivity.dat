5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of <b>labour</b> <b>productivity.</b>|$|E

The Era of Stagnation, a term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, is considered by several economists {{to be the worst}} financial crisis in the Soviet Union. It was triggered by the Nixon Shock, over-centralisation and a conservative state bureaucracy. As the economy grew, the volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. As a result, <b>labour</b> <b>productivity</b> decreased nationwide. The cumbersome procedures of bureaucratic administration did not allow for the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level to deal with worker alienation, innovation, customers and suppliers. The late Brezhnev Era also saw an increase in political corruption. Data falsification became common practice among bureaucrats to report satisfied targets and quotas to the government, and this further aggravated the crisis in planning.|$|E

With asymmetric information about <b>labour</b> <b>productivities</b> and publicgoods preferences, the multidimensional mechanism design problem becomes tractable by requiring renegotiation proofness of the final allocation of private goods and admission tickets for excludable public goods.

These properties are obtained for utilitarian welfare maximization and for a Ramsey-Boiteux formulation with interim participation constraints. ...|$|R

40|$|Pierre Berthelier, Anna Lipchitz — What role {{does the}} {{agricultural}} sector play in growth and development ? A successful economic transition involves a continuous flow of resources from agriculture to industry. This resource transfer depends on structural factors affecting demand, marginal <b>labour</b> <b>productivities,</b> technical progress, sectoral factor endowments and public economic policies. Agricultural transition is an essential input of economic growth, but is not solely sufficient for generating sustained growth. The rhythm of agricultural transition is mainly explained by the dynamism of capital accumulation in the whole economy, by agricultural policies and by investment in human capital.

25|$|The {{advantages}} that Europe had {{developed by the}} mid-18th century were two: an entrepreneurial culture, and the wealth generated by the Atlantic trade (including the African slave trade).

While some historians conclude that, in 1750, <b>labour</b> <b>productivity</b> in the most developed regions of China was still on a par with that of Europe's Atlantic economy, other historians like Angus Maddison hold that the per-capita productivity of western Europe had by the late Middle Ages surpassed that of all other regions.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{possible}} explanations for why newcomers earn less than native Canadians in the same jobs with the same skills. Lower hourly wages might be an indication that the <b>labour</b> <b>productivity</b> of immigrants is lower, and employers thus have reason to pay them less. New workers are also less familiar with the Canadian labour market and will thus not be able to maximize their salaries. Employers will also be less familiar with an immigrant's background and thus less willing to offer the same salary as to a native. Immigrants, especially visible minorities have different values than native-born Canadians as they tend to favour living in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver as opposed to other places much more than native-born Canadians. Due to lower mobility, they do not access better paying jobs, such as in Alberta and Saskatchewan. This has been changing with Calgary already surpassing Montreal in terms of percentage of visible minorities. Visible minorities in Saskatchewan earn higher wages than native-born Canadians.|$|E

She was also the last major vessel to be constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. In June 1983 the contract were renegotiated while construction was underway, with the acceptance date being extended by three years and the project cost increased to $187.3 million. The cost and time overruns were primarily due to protracted dispute between the Commonwealth and the builder over the drawings and specifications received from France, with evidence that the Department of Defence underestimated the extent {{of the differences between the}} original Australian building specifications and those supplied. Additional factors in the time and cost increases were a lack of tradesmen skilled in naval construction, overly bureaucratic management, and low <b>labour</b> <b>productivity.</b> The final project cost was estimated at $197.41 million; the dramatic increase in cost prevented the construction of a planned second ship.|$|E
