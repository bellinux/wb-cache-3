The observed faulty allocations <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditures,</b> coupled with weaknesses in the budgetary process suggest major potential gains for improving the efficiency and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> program in ANRE. These areas of reform relate to whether: (a) <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> are being used to perform/provide public roles/goods vs. private ones; (b) choice of policy instruments (i. e., expenditure program vs. other market-based instruments) is most cost-effective; (c) <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> are optimally allocated across policy instruments, agencies and levels of government, regions, and type of expenditures; (d) mechanisms for funding and other related budgetary procedures promote efficient and effective allocation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> expenditures; and (e) cost-effective mechanisms for timely monitoring, evaluation, and impact analysis <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> are adopted. The study finds that a thorough analysis, monitoring and evaluation of expenditure programs are therefore crucial in ensuring that policy objectives are attained though efficient and effective public resource allocation.

On the other hand, considering the composition <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditure,</b> on agriculture, health, trade and industry are statistically significant in explaining changes in economic growth. However, expenditure on road transport and communication is statically insignificant in explaining economic growth in Ethiopia. The study recommended that the government should increase efficiency of the financial resource by scrutinizing and evaluating for spending in transport and communication to create new capacity and support existing capacities. In addition, government should strengthen three principal-agent relationship dimensions(C=M+D – A) of the organizational structure that is crucial in decreasing the opportunity for corruption in government spending.

The tax system consists of some taxes, it has a wide spread of tax charges and applies relatively low tax rates. Both budgetary revenues and budgetary consumption have marked certain variations in relation to GDP. Currently, The Kosovo Consolidated Budget (KCB) is completely fulfilled by domestic revenues. It is considered that, even if the budgetary consumption increases up to 30 - 34 % of GDP, this raise will not endanger budgetary sustainability of the country.
