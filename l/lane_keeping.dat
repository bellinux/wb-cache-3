It was close on nine o'clock when he passed stealthily down the <b>lane,</b> <b>keeping</b> close to the park wall. A soft rain was falling, the first since the prolonged drought, and though it made the road heavy and slippery in places, it helped to deaden the sound of the young man's furtive footsteps. The air, except for the patter of the rain, was absolutely still. Henri de Montorgueil paused from time to time, with neck craned forward, every sense on the alert, listening, like any poor, hunted beast, for the slightest sound which might betray the approach of danger.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were off}} before daybreak and, eight miles farther, crossed the Moselle at Zell. They left the road before they arrived at Alf; for they were now {{approaching}} the great road between Coblentz and the south, and might come upon bodies of troops upon the march, or halting; and might be asked troublesome questions. They therefore struck upon a country <b>lane</b> and, <b>keeping</b> among the hills, crossed the main road between Bertrich and Wittlech; and slept in a copse, near Dudeldf. They had walked five-and-thirty miles, and were so dead beat that even the cold did not keep them awake.|$|R

Harry did not look up, but turned with his guide down several lanes, until they at length emerged on the quays. Saying she would call next day at his hotel for the reward he had promised her, she left him, and Harry, with his head full of the plot against Cromwell's life, crossed at once to the vessels by the quay.|$|E

40|$|Crashes {{in which}} lorries or vans are {{involved}} are often serious, {{especially for the}} crash opponent. Lorries are not only involved in crashes because of their drivers' unsafe behaviour (freights falling off, rollovers, jack-knifing), but also because other road users take too little account of them. Many road users do not realize {{that they can be}} positioned in the lorry's blind area or that a lorry can swerve out. Although delivery vans are smaller than lorries, they still are bigger and heavier than cars and their rear view is not as good. That is why the crash causes of delivery vans are often different from those of cars. Infrastructural measures, such as target-group <b>lanes</b> and <b>keeping</b> heavy freight traffic away from urban areas can result in safer lorry and van traffic. In addition, (intelligent) facilities in the vehicle, such as speed limitation devices, can be used. Yet {{it is also important to}} encourage a safety culture in haulage companies...|$|R

30|$|Staggered car-following {{behavior}} is predominant in developing countries, where limited {{attempts have been}} made to study the relationship between lateral and longitudinal distance between interacting vehicles. Gunay [7] defined the term lane-based driving discipline as the tendency to drive within a <b>lane</b> by <b>keeping</b> to the center as closely as possible (unless in lane changing). Gunay [1] remarked that when two vehicles travel parallel to each other, they tend to shy away. A new car-following relationship which is based on staggered car-following is developed, where the lateral frictional discomfort between moving vehicles is taken into account. Maximum escape speed (MES) or speed with which vehicle can safely overtake other vehicle, depending upon available road width, was calculated. It was found that there is a second-degree relationship between vehicle speed and road width available for overtaking. Further, a simulation model was developed [8] based upon observations drawn from field data collection. Gunay and Erdemir [9] analyzed staggered time headways between neighboring vehicles and found that drivers prefer to pass or lag behind the vehicle in the adjacent lane, rather than driving side by side.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a prediction- {{and cost}} functionbased {{algorithm}} (PCB) is proposed to implement robust freeway driving in autonomous vehicles. A prediction engine is built {{to predict the}} future microscopic traffic scenarios. With the help of a human-understandable and representative cost function library, the predicted traffic scenarios are evaluated and the best control strategy is selected based on the lowest cost. The prediction- and cost function-based algorithm is verified using the simulator of the autonomous vehicle Boss from the DARPA Urban Challenge 2007. The results of both case tests and statistical tests using PCB show enhanced performance of the autonomous vehicle in performing distance <b>keeping,</b> <b>lane</b> selecting and merging on freeways.

In the front rooms of dwellings girls and women were cooking or spinning, and ducks and chickens were waddling in and out, over the threshold, picking up chance crumbs and holding pleasant converse; a very old and wrinkled man sat asleep before his door, with his chin upon his breast and his extinguished pipe in his lap; soiled children were playing in the dirt everywhere along the lane, unmindful of the sun.|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} part of any {{advanced driver assistance system}} is road geometry estimation. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian estimation algorithm using lane marking measurements received from a camera and measurements of the leading vehicles received from a radar-camera fusion system, to estimate the road up to 200 meters ahead in highway scenarios. The filtering algorithm uses a segmented clothoid-based road model. In order to use the heading of leading vehicles we need to detect if each vehicle is <b>keeping</b> <b>lane</b> or changing lane. Hence, we propose to jointly detect the motion state of the leading vehicles and estimate the road geometry using a multiple model filter. Finally the proposed algorithm is compared to an existing method using real data collected from highways. The results indicate that it provides a more accurate road estimation in some scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Live-wire type {{techniques}} for interactive image segmentation are of practical use for various {{applications such as}} medical image analysis, digital image composition, etc. Intelligent scissors [5] and live wire [8] are the representative techniques of this type, {{which are based on}} a graph search over an entire image. Another technique called live lane [8] is also based on a graph search but localizes the search domain to give an interactive feedback. Compared to the live wire, the live lane trades off the repeatability of segmentation for its time efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel image segmentation technique called enhanced lane, {{a modified version of the}} live lane that ensures both efficiency and repeatability. By restricting the search domain and updating the path map incrementally, the enhanced lane can extract objects from an image interactively with its efficiency comparable to that of the live <b>lane</b> while also <b>keeping</b> its repeatability comparable to that of the live wire. Based on the live lane paradigm, our technique also differs from the time-efficient version of live wire called live wire on the fly [9]: the enhanced lane always guarantees strictly bounded response time regardless of the image size and follows the target boundary with little digression which leads to better repeatability.

40|$|Road {{lane width}} is {{important}} information not only road management but also autonomous vehicle. Especially, it is normally known {{that most of}} autonomous vehicle will use the road <b>lane</b> marking for <b>keeping</b> the travel the road. To measure the lane width, the road lane marking should be detected and then the lane width measured by calculating the interval of two lane markings. The camera and LiDAR are usually used for lane marking detection. However, the performance of each sensor is depend on the sunlight. To compare the performance lane marking recognition, the lane width was selected for performance index. The camera and 3 D LiDAR sensors installed on the road survey vehicle and the lane width was measured. The test {{was conducted on the}} Korean National Highway and the measurement result from each sensor was compared with the actual lane width. As a result, after the sunrise, the RMSE of camera was 0. 19 and the RMSE of 3 D LiDAR was 0. 34. It was shown that the result from the camera was more favorable compare with the LiDAR. However, before sunrise although the camera could not detect the lane marking, the LiDAR detected the lane marking and measured the lane width as a result of 0. 33 RMSE. In conclusion, even though the camera affected by the illumination in terms of recognition objects, the LiDAR is not affected by the illumination...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Purpose: We {{examined}} the relationship between visual field extent and driving performance in an open, on-road environment using a detailed scoring method that assessed the quality of specific skills for a range of maneuvers. The purpose was to determine which maneuvers and skills should be included in future, larger scale investigations of the effect of peripheral field loss on driving performance. Methods: Twenty-eight current drivers (67 � 14 years) with restricted peripheral visual fields participated. Binocular visual field extent was quantified using Goldmann perimetry (V 4 e target). The useful field of view (UFOV®) and Pelli-Robson letter contrast sensitivity tests were administered. Driving performance was assessed along a 14 -mile route on roads in the city of Birmingham, Alabama. The course included a representative variety of general driving maneuvers, as well as maneuvers expected to be difficult for people with restricted fields. Results: Drivers with more restricted horizontal and vertical binocular field extents showed significantly (p < 0. 05) poorer skills in speed matching when changing lanes, in maintaining <b>lane</b> position and <b>keeping</b> to the path of the curve when driving around curves, and received significantly (p < 0. 05) poorer ratings for anticipatory skills. Deficits in UFOV performance and poorer contrast sensitivity scores were significantly (p < 0. 05) correlated with overall driving performance as well as specific maneuver/skill combinations. Conclusions: In a small sample of drivers, mild to moderate peripheral visual field restrictions were adversely associated with specific driving skills involved in maneuvers for which a wide field of vision is likely to be important (however most wer...|$|R
