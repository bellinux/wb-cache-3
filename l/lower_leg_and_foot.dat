2500|$|The well-preserved {{skeleton}} of the Sinocalliopteryx holotype contained the partial {{leg of a}} dromaeosaurid within the abdominal cavity, comprising a complete <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> with toes and claws in their natural, articulated position. While the leg part, about one foot long, is very large {{in relation to the}} abdominal cavity, it is clearly situated within it, lying between the ribs. Ji and colleagues in 2007 suggested that this could indicate it preyed upon the smaller, bird-like dinosaur. This discovery indicated that Sinocalliopteryx may have been an agile, active, [...] "fierce" [...] predator, especially since other compsognathids have been found with (presumably fast-moving) lizards and small mammals in their abdominal cavities. In 2012 the dromaeosaurid was tentatively identified as an individual of Sinornithosaurus with a length of 1.2 metres (3.9 ft). The 2012 study also reported newly discovered remains of prey animals. Above the dromaeosaurid leg, feathers are visible. Below it two clusters of digested food can be seen. It was suggested that the feathers had belonged to a bird and were with the leg still present in the stomach. The digested food would, using the preserved digestive tract of Scipionyx as a reference, have been positioned in the duodenum. The C-shaped abdominal contents of this specimen appear to reflect of the original contour of the digestive tract.|$|E

50|$|At {{some point}} in his life he had {{suffered}} a violent blow to {{the left side of his}} face, creating a crushing fracture to his left orbit which would have left him partially or totally blind in one eye. He also suffered from a withered right arm which had been fractured in several places and healed, but which caused the loss of his lower arm and hand. This is thought to be either congenital, a result of childhood disease and trauma or due to an amputation later in his life. The arm had healed but the injury may have caused some paralysis down his right side, leading to deformities in his <b>lower</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> would have resulted in him walking with a pronounced, painful limp.|$|R
50|$|A high ankle sprain, {{also known}} as a syndesmotic sprain, is a sprain of the syndesmotic ligaments that connect the tibia and fibula in the lower leg, thereby {{creating}} a mortise and tenon joint for the ankle. High ankle sprains are described as high because they are located above the ankle. They comprise approximately 15% of all ankle sprains. Unlike the common lateral ankle sprains, when ligaments around the ankle are injured through an inward twisting, high ankle sprains are caused when the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> externally rotates (twists out).|$|E

50|$|In 1993, {{the first}} Hesperornis remains {{from outside of}} North America were {{recognized}} as a new species by Nessov and Yarkov. They named Hesperornis rossicus for a fragmentary skeleton from the early Campanian of Russia near Volgograd.

At about 1.4 m long, H. rossicus was the largest species of Hesperornis and among the largest hesperornithines, slightly smaller than the large Canadian genus Canadaga. Aside from its large size and different geographic location, H. rossicus differs from other Hesperornis in several features of the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot,</b> including a highly flattened metatarsus.|$|E

The digested food would, using the preserved digestive tract of Scipionyx as a reference, have been positioned in the duodenum. The C-shaped abdominal contents of this specimen appear to reflect of the original contour of the digestive tract.In addition to the dromaeosaurid leg, four irregularly-shaped stones with a diameter between fifteen and twenty millimetres were found in the abdomen, with no similar stones present in any other portions of the skeleton or embedded in the surrounding rock. The authors interpreted these as gastroliths (gizzard stones) similar to those found with Nqwebasaurus and Baryonyx. Other theropods, such as Caudipteryx and a Mongolian ornithomimid, were also found with gastroliths, though in those cases the stones were much more numerous and smaller in size. Ji and colleagues speculated that, since the later two dinosaurs were probably primarily herbivores, the number and size of gastroliths may correspond with diet; that is, herbivores ingested many small stones, while carnivores ingested only a few larger stones to aid in digestion. However, the 2012 study could find no gastroliths with the second specimen and therefore concluded that the stones with the holotype were swallowed by accident. In any case no special gizzard would have been present.|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{consider}} the functional characteristics of a five segment <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> model during gait, using the application of elementary kinematics to measure, analyse and describe <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> motion and compare these parameters between two subject groups with plantar pathological hyperkeratosis (PPH); PPH group one having callus under metatarsal heads 2, 3 and 4, and PPH group two having callus under metatarsal heads 1 and 5. Root's elegant theory of foot function (Root et al. 1966; Root et al. 1977) has become widely accepted in podiatry. This theory suggests {{the orientation of the}} subtalar joint axis influences the amount of motion in all the cardinal body planes. Therefore, a foot which has a joint axis which is highly inclined will exhibit more transverse plane lower leg rotation than frontal plane calcaneal motion; will be a less mobile foot; and tend to present with callus under metatarsal heads 1 and 5. Conversely, a foot with a lower inclined subtalar joint axis will exhibit more frontal plane calcaneal motion than transverse plane leg rotation; will be more mobile; and tend to have callus under the 2, 3 and 4 metatarsal heads. A non-invasive in vivo kinematic method was developed to collect three dimensional coordinates of markers attached to a novel five segment model of the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> in order to estimate the angular displacement and motion between the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> segments. The results have shown that there are statistically significant differences in the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> kinematics between the PPH groups (p < 0. 05) during various periods within the stance phase. These differences suggest that the motions of the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> are similar to those proposed by the podiatric theory. However the findings contradict Root's theory within the latter stages of midstance and propulsive periods of gait. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
