5|$|After {{locating}} the M. schnecki nest, the wasp enters only the nests that contain P. rebeli caterpillars. It {{is able to}} enter the nest without being swarmed because it releases a chemical that causes the worker ants to attack one another instead of concentrating all their efforts on the wasp. Once the wasp reaches the caterpillars, it marks the individuals most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> by ovipositing in them. Once the wasp's eggs hatch from the caterpillar's body, the newborn offspring feast on the caterpillar's carcass.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have allele frequency 1/2.|$|E
5|$|The thrifty gene {{hypothesis}} postulates that, due to dietary scarcity during human evolution, {{people are}} prone to obesity. Their ability {{to take advantage of}} rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater adipose reserves would be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> famine. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies. This theory has received various criticisms, and other evolutionarily-based theories such as the drifty gene hypothesis and the thrifty phenotype hypothesis have also been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> disease epidemics. This study and other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to be close to 15,000.|$|E
25|$|To {{put this}} into a {{biological}} systems context, some physiology is required. In the gastrointestinal tract, epithelial cells proliferate and die rapidly. The division of these cells occurs {{at the base of}} villi, and cells are pushed upwards by subsequent divisions to the tip where they enter apoptosis and shed off into the lumen. Netrin-1 is produced in the base of the villi, so a gradient of netrin is present that is weakest at the tip. In normal physiology, the presence of netrin-1 inhibits DCC-mediated cell death until the epithelial cell reaches the tip of the villus, where the now unbound DCC causes the cell to enter apoptosis. In a cancer state, the absence of DCC prevents the gradient from having an effect on the cell, making it more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b>|$|R

While it seems clear that they are not in continuity from Egyptian precedents, the same cannot be said for the northern shores of the Mediterranean, where such material is less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>survived,</b> due <b>to</b> climatic conditions there. Evidence from frescoes, mosaics and other media suggests that stylistically, the mummy portraits broadly fit within the prevailing Graeco-Roman traditions then dominant around the Mediterranean.|$|R
5000|$|The Lindy Effect [...] "... {{allows us}} {{to figure out how}} time and things work without quite getting inside the {{complexity}} of time's mind. Time is scientifically equivalent to disorder, and things that gain from disorder are what this author Taleb calls 'antifragile.'" [...] So things that have been in existence {{for a long period of}} time can be considered more robust/antifragile (i.e., more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>survive)</b> than new things that haven't passed the test of time. Given this, the Lindy Effect can be used to distinguish random survivors from non-random survivors and gauge the fragility of a thing which provides information that can help with decision making. For example, companies that have been around the longest and are still relatively [...] "healthy" [...] will last the longest, and vice versa. Investors can use the Lindy effect to narrow down their choice of stocks to the most durable companies.|$|R
5|$|Sea lions are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating killer whale pods. The sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and make it to the shore.|$|E
5|$|Wolves kill dogs on occasion, {{with some}} wolf populations relying on dogs as an {{important}} food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behavior when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered {{a major problem in}} Scandinavia and Wisconsin. The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are harriers, with older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as Swedish elkhounds are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> than those in good condition.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the three}} lifeboats, the James Caird was deemed {{the strongest and}} most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> the journey. Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird, a Dundee jute-manufacturer and philanthropist, whose {{sponsorship}} had helped finance the expedition. Before its voyage, the ship's carpenter Harry McNish strengthened and adapted the boat to withstand the mighty seas of the Southern Ocean. Surviving a series of dangers, including a near capsizing, the boat reached the southern coast of South Georgia after a voyage lasting 16days. Shackleton and two companions then crossed the island's mountainous interior to reach a whaling station on the northern side. Here he organised the relief of the Elephant Island party, {{and the return of}} his men home without loss of life. After the end of the First World War in 1918, the James Caird was brought back from South Georgia to England in 1919 and put on permanent display at Shackleton's old school, Dulwich College from 1922.|$|E
5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, and are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in 2000 by researchers from the University of Georgia and the US Fish and Wildlife Service looked at data collected between 1986 and 1990 {{in an effort to}} better understand the herd dynamics of the Cumberland Island herd. The study found that band instability was high, with mares not generally forming close relationships with each other and commonly switching which stallion they banded with, and juveniles dispersing quickly. The researchers attributed this to a lack of territory, with bands frequently inhabiting overlapping areas, along with a high number of bachelor stallions (those without mares). They also saw a high number of co-dominant stallions, where two or more stallions would lead a band together, and alternate breeding of the band's mares. Foals born on Cumberland Island were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> than comparable foals in western feral herds, with survival rates of 58.8-61.1% and 80% respectively. This was found to be especially true in animals born after 1 June, which was attributed to higher temperatures, higher insect levels and reduced food availability. The number of horses in the Cumberland bands was comparable to western bands and those on some eastern islands. However, Assateague and Shackleford Banks horses tended to have larger bands, with an average of 8.1 and 12.3 horses per band, respectively.|$|E
50|$|British {{colonization}} {{led to some}} {{shift to}} the common law, but the common law had little long-term impact on the legal systems of many countries that fell under British rule where there was an existing codified system. Thus civil law, mostly of French origins, now prevails throughout the Middle East, and the occasional remnants of common law are <b>likely</b> not <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> As a result, the modern legal systems of Middle Eastern countries share the basic features of French law, such as relying on complete and logical statements {{of the law in}} codes as official sources of law, keeping a sharp division between public and private law and between commercial and private law.|$|R

For example, {{one of the main}} predictions is that higher quality, and therefore most fertile, females should consistently display the largest swellings.

5|$|After their {{original}} religious activities ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying {{to erase the}} remnants of ancient Egyptian religion. Some temple buildings, such as the mammisi at Dendera or the hypostyle hall at Philae, were adapted into churches or other types of buildings. Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of Khnum at Elephantine, while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings. The dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times. Limestone was especially useful {{as a source of}} lime, so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact. With understanding of the hieroglyphic script lost, the information about Egyptian culture that was preserved in the surviving temples lay incomprehensible to the world.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E
5|$|Müllerian mimicry, {{named for}} the German naturalist Fritz Müller, {{describes}} a situation where two or more species have similar warning or aposematic signals and both share genuine anti-predation attributes (e.g. being unpalatable). At first, Bates could not explain why this should be so—if both were harmful why did one need to mimic another? Müller put forward the first explanation for this phenomenon: if a common predator confuses two species, individuals in both those species are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> This type of mimicry is unique in several respects. Firstly, both the mimic and the model benefit from the interaction, which could thus be classified as mutualism in this respect. The signal receiver is also advantaged by this system, despite being deceived about species identity, as it avoids potentially harmful encounters. The usually clear distinction between mimic and model is also blurred. Where one species is scarce and another abundant, the rare species {{can be said to}} be the mimic. When both are present in similar numbers, however, it is more realistic to speak of each as a co-mimic than of distinct 'mimic' and 'model' species, as their warning signals tend to converge. Also, the two species may exist on a continuum from harmless to highly noxious, so Batesian mimicry grades smoothly into Müllerian convergence.|$|E

[...] Protandry may {{have an effect on the}} butterfly's mating success in a population. In many time constrained species such as the Edith's checkerspot, early season matings may have a higher probability of producing adults in the next generation than those later in the year. Pre-diapause larvae are under time pressure to mature to diapause size before host plants senesce in summer drought. Therefore, larvae hatching from eggs laid earlier in the season are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have reached the intended size.
