500|$|The Supreme Court {{upheld the}} {{constitutionality}} of Sections 4 and 5 in South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966). However, in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which established the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, was no longer constitutional and exceeded Congress's enforcement authority under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court declared that the Fifteenth Amendment [...] "commands {{that the right to}} vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future." [...] According to the Court, [...] "Regardless of how to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the 'pervasive,' 'flagrant,' 'widespread,' and 'rampant' discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions {{from the rest of the}} nation." [...] In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote, [...] "Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet." [...] While the preclearance provision itself was not struck down, it will continue to be inoperable unless Congress passes a new coverage formula.|$|E

5000|$|As a Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, he {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the Northern Ireland peace process. However, after Reiss denied Gerry Adams a visa to the United States to spur the endorsement of policing and justice in Northern Ireland by Adams and his political party, Sinn Féin, Adams criticized Reiss on March 16, 2006 saying, [...] "I don't have high regards for Mitchell Reiss's input into this process" [...] and [...] "If it is he who is advising the president, it's very very bad advice." [...] Reiss responded [...] "We try very hard to be an honest broker.

We try to keep our eye on the main objective here - which is moving the peace process forward and keeping the focus on the people of Northern Ireland."

5000|$|The NDP won a {{majority}} government under Bob Rae in the 1990 provincial election, and Gigantes, once again campaigning in Ottawa Centre, defeated Patten by almost 3,000 votes. Gigantes remarked {{during the election}} campaign that the Liberals, who were widely seen as leading in the polls, were not in control of events. She said, [...] "The election call has triggered a very cold <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> of this government and people don't like what they see." [...] As {{a result of her}} legislative experience, she was appointed to Rae's first cabinet as Minister of Health on October 1, 1990. In June 1990, the federal government narrowly passed bill C-43 that would have placed restrictions on doctors who performed abortions. In response to the bill, many Ontario doctors decided to stop performing abortions altogether. In November 1990, Gigantes announced that the province would set up fully funded free-standing abortion clinics to ensure that abortion services remained available. In January 1991, Gigantes and fellow cabinet minister Anne Swarbrick led a delegation that appeared before the legal affairs committee of the Canadian Senate that was discussing the bill. Eventually the bill was defeated on a tie vote in the Senate and the federal government never reintroduced the legislation.|$|E

50|$|In 1919, the Hartford Steam Boiler Insurance and Inspection Company {{got tired}} of paying the claims on all those broken boilers, so {{they came up with}} the idea of this special piping {{configuration}} and mandated it for anyone who wanted insurance on their steam boiler.

Through <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> it becomes clear that the slurbow fired bolts and arrows like the crossbows they are based on. Most of the bolts designed for the slurbow had no feathers in the shaft as they would slow down the travel of the arrow.|$|R
5000|$|Robinson further {{commented on}} the {{recording}} process of Flux, remarking: [...] "On my last record, The Ceaseless Sight, I didn’t have as many songs. I had a few songs and parts of other songs and I {{wanted to use the}} studio to finish them. I liked the way it turned out, so for this record I said I’m not going to finish anything. You can have parts of songs and sit on them for a while, but when you’re in the studio you have a finite amount of time and you have to get in and finish them. There’s an urgency and I kind of like that pressure. It forces you to make creative decisions on {{how this is going to}} turn out. So that’s how I went in. I love the fact that it’s a very eclectic record and that it draws from all of my influences. It takes you on a journey and that’s what records should do. I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> as a whole. What I feel when I hear this record is that I’m in a different place for every song. I get inside this place and then the next song comes and I’m in a different place and I really like that. It’s really interesting to go with the music and where it takes you." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Ethiopia’s {{exchange}} rate {{policies have been}} a bone of contention for concerned economic analysts and commentators alike.

This nation's foremost energy accomplishment of this period has not been in achieving increased production. Despite a tenfold increase in the price of crude oil, U. S. production in 1981 was about the same as in 1973. Natural gas production was down. Production of coal and uranium has gone up some, but overall, neither consumption nor domestic production of energy has increased in the last nine years. ...|$|E
40|$|Africa’s export {{performance}} over recent decades is typically portrayed as being poor. This paper takes a new <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>record,</b> using {{data on the}} volume rather than the value of African exports. When analysed in volume terms a quite different picture of African {{export performance}} emerges. According to UNCTAD data, between 1990 - 2002 the export volumes for non-oil exporters actually increased by over 130 %. This impressive supply-side performance has not been properly documented. Previous studies have fixed {{too much attention to}} the value of African exports, something which, as primary commodity exporters, is largely beyond their control. The study uses estimates of volume of exports, available from UNCTAD, to explain African trade performance. Using a dynamic panel data analysis for 48 African countries over the period 1987 - 2002, the key determinants of export performance are ascertained. The implications of the findings for policy makers are subsequently discussed...|$|E
