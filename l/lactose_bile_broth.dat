40|$|There {{are several}} methods {{available}} for demonstration of enterococci contained in samples of foods and for determination of their numbers by {{the table of}} M. P. N. The author undertook a study of basic problems involved {{in one of the}} methods by which the numbers of enterococci are determined {{on the basis of the}} result of incubation of the culture of a confirmative medium which has been inoculated with the culture of a presumptive medium generally used to reveal the presence of coliform organisms. The results of the study are summarized as follows: (1) Enterococci of some strains are easily affected by sodium azide; if samples examined for enterococci contain them in minute amounts, multiplication of the micro-organisms would be inhibited. In order to obtain an accurate and reliable result, any inhibitor should not be added to the presumptive medium so that all varieties of enterococci may be allowed to multiply. (2) Experiments revealed that, when lactose broth was used as the presumptive medium, and a medium made by adding 0. 03 % sodium azide and 0. 00006 % ethyl violet to dextrose broth was used as the confirmative medium, the result was far better than would have been the case if any other methods had been used. The presence of enterococci was proved by morphologic and taxonomic study in nearly all the tubes which had been found positive by the above tests. We might, therefore, be justified in doing without morphologic and taxonomic study in some instances. (3) The method developed by the author makes it possible to carry on the experiments on enterococci side by side with those on coliform organisms at the same time; lactose broth is used as the presumptive medium for the two types of organisms, while brilliant green <b>bile</b> <b>lactose</b> <b>broth</b> and B.

Methodology: In two hospital laboratories in Viet Nam, comparisons of media for blood and stool culture were conducted. The effect of the volume of blood or stool on culture positivity rate was examined and direct plating of the blood buffy coat was trialed. Results: For 148 suspected typhoid fever cases, ox <b>bile</b> <b>broth</b> (58 positive) and brain-heart infusion broth containing saponin (63 positive), performed equally well. For 69 confirmed adult typhoid fever cases, large-volume (15 ml) blood culture gave the same sensitivity as 1 ml of bone marrow culture.

40|$|Background: Enteric fever {{is caused}} by the serotypes Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Paratyphi A, Salmonella Paratyphi B and Salmonella Paratyphi C. After {{emergence}} of multidrug resistant Salmonellae Ciprofloxacin, a fluorquinolone antibiotic was the first-line therapy. Treatment failure was observed with Ciprofloxacin soon and such strains showed in-vitro resistance to Nalidixic acid. Recent reports suggest re-emergence of Chloramphenicol sensitive strains and increasing Nalidixic acid resistance. This study is aimed at detecting the current trend in the antibiogram of Salmonella isolates from blood culture in coastal Karnataka, with an emphasis on antibiotic susceptibility of Nalidixic acid and Chloramphenicol and evaluate, if {{there is a need to}} modify the strategies in the antibiotic therapy for enteric fever. Materials and Methods: Blood samples received for culture in the laboratory between June 2009 and August 2011 was cultured in Brain Heart infusion <b>broth,</b> <b>bile</b> <b>broth</b> or in a commercial BACTEC culture media. The growth from blood cultures were processed for identification and antibiotic susceptibility as per standard methods. Antibiotic susceptibility for Ampicillin, Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, Chloramphenicol, Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone and Nalidixic acid were noted. Results: Out of 9053 blood culture specimens received, Salmonella was isolated from 103 specimens. There were 85 Salmonella Typhi isolates, 16 Salmonella Paratyphi A and two Salmonella Paratyphi B. Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A showed the highest resistance to Nalidixic acid. Salmonella Typhi showed highest susceptibility to Ceftriaxone and Salmonella Paratyphi A to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and Chloramphenicol. Two isolates were multidrug resistant. One Salmonella Paratyphi A was resistant to Ceftriaxone. Conclusion: Routine screening of Nalidixic acid susceptibility is practical to predict fluorquinolone resistance in Salmonella and preventing therapeutic failure while treating with it. It is worthwhile to consider replacing fluorquinolones with Chloramphenicol or Ceftriaxone as the first line of therapy for enteric fever. Periodic analysis of Salmonella antibiogram should be done to formulate the best possible treatment strategies...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{screening}} test is described for separating Bacteroides fragilis from other anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. The test utilizes filter paper disks impregnated with 25 mg of oxgall (Difco), tested {{in conjunction with}} antibiotic identification disks. The bile disks and antibiotic disks are placed on a supplemented brucella blood agar plate which has been inoculated by swabbing with a standardized cell suspension. After 24 h at 35 degrees C in a GasPak jar, resistance to kanamycin and bile is taken as a presumptive identification of B. fragilis. Susceptibility to one or both disks indicates {{the need for further}} identification and additional biochemical tests are required. Those strains that produce insufficient growth within 24 h {{are not likely to be}} B. fragilis. The reliability of the bile disk method was tested by comparing results with 100 clinical isolates versus results with <b>bile</b> in thioglycolate <b>broth,</b> peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth, and tryptic soy agar.

40|$|The {{following}} {{studies were}} done {{in response to questions}} regarding the adoption and use of the membrane filter (MF) technique for testing drinking water for the total coliform indicator group. A comparison with the most-probable-number technique showed that MF procedures with m-Endo agar LES were somewhat superior to the most-probable-number methods in terms of numbers of coliform organims recovered. Medium preparation and storage studies indicated that rehydration of m-Endo agar LES should be done with boiling water for less than 15 min, that m-Endo agar LES should not be exposed to light for more than 4 to 6 h, and that m-Endo agar LES plates may be used for up to 4 weeks and broth verification media for up to 3 weeks under given storage conditions. MF culture colonies were commonly found which did not produce sheen as expected for coliforms and yet were verified as coliforms. The occurrence and morphology of these atypical colonies were studied. Parallel inoculation of both lauryl tryptose (LT) and brilliant green <b>bile</b> (BGB) <b>broth</b> was found to be a better colony verification approach than recommended LT preenrichment before transfer to BGB. Comparison of parallel verification results indicated very little justification for the use of LT medium in MF verification procedures. In the case of overgrown or confluent cultures, the best coliform recoveries resulted from swabbing the MF plate and directly inoculating BGB medium with the swab. The occurrence of overgrowth was defined and evidence was collected suggesting that overgrowth is a function of sample holding time. Evaluation of routine test data and bacterial population reductions as a function of time indicated that nonquantitative recovery of coliforms may not be significantly affected for at least a 72 -h sample holding time...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{reported in}} this paper indicate that a pure culture of a virulent Type I pneumococcus as transferred under ordinary conditions {{is made up of}} individuals which are not identical in virulence for animals,—in bile solubility, or in their power to multiply under unfavorable conditions. By mechanical analysis alone no avirulent strains were obtained from the virulent strain, but one, Strain C, was separated which proved to be much more virulent for rabbits than its fellows. The virulent, colony-pure, Type I pneumococcus was allowed to multiply for several transplants in a series of cultures in (a) pneumococcus antiserum <b>broth,</b> (b) <b>bile</b> <b>broth,</b> and (c) slightly acid broth. When cultures from each series were plated on blood agar there appeared amid the ordinary pneumococcus colonies some that were totally different therefrom. Cultures from these new colonies were macroscopically bile-soluble, fermented inulin, and produced methemoglobin. Their occurrence under these different sets of conditions as well as careful controls excluded the possibility of a derivation by contamination. The new strains were avirulent and did not become virulent on repeated passage through mice. Antisera procured by the injection of them into rabbits were found to contain agglutinins for Type I pneumococci, but no protective antibodies. The avirulent strains are evidently pneumococci. It is possible that they may have been present in the parent strain and the unfavorable conditions of growth (immune serum, bile, slight acidity) might have allowed them to multiply while repressing the virulent forms. The individuals composing the pneumococcus culture are not all equally bile-soluble. By means of differential bile solubility, the avirulent forms were obtained within 12 hours from the parent strain though only twice in six experiments. It is possible that the avirulent individuals might not have been present in the 26 hour stock culture which yielded one of the positive results and that the organisms surviving the lysis might have retained sufficient bile after washing with isotonic salt solution for this to be responsible {{for the development of the}} variant. The fact that the identical experiment with the virulent Derivative Strain C revealed no avirulent forms renders it likely that the majority of the avirulent forms originated from the virulent individuals under the unfavorable conditions. The correctness of this interpretation is proven by the finding of these avirulent forms in virulent single cell derivative strains grown under unfavorable conditions. By contrast, strains of these avirulent forms descended from single diplococci did not revert to virulence. Apparently there had occurred a genuine bacterial mutation. These results in general are in accord with those of Griffith 8 who has made a more careful study of the properties of variants of pneumococci. He has recorded the occasional reversion of a variant when the single colony culture has been made after one serum passage. There is no reference in his article to any experiments with strains derived by the isolation of single diplococci. Further evidence of the composite nature of the parent strain as ordinarily grown is presented by the difference in the effect of long continued growth in immune serum on the pure line strains and on the parent strain itself. The pure line strains, equally as virulent for mice as the parent, and one of them, Strain C, more virulent for rabbits, became less virulent than the parent strain after twelve transplants in immune serum. Growth in normal horse serum did not affect the virulence. The single cell derivative, moreover, was found to be the less resistant to bile when grown in increasing concentrations of this lytic substance. The virulent Derivative Strain C became avirulent in eleven transplants in acid broth pH 6. 8 while the parent strain, though reduced in virulence, was still lethal in doses of 0. 001 cc. after the same number of transplants in this medium...|$|R
40|$|A 24 -h {{direct plating}} method for fecal {{coliform}} enumeration with a resuscitation step (preincubation for 2 h at 37 ± 1 °C {{and transfer to}} 44 ± 1 °C for 22 h) using fecal coliform agar (FCA) was compared with the 24 -h standardized violet red <b>bile</b> <b>lactose</b> agar (VRBL) method. FCA and VRBL have equivalent specificities and sensitivities, except for lactose-positive non-fecal coliforms such as Hafnia alvei, which could form typical colonies on FCA and VRBL. Recovery of cold-stressed Escherichia coli in mashed potatoes on FCA was about 1 log unit lower than that with VRBL. When the FCA method was compared with standard VRBL for enumeration of fecal coliforms, based on counting carried out on 170 different food samples, results {{were not significantly different}} (P > 0. 05). Based on 203 typical identified colonies selected as found on VRBL and FCA, the latter medium appears to allow the enumeration of more true fecal coliforms and has higher performance in certain ways (specificity, sensitivity, and negative and positive predictive values) than VRBL. Most colonies clearly identified on both media were E. coli and H. alvei, a non-fecal coliform. Therefore, the replacement of fecal coliform enumeration by E. coli enumeration to estimate food sanitary quality should be recommended...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi faces several {{environmental}} stresses while {{going through}} the stomach (acidic pH) to the small intestine (basic pH) and intracellularly in macrophages (acidic pH) in humans. The acidic pH followed by alkaline pH in the small intestine might be responsible for expression of certain stress-induced genes, resulting in not only better survival but also induction of multiplication and invasion of the bacterium in the small intestine. Based on this hypothesis, we developed a pro-cess wherein we exposed the blood, urine, and stool specimens from 90 acute typhoid fever patients and 36 chronic typhoid car-riers to acidic pH to see the effect on isolation rate of S. Typhi. About 5 g of freshly passed unpreserved stool, a centrifuged de-posit of 15 ml of urine, and 5 ml of blood clot were subjected to 5 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (pH 3. 5) for 20 min, followed by enrichment in <b>bile</b> broth-selenite F <b>broth.</b> When the combined isolation from all 3 specimens, i. e., blood, urine, and stool, after acid exposure was considered, a total of 77. 7 % of the acute typhoid patients were observed to be positive for {{the isolation of the}} S.

It therefore can be concluded that acid shock triggers the multiplication of the bacteria, resulting in better isolation rates from blood clot, stool, and urine specimens. The estimated global incidence of typhoid fever is about 26. 9 million new cases with 1 % mortality annually (1). This seems to be a gross underestimate, due to poor availability and perfor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Salmonella Typhi causes an {{estimated}} 21 million {{new cases of}} typhoid fever and 216, 000 deaths every year. Blood culture is currently {{the gold standard for}} diagnosis of typhoid fever, but it is time-consuming and takes several days for isolation and identification of causative organisms. It is then too late to initiate proper antibiotic therapy. Serological tests have very low sensitivity and specificity, and no practical value in endemic areas. As early diagnosis of the disease and prompt treatment are essential for optimal management, especially in children, a rapid sensitive detection method for typhoid fever is urgently needed. Although PCR is sensitive and rapid, initial research indicated similar sensitivity to blood culture and lower specificity. We developed a fast and highly sensitive blood culture PCR method for detection of Salmonella Typhi, allowing same-day initiation of treatment after accurate diagnosis of typhoid. Methods An ox <b>bile</b> tryptone soy <b>broth</b> was optimized for blood culture, which allows the complete lysis of blood cells to release intracellular bacteria without inhibiting the growth of Salmonella Typhi. Using the optimised broth Salmonella Typhi bacteria in artificial blood samples were enriched in blood culture and then detected by a PCR targeting the fliC-d gene of Salmonella Typhi. Results Tests demonstrated that 2. 4 % ox bile in blood culture not only lyzes blood cells completely within 1. 5 hours so that the intracellular bacteria could be released, but also has no inhibiting effect on the growth of Salmonella Typhi. Three hour enrichment of Salmonella Typhi in tryptone soya broth containing 2. 4 % ox bile could increase the bacterial number from 0. 75 CFU per millilitre of blood which is similar to clinical typhoid samples to the level which regular PCR can detect. The whole blood culture PCR assay takes less than 8 hours to complete rather than several days for conventional blood culture. Conclusions This novel blood culture PCR method is superior in speed and sensitivity to both conventional blood culture and PCR assays. Its use in clinical diagnosis may allow early detection of the causative organism and facilitate initiation of prompt treatment among patients with typhoid fever. </p...|$|R
