5|$|I. fittoni was {{described}} by Lydekker in 1889. <b>Like</b> <b>I.</b> dawsoni, this species {{was described}} from the Wadhurst Clay of East Sussex. It is now the type species of Hypselospinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{world record}} jump was very smooth. It felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> {{was lying on}} my stomach on a glass coffee table, {{watching}} a movie projected on a screen underneath the table. Although the flight was very smooth, {{it seemed like the}} movie projector was running the film faster than intended.|$|E
5|$|I've {{never had}} chills through my entire body <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had from hearing Beyoncé sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul {{and became the}} song that was coming from hers. In all my life, I have never heard {{anything}} as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever {{be one of the}} best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.|$|E

60|$|I mix a {{good deal}} with the Millionaires. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> them. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> their faces. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the way they live. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the things they eat. The more we mix {{together}} the better <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the things we mix.|$|R
60|$|CONFUCIUS. Surely. Nobody <b>likes</b> me: <b>I</b> am held in awe. Capable {{persons are}} never <b>liked.</b> <b>I</b> am not likeable; but I am indispensable.|$|R
5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't <b>like</b> <b>I</b> made this mistake or that mistake. It was <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it <b>like</b> <b>I</b> always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', <b>like</b> <b>I</b> am going to be happy.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s <b>like</b> <b>I</b> say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

'Yes,' said Dick, deliberately, 'I <b>like</b> the power; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the fun; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the fuss; {{and above}} all <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the money. <b>I</b> almost <b>like</b> {{the people who make}} the fuss and pay the money. Almost. But they're a queer gang,--an amazingly queer gang!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Princess Donna {{identifies}} {{her sexual}} identity as [...] "queer," [...] {{according to a}} 2008 interview in the Village Voice. She said: [...] "My sexuality lies outside the dominant culture of vanilla heteronormativity. I'm everything but straight. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> girls, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> boys, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> transgender boys and girls." ...|$|R

5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
5|$|Literature in Virginia often {{deals with}} the state's {{extensive}} and sometimes troubled past. The works of Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Glasgow often dealt with social inequalities {{and the role of}} women in her culture. Glasgow's peer and close friend James Branch Cabell wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry in the Reconstruction era, and challenged its moral code with Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice. William Styron approached history in works such as The Confessions of Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice. Tom Wolfe has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers <b>like</b> <b>I</b> Am Charlotte Simmons. Mount Vernon native Matt Bondurant received critical acclaim for his historic novel The Wettest County in the World about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>like</b> compliments. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to go {{home and}} tell them all over again to the members of my family. They don't believe them, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to tell them in the home circle, all the same. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to dream of them if I can.|$|R

60|$|MRS. JUNO. Then I won't do it: that's flat. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to be <b>liked.</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to be loved. I want {{everyone}} round me to love me. I don't {{want to meet}} or speak to anyone who doesn't like me.|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> am playing a horn. I try to improvise. What comes out is what I feel.|$|E
5|$|Cricket and {{football}} became {{popular in the}} state; both were introduced in Malabar during the British colonial period in the 19th century. Cricketers, like Tinu Yohannan, Abey Kuruvilla, Sreesanth and Sanju Samson, found places in the national cricket team. However, the Kerala cricket team has never won or performed well at the Ranji Trophy. A cricket club from Kerala, the Kochi Tuskers, played in the Indian Premier League's fourth season. However, the team was disbanded after the season because of conflicts of interest among its franchises. Football {{is one of the}} most widely played and watched sports with huge support for club and district level matches. In the Indian Super League the official team of Kerala is the Kerala Blasters. Kozhikode in Kerala hosts the Sait Nagjee Football Tournament. Kerala is one of the major footballing states in India along with West Bengal and Goa and has produced national players <b>like</b> <b>I.</b> M. Vijayan, C. V. Pappachan, V. P. Sathyan, Jo Paul Ancheri, and Pappachen Pradeep. The Kerala state football team has won the Santhosh Trophy five times; in 1973, 1992, 1993, 2001 and 2004. They were also the runners-up eight times.|$|E

5000|$|In {{regards to}} the album's lyrical themes, Blasko told Rolling Stone Australia magazine: [...] "The basis is {{definitely}} my life, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to take it into a heightened reality. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the idea of 'the character' on the record. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> musicals, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it to be fancy." ...|$|R
5000|$|In rhetoric, antimetabole ( [...] ) is the {{repetition}} of words in successive clauses, but in transposed order; for example, [...] "I know what <b>I</b> <b>like,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> what <b>I</b> know". It is related to, and sometimes considered a special case of, chiasmus.|$|R

25|$|Iris grow well in {{most any}} garden soil types {{providing}} they are well-drained. The earliest to bloom are species <b>like</b> <b>I.</b> junonia and I. reichenbachii, which flower {{as early as}} February and March in the Northern Hemisphere, followed by the dwarf forms of I. pumila, and then {{by most of the}} tall bearded varieties, such as the German Iris and its variety florentina, Sweet Iris, Hungarian Iris, Lemon-yellow Iris (I. flavescens), Iris sambucina, I. amoena, and their natural and horticultural hybrids such as those described under names <b>like</b> <b>I.</b> neglecta or I. squalens and best united under I. × lurida.|$|E
25|$|It {{implies that}} the concern with canon is viewed as another historical-critical {{technique}} which can take its place alongside of source criticism, form criticism, rhetorical criticism, and the <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> do not envision the approach to canon in this light. Rather, {{the issue at stake}} in canon turns on establishing a stance from which the Bible is to be read as Sacred Scripture.|$|E
25|$|I {{would never}} say ‘I’m straight, I’m bisexual, I’m gay.’ I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> will {{fall in love with}} a human being for who they are. I’m not afraid to say I’ve been {{attracted}} to a woman before and I’ve kissed girls before and been in love with them before. I’ve never really had a girlfriend or anything and I {{would never say}} I’m anything, really. I don’t have an identity in that way.|$|E
6000|$|I {{am glad to}} {{know you}} like the [...] "Prince and the Pauper" [...] so well and I believe with you that the dream is good {{evidence}} of that <b>liking.</b> <b>I</b> think I may say, with your sister that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> myself best when I am serious.|$|R

25|$|Quite {{a few of}} the {{pioneering}} apologists were Baptist pastors, <b>like</b> <b>I.</b> M. Haldeman, or participants in the Plymouth Brethren, like William C. Irvine and Sydney Watson. Watson wrote a series of didactic novels like Escaped from the Snare: Christian Science, Bewitched by Spiritualism, and The Gilded Lie, as warnings of the dangers posed by cultic groups. Watson's use of fiction to counter the cults has been repeated by later novelists like Frank E. Peretti.|$|E
25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. I felt the rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E
