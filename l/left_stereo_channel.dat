50|$|The song {{starts with}} the {{atmospheric}} sounds of a London Underground station, then a tense, syncopated beat carried by the bass guitar. The lyrics are sentimental, contrasting the warmth of home and domestic life with the dangers of 1970s London's urban decay and casual late-night violence.

5000|$|The {{ending of}} the A-side of the album is the punk song Los Paul, which begins with the {{striking}} line [...] "Go Paul, {{you have to really}} hit him in the balls!". In the verses, Krawinkel plays a single repetitive chord on the electric guitar, accompanied by a quick beat from the drums. Remmler sings a couple of phrases which are taken from the commentary of a football match. After the second chorus, the vocals stop. In the <b>left</b> <b>stereo</b> <b>channel,</b> clips of a real football commentary can be heard, in which video replays are analysed. At the same time, in the right stereo channel, multiple news readers are reporting one after the other about the attack on Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes mono {{sound or}} {{monaural}} can simply {{refer to a}} merged pair of stereo channels - also known as [...] "collapsed stereo" [...] or [...] "folded-down stereo". Over time some devices have used mono sound amplification circuitry with two or more speakers since it can cut {{the cost of the}} hardware. Some consumer electronics with stereo RCA outputs have a microswitch in the red RCA output (i.e., the right stereo channel) that disables merging of stereo sound into the white (<b>left</b> <b>stereo</b> <b>channel)</b> RCA output. Common devices with this are VCRs, DVD/Blu-ray players, information appliances, set-top boxes, and the like. Video game consoles sometimes have male RCA ends of cables with a proprietary multi-A/V plug on the other end, which prevents automatic stereo merging unless adapters are used.|$|E
5000|$|... 2002 EMI/VirginOn 16 July 2002, a 2-disc {{version was}} {{released}} by EMI/Virgin. The {{first in a series}} of 30th Anniversary 2CD Editions, this release included a newly remastered version as its first CD. The remaster on this edition reverses the <b>left</b> and right <b>stereo</b> <b>channels</b> on the first disc and many of the songs have been edited.

On the CD version the <b>left</b> {{and right}} <b>stereo</b> <b>channels</b> were reversed. This CD was reissued again in 1995 by Rykodisc. Much {{of the material}} on the album was {{made available to the}} public again when Läther was finally officially released to the public in 1996 after Zappa's death. In 2012, under a new distribution agreement between Gail Zappa (Frank's widow) and Universal Music Group, the CD was reissued yet again under the Zappa Records label. Despite new packaging the content is the same as other CD releases.|$|R

It also includes 3.5mm audio input and output jacks. The Pill charges over a Micro USB port, and comes with a USB AC adapter. The device also includes a microphone {{so it can be}} used as a speakerphone. The Pill is also an aptX-certified device. In 2013, updated versions of the Pill, Beats Pill 2.0, were released. The new models have longer battery life, a port for charging other USB devices, the ability to pair Pills together with near-field communication (NFC) to play the same audio either individually, or handling <b>left</b> and right <b>stereo</b> <b>channels</b> respectively, character stands, and a new, larger [...] "XL" [...] version.|$|R
50|$|Crossfeeding blends the <b>left</b> {{and right}} <b>stereo</b> <b>channels</b> slightly, {{reducing}} the extreme channel separation which {{is characteristic of}} headphone listening in older stereo recordings, and is known to cause headaches in {{a small fraction of}} listeners. Crossfeed also improves the soundstage characteristics and makes the music sound more natural, as if one was listening to a pair of speakers. While some swear by crossfeed, many prefer amplifiers without it. The introduction of digital signal processing (DSP) technology led a number of manufacturers to introduce amplifiers with 'headphone virtualization' features. In principle, the DSP chips allow the two-driver headphone to simulate a full Dolby 5.1 (or more) surround system. When the sounds from the two headphone drivers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate the source of a sound. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine as they do with crossfeed, the illusion of sound directionality is created.|$|R
40|$|SIR-C/X-SAR is {{currently}} scheduled for launch in April 1994. SIR-C is an L-Band and C-Band, multi-polarization spaceborne SAR system developed by NASA/JPL. X- SAR is an X-Band SAR system developed by DARA/ASI. One {{of the problems}} involved in calibrating the SIR-C instrument {{is to make sure}} that the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarized beams are aligned in the azimuth direction, i. e [...] that they are pointing in the same direction. This is important if the polarimetric performance specifications for the system are to be met. To solve this problem, we have designed and built a prototype of a low-cost ground receiver capable of recording received power from two antennas, one H-polarized, the other V-polarized. The two signals are mixed to audio then recorded on the <b>left</b> and right <b>stereo</b> <b>channels</b> of a standard audio cassette player.

50|$|Home {{entertainment}} centers may {{be attached}} to high-fidelity stereo or quadraphonic speakers. By the 2000s, the best sound systems were designed for home theater and movie sound. It typically includes {{more than just the}} <b>left</b> and right <b>stereo</b> <b>channels.</b> Television and VHS typically encodes extra channels onto the two main channels, while digital modes encode this information into the digital DVD source data, with center, two rear, and a subwoofer speakers. The difficulty is usually in wiring and placing the rear speakers and the necessity of buying a receiver which can decode the sound. As the size of video monitors has increased, rather than having a 20-inch TV surrounded by massive stereo equipment, it is common to have a very large flat or projection screen with a small and integrated DVD player / receiver and satellite or digital cable receiver underneath, with small remote speakers and a moderate sized subwoofer.The audio and video components have special connectors which are often hooked to a dedicated box whose connections and functions are known to only one person in the household. The items are then plugged into an electrical outlet strip, which should have a surge protector. Each component typically has its own remote control, though expensive universal remote controls are available that can learn or are programmed with most common equipment.|$|R
40|$|Stereoscopic Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) in a tiled setup, {{so-called}} display walls, {{are rising}} {{as a replacement}} for the classic projection-based systems for Virtual Reality (VR) applications. They have numerous benefits over projectors, the only drawback being their maximum size, which is why VR applications usually resort to using tiled display walls. Problems of display walls are the obvious bezels between single displays making up the wall and, most importantly, the complicated pipeline to display synchronized content across all participating screens. This becomes especially crucial when we are dealing with active-stereo content, where precisely timed display of the <b>left</b> and right <b>stereo</b> <b>channels</b> across the entire display area is essential. Usually, these scenarios require a variety of expensive, specialized hardware, which makes it difficult for such wall setups to spread more widely. In this paper, we present our service-oriented architecture Display as a Service (DaaS), which uses a virtualization approach to shift the problem of pixel distribution from specialized hardware to a generic software. DaaS provides network-transparent virtual framebuffers (VFBs) for pixel-producing applications to write into and virtual dis-plays (VDs), which potentially span multiple physical displays making up a display wall, to present generated pixels on. Our architecture assumes network-enabled displays with integrated processing capabilities, such that all communication for pixel transport and synchronization between VFBs and VDs can happen entirely over I...|$|R
