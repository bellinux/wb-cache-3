5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a battery manufacturing plant where lead was used in the processes of production, to survey the working conditions and safety behaviors, and to measure the airborne <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> contaminated in the workplace and the blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of workers. The survey of working conditions showed that the workers were directly exposed to lead in sections e. g. grid casting, spreading, forming and polishing, assembly and special battery production sections. Some workers in these sections used a cotton mask to protect dust exposure, but most workers did not use any masks. High airborne <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> more than 0. 2 mg/m 3 was frequently measured in these sections. Geometric average of blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> slightly increased from 17. 9 µg/dl to 22. 3 µg/dl during 1998 and 2001. However, the geometric average of blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> dropped to 17. 4 µg/dl in 2002. No workers had blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> above 60 µg/dl. Workers with different age groups had no significantly different average blood <b>lead</b> <b>level.</b> Workers whose duration of work was between 20 – 29 years had average blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of 21. 5 µg/dl.

5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples.

However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E

40|$|Background: Widespread use of lead {{has caused}} {{extensive}} environmental contamination and health problems {{in many parts}} of the world. Children are particularly vulnerable and even relatively low levels of exposure can cause serious health conditions. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> in children in industrial city of Nepal, Birgunj. Materials and Methods: The cross sectional study was done on 50 school going student in Birgunj city, Nepal from November 2016 to January 2017. Questionnaire was used to collect data. Capillary blood was drawn and Blood <b>Lead</b> <b>Level</b> was measured immediately. SPSS ver. 22 was used to analyze the data. Results: The mean age of children in study was 12. 5 ± 1. 11 years. Among 50 children, 54 % were male and 46 % were female. The mean blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> was 20. 33 ± 9. 36 μg/dl (male 21. 08 ± 8. 87 μg/dl, female 19. 46 ± 10. 92 μg/dl). All the children in the study have elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and 84 % of them have > 10 μg/dl.

5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|The levels found {{today in}} {{most people are}} orders of {{magnitude}} greater than those of pre-industrial society. Due to reductions of lead in products and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today, but low level lead exposure is still common.

During the end of the 20th century, the blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> deemed acceptable steadily declined.

5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%.
