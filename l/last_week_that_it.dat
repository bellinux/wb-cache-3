The last time Malaysia discussed this issue was almost a decade ago but it was of little avail. Maybe this time it will be different. A survey recently (NST, May 9) showed that many Malaysians pay exorbitant prices for their medicines. In fact, drug prices in Malaysia are far above the international reference pricing, a guide on how much medicine should cost. The ministry's list of essential medicines will include antibiotics, aspirin and other painkillers, as well as medicines for high blood pressure and depression...|$|E

Roy McMurtry LLB ‘ 58, LLD ‘ 91, former Attorney General and Chief Justice of Ontario and current Chancellor of York University. The McMurtry Visiting Clinical Fellowship will bring leading lawyers and related practitioners to Osgoode for a term or part of a term to provide mentorship to students and lawyers engaged in experiential education initiatives. Fellowship holders may also teach and get involved with Osgoode’s mooting and lawyering programs, participate in research projects, deliver public and faculty lectures, and assist with institutional projects in their areas of expertise and interest. The McMurtry Fellowship, together with the Law School’s announcement <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be the first Canadian law school to introduce an experiential education requirement – a “praxicum” – into its Juris Doctor (JD) curriculum and to open an Office of Experiential Education to develop and support experiential learning initiatives, are key components of a larger, five-year strategic plan (“Experience Osgoode”) to advance experiential education, and build partnerships and collaboration to achieve that goal. “McMurtry Fellowships will {{play a vital role in}} creating bridges between the academic, policy and practice communities and provide Osgoode students, staff and faculty with the opportunity to connect with broader practice networks and expertise,” said Sossin, adding that the Fellowship holders will be chosen in the spring of each year by an ad hoc selection committee of the Law School consisting of faculty, student and staff representatives. The Fellowship holders will receive an office, administrative support and a stipend with the expectation that they will spend a semester in residence at Osgoode. Sossin said it is truly fitting that the new Fellowship should bear McMurtry’s name as he “has long championed building bridges between the academy, Bar and Bench. ” He described McMurtry as “a driving force” behind numerous endeavours including the creation of Ontario 2 ̆ 7 s legal aid system, and particularly the expansion of the community legal clinic model in the 1970 s, as well as the founding of the Ontario Justice Education Network and the Chief Justice 2 ̆ 7 s Advisory Committee on Professionalism. “Roy McMurtry 2 ̆ 7 s roots at Osgoode are broad and deep,” Sossin said. “He was given an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1991. He is a featured graduate in Osgoode 2 ̆ 7 s Catalysts initiative and the Honourary Chair of the Osgoode History 2 ̆ 6 Archives Project, which showcases the Law School’s illustrious past in dynamic displays throughout our new building. ” Sossin added that the Law School is privileged to welcome a number of Visiting Professors every year who contribute enormously to the School’s academic programs, and the McMurtry Fellowship holders will augment that rich tradition. As an example of the goals of the McMurtry Fellowship program, this September, renowned human rights litigator Joseph Arvay, Q. C. of Arvay Finlay Barristers is visiting Osgoode to provide mentorship to Osgoode’s Clinical Education Program and will deliver the James Lewtas Lecture entitled “Is there a Constitutional Right to Die?” on Wednesday, September 19 at 1 p. m. in Room 1001. York University is the leading interdisciplinary research and teaching university in Canada. York offers a modern, academic experience at the undergraduate and graduate level in Toronto, Canada’s most international city.

40|$|Fears {{that such}} a rights charter would {{infringe}} our liberties ignore {{the voices of the}} vulnerable and dispossessed, writes Caroline FleayWHILE the Rudd government announced <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> supports calls for human rights education and greater scrutiny of legislation that might breach human rights, it stopped short of supporting a charter of rights. Clearly the government is nervous about being seen to be too supportive of this approach to protecting freedoms and entitlements. This nervousness no doubt reflects the fears that have been publicly expressed since the Brennan committee reported to the federal government last September. The report followed the national human rights consultations held throughout Australia last year and its recommendations include a federal charter of human rights. If you have missed the subsequent commentary, let me give you some of the highlights. In a measured rejection of calls for a human rights charter, earlier this year journalist Paul Kelly argued that the majority of Australians do not want such legislation. In a not-so-measured response, lawyer James Allen described the national human rights consultations process as “one-sided hocus pocus”. Elise Parham from the Centre for Independent Studies {{went so far as to}} declare that adopting such a charter would result in a “Shakespearean tragedy”. She cautioned that, unlike other laws, a charter’s rights could directly influence the actions of government and the judiciary, and indirectly affect the actions of those in business and the community. But surely human rights legislation should set reasonable limits over the actions of government and other actors? This seems to be the crux of the concerns of these critics of a charter, and was made most explicit in Joe Hockey’s claim last month that “personal and social liberties are being trampled in the pursuit of human rights”. The theme emerging is a fear about what will happen if federal legislative protections for human rights in Australia are adopted. Or, to put it less kindly, a desire to incite fear about what will happen if a human rights charter was to be adopted – namely, that our individual liberties would be dangerously limited by any substantive articulation of human rights in federal legislation. This is an understanding of individual liberties rooted in the liberalism of the Enlightenment. For these philosophers it was important that individuals retained a sphere of freedom in their lives within which government could not interfere. Indeed, one of the purposes of government was to protect such a sphere of freedom in order for individuals to be able to pursue their version of the good life. Of course, there ensued much debate about the extent of such individual liberties. John Stuart Mill, Hockey’s favourite philosopher, argued that there should be limits on our individual liberties when their pursuit threatens the liberties of others. That is, individuals should only be free to pursue their version of the good life to the extent that they do not prevent others from doing so. John Stuart Mill was onto something. We need to accept some restraints on our behaviours to ensure we don’t unnecessarily infringe the freedoms of others. But how should we articulate what these restraints should be?  This is where the language of human rights can help. Human rights is based on the assumption that as humans we all share certain rights that need to be realised for us to live a life of dignity. This includes the liberties considered important by the Enlightenment liberals – civil and political rights such as freedoms of expression, religion and association, and the right to participate in the political life of your society. But the human rights language has also evolved to include economic, social and cultural rights, such as rights to adequate housing, education and healthcare, and to access the culture of your community. Similarly, the right to self-determination has come to be considered important for being able to live a life of dignity. It is this broad inclusion of human rights that has given this language its potency for vulnerable members of societies. The language of human rights has been adopted by a growing number of the dispossessed and politically vulnerable to assert their claims for a life of dignity. Some of their voices were heard in the national human rights consultations. By asserting that we are all rights-holders, the language of human rights places obligations on others to respect and protect our rights, particularly governments. Conceiving of everyone as rights-holders gives agency to those who are vulnerable and least able to access what they need to live a life of dignity. It provides an important alternative to notions of charity where resources allocated to the vulnerable depend almost totally on the benevolence of those who can afford or have the power to give. Human rights recognises that how we treat the vulnerable in our society is one of the most important measures of our humanity. In a society that is based on the rule of law, surely we should be interested in passing laws that recognise we all have rights to what we need to live a life of dignity. These laws should include the broad range of human rights – not just the individual liberties articulated in civil and political rights, but also social, economic and cultural rights, and the right to self-determination. Fears {{that such a}} human rights charter would infringe our individual liberties ignore the voices of the vulnerable and dispossessed. They may not be the majority in Australia but it is up to us all to acknowledge their importance as fellow humans. •Caroline Fleay is a lecturer at the Centre for Human Rights Education at Curtin University...|$|E

25|$|During the May 27, 2015 CMLL Informa show <b>it</b> was {{revealed}} <b>that</b> Negro Casas {{would be the}} trainer for Blue Panther Jr, Canelo Casas, Delta and Guerrero Maya Jr. while Virus would be the trainer for Zavala, Disturbio, Esfinge and Flyer. Three out of the four wrestlers on Virus' team were already in his wrestling class, adding Disturbio to the group. During the CMLL Informa episode the announcers pushed the storyline that Casas might {{have a harder time}} with his team, training the son of long time rival Blue Panther, Casas' nephew and the two most experienced wrestlers in the group who may not be as open to his input as a trainer. During the first round Guerrero Maya Jr. earned 100 points from winning five matches in total during the seven-week round-robin tournament, the most of any of the participants while Flyer only earned 30 points for one victory (over Blue Panther Jr.) and a draw against Canelo Casas, the least of any participant. Guerrero Maya Jr. was also the person to get the highest accumulated score from the judges, a total of 221 points, with Delta receiving the lowest collective score a total of 132 points. The online poll had Boby Zavala as the top point earner with 221 points and Blue Panther Jr as the lowest with only 53 points in total. While Flyer scored low both in matches and with the judges the fan polls were strongly in his favor during the <b>last</b> four <b>weeks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> moved him into fifth position. Blue Panther Jr., who was already the lowest ranked competitor, did not work his final match of the first round, with CMLL claiming force majure, replacing him in the match with Hechicero who wrestled against Delta but did not get any points. His no-show did not change his rankings as he could not possibly have ended higher than seventh place. For the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of the first round it looked as if Flyer would be in third place as long as he got decent points from the judges due to his strong poll numbers, but he was forced {{to pull out of the}} match due to a foot injury. Due to this CMLL had Guerrero Maya Jr. wrestle against Tritón. By not scoring any points from the judges at all Flyer felt to fourth position. In the end Guerrero Maya Jr., Bobby Zavala, Esfinge and Disturbio all qualified for the second round. Between rounds trainer Negro Casas will team up with Guerrero Maya Jr. and Boby Zavala to take on Virus, Esfinge and Disturbio as part of the July 24 Super Viernes show.|$|R
