5000|$|The [...] "Place of the Relevant Intermediary Approach" [...] (or [...] "PRIMA") is {{increasingly}} being favoured over the <b>look-through</b> <b>approach.</b> It {{is the basis}} for the Hague Securities Convention, which if ratified, will supersede the <b>look-through</b> <b>approach</b> globally. In January 2001, at the first Special Commission of the Hague Securities Convention, the <b>look-through</b> <b>approach</b> was resoundingly rejected by the 119 experts in attendance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>look-through</b> <b>approach</b> {{has lost}} {{applicability}} {{due to the}} increasing complexity of cross-border securities transactions {{brought about by the}} introduction of an indirect holding system. There are severe conceptual, legal and practical difficulties with continuing to apply the <b>look-through</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>look-through</b> <b>approach</b> {{also creates}} severe {{practical}} difficulties: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>look-through</b> <b>approach</b> is a {{conflict}} of laws rule applied to the proprietary aspects of security transactions. It is an application of the traditional lex rei sitae (where the property is situated) test.|$|E
50|$|Uncertainties {{as to the}} approach, and of the <b>look-through</b> <b>approach,</b> if applicable, lead to {{significant}} expense for market participants. Because the position in many cases cannot be satisfactorily determined, there remains an element of systemic risk.|$|E
5000|$|The Place of the Relevant Intermediary Approach, or PRIMA, is a {{conflict}} of laws rule applied to the proprietary aspects of security transactions, especially collateral transactions. It is an alternative approach to the historically important <b>look-through</b> <b>approach,</b> and was in its earliest {{form the basis for}} the initial draft of the Hague Securities Convention.http://hcch.e-vision.nl/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=72 ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike the <b>look-through</b> <b>approach,</b> PRIMA {{does not}} look through the various tiers of {{intermediaries}} to the underlying securities. Rather, it stops {{at the level of}} the intermediary immediately above the parties to the pledge or transfer. Its important advantage is that it subjects an investor's interest in securities to the law of a single jurisdiction, even where evidence of underlying securities is situated in many different countries, or where various issuers in a single portfolio is involved. This provides certainty and clarity for all parties involved.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{indirect}} holding system, securities are held through fungible accounts (omnibus accounts). Under such a system, {{there is no}} record of an individual investor's interest in respect of the securities {{at the level of the}} issuer's or intermediary's register, other than the intermediary with whom the investor has a direct relationship. Thus, if the investor, or a person such as a collateral taker asserting a claim against the investor's interest were to try to enforce that claim at any of these higher levels, the response would be that no record exists of any interest against which the claim could be pursued. This problem demonstrates that any attempt to apply the <b>look-through</b> <b>approach</b> under a fungible custody structure runs counter to the widespread conflict of laws principle that jurisdiction over proprietary aspects of dispositions of movable property should broadly be attributed to the jurisdiction where orders in respect of that property are capable of being enforced.|$|E
