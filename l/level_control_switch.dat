40|$|The {{improvement}} of the energy efficiency of belt conveyor systems can be achieved at equipment or operation <b>levels.</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>control</b> and variable speed control are proposed in literature to improve energy efficiency of belt conveyors. The current implementations mostly focus on lower <b>level</b> <b>control</b> loops or an individual belt conveyor without operational considerations at the system level. In this paper, an optimal <b>switching</b> <b>control</b> and a variable speed drive (VSD) based optimal control are proposed to improve the energy efficiency of belt conveyor systems at the operational level, where time-of-use (TOU) tariff, ramp rate of belt speed and other system constraints are considered. A coal conveying system in a coal-fired power plant is taken as a case study, where great saving of energy cost is achieved by the two optimal control strategies. Moreover, considerable energy saving resulting from VSD based optimal control is also proved by the case study.

40|$|Blood {{vessels are}} part of the stem cell niche in the {{developing}} cerebral cortex, but their in vivo role in controlling the expansion and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in development has not been studied. Here, we report that relief of hypoxia in the developing cerebral cortex by ingrowth of blood vessels temporo-spatially coincided with NSC differentiation. Selective perturbation of brain angiogenesis in vessel-specific Gpr 124 null embryos, which prevented the relief from hypoxia, increased NSC expansion at the expense of differentiation. Conversely, exposure to increased oxygen levels rescued NSC differentiation in Gpr 124 null embryos and increased it further in WT embryos, suggesting that niche blood vessels regulate NSC differentiation at least in part by providing oxygen. Consistent herewith, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α <b>levels</b> <b>controlled</b> the <b>switch</b> of NSC expansion to differentiation. Finally, we provide evidence that high glycolytic activity of NSCs is required to prevent their precocious differentiation in vivo. Thus, blood vessel function is required for efficient NSC differentiation in the developing cerebral cortex by providing oxygen and possibly regulating NSC metabolism. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Afterwards, {{we develop}} control {{strategies}} {{to optimize the}} overall image delivery of the camera, for example, by optimizing the SNR, stability of operation under varying conditions, and avoiding switching in operational modes. The purpose of these discussions breaks down in several aspects. The main question that is addressed is the design and operation of image <b>level</b> <b>control</b> algorithms and a suitable overall control strategy, to achieve stable, accurate, and smooth <b>level</b> <b>control,</b> avoiding <b>switching</b> in operational modes and enabling subsequent perceptual image improvement. The output image should have as good SNR as possible and signal clipping should be avoided, or only introduced in a controllable fashion. The <b>level</b> <b>control</b> strategy should provide a good solution {{for all types of}} images/video signals, including low-, medium-, and high-dynamic range images. One of the problems in the control system is the lens, as it has unknown transfer characteristics, the lens opening is not known, and the involved mechanical control is unpredictable in accuracy and response time. As already mentioned, many other parameters need to be controlled as well, so that a potentially attractive proposal would be to control those parameters all in parallel and enforce an overall control stability, accuracy, and speed. The design of such a parallel control system, combined with a good integration with the tone mapping and enhancement part of the image pipeline, is one of the contributions of this paper, which will be presented in Section 5. The presentation of the novel design is preceded by a standard overall control strategy for lens, exposure time, and gain.|$|R

OpenFlow is an innovative tech-nology and enables fine-grained, flow <b>level</b> <b>control</b> of Eth-ernet <b>switching.</b> However, the flow table structure defined by OpenFlow is not hardware friendly and the scalability {{is limited by the}} switch device. OpenFlow is also not sufficient for fast multipath failover. To overcome these limitations, we propose DomainFlow in which the network is split into sections and exact matches are used where possible to en-able practical flow management using OpenFlow for com-modity switches. We applied a prototype of DomainFlow to multipath flow management in the Virtual eXtensible LAN (VXLAN) overlay network environment.

50|$|East has {{endorsed}} Yamaha instruments since 1981 and developed his own custom 5-string signature model in 1994, the BBNE (modeled after his early 1980s BB5000 5-string bass). The 2nd and current Nathan East signature bass, the BBNE2 {{was released in}} 2001, though Nathan can be seen playing the original prototype as early as 2000. The original prototype has a solid Gotoh bridge where as the production model has the Yamaha BPZ-7 bridge which features individual, machined saddles that provide more precise intonation and clarity. The BBNE2 bass has a slightly smaller body than the BBNE as well as neck-thru construction where the BBNE was a bolt-on. The BBNE2 appears to be heavily influenced by Nathan's late 1980s custom black Yamaha LB-1 Motion 5-string bass. The BBNE2's electronics feature a custom preamp with a three band eq that includes the NE-1 (eq pedal) circuit built in with its own <b>level</b> <b>control</b> and on/off <b>switch.</b> The NE-1 circuit is a parametric mid control that allows the user to specifically target midrange frequencies to cut. The BBNE2's <b>control</b> <b>switches</b> for the on-board NE-1 have been confused for a piezo circuit by many people due to its resemblance to early piezo equipped TRBP models. The BBNE2 is available in both solid white or solid black finishes with gold hardware and an ebony fingerboard. Yamaha also released {{a small number of}} white BBNE2 basses that included all black hardware, this model was called the BBNE2 Artist model.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In <b>controlled</b> <b>switching</b> technology, an {{effective}} way to reduce transients produced by switching action, equipment failure preventions, and to inhance power quality, that is, already defined controlled strategies are to close and/or open each independent circuit breaker pole. <b>Controlled</b> <b>switching</b> of high voltage AC gas circuit breaker (GCB) and explains the <b>controlled</b> <b>switching</b> methods that are existing now a days is presented in this paper.

40|$|A Distributed Switch {{is a set}} of FCDFs {{associated}} with at least one <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch,</b> that <b>controls</b> the operations of the set of FCDFs. Figure 42 shows an example of Distributed Switch composed of a <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and two FCDFs. From an external point of view (i. e., outside the dotted and dashed black line in figure 42), a Distribut-ed Switch behaves as a Fibre Channel Switch. In particular, a Distributed Switch supports the instan-tiation of N_Port to F_Port links and of E_Port to E_Port links (ISLs). N_Port to F_Port links are supported by both FCDFs and <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switches,</b> while ISLs are supported only by <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switches.</b> This means {{that it is possible to}} connect a Distributed Switch to another Switch only through a <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch,</b> not through an FCDF. From an internal point of view (i. e., inside the dotted and dashed black line in figure 42), A_Port to A_Port links (ASLs) enable FC frames forwarding between <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and FCDFs, as well as between FCDFs. ASLs are also used to exchange control information between <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and FCDFs. The <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> uses one or more Virtual Domain_IDs Domain_ID to perform N_Port_ID allo-cations for N_Ports connected to the FCDF Set FCDFs of the Distributed Switch (i. e., a Virtual Domain_ID is used as the most significant byte in the N_Port_IDs allocated to N_Ports that are at-tached to an FCDF of the FCDF SetDistributed <b>Switch).</b> The <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> uses also another Domain_ID, called Principal Domain, for its normal functions as a Fibre Channel Switch. As a result, a Distributed Switch such as the one shown in figure 42 uses at least two Domain_IDs: one for the Principal Domain and one or more for the Virtual Domain.

40|$|Abstract- A new carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) - based <b>controlled</b> <b>switch</b> is introduced. The new CNT device {{is a field}} emission – based device that uses field electron emission from the CNT to implement the functionality of <b>controlled</b> <b>switching.</b> To implement the field emission CNT <b>controlled</b> <b>switch,</b> four field emission CNTs that have single {{carbon nanotube}}s as the emitters were tested; two with single-walled CNT and two with multi-walled CNT. A tube with a tungsten tip was also used for comparison. The Fowler-Nordheim analysis of the DC currentvoltage data provided reasonable values for the local fields at the emitters and the sizes of the emitters. It is also shown within the new implementation of the <b>controlled</b> <b>switch</b> that squarewave pulses from a single laser diode with 20 mW power and 658 nm wavelength which is focused on each emitter increased the emitted current by 5. 2 % with the CNT and 0. 19 % with the compared tungsten tip. The extension of the new device from the two-valued to the general m-valued case is introduced, and the implementation of multiple-valued Galois circuits and systems utilizing the new CNT field emission – based device is also shown. Since the <b>controlled</b> <b>switch</b> is a basic block {{in the design of}} modern digital systems, the new CNT device can have a wide range of applications {{in a wide variety of}} nano circuits...|$|R

40|$|In the dimmers {{and motor}} driving apperatuses, AC <b>control</b> <b>switches</b> {{consisting}} of thyristor are generally used {{in order to}} control the AC power of load. Those <b>switches</b> <b>control</b> the load voltage by adjusting the firing angle of thyristor, so the equivalent power factor considered as the difference between source voltage and load current are more lagging than that of preadjusting in spite of load characteristic. And the larger the firing angle, the lagger the equivalent power factor. But if we can control the AC power by adjusting not only the firing angle but also the extinction angle of thyristor, this defect is improved regardless of load characteristic. In this paper we proposed this new type AC <b>control</b> <b>switch</b> and discussed on its basic characteristics which were a fundation of its applicatioh.
