50|$|By {{the late}} 1890s, the {{operations}} of the Goodyear's lumbering company was noted as being the most extensive in the state of Pennsylvania. The mills at Austin, Galeton, and Cross Fork were the most modern in style, and included all the newest and most up-to-date machinery. The mill at Austin was listed as the largest in the state. The Goodyear's employed 2400 men, working 10 hr day. They owned 11 <b>log</b> <b>loaders</b> manufactured by the Marion Steam Shovel Co. (Goodyear owned the patent). Five shay engines moved 207 log cars. One Shay locomotive would handle two <b>log</b> <b>loaders,</b> and about 30 log cars. There were 75 mi of logging railroads, which were constantly moved around to uncut parts of the forest. These logging railroads then connected with the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad. It was reported in 1898, that the Goodyear's had 10 years worth of timber left. Some of the mills operated 22 hours per day, and used electric lights to keep the men working at night.|$|R

Almost 20 mi of rail had been built by the Lackawanna Logging Company at Cross Fork, who also constantly moved the tracks to fresh areas to be cut. In addition, uncut logs were also brought in to Cross Fork by the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad from other nearby areas.|$|R

5000|$|JIT/TPS {{implementations}} may {{be found}} in many case-study articles from the 1980s and beyond. One article in a 1984 issue of Inc. magazine relates how Omark Industries (chain saws, ammunition, <b>log</b> <b>loaders,</b> etc.) emerged as an extensive JIT implementer under its home-grown name ZIPS (zero inventory production system). At Omark's mother plant in Portland, Oregon, after the work force had received 40 hours of ZIPS training, they were [...] "turned loose" [...] and things began to happen. A first step was to [...] "arbitrarily eliminate a week's lead time which things ran smoother. 'People asked that we try taking another week's worth out.' After that, ZIPS spread throughout the plant's operations 'like an amoeba.'" [...] The article also notes that Omark's 20 other plants were similarly engaged in ZIPS, beginning with pilot projects. For example, at one of Omark's smaller plants making drill bits in Mesabi, Minnesota, [...] "large-size drill inventory was cut by 92%, productivity increased by 30%, scrap and rework ... dropped 20%, and lead time ... from order to finished product was slashed from three weeks to three days." [...] The Inc. article states that companies using JIT the most extensively include [...] "the Big Four, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Westinghouse Electric, General Electric, Deere, and Black and Decker".|$|R
50|$|Small {{cars were}} at first {{packaged}} in both picture boxes and blister packs. Boxes were dropped entirely by the mid-1980s. Large models were mostly packed in window boxes, {{with a few}} exceptions. One unfortunate design element in this time period was the unrealistic and rather gaudy white-walled tires labeled with 'Siku' {{on opposite sides of}} each tire and with and white 'spoked' wheels that appeared on most vehicles in this series. Fortunately, by the late 1990s, realistic wheel designs were adopted, like accurate mini mags for the Mini Cooper seen on this page. This series is still produced today, and since the incorporation of the Club Series (see below) in the early 1990s, large trucks as well as military tanks and a few aircraft {{have been made in the}} small car size and put in blister packages. Of course, their scale varied greatly too. Hence, a unified scale of 1:55 (or 1:60 for cars from the V series) is not uniformly applied.Siku keeps up with odd German sports cars selections like the Gumpert Apollo or the Wiesmann GT. Occasionally Siku outdoes itself with a very odd model. Sixteen inch tall cranes have been produced, helicopters on flat bed semi trucks, forestry <b>log</b> <b>loaders,</b> piston bully snow tracked vehicles, an ultra-detailed stake bed Mercedes Unimog, potato digger truck, triple engined competition pulling tractor and modern tram and subway cars. Perhaps the most outrageous is the AIDA Aluna 10 story plus cruise ship in 1:1,400 scale (18 cm long).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 In {{order to}} {{appraise}} timber, {{it is necessary}} to estimate logging costs with reasonable accuracy. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a rethod for estimating log loading costs in the Intermountain Region. Nine different <b>log</b> <b>loaders</b> were studied loading from cold decks on six USDA. Forest Service timber sales in the Intermountain Region. Regression analysis indicated that loading time per truck was a linear function of pieces per truck. It also indicated a significant difference in loading times between hydraulic loaders and cable loaders. Regression analysis of sample truck scale data for each sale indicated that both the number of pieces loaded per truck and the volume per truck were functions of average piece size. The results also suggested that timber species affected volume per truck. The time study regression equation and the sample truck scale regression equations were combined to obtain production equations for both cable and hydraulic loaders as a function of average piece size. Then estimated owning and operating costs for a typical hydraulic loader were combined with the production equation to obtain a relationship for loading costs per unit volume a a function of average piece size and hours of annual use. These costs were compared with costs obtained using the USDP Forest Service andbook (Forest Service, 1977). Results of this comparison indicated that the USDA Forest Service appraised loading costs did not vary nearly as much with average piece size as did the cost estimated in this paper...|$|R

5000|$|Shovel logging, {{sometimes}} called Hoe Chucking, uses a <b>log</b> <b>loader</b> to swing logs {{to the forest}} road. Shovel logging {{is one of a}} number of methods that may be used to move logs from forest to road. Rather than driving out to the log and dragging it back to the landing, the loader moves slowly across the harvest area, grabbing logs/trees within reach, and swinging them around to drop them closer to the road. Logs further from the road can be shoveled to the landing in a few passes back and forth. [...] Skidding and cable logging can be more cost efficient for logs further from the road. Shovel logging can make use of the loader between log truck arrivals. It can also reduce soil disturbance, since it requires only a single pass to move all the logs in reach.|$|E
40|$|Intensive forest {{management}} requires efficient logging tech-niques to remain economical. Commercial thinnings and shorter rotations increase piece count inversely to piece size. Continued research aimed toward effective log handling processes is essential. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate one case of a self-loading <b>log</b> truck (integral <b>loader</b> and truck) working in various decking configurations and piece sizes. Data obtained by the multimoment time study method where analyzed by multiple regression techniques. Loading production rates were determined from regression equations with the remainder of the total loading time computed by averages from 90 observations. Decking configurations were compared on a productivity basis. This study found excessive varation in loading times for large diameter logs. In small diameters, specific decking configurations reduced total loading times up to 20 percent. The results supporte...|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between a swing yarder and a tower yarder is that the upperworks is mounted on a large slewing bearing. This bearing permits the boom and cable system to be 'swung' across a setting without relocating the machine. An experienced operator uses timing and cable tension to swing the grapple to the desired location. In practice, however, the main benefit of a swinging machine is that once the logs are yarded up to the machine, they can be swung {{to the side and}} landed. This allows the machine to be positioned in a small area such as on a road, and to land (set down) the logs on the road behind (or in front of) the machine. By contrast a tower has no options on where to set the logs---so the tower has to be positioned back from the break of the hill so as to leave a landing area on the downhill side of the machine, the logs can only be pulled up to near the tower and then lowered to the ground making it necessary for a shovel (<b>log</b> <b>loader)</b> to also be present to remove the logs once landed. Implicitly a swing machine {{does not need to be}} as tall as a tower machine particularly in steep ground because the swing machine can be set right up to the 'edge' of the steep ground while the tower must be set back from the 'edge' to allow landing space.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Shovel logging is a {{relatively}} new ground-based method of yarding tinther. It involves moving logs from stump to landing by successive swinging with a hydraulic excavator modified into a <b>log</b> <b>loader</b> by replacing the shovel bucket with a grapple. Loaders used in shovel yarding can weigh in excess of 100, 000 pounds so that the opportunity for soil compaction is great. This study measured the amount of soil compaction that occurs with shovel yarding. The study was done on the Quinault District of the Olympic N. F. in Washington state.

40|$|The western United States faces {{significant}} {{forest management}} challenges after severe bark beetle infestations {{have led to}} substantial mortality. Minimizing costs is vital for increasing the feasibility of management operations in affected forests. Multi‐transmitter Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) ‐radio frequencies (RF) technology has applications in the quantification and analysis of harvest system production efficiency and provision of real‐time operational machine position, navigation, and timing. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the accuracy with which multi‐transmitter GNSS‐RF captures the swinging and forwarding motions of ground based harvesting machines at varying transmission intervals. Assessing the accuracy of GNSS in capturing intricate machine movements is a first step toward development of a real‐time production model to assist timber harvesting of beetle‐killed lodgepole pine stands. In a complete randomized block experiment with four replicates, a <b>log</b> <b>loader</b> rotated to 18 predetermined angles with GNSS‐RF transponders collecting and sending data at two points along the machine boom (grapple and heel rack) and at three transmission intervals (2. 5, 5. 0, and 10. 0 s). The 2. 5 and 5. 0 s intervals correctly identified 94 % and 92 % of cycles at the grapple and 92 % and 89 % of cycles at the heel, respectively. The 2. 5 s interval successfully classified over 90 % of individual cycle elements, while the 5. 0 s interval returned statistically similar results. Predicted swing angles obtained the highest level of similarity to observed angles at the 2. 5 s interval. Our results show that GNSS‐RF is useful for realtime, model‐based analysis of forest operations, including woody biomass production logistics...|$|E
