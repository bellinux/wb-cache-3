5|$|Construction was in two phases. A {{level section}} from Tiverton to Lowdwells on the Devon/Somerset border, opened in 1814, and {{was capable of}} {{carrying}} broad-beam barges, carrying up to 40tons. The Somerset section, suitable for tub-boats, which were about 20feet (6.1m) long and capable of carrying eight tons, opened in 1839. It included an inclined plane and seven boat <b>lifts,</b> the earliest <b>lifts</b> to see commercial service in the UK. The <b>lifts</b> predated the Anderton Boat Lift by nearly 40 years.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{from the}} outset, {{overcrowding}} {{has been a}} constant problem, and there have been numerous improvements to the facilities and below-ground arrangements to deal with this. After much discussion between the then two separate operators, a major reconstruction began in 1912. This entailed a new ticket hall, serving both lines, being built {{in the basement of the}} Bakerloo station, with the Bakerloo <b>lifts</b> removed and new deep-level escalators opened down to the Bakerloo line level. Access to the CLR was by way of existing deep-level subways. The new works came into use on 9 May 1914 with the CLR <b>lifts</b> still available for passengers. By 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope, so a second rebuilding began. This involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to the Central line and the CLR station building becoming exit-only. On 2 October 1928, a third escalator leading to the Bakerloo platforms was opened. Unusually, <b>lifts</b> came back into prominence at an Underground station when, in 1942, a set of high-speed <b>lifts</b> came into use, largely used as an exit route from the Central line platforms directly to the Argyll Street exit building.|$|E

5|$|Landings by the 1st Allied Airborne Army's three {{divisions}} {{began in}} the Netherlands on 17September 1944. Although allocation of aircraft for each division was roughly similar, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division landing at Nijmegen would use only one lift. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division at Grave required two <b>lifts</b> while the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem would need three <b>lifts.</b> Whereas the two American divisions delivered at least three quarters of their infantry in their first lift, the 1st Airborne's similar drop used only half its infantry capacity and the remainder to deliver vehicles and artillery.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} central London Underground stations, Holborn was modernised {{in the early}} 1930s to replace the <b>lifts</b> with escalators. The station frontages on Kingsway and High Holborn were {{partially}} reconstructed to modernist designs by Charles Holden with the granite elements replaced with plain Portland stone façades perforated with glazed screens. The <b>lifts</b> were removed and a spacious new ticket hall was provided giving access to a bank of four escalators down to an intermediate concourse for the Central line platforms. A second bank of three escalators continues down to the Piccadilly line platforms.|$|E

5|$|The older {{stations}} on the North South and East West {{lines were}} originally built with no accessibility facilities, such as <b>lifts,</b> ramps, tactile guidance systems (Braille tactiles {{on the floor}} surface), wider fare gates, or toilets for passengers with disabilities; authorities in the past actively discouraged use of their system by the disabled. Now, these facilities are being progressively installed {{as part of a}} programme to make all stations accessible to the elderly and to those with disabilities. All stations are now barrier-free, although works are still ongoing to provide stations with additional barrier-free facilities. The installation of <b>lifts</b> at pedestrian overhead bridges next to six MRT stations and additional bicycle racks at 20 stations is slated to be completed by the end of 2013.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>lifting,</b> i. e., {{the process}} of taking a valid inequality for a polyhedron and extending it to a valid inequality in a higher dimensional space. <b>Lifting</b> is usually applied sequentially, that is, variables in a set are <b>lifted</b> one after the other. This may be computationally unattractive since it involves the solution of an optimization problem to compute a <b>lifting</b> coefficient for each variable. To relieve this computational burden, we study sequence independent <b>lifting,</b> which only involves the solution of one optimization problem. We show that if a certain <b>lifting</b> function is superadditive, then the <b>lifting</b> coefficients are independent of the <b>lifting</b> sequence. We introduce the idea of valid superadditive <b>lifting</b> functions to obtain good aproximations to maximum <b>lifting.</b> We apply these results to strengthen Balas' <b>lifting</b> theorem for cover inequalities and to produce <b>lifted</b> flow cover inequalities for a single node flow problem.

40|$|Group <b>lifting</b> {{structures}} {{are introduced to}} provide an algebraic framework for studying <b>lifting</b> factorizations of two-channel perfect reconstruction finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter banks. The <b>lifting</b> factorizations generated by a group <b>lifting</b> structure are characterized by Abelian groups of lower and upper triangular <b>lifting</b> matrices, an Abelian group of unimodular gain scaling matrices, {{and a set of}} base filter banks. Examples of group <b>lifting</b> {{structures are}} given for linear phase <b>lifting</b> factorizations of the two nontrivial classes of two-channel linear phase FIR filter banks, the whole- and half-sample symmetric classes, including both the reversible and irreversible cases. This covers the <b>lifting</b> specifications for whole-sample symmetric filter banks in Parts 1 and 2 of the ISO/IEC JPEG 2000 still image coding standard. The theory is used to address the uniqueness of <b>lifting</b> factorizations. With no constraints on the <b>lifting</b> process, it is shown that <b>lifting</b> factorizations are highly nonunique. When certain hypotheses developed in the paper are satisfied, however, <b>lifting</b> factorizations generated by a group <b>lifting</b> structure are shown to be unique. A companion paper applies the uniqueness results proven in this paper to the linear phase group <b>lifting</b> structures for whole- and half-sample symmetric filter banks.

40|$|Repetitive manual <b>lifting</b> task in {{mineral water}} gallon pack company have {{a risk that}} can caused Low Back Pain (LBP).

The <b>lifting</b> worker is a worker whose duty is <b>lifting</b> and moving the gallon pack from one pallet to another. "AA" Company is an agent who sell mineral water gallon pack at Surabaya, that have 3 <b>lifting</b> workers.

Trough this application, called "NIOSH <b>lifting</b> equation" can be seen and directly explained that the difference of <b>lifting</b> habit is a main factor that caused LBP to the <b>lifting</b> worker at "AA" Company. Based on the "NIOSH <b>lifting</b> equation" simulation of these three <b>lifting</b> workers, showed these <b>Lifting</b> Index (LI) value: worker 1 (3, 94), worker 2 (2, 79) and worker 3 (1, 82).
