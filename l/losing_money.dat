Competition from private buses, the MTT's own bus fleet and the growth of private car ownership all took patrons from the tram network. By the 1950s, the tram network was <b>losing</b> <b>money</b> and being replaced by an electric and petrol-driven bus fleet. Adelaide's tram history is preserved by the volunteer-run Tramway Museum, St Kilda and the continuing use of 1929 H type trams on the remaining Glenelg tram line.|$|E

5|$|Cunard was in {{significant}} financial difficulties when Smallpeice joined, and posted {{a loss of}} $7.2 million in 1965, <b>losing</b> <b>money</b> on the passenger ships and making profits on their shipping line. Smallpeice initially attempted to resolve the financial position of the company by embarking on a merger with another shipping line. Ocean Steamship Company had previously asked that they have first refusal on a merger with Cunard. Ocean Steamship brought P into the discussions, and a three-way merger at one point looked feasible, but neither party could see any benefit in a deal involving Cunard, and backed out of proposed deal.|$|E

5|$|The {{agreements}} to containerise Cunard's freight operations had returned the overall Cunard group to profitability, with the shipping line now profitable and the passenger ships <b>losing</b> <b>money,</b> {{a reversal of}} the situation Smallpeice had inherited in 1965. The company returned profits of £2 million in 1968 and £3 million in 1969 and the share price rose accordingly. The downturn in the economy and shipping industry in 1970 resulted in Cunard once again incurring a loss and a drop in the share price, resulting in the company becoming a takeover target.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{municipal}} council was considering {{the future of}} the airport. The city engineer estimated it would need a subsidy of NOK2 million in 2006, and the politicians, who wanted the airport to run without subsidies, demanded that Vildanden guarantee for the deficit. This was rejected by Vildanden—on the contrary, the company was in dire need for more capital, and issued a private placement for NOK4 million in December 2005. The company had since the start been <b>losing</b> <b>money,</b> and needed extra capital to get through the rough until it could make an operating profit. After the placement, 15% of the company was owned by DAT, while Coast Air sold their shares. In 2005, Vildanden had a revenue of NOK15 million.|$|E

Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E

Despite hopes that they would continue producing narrative films, perhaps with less modern equipment, the company was dissolved. Oriental's actors and crew members migrated to different studios. Suska was signed to Java Industrial Film and directed a single film for them, Ratna Moetoe Manikam. Dhalia went to Populair's Film and acted in one production, Moestika dari Djemar (The Jewel of Djemar; 1942), before the Japanese occupation in March 1942 closed that studio. Soerip, meanwhile, joined Njoo and Young at Majestic Film, acting in two productions before that studio was closed.|$|E

Hassett began the season with two consecutive Sheffield Shield losses before the Tests, although he did manage 91 against South Australia before facing South Africa. He scored 123 in the return match {{later in the season}} and Victoria recorded two wins under his watch, against Queensland.|$|E

Ofotbanen had then been <b>losing</b> <b>money</b> continually since the start-up in 2001; in 2004, it had a deficit of NOK 4 million of a NOK 20 million revenue. At the extraordinary general meeting on 4 September 2006, the company was sold for NOK 1 million to Rail Management, a holding company for the London-based shipping owner Mons Bolin. In November, the Norwegian Rail Inspectorate threatened to withdraw the company's safety license, since they had failed to show proper maintenance of the rolling stock.|$|E
