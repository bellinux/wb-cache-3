Many buildings and bridges collapsed, and as a result over 9,000 people were injured. Researchers at the University of Southern California analyzed the main areas of a ten-story building that were subjected to <b>low-cycle</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Unfortunately, there was limited experimental data available to directly construct a S-N curve for <b>low-cycle</b> <b>fatigue,</b> so most of the analysis consisted of plotting the high-cycle fatigue behavior on a S-N curve and extending the line for that graph to create the portion of the <b>low-cycle</b> <b>fatigue</b> curve using the Palmgren-Miner method. Ultimately, this data was used to more accurately predict and analyze similar types of damage that the ten-story steel building in Northridge faced.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of grain boundary (GB) crack initiation in <b>low-cycle</b> <b>fatigued</b> 70 / 30 brass is investigated {{on the basis}} of the observation of dislocation structures and surface topography by means of transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The dislocation structures are almost the same as those observed in a high-cycle fatigue test. Although typical dislocation structures are not indicative of strain localized regions (SLRs), the SLRs are recognized in the favorably oriented grains. At the intersections of such SLRs with the GB, extrusion-type GB deformations are frequently observed. These GB deformations are considered to be responsible for GB cracking.

A clear trend of increasing elastic modulus with fatigue level was noted in the austenite of the <b>low-cycle</b> <b>fatigued</b> samples; the residual strains in austenite and the deviatoric components of residual microstresses in both phases were determined {{as a function of}} fatigue.

50|$|Common {{factors that}} have been {{attributed}} to <b>low-cycle</b> <b>fatigue</b> (LCF) are high stress levels and a low number of cycles to failure. Many studies have been carried out, particularly in the last 50 years on metals and the relationship between temperature, stress, and number of cycles to failure. Tests are used to plot an S-N curve, and {{it has been shown that}} the number of cycles to failure decreased with increasing temperature. However, extensive testing would have been too costly so researchers mainly resorted to using finite element analysis using computer software.|$|E
50|$|Through many experiments, it {{has been}} found that {{characteristics}} of a material can change as a result of LCF. Fracture ductility tends to decrease, with the magnitude depending on the presence of small cracks to begin with. To perform these tests, an electro-hydraulic servo-controlled testing machine was generally used, as it is capable of not changing the stress amplitude. It was also discovered that performing <b>low-cycle</b> <b>fatigue</b> tests on specimens with holes already drilled in them were more susceptible to crack propagation, and hence a greater decrease in fracture ductility. This was true despite the small hole sizes, ranging from 40-200 μm.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of both the fifth and sixth year effort of a research program conducted for NASA-LeRC by The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). The research included on-going development of methodology for a probabilistic material strength degradation model. The probabilistic model, {{in the form of a}} postulated randomized multifactor equation, provides for quantification of uncertainty in the lifetime material strength of aerospace propulsion system components subjected to a number of diverse random effects. This model is embodied in the computer program entitled PROMISS, which can include up to eighteen different effects. Presently, the model includes five effects that typically reduce lifetime strength: high temperature, high-cycle mechanical <b>fatigue,</b> <b>low-cycle</b> mechanical <b>fatigue,</b> creep and thermal fatigue. Statistical analysis was conducted on experimental Inconel 718 data obtained from the open literature. This analysis provided regression parameters for use as the model's empirical material constants, thus calibrating the model specifically for Inconel 718. Model calibration was carried out for five variables, namely, high temperature, high-cycle and <b>low-cycle</b> mechanical <b>fatigue,</b> creep and thermal fatigue. Methodology to estimate standard deviations of these material constants for input into the probabilistic material strength model was developed. Using an updated version of PROMISS, entitled PROMISS 93, a sensitivity study for the combined effects of high-cycle mechanical fatigue, creep and thermal fatigue was performed. Then using the current version of PROMISS, entitled PROMISS 94, a second sensitivity study including the effect of <b>low-cycle</b> mechanical <b>fatigue,</b> as well as, the three previous effects was performed. Results, in the form of cumulative distribution functions, illustrated the sensitivity of lifetime strength to any current value of an effect. In addition, verification studies comparing a combination of high-cycle mechanical fatigue and high temperature effects by model to the combination by experiment were conducted. Thus, for Inconel 718, the basic model assumption of independence between effects was evaluated. Results from this limited verification study strongly supported this assumption...|$|R

50|$|The exoskeletal engine (ESE) is {{a concept}} in {{turbomachinery}} design. Current gas turbine engines have central rotating shafts and fan-discs and are constructed mostly from heavy metals. They require lubricated bearings and need extensive cooling for hot components. They are also subject to severe imbalance (or vibrations) that could wipe out the whole rotor stage, are prone to high- and <b>low-cycle</b> <b>fatigue,</b> and subject to catastrophic failure due to disc bursts from high tensile loads, consequently requiring heavy containment devices. To address these limitations, the ESE concept turns the conventional configuration inside-out and utilizes a drum-type rotor design for the turbomachinery in which the rotor blades {{are attached to the}} inside of a rotating drum instead of radially outwards from a shaft and discs.

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} sleepers (or railroad ties) {{are designed}} {{in order to}} carry and transfer the wheel loads from the rails {{to the ground and}} are installed as the crosstie beam support in railway track systems. They are subjected to impact loading conditions that are resulted from train operations over wheel or rail abnormalities, such as flat wheels, dipped rails, crossing transfers, rail squats, corrugation, etc. The magnitude of the shock load relies on various factors such as axle load, types of wheel/rail imperfections, speeds of vehicle, track stiffness, etc. This paper demonstrates the development of finite element modelling to evaluate the dynamic responses of prestressed tendons or wires embedded in concrete sleepers, particularly under a variety of impact loads. The force prediction under high speed rail environment was conducted using D-TRACK. The 3 D finite element model of prestressed concrete sleeper has been developed using a finite element package, LS-Dyna. It has been verified by the experiments carried out using the high capacity drop-weight impact machine at the University of Wollon-gong, Australia. The experimental results provide very good correlation with numerical simulations. In this paper, the numerical studies are extended to evaluate the dynamic behaviors of high strength steel wires and their responses under different parameters in high speed rail environments. The outcome of this study can potentially lead to the dynamic design guideline for prestressed concrete sleepers under <b>low-cycle</b> <b>fatigues.</b> Future work includes more detailed investigation into the effect of track bed and rail pad degradation subject to higher frequency impacts...|$|R
