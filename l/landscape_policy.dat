40|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of landscapes and the complexity of landscape policies, integration principle plays {{a very important role}} in formulating a conceptual framework for effective landscape policies. This is often overlooked in normal practice of landscape related policy making, as a result of overemphasizing development and economic growth by local government. If the integration principle could be taken into account sufficiently, a consciously more responsive approach for <b>landscape</b> <b>policy</b> making could be formulated with higher effectiveness and less uncertainty. This thesis seeks to contribute to the system of <b>landscape</b> <b>policy</b> that integrates multiple environmental and spatial planning concerns into its processes and structures. This thesis has combined landscape planning and policy theories to analyze landscape policies currently in force in cities of Asia to demonstrate the complexity of landscape policies and the importance of integration in policymaking process. While there are few approaches in <b>landscape</b> <b>policy</b> studies except the European Landscape Convention which is a continental scale treaty with focus on environmental and cultural conservation within the context of Europe, there are widespread research on public policies particularly in urban planning, environmental protection, and sustainable development which provided plentiful sources as references. To apply integration principle in policymaking on the basis that <b>landscape</b> <b>policy</b> of nowadays is even important than before, a conceptual framework of <b>landscape</b> <b>policy</b> is established to gauge impacts and changes, as well as to inform planning, and implementation progressively. After providing a combined literature review of landscape architectural theories, <b>landscape</b> <b>policy</b> related areas, and practices of current landscape policymaking, this thesis discusses the importance of integrated approach in landscape policymaking due to the complexity and multidisciplinarity nature of landscape architecture discourse, and sets a two-way action between theory and practice as research strategy. After an overview of current landscape policies of Europe and Asia, this thesis has summarized four types of landscape policies based on its administrative level to reflect the hierarchical structure of <b>landscape</b> <b>policy,</b> from European Landscape Convention at global level to Hong Kong’s Greening Master Plan at project scale. This thesis further looks into two best practices of landscape policymaking in Japan and Singapore, to further elaborate the conceptual basis of the research and analyze the gap between current landscape policies and its urban development practice context. Case studies of Japan and Singapore are employed as references for both discussion and comparative purpose, aiming to demonstrate different ways in which integration principle could be utilized and interpreted with coherent consistency across policy levels and different government sectors, so as to clarify implications of integration principle in policymaking, implementation, and the following continuous improvement processes mainly at city level. The study is concluded by highlighting key issues of conceptual framework with recommendations for further research on integrated landscape policymaking, by applying Grounded Theory as main research method through collection and analysis of qualitative data, with the use of both explorative and interpretive approaches. published_or_final_versionArchitectureDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Then, common visions might emerge and “inform” <b>landscape</b> <b>policies,</b> indirectly influencing the meaning of wellbeing. Specifically, the socioeconomic theory might constitute a missing link between regulatory issues and technological achievements, enhancing and combining the new opportunities for participation offered by the European Landscape Convention, and by the widespread diffusion of social networks on the web.

40|$|The {{importance}} of cultural ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes is increasingly recognized as agricultural scale enlargement and abandonment affect aesthetic and recreational values of agricultural landscapes. Landscape preference studies addressing {{these type of}} values often yield context-specific outcomes, limiting the applicability of their outcomes in <b>landscape</b> <b>policy.</b> Our approach measures the relative {{importance of}} landscape features across agricultural landscapes.

In the Dutch landscape visitors highly value hedgerows and tree lines, whereas groups of trees and crop diversity are highly valued in the German landscape. Furthermore, we find that differences in relative preference for landscape attributes are, to some extent, explained by socio-cultural background variables such as education level and affinity with agriculture of the visitors.

40|$|The Dutch National Ecological Network (EHS) and National Landscapes partly overlap. The {{policy for}} the National Ecological Network is aimed at obtaining a network of {{connected}} nature areas to protect and improve biodiversity. In general no developments are possible in EHS areas. The Na-tional <b>Landscapes</b> <b>policy</b> aims at protecting and strengthening of core qualities in National Land-scapes. These areas are special in national and international context because of cultural-historical, natural or landscape qualities. Sufficient socio-economic development should be guaranteed in these National Landscapes. Contradicting aspects of the policies might be problematic. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research was to determine how actors on local level, deal with both EHS and National Land-scapes policies, and whether possible problematic situations on local level can be explained by con-tradicting discourses. To obtain general information a literature and policy study is done. The policy discourses and arrangements concept is used to compare substance and organisational related aspects of the nature and <b>landscape</b> <b>policies.</b> Local actors in the three Northern provinces are consulted via a questionnaire and interviews. Main differences between the policies can be found in policy visions and aims. Where the EHS can be characterised by mono-functional land use and the ‘no, unless’ development regime, the National Landscapes are much more focused on multi-functional land use and spatial development (‘yes, if’ regime). But in general these differences barely give rise to local implementation problems. Involved actors have been merging towards each other and both policies are nowadays better inte-grated in local development processes. According to local actors win-win situations can be obtained because there is often a relation between natural and cultural values and secondly the level of scale differs. But sufficient communication, deliberation and awareness of involved actors are essential. Local actors also state that not all opportunities for successful integration of nature and <b>landscape</b> <b>policies</b> with other functions, like water management, are fully utilised yet. Finally, a lack of legal anchoring, unequal distribution of representatives and a lack of expertise at local policy levels can also be a threat to successful integration. ...|$|R

In Europe various territorial dynamics pose persistent challenges to maintaining diverse landscapes both as European heritage and in their capacity to provide vital functions and services. Concurrently, under the competence of cohesion policy, the EU is attempting to improve policy making by better policy coordination and respecting regional specifics. This paper explores the question how a policy dedicated to landscape can help to handle territorial change and support territorial cohesion. It presents results and performances of the ESPON applied research study LP 3 LP: (1) a common <b>landscape</b> <b>policy</b> for the Three Countries Park, across the Dutch, German and Belgium borders, including a spatial landscape vision, a governance proposal of adaptive landscape management, and thematic strategies dealing with green infrastructure, cultural heritage, complementary biomass and quality production; (2) recommendations at the EU level. In discussing the significance of a landscape approach for EU policy,three dimensions of landscape are linked withimportant aspects of territorial cohesion: ‘landscape as asset’ addressing natural-cultural territorial capital as an indigenous base forsmart, sustainable, and inclusivedevelopment;‘landscape as place’ stressing the relevance of landscape for place-based policies; and ‘landscape as common ground’ highlighting its potential for horizontal, vertical, and territorial integration. <br/...|$|E

However, existing theoretical frameworks doesn't clarify enough the differences between various landscape services, among which potential conflicts - deriving from multiple values related to the same spatial assets - may arise. A sound assessment of landscape services is necessary.

The "new paradigms" for the conservation of nature proposed by IUCN (Durban 2003; Bangkok 2004; Barcelona 2008) stimulate innovative proposals about nature conservation <b>policies.</b> <b>Landscape,</b> conceived by the European Landscape Convention as a bridge between nature and culture, can support this integration process as it invites not only to broaden the conservation action to the whole territorial context, but also to consider both natural and cultural values, looking at the quality of life and at the identity values.

The survey participants were a group of highly experienced researchers from eighteen countries involved {{in at least one}} applied project since 2000 relating to this topic. After analysis of more than forty applied projects, the survey results were incorporated into the analysis to create a comprehensive picture regarding the potentials and limitations of alternative futures and scenario analysis in landscape planning with particular attention to climate change.

Journal of Environmental Management, 92 (9), 2097 - 2108. IMPF: 03. 24 Several innovative directions for <b>landscape</b> <b>policy</b> development and implementation have emerged over recent years. These include: (i) an expansion of scope to include all landscape aspects and landscape types, (ii) an increased emphasis on public participation, (iii) a focus on designing measures appropriate for different contexts and scales, and (iv) encouraging support for capacity-building. In this paper, we evaluate {{the extent to which}} these policy directions are reflected in the practice of academic landscape research. We evaluate all research papers published in three leading landscape journals over six years, as well as published research papers relating directly to the European Landscape Convention. The latter, which was adopted in 2000, establishes a framework for landscape protection, planning and management in Europe and is to date the only international legal instrument of its kind. Results indicate that whilst policy innovations do not appear to be a major stimulus for academic research, studies nevertheless address a range of landscape aspects, types and scales (albeit with a slight bias towards bio-physical landscape aspects). However, geographical representativeness of research is weak and dominated by the United States and northern/western Europe, and research capacity likewise appears to be unevenly distributed. Landscape research is also limited in the extent to which it involves stakeholders or develops innovative methods for doing so, notwithstanding that this remains a key challenge for policy-makers. Results point to the potential for landscape research to address areas (topical and geographical) which have received little attention to date, as well as suggesting mutual benefits of stronger links between policy and academia.
