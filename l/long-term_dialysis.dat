40|$|<b>Long-term</b> peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> {{can lead}} to {{morphological}} and functional changes in the peritoneum. Although the range of morphological alterations is known for the peritoneal dialysis population as a whole, these changes will not occur in every patient in the same sequence and {{to the same extent}}. Longitudinal studies are therefore required to help identify which patients might develop the changes. Although longitudinal studies using peritoneal biopsies are not possible, analyses of peritoneal effluent biomarkers that represent morphological alterations could provide insight. Longitudinal studies on peritoneal transport have been performed, but follow-up has often been too short and an insufficient number of parameters have been investigated. This Review will firstly describe peritoneal morphology and structure and will then focus on peritoneal effluent biomarkers and their changes over time. Net ultrafiltration will also be discussed together with the transport of small solutes.
