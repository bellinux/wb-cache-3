5|$|A {{day after}} the draw against Vitesse, Ronald Koeman {{announced}} he would end his tenure as manager of Feyenoord {{at the end of}} the 2013–14 season. On 4 February the team beat Roda JC away 2–1. Immers and Armenteros scored to take a two-goal lead at half time, Roda got on the board near the end of the game. The win moved Feyenoord to two points behind Vitesse. The following Saturday Feyenoord played N.E.C. at home. The visitors took an early lead, before Immers and Pellè gave Feyenoord a one-goal advantage at half time. An additional goal by Pellè and two scores from Boëtius led to a 5–1 win that led Feyenoord to third place in the league table. On 16 February the club played away at NAC Breda. The game ended in a 1–1 draw; Janmaat scored the lone Feyenoord goal in the first half before NAC equalized from a penalty kick.

500|$|Benfica were {{surprised}} by the Faro side's opposition. José Manuel Delgado wrote in his match report for Record: [...] "Heynckes' defence show inexplicable passivity, and Quinzinho was a loose threat {{that no one could}} stop.

Shortly after the 15-minute mark the Angolan striker was injured and Farense threats stopped, allowing Benfica to turn the match around: [...] "After his substitution Benfica started to settle in the midfield, better supporting the attack...until Maniche put the threats in practise and scored in the 23rd and 38th minutes, with Nuno Gomes leaving Benfica in the lead before halftime". For their <b>last</b> <b>February</b> match, Benfica visited Estádio José Gomes to face the local team, Estrela da Amadora. Two goals by Gáucho and another by Kenedy gave them their first league loss since 19 December, with Porto and Sporting regaining a four-point lead.|$|E
