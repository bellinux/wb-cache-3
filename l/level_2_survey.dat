MAG conducted its first emergency survey in Afghanistan in 1989 and conducted {{the first ever}} surveys in Cambodia and northern Iraq. Between 1992 and 1997, MAG Iraq conducted {{one of the largest}} minefield demarcation programmes in the world, while in Kosovo, MAG was tasked by the UN Mine Action Coordination Centre (MACC) in October 1999 to conduct a <b>Level</b> <b>2</b> <b>survey</b> along the border area with Albania. In 1993, MAG conducted an emergency impact assessment of the landmine problem in Moxico province, Angola, which led to the establishment of a MAG clearance programme later that year.|$|E

40|$|The TFW Monitoring Program method {{manual for}} the Large Woody Debris (LWD) Survey {{provides}} a standard method for assessing and monitoring {{the quantity and}} qual-ity of large woody debris. The LWD Survey has two methods for measuring the amount of large woody debris at the TFW stream segment scale. The relatively quick Level 1 method quantifies the number of pieces in each of several size class categories and by bankfull channel zone. The <b>Level</b> <b>2</b> method collects more detailed information on indi-vidual pieces including piece count, volume by bankfull channel zone, whether it is deciduous or conifer, and stability. In addition, LWD jam information is collected for both Level 1 and <b>Level</b> <b>2</b> <b>Surveys.</b> The Jam method collects information on jam and piece count, number of jams by bankfull channel zone, and number of pieces per jam in each of several size class categories. Association with a Reference Point Survey pro-vides information on piece and jam distribution. Optional key piece information can be collected for the Level 1 and Jam methods and is calculated in the database for <b>Level</b> <b>2</b> pieces. TFW data management services provides basic analysis of LWD data at 10...|$|R
40|$|The area {{affected}} with antipersonnel {{land mines}} in 56 infested countries {{is estimated to}} be 1 Mio km. This represents a serious threat to the human lives and a major obstacle {{for the development of the}} polluted region. The objective of ARC is to develop, demonstrate and promote a new system for performing the UN <b>Level</b> <b>2</b> <b>surveys</b> allowing a quick reduction of suspected mine-polluted areas and post- cleaning quality control. The ARC-system is based on a Camcopter UAV, optical, infrared and hyperspectral sensors and a Mine Information System supported by a Geographical Information System. The sensor data will be processed to extract mine field indicators. The sensor fusion module will combine the mine field indicators with the GIS information to achieve optimal minefield delineation. It is our intention to have the ARC system as soon as possible operational in the field which is supported by early field tests and an evolutionary development path. The project will lead to a demonstration of the system in a mine affected area in Croatia showing its usefulness to potential end users...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{information}} needs and information seeking behaviour of coaches in the sports of swimming and track and field who had completed <b>level</b> <b>2</b> accreditation of the Australian Coaching Council. The study aimed to identify information needs, the sources from which information is currently obtained and to gauge the level of satisfaction with current information provision in terms of the quantity, content and timeliness of information received. The study also aimed to examine the influence of the independent variables of sport, geographic location and education level on information needs and information seeking behaviour. In line with current theoretical thinking in the examination of information needs described in the literature, the researcher took a 'user-centred' approach in the identification of information needs utilising the structured group discussion process, Nominal Group Technique (NGT) as the first stage of the research. This process established the broad parameters of coaches' information needs and provided the basis for the design of a subsequent survey which was distributed to all swimming and track and field coaches who had completed <b>level</b> <b>2</b> accrediation. The <b>survey</b> resulted in a response rate of 69 percent from a total population of 568. The study revealed that coaches have a wide range of information needs many of which would not generally be associated with libraries, that there are few differences between coaches from different sports, those of differing education levels and between those of different geographic locations, although access to information is made more difficult through geographic isolation. The study revealed that coaches use multiple sources to obtain information and that libraries and formal sport information providers are not key sources for most types of information. Low levels of satisfaction were found to exist with the quantity and content of information with the highest level of dissatisfaction being expressed with the timeliness of information received. The study concludes by identifying issues, recommending possible actions in relation to these issues and identifies areas for future research...|$|R
