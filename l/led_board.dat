Nowadays, <b>LED</b> display <b>boards</b> are widely used in advertising and other applications. <b>LED</b> display <b>boards</b> can also be used indoors or outdoors. The objective of this system is to design a display panel by using several dozens of LED matrix display. The display pattern can desire to be changed easily and modified by the user. This <b>LED</b> display <b>board</b> is overall in two major components; which are the microcontroller and LED display panel. Microcontrollers with programs are developed to generate characters and graphics for this module. In this system, when the <b>LED</b> display <b>board</b> is “ON”, it will display the messages and then dance movements by the rhythm of music using a PIC microcontroller. It is not needed to change the LED panel, only to change the input data in PIC program. In this system, LED panel is controlled by a program in microcontroller from serial to parallel shift registers using the scanning method. PIC microcontroller is for generating the output signal to output display board by using a program. Then, it will be run on the <b>LED</b> display <b>board.</b> This is very useful in area like railway platforms, streets, banks, training institutes and other applications to show data information on the large <b>LED</b> <b>boards.</b> As a result, this <b>LED</b> display <b>board</b> is useful as indoors or outdoors as it is also economic. This display consists of maximum 72 bright LEDs which are rotated to show the display. In this system, this display can show data information which will require a whopping 512 LEDs.
