40|$|My {{work within}} a {{research}} project studying flood-risk management in Hungary is described, with special attention on <b>loss-spreading</b> instruments, mainly insurance. I argue that computer simulation tools are useful in catastrophe policy making. Computer simulation provides a method for estimating the consequences of different potential policy strategies. In decision making processes it also forces the involved parties to maintain a holistic perspective. My research contribution is twofold. I first structured and implemented a flood risk management policy model, capable of estimating the consequences of different insurance strategies for various stakeholders. I then incorporated a micro-level perspective in the flood risk management policy model. ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{summarizes}} {{studies on}} the development of a financial risk management model for floods in the Upper Tisza river region, Hungary. We focus on the evaluation of a multi-pillar flood <b>loss-spreading</b> program involving partial compensation to flood victims by the central government, the pooling of risks through a mandatory public-private insurance on the basis of location-specific exposures, and a contingent ex-ante credit to reinsure the pool's liabilities. Policy analysis is guided by GIS-based catastrophe models and stochastic optimization methods with respect to location-specific risk exposures. We use economically sound risk indicators leading to convex stochastic optimization problems strongly connected with non-convex insolvency constraint and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{catastrophe}} management, {{risk spreading}} {{is one of}} the important measures for increasing societal resilience to disasters. In this paper we discuss an integrated catastrophe management model which explores alternative risk spreading options. As a case study we consider the seismic prone Tuscany region of Italy.

40|$|This Article {{questions}} the prevailing view that securities-fraud actions {{suffer from a}} circularity problem. Because shareholder plaintiffs are owners of the defendant corporation, it is commonly argued that shareholder compensation is a payment from shareholders to themselves with substantial transaction costs {{in the form of}} attorney fees. But shareholder compensation is no more circular than a dividend, which is a cash payment to shareholders from the company they own with substantial transaction costs in the form of taxes. In fact, shareholder compensation is less circular than a dividend because it is a transfer to shareholders who purchased stock when the price was inflated by fraud from those who did not. Shareholder compensation serves an important <b>loss-spreading</b> function that is facilitated by the insurance market. Shareholder compensation may also capture some of the benefits of paying dividends, such as signaling and reducing agency costs, though it may do so more effectively if companies could resolve securities-fraud actions by paying a preemptive dividend...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a flood {{management}} model that takes into account the specifics of catastrophic risk management: highly mutually dependent losses, the lack of information, the need for long-term perspectives and explicit analyses of spatial and temporal heterogeneities of various agents such as individuals, governments, and insurers. We use modified data from a pilot region of the Upper Tisza river, Hungary, to illustrate the evaluation of a public multipillar flood <b>loss-spreading</b> program involving partial compensation to flood victims by the central government, the pooling of risks through a mandatory public catastrophe insurance on the basis of location-specific exposures, and the demand for a contingent ex-ante credit to reinsure the insurances liabilities. GIS-based catastrophe models and stochastic optimization methods are used to guide policy analysis with respect to location-specific risk exposures. We use economically sound risk indicators leading to convex stochastic optimization problems strongly connected with nonconvex insolvency constraint, VaR and CVaR...|$|E
40|$|Liability under Rylands v Fletcher {{has since}} its {{inception}} been justified by ideas of risk-creation and <b>loss-spreading,</b> in circumstances where parties are free from blame. Pollock described it as amounting to an ‘insurance’ between neighbours; in its contrast with negligence liability, it has more recently {{been described as the}} ‘conscience’ of the law. Here we are concerned with the nature and limited existence of Rylands liability for damage done by the escape of fire after the Court of Appeal’s decision in Stannard v Gore. How does ‘insurance’ through liability compare with the well-recognised and widespread practice in relation to fire, of insuring oneself? We particularly discuss the possible purposes of the long disembodied section 86 of the Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774, the significance of insurance in that statute, and the importance of rival interpretations of its applicability to Rylands liability. We identify the current difficulties in this area of law as lying in the elusiveness of the social purposes which have shaped its principles, suggesting that any justification of Rylands liability for fire should indeed take account of the long-established practice of first party insurance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an integrated}} model capable {{of dealing with}} spatial and temporal heterogeneities induced by extreme events, in particular weather related catastrophes. The model {{can be used for}} quite different problems which take explicitly into account the specifics of catastrophic risks: highly mutually dependent losses, inherent capacity of information, the need for long-term perspectives (temporal heterogeneity) and geographically explicit analyses (spatial heterogeneity) with respect to losses and gains of various agents such as individuals, governments, farmers, products, consumers, insurers, investors, and their decisions on coping with risks. We illustrate emerging challenging decision-making problems with a case study of severe floods in a pilot region in the Upper Tisza River. Special attention is given to the evaluation of a flood <b>loss-spreading</b> program taking explicitly into account location specific distributions of agricultural and structural losses. This enables us to evaluate premiums, insurance coverage, and governmental compensation schemes minimizing, in a sense, the risk of locations to overpay actual losses, risks of bankruptcy/insolvency for insurers, and overcompensation of losses by the government. GIS-based catastrophe models and stochastic optimization methods are used to guide policy analysis with respect to location-specific risk exposures. We use special risk functions in order to convexity discontinuous insolvency constrains...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{strict liability}} doctrines - liability for abnormally dangerous activities, for wild animals, for abnormally dangerous animals, and for intruding livestock - can largely {{be explained by}} a small set of rationales. The Restatement Third Draft offers six principal economic and fairness-based rationales for strict rather than negligence liability: providing the injurer an incentive to optimize (1) the level of care and (2) {{the level of the}} activity; and recognizing the justice of requiring the injurer to pay when his activity (3) creates a nonreciprocal risk, (4) affords him a nonreciprocal benefit, (5) is the exclusive cause of the harm, or (6) when the community 2 ̆ 7 s sense of fairness supports strict liability. The Draft also rejects (7) <b>loss-spreading</b> as a rationale in this context. With the notable exception of (5), exclusive causation, this is a defensible and plausible set of rationales. However, the actual strict liability doctrines endorsed in the Draft are narrower in scope than the robust logic of these rationales would imply. This mismatch is probably best explained by judicial reluctance to impose strict liability unless the effects of such liability are modest. At the same time, from a wider perspective, the supposed contest between strict liability and negligence approaches is overstated, for each approach contains traces of the other...|$|E
40|$|Personal injury litigation, or tort law, traditionally, {{has been}} viewed as antithetical to the goals of public health. The focus on {{individual}} compensation for injuries resulting from accidents, products, and international wrongdoing arguably does not serve the 2 ̆ 2 greater good 2 ̆ 2 or communitarian objectives of public health. This Article, originally presented on a January 2006 AALS Panel on Teaching Public Health In Law School, takes issue with the traditional view and will demonstrate ways that personal injury litigation and public health objectives may be complimentary and mutually reinforcing. Some areas of tort law, such as mass torts against tobacco companies, toxic polluters, gun manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and producers of dangerous chemicals, such as Agent Orange and asbestos, directly serve the public interest by {{sending a message to}} those defendants that public health and safety demand safer products. In addition, policy objectives underlying torts include not only compensating injured victims though an award of monetary damages but also <b>loss-spreading,</b> risk-allocation, and informal regulation of safety standards and norms. Moreover, utilitarian objectives serve the public good by addressing scarce resource allocation and assigning fault to the party best able to reduce the risk and bear the loss. The Article illustrates those points through specific examples in historical and recent case law and insight into the cultural background and judicial philosophy behind the decisions. Ultimately, the goal is to challenge traditional perceptions of, and perhaps hostility toward, tort law as undermining public health objective. Shifting readers 2 ̆ 7 focus carries important policy implications for tort reform, public health regulation, and health care delivery...|$|E
