2500|$|Kramer wrote, however, that [...] "Billie Jean {{beat him}} fair and square. A lot of men—especially around our age—were so stunned {{when he lost}} that they figured he must have tanked.

Bobby Riggs, the biggest ham in the world, gets his greatest audience—and purposefully <b>looks</b> <b>bad?</b> There's no way. If he had beaten Billie Jean, he could have kept the act going indefinitely. Next {{they would have had}} him play Chrissy on clay." [...] Selena Roberts claimed in her book documenting the match, A Necessary Spectacle, that Riggs later undertook a public polygraph test to prove he did not throw the match.|$|E
