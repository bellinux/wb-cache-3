5|$|After Ronald Reagan <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> in 1989, {{the couple}} retired {{to their home}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California. Nancy devoted {{most of her time}} to caring for her husband, who was {{diagnosed}} with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, until his death at the age of 93 on June 5, 2004. Reagan remained active within the Reagan Library and in politics, particularly in support of embryonic stem cell research, until her death from congestive heart failure at age 94 on March 6, 2016.|$|E
5|$|After Ford <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> in January 1977, {{the former}} President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E
5|$|Reagan was {{in great}} pain from the bullet that struck his rib, and he {{believed}} that the rib had cracked when Parr pushed him into the limousine. When the agent checked him for gunshot wounds, however, Reagan coughed up bright, frothy blood. Although the president believed that he had cut his lip, Parr believed that the cracked rib had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered the motorcade to divert to nearby George Washington University Hospital, which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use. The limousine arrived there less than four minutes after leaving the hotel, while other agents took Hinckley to a DC jail, and Nancy Reagan ("Rainbow") <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> for the hospital.|$|E

25|$|When many Democrats <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{following}} Richard Nixon's {{replacement of}} Johnson, Dole did not. From 1969 to 1973, {{she served as}} deputy assistant to President Nixon for consumer affairs. In 1973, Nixon appointed her to a seven-year term on the Federal Trade Commission. In 1975, she became a Republican. She took a leave from her post as a Federal Trade Commissioner for several months in 1976 to campaign for her husband for {{vice president of the}} United States, when he ran on the Republican ticket with Gerald Ford. She later resigned from the FTC in 1979, to campaign for her husband's 1980 presidential run. During the 1970s, Dole was a self-described member of the Women's Liberation Movement and helped reform laws to ensure equal credit for women. She was also a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E
500|$|Issues that {{surrounded}} the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills; in 2014, Hillary would state that she and Bill had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> [...] "not only dead broke, but in debt."

Closely scrutinized by Democrats, Harrison's reputation was largely intact when he <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> Having an advantage few 19th Century Presidents had, Harrison's own party, the Republicans, controlled Congress, while his administration actively advanced a Republican program {{of a higher}} tariff, moderate control of corporations, protecting African American voting rights, a generous Civil War pension, and compromising over the controversial silver issue. Historians have not raised [...] "serious questions about Harrison's own integrity or the integrity of his administration." ...|$|E
500|$|Garfield {{had long}} been anxious to escape hot, {{unhealthy}} Washington, and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to Elberon, where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer. He <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{for the last time}} on September 5, traveling in a specially cushioned railway car; a spur line to the Franklyn Cottage, a seaside mansion given over to his use, was built in a night by volunteers. There, Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became (after an initial rally) a death watch. Garfield's personal secretary, Joe Stanley Brown, wrote 40 years later, [...] "to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore, the sound which filled my ears as I walked from my cottage to his bedside, without recalling again that ghastly tragedy." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1916, the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862-1947) was {{commissioned}} by Colonel Edward M.

50|$|Nixon's {{resignation}} was tendered to United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at 11:35 am. At that moment, Ford {{became the}} 38th President of the United States, although {{he took the}} official oath of office at 12:05 pm. Once the former President (and now private citizen) Nixon <b>left</b> <b>the</b> building, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staff began preparations for Ford's swearing in. More chairs were added for the much larger crowd of invited guests than was at the farewell. The oath was administered to Ford by Chief Justice Warren Burger in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> East Room. Chief Justice Burger was traveling in the Netherlands at the time, and was flown back to Washington on an Air Force plane. The first phone call that President Ford, a former center on the University of Michigan football team, made after his inauguration was on Saturday, August 10, 1974, to Ohio State University football coach Woody Hayes, who had just recently suffered a heart attack.|$|R

500|$|At {{the close}} of Grant's two terms as {{president}} in 1877, the Republican-controlled Congress suggested that Grant {{not return to the}} White House for a third term. Grant did not seem to mind and even told his wife Julia, [...] "I {{do not want to be}} here [...] another four years. I do not think I could stand it." [...] After Grant <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> he and his wife decided to use their US$85,000 of savings to travel around the world. A biographer from the New York Herald, John Russell Young, traveled with the Grants and documented their journey to exotic places around the world in a book later published called Around the World with General Grant. Young saw that Grant's popularity was soaring, as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in Tokyo and Peking, China.|$|E
500|$|As Frances Cleveland <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> {{she told}} a staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I {{want you to take}} good care of all the {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E
500|$|Instead, in late January 2011, White House {{officials}} {{disclosed that}} Browner {{would be leaving}} her position in the fairly near future.

[...] League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a [...] "tenacious advocate on our issues" [...] who would be [...] "sorely missed", while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner's exit was a good development and that [...] "Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States." [...] Browner <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> during March 2011.
