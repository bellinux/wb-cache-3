2500|$|Because {{there is}} no single {{straight}} <b>line</b> of <b>yarn</b> anywhere in the pattern, a knitted piece of fabric can stretch in all directions. [...] This elasticity is all but unavailable in woven fabrics which only stretch along the bias. Many modern stretchy garments, even as they rely on elastic synthetic materials for some stretch, also achieve at least some of their stretch through knitted patterns.|$|R

40|$|Different {{types of}} {{chemical}} treatment of textile are widely applied in advanced textile. Finishing of textile can provide additional functional properties for products or/and {{to improve the}} appearance of final product {{as well as to}} improve their mechanical properties. In this research the influence of the industrial treatment of viscose linings on the parameters of fabric surface friction, on fabric surface appearance {{as well as on the}} slippage resistance of yarns at a seam was investigated. Raw, dyed, dyed and softened, dyed and non-slip finished plain weaved linings were investigated. The slippage resistance of yarns at a seam in woven fabrics was evaluated according to standard EN ISO 13936 - 1 : 2004. The friction was investigated according to the standard DIN 53375 in a fabric-fabric friction pair. Surface of raw, dyed, dyed and softened viscose lining was investigated using SEM. The obtained results have shown that the friction parameters as well as the parameters of seam slippage resistance of dyed or dyed and softened fabrics were higher than the ones of raw fabric. The highest differences in those parameters were obtained for lining that was dyed and treated with non-slip finishing. That type of finishing influenced the break of <b>lining</b> <b>yarns</b> without typical to the other investigated linings slipping near a stitching line. [URL] </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{will present a}} system to use three {{dimensional}} computer graphics in garment design. This system is capable to visualize the "real", i. e. the physically correct, appearance of a knitted fabric. A fast visualization of a physically correct micro-structure garment is of crucial importance in textile industry, since it enables fast and less expensive product development. This system may be either used {{in the design of}} new products or teaching the art of knitted fabrics. We use in our system directly the produced machine-code of the design system for knitting machines. A physical model, a particle system, is used to calculate the dynamics of the micro-structure of the knitted garment. keywords: Physically based modeling, textile modeling, computer graphics, 3 D-Models 1.

50|$|Participatory 3D {{modelling}} (P3DM) is a community-based mapping method which integrates local spatial {{knowledge with}} data on {{elevation of the}} land and depth of the sea to produce stand-alone, scaled and geo-referenced relief models. Essentially based on local spatial knowledge, land use and cover, and other features are depicted by informants on the model by the use of pushpins (points), <b>yarns</b> (<b>lines)</b> and paints (polygons). On completion, a scaled and geo-referenced grid is applied to facilitate data extraction or importation. Data depicted on the model are extracted, digitised and plotted. On completion of the exercise the model remains with the community.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to address}} the above quality problem of knitting section by identifying the 80 % causes of quality defects and proposing the possible solution for the critical ones. In dealing with the quality problem, direct observation, interview, check sheet & reports were used to collect data and these data were also analyzed using Pareto technique, and focus group discussion. After the data is analyzed, the four critical fabric defects (Needle <b>line,</b> Hole, <b>Yarn</b> variation and Lycra jump) are achieved and these fabric defects need to be corrected to minimize the rejection rate by 80 %. The output of the research indicated that the existing 7. 87 % rejection rate {{can be reduced to}} 1. 574 % which resulted in the net difference of 6. 296. This implies that the net monthly reduction in fabric rejection rate is about 5533. 6 kilogram which really affects the total production in the section.

40|$|PublishedOne {{immediate}} {{challenge for}} the Marine Energy Converters (MECs) industry is solving the cost and weight problems of mooring lines in deepwater (> 75 m). Fibre rope taut mooring lines represent a new and interesting option for the mooring of MECs in deepwater. Synthetic fibre ropes offer {{a solution to the}} weight problems of using steel lines in deepwater as they have a very low weight in water. Also, compared to steel, there are a large number of synthetic fibre material compositions {{with a wide range of}} material properties. A synthetic rope can therefore be designed to have properties that match the mooring requirements. Several materials have potential for mooring <b>line</b> application. <b>Yarns</b> of these synthetic materials can be made into ropes using a number of constructions, some of which are suited to particular fibres. As with any new application, research must be conducted to determine how well the fibre ropes satisfy the performance requirements. The effects of aging of fibre ropes will be characterized in the proposed tests. Test facilities at the University of Exeter are unique in the MARINET consortium, as they allow the extensive testing of mooring lines in water. Their testing infrastructure will help us to determine which prospective innovative fibre rope mooring line is best suited for deepwater MECs. Also, the technological and scientific support offered by the well experienced staff is another reason to propose the access to these two tests facilities. The work described in this publication has received support from MARINET, a European Community - Research Infrastructure Action under the FP 7 “Capacities” Specific Programme...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the new methods for the {{investigation}} of the yarn slippage at the sewn seams in woven fabrics and for the determination of the parameters of yarn pulling out from woven fabrics were suggested. The original test methods capable to imitate similar to the real clothing wearing conditions, to evaluate the influence of external friction, of deformation method and of the position of seam allowances in respect to stitching <b>line</b> on the <b>yarn</b> slippage parameters were designed. Applying the new method based on the yarn pulling out from woven fabric with sewn seam, the analysis of the friction that occurs between warps and wefts during their sliding was done. Consequently, the behavior of the sewn seams in woven fabrics was analyzed applying the linear regression model which describes the dependence between the parameters such as: yarn pull out force F pull-out, yarn pull out displacement e pull-out, the woven fabrics’ mechanical characteristics such as: bending rigidity in warp direction B 1, fabric elongation in warp direction E 100 - 1 and yarn slippage at sewn seam parameter (seam opening d). The created three-cluster model enabled to split the investigated woven fabrics into three statistically different groups. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

In 1999, Stoller and Karp co-edited The BUST Guide to the New Girl Order, which was a compilation of the best writing from BUST magazine to that point. In 1999, Stoller formed a Stitch 'n Bitch group in New York City's East Village to teach and encourage others to knit, and began writing about her hobby and her group in BUST magazine. In 2003, Stoller authored Stitch 'N Bitch: The Knitter’s Handbook, the first of the best-selling Stitch'n Bitch series of knitting books, calendars and journals. It was followed by Stitch 'n Bitch Nation, which also made the New York Times Best Seller list, Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker, and Son of Stitch 'n Bitch. She hosts and teaches on Stitch 'n Beach cruises and Stitch 'n Bitch Tuscany. Stoller encourages her readers to take on the [...] "feminine" [...] activity of knitting and organize their own Stitch 'N Bitch sessions in their communities. In 2010, Stoller teamed with Red Heart to launch a <b>yarn</b> <b>line,</b> Stitch Nation by Debbie Stoller.|$|R
