40|$|Standard Galois Lattices are {{effective}} tools for data analysis and knowledge discovery. Many research works in classification or association rules increase {{the interest of}} them for data mining. They allow structuring data sets, by extracting concepts and rules to deduce concepts from other concepts. They concern binary data arrays, called contexts. Several algorithms were proposed to generate concepts of lattices, among which Ganter algorithm is the best one for <b>large</b> <b>contexts.</b> However, it’s also hard to face the complexity of large data with Ganter algorithm. So we propose a new and fast Galois lattice-building algorithm GL which works for objects having very general descriptions. And we propose a way to parallelise <b>large</b> <b>context...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{build-up}} {{towards a}} war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549, with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian's court at Constantinople, {{in attempts to}} obtain military support from Justinian or at least, {{in the case of}} Thurisind, to get a pledge of neutrality. To sway Justinian, Thurisind's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance and promised to fight against Byzantium's enemies. However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies and promised to provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, this war was of major importance in the <b>larger</b> <b>context</b> of the Gothic War, because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land communications between Italy and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{intellectual}} pursuits, the gentry exhibited {{habits and}} cultured hobbies which marked their social status and refinement. The erudite term of enjoying {{the company of}} the 'nine guests' (九客, jiuke)—an extension of the Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar—was a metaphor for accepted gentry pastimes of playing the Chinese zither, playing Chinese chess, Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, conversation, and drinking wine. The painted artwork of the gentry shifted dramatically in style from Northern to Southern Song, due to underlying political, demographic, and social circumstance. Northern Song gentry and officials, who were concerned largely with tackling issues of national interest and not much for local affairs, preferred painting huge landscape scenes where any individuals were but tiny figures immersed within a <b>larger</b> <b>context.</b> During the Southern Song, political, familial, and social concerns became heavily embedded with localized interests; these changes correlate with the chief style of Southern Song paintings, where small, intimate scenes with a primary focus on individuals was emphasized.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{continuous}} cache {{models were}} proposed as extensions to recurrent neural network language models, to adapt their predictions to local {{changes in the}} data distribution. These models only capture the local context, of up to a few thousands tokens. In this paper, we propose an extension of continuous cache models, which can scale to <b>larger</b> <b>contexts.</b> In particular, we use a large scale non-parametric memory component that stores all the hidden activations seen in the past. We leverage recent advances in approximate nearest neighbor search and quantization algorithms to store millions of representations while searching them efficiently. We conduct extensive experiments showing that our approach significantly improves the perplexity of pre-trained language models on new distributions, and can scale efficiently to much <b>larger</b> <b>contexts</b> than previously proposed local cache models.

40|$|Formal concept {{analysis}} is increasingly used for <b>large</b> <b>contexts</b> that are built by programs. This paper presents an e#cient algorithm for concept analysis that computes concepts {{together with their}} explicit lattice structure. An experimental evaluation uses randomly generated contexts to compare the running time of the presented algorithm with two other algorithms. Running time is mainly proportional {{to the number of}} concepts computed and thus the algorithm is well suited for <b>large</b> <b>contexts.</b> At least contexts with sparsely filled context tables cause concept lattices grow quadratically with respect to the size of their base relation. The growth rate is controlled by the density of context tables. Modest growth combined with e#cient algorithms leads to fast concept analysis. 1 Introduction Concept analysis {{has proven to be a}} valuable tool for gaining insight into complex data [4, 12]. In many applications of concept analysis experts learn from formal contexts by inspecting th [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Arithmetic {{encoding}} is {{an essential}} class of coding techniques which {{have been widely used}} in various data compression systems and exhibited promising performance. One key issue of arithmetic encoding method is to predict the probability of the current symbol to be encoded from its context, i. e., the preceding encoded symbols, which usually can be executed by building a look-up table (LUT). However, the complexity of LUT increases exponentially with the length of context. Thus, such solutions are limited in modeling <b>large</b> <b>context,</b> which inevitably restricts the compression performance. Several recent convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) -based solutions have been developed to account for <b>large</b> <b>context,</b> but are still costly in computation. The inefficiency of the existing methods are mainly attributed to that probability prediction is performed independently for the neighboring symbols, which actually can be efficiently conducted by shared computation. To this end, we propose a trimmed convolutional network for arithmetic encoding (TCAE) to model <b>large</b> <b>context</b> while maintaining computational efficiency. As for trimmed convolution, the convolutional kernels are specially trimmed to respect the compression order and context dependency of the input symbols. Benefited from trimmed convolution, the probability prediction of all symbols can be efficiently performed in one single forward pass via a fully convolutional network. Experiments show that our TCAE attains better compression ratio in lossless gray image compression, and can be adopted in CNN-based lossy image compression to achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance with real-time encoding speed...|$|R
