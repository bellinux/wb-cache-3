25|$|Historically, the dry {{and liquid}} bulk {{segments}} have generated {{most of the}} canal's revenues. Bulk cargo includes dry goods, such as grains (corn, soy, and wheat, among others), minerals, fertilizers, coal, and <b>liquid</b> <b>goods,</b> such as chemical products, propane gas, crude oil, and oil derivatives. Recently, containerized cargo has replaced dry bulk as the canal's main income generator, moving it to second place. Vehicle carriers have become the third-largest income generator, replacing the liquid bulk segment. Shipping industry analyses conducted by the ACP and top industry experts indicate that the canal expansion will be beneficial to both the canal and its users because of the demand that will be served by allowing the transit of more tonnage.|$|E

Cargo (physical goods) are primarily delivered via roads and railroads on land, shipping lanes on the sea and airline networks in the air.

Niehl II handles cars, <b>liquid</b> <b>goods</b> including dangerous liquids and hydrocarbon gases.

For transportation of live animals special requirements have to be met in many countries to prevent cruelty to animals (see animal rights).

40|$|O comércio foi uma das razões que impulsionaram os amplos investimentos em infraestrutura e desenvolvimento dos meios de transporte, com o intuito de facilitar o deslocamento por grandes distâncias. Além de influenciar diretamente o surgimento dos contratos mercantis, das instituições financeiras e da moeda. O comércio, na forma como conhecemos hoje, teve início com o escambo, que ocorria em feiras itinerantes. Com o tempo, houve a necessidade de se estabelecer um local fixo onde fossem promovidas tais trocas. Com isso, surgiram os primeiros armazéns de secos e molhados, que propiciaram a base para a arquitetura comercial. A pouca relevância dada a este tipo de arquitetura, bem como a influência clara do comércio na paisagem urbana, foram os impulsos necessários para este projeto. Os ambientes comerciais são a estética dos espaços urbanos e, muitas vezes, são projetados sem a devida preocupação em conciliar a arquitetura com ferramentas de design visual, como o {{merchandising}} visual, que permitem projetar ambientes que se comuniquem melhor com os consumidores e com a cidade. O presente mestrado consiste em uma pesquisa para levantar, identificar e indicar parâmetros pertinentes ao design visual aplicados em fachadas de estabelecimentos comerciais e as influências do modo de consumir do sujeito pós-moderno na concepção destes espaços. Commerce {{was one of}} {{the main}} reasons that boosted investments in infrastructure and development of transportation systems with the intent to facilitate long-distance movement. It also influenced directly the emergence of commercial contracts, financial institutions, and currencies. Commerce, as we know it, began with the exchange of goods and services that happened in roving markets. With time, as the demand grew, there was a rise in the need for an established location where trade could expand. That enabled the development of the first warehouses of dried and <b>liquid</b> <b>goods</b> which formed the base for commercial architecture. The low level of importance given to this type of architecture along with the influence of commerce in the urban landscape were the key motivations for this project. The places of trade area the aesthetically shape urban spaces and, in many cases, these places do not align the architecture with tools of Visual Design, such as visual merchandising, which allow us to design environments that better communicate with the consumers and the city. This present study aims to find out, identify and specify parameters relevant to the visual design applied in commercial storefronts and influences the way of consuming the postmodern subject in the design of these spaces...|$|E

In the future heat flux from the foil will be calculated with help of Koshi problem solution. It was shown that the rivulet width as the liquid flow rate increases, and it narrows as heat power increases due to the high evaporation rate.

30|$|Interest in {{some kinds}} of fuel cell {{technologies}} dropped owing to economic factors, material problems, and certain inadequacies {{in the operation of}} electrochemical devices [49]. One of the main drawbacks of the fuel cells is related {{to the use of the}} liquid electrolyte. Using a polymer membrane as an electrolyte can solve some limiting requirements of fuel cells. For instance the essentially need for using pure fuels in AFCs have been overcome by using a polymer membrane as an electrolyte [14, 15]. Fuel cell membranes must meet several desired properties such as high proton conductivity, low electronic conductivity, impermeability to fuel gas or <b>liquid,</b> <b>good</b> mechanical toughness in both the dry and hydrated states, and high oxidative and hydrolytic stability in the actual fuel cell environment [4]. These properties are related to properties such as ion exchange capacity, morphology and water uptake that must be assessed as well when characterizing potential of a new fuel cell membrane [9].|$|R
40|$|The solid-liquid phase-diagram of charge-stabilized {{colloidal}} suspensions {{is calculated}} using {{a technique that}} combines a continuous Poisson-Boltzmann description for the microscopic electrolyte ions with a molecular-dynamics simulation for the macroionic colloidal spheres. While correlations between the microions are neglected in this approach, many-body interactions between the colloids are fully included. The solid-liquid transition is determined at a high colloid volume fraction where many-body interactions {{are expected to be}} strong. With a view to the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory predicting that colloids interact via Yukawa pair-potentials, we compare our results with the phase diagram of a simple Yukawa <b>liquid.</b> <b>Good</b> agreement is found at high salt conditions, while at low ionic strength considerable deviations are observed. By calculating effective colloid-colloid pair-interactions it is demonstrated that these differences are due to many-body interactions.

40|$|In {{the classic}} Arrow-Debreu model, the {{existence}} of money is not accommodated. However, using trading post market segmentation and requiring budget balance in each pair-wise transaction the model can converge to monetary equilibrium. Uniqueness of the common medium of exchange (commodity money) follows from scale economy in transaction costs. Also, this paper shows that existence and convergence to monetary equilibrium are totally different concept. In Full Double Coincidence of Wants situation, where previous market information helps households judging which good has highest saleableness, convergence takes place more easily than in Absence of Double Coincidence of Wants situation. This paper investigates the emergence of commodity money {{as the result of}} a tatonnement adjustment in a trading post economy. The convergence process models Menger‟s concept of saleableness – the most <b>liquid</b> <b>good</b> becomes the common medium of exchange. A computational approach is adopted to illustrate the monetary convergence as a result of decentralized adjustment process by utility maximizing households in the economy. Starting from an arbitrary initial economy, the analysis constructs a mapping from a compact economy space to monetary equilibrium or non-monetary equilibrium. By varying the transaction costs parameters and the household endowments, the paper successfully identifies the regions of parameter space where convergence to monetary equilibrium occurs as a result of decentralized adjustment process. The reasons for non-convergence are also investigated...|$|R
