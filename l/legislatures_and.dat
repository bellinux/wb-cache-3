5|$|India is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} 29 states and 7 union territories. All states, {{as well as}} the union territories of Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected <b>legislatures</b> <b>and</b> governments, both patterned on the Westminster model. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the centre through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. Since then, their structure has remained largely unchanged. Each state or union territory is further divided into administrative districts. The districts in turn are further divided into tehsils and ultimately into villages.|$|E
5|$|Once the Speaker {{election}} {{had concluded}} and Congress {{was ready to}} conduct legislative business, the issue of slavery took center stage. Northerners sought to admit California, a free state, to the Union. Kentucky's Henry Clay introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions, the Compromise of 1850, to admit California and pass legislation sought by each side. Johnson voted for all the provisions except for {{the abolition of slavery}} in the nation's capital. He pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators (then elected by state <b>legislatures)</b> <b>and</b> of the president (chosen by the Electoral College), and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years. These were all defeated.|$|E
5|$|Other provinces have no {{official}} languages as such, but French {{is used as}} a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial <b>legislatures,</b> <b>and</b> laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official. There are 11 indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects. Of these, only the Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibway languages have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable to survive in the long term. Several indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories. Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut, and is one of three official languages in the territory.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1780s, Bryan {{remained}} an ardent {{advocate of the}} unicameral <b>legislature</b> <b>and</b> executive council still in place in Pennsylvania, and he opposed adoption of the 1787 Federal Constitution largely because it created a bicameral <b>legislature</b> <b>and</b> a single executive.|$|R

5|$|The {{tour was}} a {{commercial}} success, grossing over $156 million, being seen by over 1.7 million ticket holders, and finishing as the third-highest grossing {{tour in the}} world for 2009 even though the tour faced some logistical issues. Ticket sales were botched by Ticketmaster, a situation further exacerbated by revelations of their holding seats back for their secondary market TicketsNow. Before long, <b>legislatures</b> <b>and</b> attorneys general of several states, as well as members of the U.S. Congress and federal regulatory agencies, were weighing in on the matter, with various lawsuits, settlements, and proposed laws as the result.|$|E
5|$|After each {{election}} to the Scottish Parliament, {{at the beginning of}} each parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer, the equivalent of the speaker in other <b>legislatures,</b> <b>and</b> two MSPs to serve as deputies. The Presiding Officer (currently Ken Macintosh) and deputies (currently Linda Fabiani and Christine Grahame) are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial. During debates, the Presiding Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 50 states and federal district, the United States has sovereignty over 14 territories. Five of them (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while nine of them do not. With the exception of Navassa Island, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which {{are located in the}} Caribbean, all territories are located in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be unorganized, meaning they have not had an Organic Act enacted by Congress; the four other territories are organized, meaning they have had an Organic Act that has been enacted by Congress. The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy and a non-voting delegate in Congress, in {{addition to}} having territorial <b>legislatures</b> <b>and</b> governors, but residents cannot vote in federal elections.|$|E

5|$|John von Neumann, {{working with}} Oskar Morgenstern {{on the theory}} of games, broke new {{mathematical}} ground in 1944 by extending functional analytic methods related to convex sets and topological fixed-point theory to economic analysis. Their work thereby avoided the traditional differential calculus, for which the maximum–operator {{did not apply to}} non-differentiable functions. Continuing von Neumann's work in cooperative game theory, game theorists Lloyd S. Shapley, Martin Shubik, Hervé Moulin, Nimrod Megiddo, Bezalel Peleg influenced economic research in politics and economics. For example, research on the fair prices in cooperative games and fair values for voting games led to changed rules for voting in <b>legislatures</b> <b>and</b> for accounting for the costs in public–works projects. For example, cooperative game theory was used in designing the water distribution system of Southern Sweden and for setting rates for dedicated telephone lines in the USA.|$|E
5|$|Muslims of Bombay elected Jinnah, though then {{absent in}} London, as their {{representative}} to the Central Legislative Assembly in October 1934. The British Parliament's Government of India Act 1935 gave considerable power to India's provinces, with a weak central parliament in New Delhi, which had no authority over such matters as foreign policy, defence, {{and much of the}} budget. Full power remained {{in the hands of the}} Viceroy, however, who could dissolve <b>legislatures</b> <b>and</b> rule by decree. The League reluctantly accepted the scheme, though expressing reservations about the weak parliament. The Congress was much better prepared for the provincial elections in 1937, and the League failed to win a majority even of the Muslim seats in any of the provinces where members of that faith held a majority. It did win a majority of the Muslim seats in Delhi, but could not form a government anywhere, though it was part of the ruling coalition in Bengal. The Congress and its allies formed the government even in the North-West Frontier Province (N.W.F.P.), where the League won no seats despite the fact that almost all residents were Muslim.|$|E
