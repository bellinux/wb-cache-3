40|$|In this paper, we analyze a two-{{producers}} two-agent {{model in}} which producers delegate sales and price negotiations to exclusive, separate, and independent agents. Producers first choose a pricing arrangement (two-part tariff versus <b>linear</b> <b>tariff)</b> and then set wholesale prices (and fixed fees) to their agents. Given this, agents announce prices to consumers {{as a basis for}} negotiations. Finally, consumers make their buying decision and bargain about the actually paid price once they arrive at an agent`s location. We show that both franchise pricing and linear pricing can be supported as equilibrium outcomes depending on the agents` fixed costs and consumers` bargaining power. With ex ante unobservable two-part tariffs consumers may be worse off from the ability to bargain and more so the higher their bargaining power. In the case of linear pricing, consumers gain from the ability to bargain and more so the higher bargaining power they have. On the balance, however, consumers are worse off from higher bargaining power {{due to the fact that}} increasing bargaining power affects the manufacturers` equilibrium actions regarding pricing schemes to the consumers` disadvantage...|$|E

In particular, the optimal design of dynamic two-part tariffs for a regulated monopolistic retailer is considered, where the retailer faces exogenous wholesale electricity prices and fixed costs {{on the one hand}} and stochastic demands with inter-temporal price dependencies on the other. Part I presents a general framework and analysis for revenue adequate retail tariffs with advanced notification, dynamic prices and uniform connection charges. It is shown that the optimal two-part tariff consists of a dynamic price that may not match the expected wholesale price and a connection charge that distributes uniformly among all customers the retailer's fixed costs and a price-volume risk premium. A sufficient condition for the optimality of the derived two-part tariff among the class of arbitrary ex-ante tariffs is obtained. Numerical simulations quantify the substantial welfare gains that the optimal two-part tariff may bring compared to the optimal <b>linear</b> <b>tariff</b> (without connection charge).

40|$|Using the Laffont, Rey and Tirole (1998) framework, a {{model of}} {{competition}} between vertically integrated telecommunications networks in a deregulated environment is developed. Two local operators compete in linear and non <b>linear</b> <b>tariffs</b> (i. e. two-part tariffs) in the subscribers market. In addition, they are integrated downstream in a potentially competitive sector (i. e. long distance sector) where they face competition of other firms which require (one way) access to local networks as an "essential facility". The purpose of the paper is to introduce a "downstream" competition in the usual framework of network competition and to focus on how the one way access charges are set in an oligopolistic market. In a mature phase of the industry, the presence of competition in both local and long distance sectors leads to lower local and long distance tariffs. The strategic role of the two-way and one-way access charges is pointed out, with particular reference {{to the effect that}} the reciprocal (two-way) access charge has on competition in the complementary sector. Finally, in case of competition in two-part tariffs, the paper investigates: 1) the asymmetric case in which only one network is integrated; 2) the entry process when the two local networks have different coverage. The results show how the level of the two-way and one-way access charges affects the "level playing field" between networks.

Take, for example, product pricing, gas and electricity pricing, transportation and postage pricing, telecommunications, cable TV and Internet access pricing. These are all examples of nonlinear pricing, where the selling firm designs differentiated products and prices them according to the firm's marketing strategy. Nonlinear pricing is also a general model of incomplete information {{and it has a}} plenty of applications, such as regulation, taxation and designing labor contracts. This Dissertation develops a new learning approach for the nonlinear pricing problem, where the selling firm has limited information about the buyers' preferences. The main contributions are i) to show how the firm can learn what kind of products should be put up for sale, and what information the firm needs to do this, ii) to introduce a new approach in modeling incomplete information using optimality conditions, iii) to analyze mathematically the general pricing problem with many buyer types and multiple quality dimensions, and iv) to examine the computational issues of solving the pricing problem. The learning method is based on selling the product repeatedly. The firm sets <b>linear</b> <b>tariffs,</b> from which the buyers select the product they wish to consume. This reveals the buyers' marginal valuations, which is exactly the information that is needed to evaluate the optimality conditions. By evaluating the different optimality conditions, the firm learns the buyers who get the same product at the optimum and the buyers who are excluded.

We first analyze the distributive {{consequences of the}} water network expansion, as about one fifth of the households in Casablanca {{is expected to be}} connected under the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) programs. Then we conduct micro-simulation estimations using alternative water tariff structures in order to assess their distributional effects. Due to the selection pattern of the water connection itself, the water demand of unconnected households must be estimated as a preliminary step using a standard Heckman procedure. Water consumption has then been adjusted using standard elasticity assumptions for alternative water pricing. The analysis shows that every tariff structure simulated becomes progressive once the water network is expanded and that the reduction of the first block provides no improvement at constant subsidy level. The most progressive tariff structure are the ones providing a free water allowance, especially when it takes into account the household size. Finally, simulated targeted subsidies do not improve the distribution while the exclusion issue is a rising concern, with more than 50 % of the poorest households excluded from such consumption subsidies...|$|E

Initially, the report reviews the developments in the WTO and the EU on market access. The report also reviews various studies that evaluated agriculture market liberalisation in the EU. The report then describes the LTEM (Lincoln Trade and Environment Model), a multi-commodity and country, partial equilibrium model. The basic framework of the LTEM trade model is described especially the modification of the model to include market protection through import tariffs. The model is then used to estimate the impact of different levels and forms of tariff cuts. Three tariff reduction alternatives are considered. The first applies a <b>linear</b> <b>tariff</b> cut of 39 per cent, the second a tiered formula with cuts ranging from 60, 50, and 45 to 35 per cent. The highest cuts are applied to the sectors with highest tariffs, such as beef, sheep {{and some of the}} dairy products. The third applies a 100 per cent tariff removal. The results are consistent with theory, other studies and expectations. Producer returns decrease for the EU in proportion to the level of tariff cut. The decreases are larger for beef and sheep. In dairy, the reductions in producer returns are lesser due to the small decrease in EU milk production. EU dairy production remains at its quota level in the first two scenarios. NZ and Australia benefit in all scenarios. The application of a tiered formula for tariff cuts in the second scenario leads to deeper reductions in the commodities where NZ and Australia are net exporters and therefore leads to higher returns than the linear reduction. Regarding commodities, the gains in producer returns for NZ and Australia are bigger for beef and sheep. In the case of the dairy sector, the gains for NZ and Australia are much more moderate. This is expected the cuts in import tariffs in the EU dairy sector are offset by other mechanisms in place...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the theoretical properties of different price cap schemes {{that have been}} applied in the UK and the USA. The objective is to assess the consequences for price structures and welfare of different ways of defining the regulated price index. Chapter 2 surveys the literature on regulation under asymmetric information that is related to price caps. Chapter 3 presents a general analysis of five main types of price cap when the regulated firm sets <b>linear</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The schemes are the Tariff Basket (TB) scheme, the Fixed Weights (F) scheme, the Average Revenue (AR) scheme, the Average Revenue (Lagged) scheme, and the Paasche Price Index (PPI) scheme. The TB and PPI schemes generate efficient price structures in the long run, whereas prices are inefficient under the other schemes. In Chapter 4 the consequences of allowing freedom to set different prices, relative {{to the case of}} uniform prices, are analyzed. The conditions for price freedom to be desirable are derived for the case where the price level is not regulated. When the price level is regulated it is shown that AR regulation can cause welfare to be below the level that obtains without any regulation. Chapter 5 contains an analysis of the five price caps examined in Chapter 3 for the case where the firm sets a two-part tariff. The AR and PPI schemes are dominated, and the conditions under which TB, F and ARL are optimal are established. Chapter 6 explores some issues in the regulation of nonlinear tariffs by AR and TB price caps. Chapter 7 considers some extensions of the analysis. It is shown that when quality is a choice variable, the regulator is concerned about income distribution and there is demand growth the TB scheme can be adapted and retains its desirable properties.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} analysis of optimal pricing by firms when consumer demands are uncertain. The {{purpose is to}} extend the familiar literature on single-product nonlinear pricing in two directions: to cases where the firm is regulated and to the case where the firm produces several products. Chapter 1 embeds these problems into the general setting of models of asymmetric information and, as well as covering existing work on the pricing decisions of firms facing adverse selection, discusses other areas including repeated contracts, auctions, signalling and the uses {{of what is known}} as the 'first-order approach'. Chapter 2 analyzes nonlinear pricing by a regulated single-product firm. As an alternative to requiring the firm to offer a given <b>linear</b> <b>tariff</b> two different types of regulation which allow nonlinear pricing are considered, namely, average revenue regulation and optional tariff regulation. Chapter 3 introduces the topic of multiproduct pricing when consumers have differing tastes for the various goods. The important simplifying assumption is that consumers wish to buy either one unit of a good or none at all. There are three main results: if consumers' taste parameters are continuously distributed then the firm will not offer all goods to all consumers; in the symmetric two-good case it is shown that (subject to a kind of 'hazard rate' condition) the firm will offer the bundle of two goods at a discount compared with the charge for the two goods separately; and the pricing strategy when the number of goods becomes large is solved approximately. Chapter 4 relaxes the assumption of unit demands and uses differential methods to analyze the multiproduct nonlinear pricing problem. In the symmetric case when taste parameters are continuously distributed the firm will choose to exclude some low-demand consumers from the market. It is shown that when parameters are independently distributed the firm will wish to introduce a degree of cross-dependence into its tariff. Sufficient conditions for a tariff to be optimal are derived and any tariff which satisfies these conditions necessarily will induce 'pure bundling', so that once a consumer decides to participate in the market at all she will choose to buy all goods. A class of cases is solved explicitly using these sufficient conditions. Since other solutions may be hard to solve analytically, a procedure for numerically generating solutions for the two-good case is described and two more solutions are described. </p...|$|E

Increasing-block tariff systems are used by 87 of the 184 utilities in OECD countries surveyed, such as e.g. in Spain. Since the late 1980s there has been a trend in OECD countries away from decreasing-block tariffs, which are apparently only still found in some cities of the United States. Where fixed charges exist as part of two-part tariffs, there is a shift toward the reduction or even abolition of large minimum free allowances in OECD countries.
