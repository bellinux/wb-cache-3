In order to accommodate a large range of strains, these interconnectors are manufactured with a stress-relief loop shape. The main goal of this thesis is the study of the experimental aspects of the low cycle fatigue of these interconnectors. The development of an in-situ automated fatigue testing procedure is described in detail. This procedure, which involves a miniature cycling device situated inside the vacuum chamber of a scanning electron microscope (SEM), was applied to several pure silver interconnectors with different <b>loop</b> <b>heights.</b> The use of the SEM enables observation, at high magnification, of the interconnector while it is being tested. A new parameter, $ kappa$, which includes the interconnector's geometrical characteristics, is introduced. The experimental results show that the fatigue life of interconnectors can be predicted from a knowledge of $ kappa$. A new approach to the measurement of strain at the top of interconnectors' loop is also proposed. The technique requires the use of the SEM and the deposition of 2 $ mu$m spheres as surface markers. In addition to the experimental technique, a three-dimensional linear finite element analysis of the interconnectors is performed.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{demand for}} {{increased}} computing power {{and more complex}} integrated circuit devices with increased functions per chip results in high lead-count integrated circuit packages. With the shrinkage in integrated circuit sizes towards smaller packages, and the decrease in pad pitch, the trend is moving from the current ultra-fine-pitch volume production of 50 µm to even lower pad pitches. However, the various concerns for 50 -µm pitch bonding, such as low production yield, reliability issues, etc, have forced many customers to re-visit the feasibility of utilising the robust fine pitch bonding to handle the high lead-count packages. This paper reports the new development of bonding tools to handle the multi-tier wire bonding requirement with a maximum <b>loop</b> <b>height</b> of 475 µm. With {{the increase in the}} <b>loop</b> <b>height</b> of the wires, the bottleneck height of the capillary needs to be increased accordingly to prevent touching the adjacent wire during bonding. The increase in bottleneck height can influence the efficient transfer of the ultrasonic energy from the bonding tool to the bond interface and affect bond quality. In addition, the longer bottleneck height of the capillary also increases the risk of tip breakage during bonding. In this study, the external profile of the capillary is simulated with respect to the looping profile during bonding using a customised software package. In addition, finite element simulation is also utilised to analyse the difference in stress level with different bonding tool designs. The results of the simulations are then used to correlate with the actual bonding responses...|$|E

Its peak f_X from 0. 3 [...] 100 keV of 5. 3 x 10 ^- 8 erg/cm 2 /s is nearly 7000 times larger than the star's quiescent coronal flux, and the change in magnitude in the white filter is > 4. 7. This flare also caused a transient increase in EV Lac's bolometric luminosity (L_bol) during {{the early stages of the}} flare, with a peak estimated L_X/L_bol ~ 3. 1. We apply flare loop hydrodynamic modeling to the plasma parameter temporal changes to derive a loop semi-length of l/Rstar = 0. 37 +/- 0. 07. The soft X-ray spectrum of the flare reveals evidence of iron Kalpha emission at 6. 4 keV.

40|$|HEMT {{cryogenic}} low-noise amplifiers are {{an important}} part of instrumentation: the amplifiers use as a front-end for different measurements and as IF amplifiers in heterodyne receivers. During last few years the low-noise limit has reached as low level as approximately 0. 5 K/GHz for GaAs [1] and 0. 25 K/GHz for InP HEMT [2]. However, besides electrical performance improvement there were not many improvements on mass and dimension side of such amplifiers as they were built based on standard TRL technology with discrete active and passive components. Mass and dimensions are also very important for real applications. When ultimate low-noise performance is placed in focus, pure MMIC technology seems to loose against design using discrete components. With this in view, pioneered work by E. F. Lauria, et. al. [3] have successfully demonstrated a design employing MMIC approach while using discrete components and based on a microstrip on Cuflon with lumped bias network. Encouraged by this work, we propose a compact design of a 4 - 8 GHz cryogenic low noise amplifier using a combination of standard TRL and lumped element technology to achieve both ultimate noise performance over the specified band and a very compact size. In our design, the size reduction of the amplifier is realized by selecting an alumina substrate with a high dielectric constant, (εr = 9. 9), but also by taking advantage of the lumped networks in the matching and bias circuitries. Avoiding quarter wave transformers and instead use a lumped element design approach opens up for the possibilities to reach greater bandwidths and simultaneously obtain a more compact design. In order to make optimum design, we have performed extensive simulations. Each amplifier stage has been simulated in Agilent EMDS, 3 D electromagnetic field simulation package, including the single layer capacitors, and then implemented in the ADS circuit simulations as an S-parameter file. Over the 4 - 8 GHz band, the simulations predict noise temperature, Taverage 35 dB. The transistors selected for the design are commercial InP HEMT (HRL) chosen due to their excellent noise performance [2], but also for the very low power consumption, which is of great importance at cryogenic temperatures. All the components used in the RFsignal path and in the bias circuits are mounted with conductive epoxy. Apart from the RFsignal path, all components are interconnected via bond-wires. Fine tuning is done by adjusting the length and <b>loop</b> <b>heights</b> of the bond-wires. At the conference we plan to report results of measurement and characterization of the prototype amplifier.

40|$|Solid state {{lighting}} {{is a good}} alternative light source with reduced energy consumption. Light-emitting diode (LED) is very efficient in turning electrical energy into light. LED {{has a number of}} advantages over the traditional light sources. The optical performance of the LED component is very critical. In general, white light can be obtained by applying phosphor on a blue LED chip. The blue light from the LED excites the phosphor to emit yellow light. The blue and yellow light mixes together to give white light. In order to obtain a good optical performance, it is necessary to apply phosphor properly. It is challenging to distribute a right amount of phosphor on the LED die. Besides, phosphor dispensing is usually the slowest process when compared with die bonding and wire bonding. This controls the overall throughput of the LED packaging process. There are different methods to apply the phosphor. The phosphor is mixed with epoxy or silicone to form slurry and is then dispensed onto the chip. However, the spatial color distribution is poor if phosphor slurry is used. Conformal phosphor coating can be used to improve the spatial color distribution. In this paper, an innovative phosphor stencil printing method is proposed. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the phosphor stencil printing process for wafer-level LED packaging. LEDs are first mounted on a wafer submount. Wire bonds are used as interconnect. The phosphor is stencil printed on the chip surface after wire bond. The minimum phosphor layer thickness is controlled by the wire bond <b>loop</b> <b>height.</b> In order to achieve a low <b>loop</b> <b>height,</b> reverse wire bonding is used. The first bond is on the wafer submount and the second bond is on the LED chip. The reverse wire bond has a very low profile which allows a thin layer of phosphor to be printed on the chip surface. Prototypes are successfully fabricated. A uniform layer of phosphor is stencil printed on the LED chip on the wafer submount. Experimental result shows that the proposed phosphor printing method is very effective in distributing the right amount of phosphor on the chip surface. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E

The presence of prominences trapped in co-rotation 2 to 5 stellar radii above the stellar surface has been taken {{as evidence that the}} coronae of these stars must be very extended. The observed surface magnetic fields, however, cannot contain X-ray emitting gas out to these distances. We present an alternative model: that these prominences are trapped in long thin loops embedded not in the X-ray corona, but in the wind. Above coronal helmet streamers, oppositely-directed wind-bearing field lines reconnect to form closed loops which then fill up with gas that was originally part of the wind. We demonstrate that static equilibria exist for these loops at a range of pressures and temperatures. The maximum <b>loop</b> <b>height</b> falls as the rotation rate increases, but rises as the loop temperature decreases.

To achieve the climbing, cruising and descending flight {{control of the}} air-breathing hypersonic vehicle, an engineering-oriented flight control system based on a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) method is designed for the hypersonic vehicle, which including the <b>height</b> <b>loop,</b> the pitch angle loop and the velocity loop. Moreover, as a variant of nature-inspired algorithm, modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm is presented to optimize the flight control parameters and is characterized by better exploration and exploitation than the standard shuffled frog leaping algorithm. A nonlinear model of air-breathing hypersonic vehicle is used to verify the dynamic characteristics achieved by the intelligent flight control system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed swarm intelligence optimized PID controllers are effective in achieving better flight trajectory and velocity control performance than the traditional controllers...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{structure of}} solar active region NOAA 7986 observed on 1996 August 30 with the Extrem-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) is analyzed. We {{develop a new}} method of Dynamic Stereoscopy to reconstruct the 3 D geometry of dynamically changing loops, which allows us to determine {{the orientation of the}} loop plane with respect to the line-of-sight, a prerequisite to correct properly for projection effects in 3 D loop models. With this method and the filter-ratio technique applied to EIT 171 A and 195 A images we determine the 3 D coordinates (x(s), y(s), z(s)), the loop width) w(s), the electron density n(sub e) (s), and the electron temperature T(sub e) (s) as function of the loop length s for 30 loop segments. Fitting the loop densities with an exponential density model n(sub e) (h) we find that the so inferred scale height temperatures, T(sub e) (sup lambda) = 1. 22 +/- 0. 23 MK, match closely the EIT filter-ratio temperatures, T(sub e) (sup FIT) = 1. 21 +/- 0. 06 MK. We conclude that these rather large-scale <b>loops</b> (with <b>heights</b> of h approx. equals 50 - 200 Mm) that dominate EIT 171 A images are close to thermal equilibrium. Most of the loops show no significant thickness variation w(s), but many exhibit a trend of increasing temperature (dT/ds greater than 0) above the footpoint...|$|R
40|$|We define two {{new models}} {{on the square}} lattice, in which each allowed {{configuration}} is a superposition of a covering by ``white'' dimers and one by ``black'' dimers. Each model maps to a solid-on-solid (SOS) model in which the ``height'' field is two dimensional. Measuring the stiffness of the SOS fluctuations in the rough phase provides critical exponents of the dimer models. Using this ``height'' representation, we have performed Monte Carlo simulations. They confirm that each dimer model has critical correlations and belongs to a new universality class. In the "dimer-loop" model (which maps to a <b>loop</b> model) one <b>height</b> component is smooth but has unusual correlated fluctuations; the other height component is rough. In the ``noncrossing-dimer'' model, the heights are rough having two different elastic constants; an unusual form of its elastic theory implies anisotropic critical correlations.
