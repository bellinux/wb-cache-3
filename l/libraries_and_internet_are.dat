40|$|Abstract This study {{investigated}} the influence of information sources availability and use on academic performance of secondary school students using a descriptive survey design. Two hundred and eight senior secondary school students {{were randomly selected from}} six secondary schools in Ibadan. Data was collected using a self-structured questionnaire that covers all the variables under study. Percentage was used to answer the research questions while Pearson product moment correlation coefficient was used to test the hypotheses postulated. The findings indicated that information sources that are mostly available in secondary schools are the teachers and lesson notes while <b>library</b> <b>and</b> <b>internet</b> facilities <b>are</b> the least available. The result of the hypotheses showed significant relationship between the independent variables (information sources availability and use) and dependent variable (academic performance). r (206) =. 21, p <. 01.

40|$|May {{the changes}} in the {{representations}} of the public library be propitiated by readers' appropriations of the Internet? To answer this question, a theoretically-driven and empirically-based research was developed in a public library in Portugal, combining the analysis of documents uses, the ethnography of space <b>and</b> <b>Internet</b> use, of social relations developed while reading, with the analysis of representations of the public library. No clear-cut association emerged between social-demographics or user profiles, and representations, in general.

This is quite clear from the fact that a very low percentage of students are able to get higher grades in examinations held in Southern provincial ministry of Education. Therefore there is a great need to explore the factors that affect career path of students to guide them towards a better future through the success in education. This study identifies factors that influence academic success of students and presents research findings to use them for academic counseling in schools in Sri Lanka. Southern Province has been selected for the research to represent the education system of Sri Lanka. Literature survey was done to identify the current education system with reference to the identified problem. Collected data were analyzed statistically to find the relationship between each parameter that contributes to the success of students with examination results. Very good relationships between examination marks and subject related extra curricular activities, working capacity, inborn skills and field of career interest have been identified. G. C. E.

40|$|A {{theoretically}} orientated and empirically supported {{research is}} presented, exploring and developing possible relations between {{uses of the}} public library, according to {{the dimensions of the}} usage of documentary resources, of space <b>and</b> of the <b>Internet,</b> on one hand, and its representations, on the other. Resorting to a qualitative approach, Michael Burawoy's extended case method was applied to the Library Almeida Garret in the city of Porto. The tools used to gather information were in-depth semi-structured interviews, analysis of children's drawings, observation, documentary analysis of official texts and photography. Several readers were interviewed, including non Internet-users, as well as managers, technical and front-office staff, and the architect. As intermediate results, several users' profiles are presented and an explanation is advanced for the genesis and functioning of a tacit system for the regulation of conducts, especially as far as noise is concerned. As a final result, I conclude that there is no clearly disruptive "impact" induced by the Internet from the collected and analysed representations, which are related to recently registered changes in the reading practices: for some representational images the Internet reinforces the traditional image of the library as an encyclopaedic organization, as a set of diversified resources; for others, Internet use will contribute, on one hand, to their reinforcement, while, on the other hand, it updates and democratizes these representations through an opening to non-learned practices and by the affordance of recreational, communication or, yet, instrumental uses based on the Internet; in more extreme situations, when <b>library</b> <b>and</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>are</b> used as synonyms in the representational grammar, without this technology a library would, naturally, not make sense; but, in the opposite extreme, its popular and intensive use is not thought as being compatible with the image of an institution devoted to culture, here understood as learned culture, the terms being almost antonymic. Changes in the frequency and usage of the public library, are else associated, in a clear manner, to the emergence of new types of readers reflecting changes in the urban social composition of the city and in the ways of urban living. So I conclude that the library without <b>Internet</b> would not <b>be</b> so public, or that it would not exist at all in some people's views, <b>and</b> that the <b>library</b> finds a reinforcement as to what is, and may keep on being, precisely in the public provision of <b>Internet</b> access <b>and</b> in open, free, and, when necessary, personally supported, Internet services...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{introduction}} of computerized post-coordination has solved {{many of the}} problems of pre-coordinated subject access. However, the adoption of computerized post-coordination results in the loss of some pre-coordination benefits. Specifically, the effect of hiding terms within the context of others is lost in post-coordination which gives lead status to every document term. This results in spurious matches of terms out of context. <b>Library</b> patrons <b>and</b> <b>Internet</b> searchers <b>are</b> increasingly dissatisfied with subject access performance, in part because of unmanageably large retrieval sets. The need to enhance precision and limit the size of retrieval sets motivates this work which proposes partial coordination, an approach which incorporates the advantages of computer search with the ability of pre-coordination to limit spurious partial matches and thereby enhance precision...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare (inter) national guidelines and analyse differences. Methods: MEDLINE, the Cochrane <b>Library</b> <b>and</b> the <b>internet</b> <b>were</b> searched for guidelines on {{the prevention of}} VTE in orthopedic surgery. From these, we constructed a table comparing the different antithrombotic regimens during different orthopedic surgical and plaster cast treatments. RESULTS: Eleven guidelines from nine different countries and one international guideline were included. Few guidelines advise on thrombosis prophylaxis after plaster cast immobilization, (prolonged) arthroscopic surgery and isolated lower extremity trauma. Different opinions exist on the sole use of aspirin and mechanical prophylaxis and {{on the use of}} vitamin K antagonists after major hip and knee surgery. CONCLUSION: Based on the same available literature, different guidelines recommend different thromboprophylactic regimens. Ideally, the grade of recommendation should be based on the same level of evidence world-wide. Whilst there is no agreement on the relevance of different endpoints (e. g. asymptomatic DVT), {{it is very difficult to}} reach a consensus.

Film is categorized as a motion picture – basically it is divided into two big genres, a story movie and a documentary movie. Film is interesting to discuss. One of the types of film is sequence film. Sequence films are films that have correlation with the former ones. Conflict {{is a fact of life}} that every one of us faces every day. When people face conflict, they must find some way to resolve it. Resolving conflict often requires a physiological reaction; that is why we become aroused and active when facing a conflict. To continue in this state of arousal for any length of time can be stressful. We become nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, concerned, angry, frustration. The film Scream and Scream 2 presents us about some conflicts in case of terror that cause Sidney so frightened and anxious then lead her to become stress. The result of stress brings some physiological reactions to Sidney. The most interesting is that she become alert and more sensitive to her boyfriend then decides to keep in a distance with him because she accused him as the initial suspect. In analyzing Sidney’s stress, the researcher uses the psychological approach. In addition, a <b>library</b> research <b>and</b> <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> conducted to collect theories and other supporting materials...|$|R
40|$|This study focuses {{attention}} on the information needs and information seeking behavior of the media practitioners (MPs) in Karachi. Information need is felt when an individual comes to know that his knowledge is not enough or is insufficient, When a user recognizes an information need, he consults an information system, library or interpersonal source for satisfaction of his need. These actions constitute his information seeking behavior. Media Practitioners (MPs) are the staff members of mass media i. e. radio, television and newspaper involved in professional activities. Objectives of the study are to explore and {{understand the nature of}} information needs of media practitioners in Karachi. A very formatted and empirical effort has been made: 1. to identify various types of information sources in use by the media practitioners in Karachi, 2. to examine how MPs learn to know about the existence of various information sources, 3. to explore the reasons and factors that motivate these media practitioners to seek and consume information. It is also carried out: 4. to find out various sources and information channels used by these media practitioners in Karachi. 5. To find out how these MPs use and disseminate information once they get it, 6. to suggest research based principles for improvement in the quality of acquisition <b>and</b> collection through <b>libraries.</b> Sample consists of 185 MPs selected randomly from four local media houses i. e. radio, television, and newspaper/news agencies. A questionnaire was developed as the instrument for data collection. Data were gathered through structured interview. For analysis of data, sampled participants were grouped into five categories i. e. 1. Complete Sample 2. Media house wise i. e. television, radio and newspapers/news agencies 3. Policy makers, policy executors and workers 4. Participants working in fields, on desks and those who work on both and 5. according to beats. Results obtained from this study indicate that reports of various organizations, government departments, NGOs and assignment committees, etc are the form of information that are used and sought most often. After the reports come original documents, tables and graphs etc. Most of the practitioners require selective information rather than exhaustive type. Feature writers, producers of research oriented programs and policy executors look for exhaustive information. For all groups of media practitioners, belonging to any type of mass communication, priority of information <b>is</b> very high. <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> the channel, which is being used increasingly by media practitioners; however, practitioners working. in the fields use other library services more than Internet Quite surprisingly, the use of libraries among radio practitioners was found to be particularly low. Use of Internet among newspaper practitioners is high as compared to radio and T. V. practitioners. Majority of the practitioners require reference service but media house libraries seldom provide this service. Newspaper clipping service is also needed by all groups of practitioners. <b>Library</b> <b>and</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>are</b> the channels of information, which are mostly used by all group of practitioners. Most of the practitioners mentioned reading of book reviews published in newspapers to know the existence of an information source. All practitioners read periodicals regularly to keep themselves informed about current affairs and events. They collect information in libraries by asking the librarian or searching the shelves. They also consult colleagues to know whether needed information exists somewhere in some form. Generally, they go to a library, which is nearest to their office or home.

Consequently, this article presents and illustrates proposed reformed spelling by deleting redundant letters, unnecessary clusters of letters, dropping useless silent letters, regularizing digraph, and spelling compound words in one form only. These changes will enhance spelling skills, teaching, reading, and writing in English as a Second Language...|$|R
40|$|Lack of {{protection}} of small valuable wetland areas from urban expansion projects can negatively affect environmental quality for miles throughout a watershed, {{and can lead}} to a net loss of wetlands. Research performed along the southeastern Atlantic coastal plain has shown a marked decrease in small wetland areas. This trend became evident in 1984 when it was reported that 84 % of wetland losses for the entire nation occurred in the southeastern United States. Preservation of all wetlands, no matter how small, is important for maintaining the biodiversity of plant and animal life located within these areas. Although laws have been created to promote wetland survival, destruction of wetland areas still occurs. The purpose of this project was to determine various conservation methods that can offer viable solutions to preserving remaining wetland areas within the Dog River Watershed in Mobile, Alabama. Through extensive <b>library</b> <b>and</b> <b>internet</b> research, it <b>was</b> discovered that conservation easements can guarantee the protection of wetland areas in perpetuity. In order to ensure that this method will be fully sustainable, it was necessary to conduct additional research to determine the following factors: process/costs of easement acquisition, potential easement holders and their responsibilities, and possible funding mechanisms for conservation easement acquisition and monitoring. It is expected that, by educating the public on the process and benefits of conservation easements, many valuable plots of land crucial to watershed areas can be acquired for the purpose of protecting, and in some cases improving, existing wetlands nationwide...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} perform a high-level segmentation of videos into scenes. A scene {{can be defined as}} a subdivision of a play in which either the setting is fixed, or when it presents continuous action in one place. We exploit this fact and propose a novel approach for clustering shots into scenes by transforming this task into a graph partitioning problem. This is achieved by constructing a weighted undirected graph called a shot similarity graph (SSG), where each node re{{presents a}} shot and the edges between the shots are weighted by their similarity based on color and motion information. The SSG is then split into subgraphs by applying the normalized cuts for graph partitioning. The partitions so obtained represent individual scenes in the video. When clustering the shots, we consider the global similarities of shots rather than the individual shot pairs. We also propose a method to describe the content of each scene by selecting one representative image from the video as a scene key-frame. Recently, DVDs have become available with a chapter selection option where each chapter is represented by one image. Our algorithm automates this objective which is useful for applications such as video-on-demand, digital <b>libraries,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>Internet.</b> Experiments <b>are</b> presented with promising results on several Hollywood movies and one sitcom...|$|R

Because most teachers and learners are not yet computer skilled, resource-based learning, supported by digital versatile disc (DVD) technology, {{is one of the}} most cost-effective and self-contained educational media that involve minimal infrastructural investment. Educational DVDs provide the opportunity to deliver a constructive multi-media learning experience to learners in rural areas who do not have access to <b>libraries</b> <b>and</b> the <b>Internet.</b> This <b>is</b> especially valuable for history education because DVDs allow learners to "go time travelling" through history, guided by different learning media and artefacts such as historical photographs, illustrations, film material, music, speeches, newspaper reports, political cartoons, maps, etc. Multi-media learning tools stimulate different learning styles and broaden the range of the learning experience in general. This paper provides a research framework for the development and evaluation of educational DVDs and Web-based multi-media clips for grades 8 and 9 history in the social sciences learning area. These clips are currently being developed at the Faculty Education Sciences of the North-West University.

Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to the students and asked to score each individual statement regarding LBL and PBL. The median total scores and median with interquartile range of individual statements was calculated. A comparison between questions that support LBL or PBL was performed. Student t-test was employed to compare the mean scores of different groups. Result: Among of one hundred and thirty five (135) students, only one hundred and ten (110) student participated in this study. The individual median score was 37 when compared to possible total score of 55.

The voice would become an element of identification without errors, such as fingerprints, and supported in the most well known cellular technology in the world (GSM), with all these elements, this becomes a promising technology of great impact. This document pretends to show the results of the hard work in pursue for that objective, and the conclusions that could have got...|$|R

A {{total of four}} classical targeted drugs, prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE- 5 Is), and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (sGCS), have been proved to improve exercise capacity and hemodynamics compared to placebo; however, direct head-to-head comparisons of these drugs are lacking. This network meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively compare the efficacy of these targeted drugs for PAH. Methods: Medline, the Cochrane <b>Library,</b> <b>and</b> other <b>Internet</b> sources <b>were</b> searched for randomized clinical trials exploring the efficacy of targeted drugs for patients with PAH. The primary effective end point of this network meta-analysis was a 6 -minute walk distance (6 MWD). Results: Thirty-two eligible trials including 6, 758 patients were identified. There was a statistically significant improvement in 6 MWD, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and clinical worsening events associated {{with each of the}} four targeted drugs compared with placebo. Combination therapy improved 6 MWD by 20. 94 m (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 6. 94, 34. 94; P= 0. 003) vs prostanoids, and 16. 94 m (95 % CI: 4. 41, 29. 47; P= 0. 008) vs ERAs. PDE- 5 Is improved 6 MWD by 17. 28 m (95 % CI: 1. 91, 32. 65; P= 0. 028) vs prostanoids, with a similar result with combination therapy. In addition, combination therapy reduced mean pulmonary artery pressure by 3. 97 mmHg (95 % CI: - 6. 06, - 1. 88; P< 0. 001) vs prostanoids, 8. 24 mmHg (95 % CI: - 10. 71, - 5. 76; P< 0. 001) vs ERAs, 3. 38 mmHg (95 % CI: - 6. 30, - 0. 47; P= 0. 023) vs PDE- 5 Is, and 3. 94 mmHg (95 % CI: - 6. 99, - 0. 88; P= 0. 012) vs sGCS. There {{were no significant differences in}} all-cause mortality and severe adverse events between prostanoids, ERAs, PDE- 5 Is, sGCS, combination therapy, and placebo. Conclusion: All targeted drugs for PAH are associated with improved clinical outcomes, especially combination therapy. However, all these drugs seem to show less favorable effects on survival in the short-term follow-up, suggesting further clinical trials are required.
