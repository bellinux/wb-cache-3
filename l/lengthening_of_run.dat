25|$|Glamorgan Dragons <b>lengthened</b> their <b>run</b> <b>of</b> {{losses to}} four, despite {{requiring}} 22 {{for the last}} seven wickets at Edgbaston. Jamie Troughton's 51 took Warwickshire Bears past 100 after they had lost their first four wickets for 56, and Dougie Brown along with eleven extras gave the hosts a total of 169 for 9. Glamorgan started well, with Sourav Ganguly and Matthew Elliott lifting them to 88 for 1 before leaving in quick succession to Neil Carter and Jonathan Trott respectively. Mike Powell and David Hemp (40 off 19 balls) then built another partnership of 59 to see Glamorgan 147 for 3, but Carter and Brown then shared five wickets as Glamorgan's next five wickets fell for six runs. Powell added 11 with Dean Cosker, but the damage was already done, and Powell was run out on the penultimate ball as they needed six runs from two balls. Adam Harrison needed to hit the final ball for six, but only managed a single.|$|R

40|$|Insufficiency of the {{posterior}} tibial tendon is challenging to treat. When the deformity is flexible, treatment options have included tendon transfer, often {{combined with a}} medial slide calcaneal osteotomy and/or a <b>lengthening</b> <b>of</b> the lateral column. Posterior calcaneal osteotomy {{has been shown to}} give correction, although not full correc-tion. <b>Lengthening</b> <b>of</b> the lateral column also has been shown to give correction and has been used in the more severe flexible deformities, but it involves either fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint or risk of arthritis at this joint. An osteotomy combining the calcaneal medial slide with a <b>lengthening</b> <b>of</b> the lateral column at the same osteotomy site has been tested in the laboratory. This combined osteotomy provides a <b>lengthening</b> <b>of</b> the lat-eral column, but it is positioned away from the calcane-ocuboid joint. In this study, the osteotomy was com-pared with a medial slide calcaneal osteotomy and an Evans <b>lengthening</b> <b>of</b> the lateral column, using a cadaver flatfoot model. Radiographic measurements were made to evaluate correction of the planovalgus deformity after each of these procedures. There was statistically signif-icant improved correction with the new osteotomy com-pared with that in a standard medial slide, and correction was comparable to that in the <b>lengthening</b> <b>of</b> the lateral column. This combined osteotomy may be a reasonable alternative when more correction is desired than can be obtained from a medial slide alone and when the sur-geon wishes to avoid an osteotomy near the calcane-ocuboid joint...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} advantages, knee disarticulations (KDs) {{are rarely}} performed {{because of the}} anticipated KD prosthesis fitting problems that include the positioning of the knee joint distally from the KD socket.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the cosmetic effect of the knee joint in a KD prosthesis by determining the extent <b>of</b> the <b>lengthening</b> <b>of</b> the thigh and the shortening of the shank. This lengthening and shortening were measured through an experimental setup using laser techniques. These measurements were made of 18 knee joints used in KD prostheses. <b>Lengthening</b> <b>of</b> the thigh varied between 23 and 92 mm, and shortening of the shank varied between 3 and 50 mm.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that myofascial force transmission may not be limited by compartmental boundaries of a muscle group to synergists. Muscles of the anterior tibial compartment in rat hindlimb as well as of the neighbouring peroneal compartment (antagonistic muscles) were excited maximally. Length-force data, based on proximal <b>lengthening,</b> <b>of</b> EDL, as well as distal <b>lengthening</b> <b>of</b> the tibial muscles (TA + EHL) and the peroneal muscle group (PER) were collected independently, while keeping the other two muscle groups at a constant muscle-tendon complex length. Simultaneously measured, distal and proximal EDL active forces were found to differ significantly throughout the experiment. The magnitude of this difference and its sign was affected after proximal <b>lengthening</b> <b>of</b> EDL itself, but also of the tibial muscle complex and of the peroneal muscle complex. Proximal <b>lengthening</b> <b>of</b> EDL predominantly affected its synergistic muscles within the anterior crural compartment (force decrease < 4 %). <b>Lengthening</b> <b>of</b> either TA or PER caused a decrease in distal EDL isometric force (by 5 - 6 % of initial force). It is concluded also that mechanisms for mechanical intermuscular interaction extend beyond the limits of muscle compartments in the rat hindlimb. Even antagonistic muscles should not be considered fully independent units of muscular function. Particular, strong mechanical interaction was found between antagonistic tibial anterior muscle and peroneal muscle complexes: <b>Lengthening</b> <b>of</b> the peroneal complex caused tibial complex force to decrease by approximately 25 %, whereas for the reverse a 30 % force decrease was found. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
