A writer from PopSugar criticized Cavallari's [...] "sassy, bad-girl attitude" [...] for lacking originality and preferred Conrad for [...] " [...] it real". Rachel Krasnow from the Weekend Watchers was disappointed in the [...] "overdone" [...] and [...] "ridiculous" [...] scenes involving Cavallari and Brescia, and suggested {{that they had been}} staged by producers. Brian Moylan from Jezebel felt that Conrad's departure [...] "doomed the show" [...] and added that he [...] "just [...] get The Hills" [...] despite [...] " [...] a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>really</b> trashy television".|$|E

There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>really,</b> really, really big movies about robots and things—and there's not a part for a 34-year-old woman in a robot movie." [...] Witherspoon returned with three films released in 2010, 2011 and 2012, all centered on her as a woman caught in a love triangle between two men. In a 2012 interview with MTV, Witherspoon jokingly referred to this trio of films as her [...] "love triangle period".|$|E

BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl said that [...] "the insubordination of Stanley was a necessary plot point to cover" [...] because [...] "without it, too much Stanley being Stanley becomes unbelievable". Furthermore, he wrote that there [...] "was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>really</b> funny stuff tonight" [...] and highlighted [...] "the scene between Darryl and Michael" [...] due to Robinson's acting. Aubry D'Arminio from Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "Mike's embarrassment, and his unwillingness at first to admit he is disliked, was very very well played on Carell's part." [...] Furthermore, D'Arminio praised several of the episode's lines of dialogue and wrote [...] "I cannot even come near to picking a favorite quote [...] for this episode" ...|$|E

And they know {{what you need to}} know so they teach you quite well” (06). This aspect also extended to the “outside world”, helping students appreciate relationships between what happens in the classroom and the real world. When describing one teacher a participant explained that the teacher “doesn’t just tell us the concepts—he sort of extends us. So we’ll talk about a concept and then he’ll give <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>really</b> good real life examples” (13).|$|R
500|$|In 1996, while {{attending}} the successful revival of The King and I, Chinese-American playwright David Henry Hwang considered whether other Rodgers and Hammerstein shows could be revived {{and decided to}} work on Flower Drum Song. [...] To Chinese Americans, the musical [...] "represented political incorrectness incarnate. [...] But [...] had a secret soft spot for the movie version. 'It {{was kind of a}} guilty pleasure ... and one of the only big Hollywood films where you could see a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>really</b> good Asian actors onscreen, singing and dancing and cracking jokes.'" [...] Ted Chapin, president of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, announced that an unnamed [...] "Asian playwright" [...] had approached him about revising Flower Drum Song. [...] Chapin called the musical [...] "a naive, old fashioned, anti-feminist story with a truly great score.... It's one that ... needs changes." [...] Rodgers' will urged his heirs to do what they believed he would have agreed to (Hammerstein's instructions are unknown), but during her lifetime, his widow Dorothy had refused to countenance major changes in the plays. [...] Hwang's involvement was soon revealed, and in 1997, C. Y. Lee announced that the rewrite had his approval.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Anasazi" [...] was rated an A, being described as [...] "mind-blowing if frustrating", with it being noted that the episode [...] "made fans want to fast-forward through summer." [...] Writing The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A-, noting that the episode [...] "has a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>really</b> strong moments" [...] and praising Duchovny's acting. However, {{he felt that the}} episode marked {{the point at which the}} series' overarching mythology would begin to lose focus, explaining that [...] "it's troubling that instead of answering any big issues here ... the show only gives us new directions". Chris Carter said of the episode, [...] "I'm proud of the way it came together, what it did for the series, and the overwhelmingly positive response it has gotten. I'm very pleased beginning season three with where this episode put us—which is that it posed more questions than it answered." [...] He later said in 2005 that the episode brought a lot of interest to the show due to the apparent death of agent Mulder. The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi. Sordi noted that the plotline [...] "laid the groundwork for the mythology arc for the rest of the series", adding that it [...] "brought much more significance to what is to come".|$|E
500|$|An {{ensemble}} of 20 actors {{make up the}} bulk of the series' cast. Hawley found ensembles enticing because they presented [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>really</b> good moving pieces". At Paleyfest 2015, the Fargo creator commented: [...] "It's sort of like a horse race in a way, especially when you know that everyone is on this collision course. It's like, 'Who's going to make it?' And you can put people together in unexpected pairings." [...] Offerman played Karl Weathers, an alcoholic and the only lawyer in Luverne, and Cristin Milioti was assigned the part of Betsy Solverson, Lou's terminally ill wife. Hawley felt that Milioti was the right choice because her personality was similar to her character's. Garrett portrays Joe Bulo, and Bokeem Woodbine appears as Mike Milligan, a role he was offered two days after auditioning. For the role of Hanzee Dent, Hawley hired Zahn McClarnon two weeks after his audition. Six others play members of the Gerhardts: Kieran Culkin as Rye, Rachel Keller as Simone, Michael Hogan as Otto, Allan Dobescu as Charlie, Angus Sampson as Bear, and Jeffrey Donovan as Dodd. When asked about his decision to cast Donovan, Hawley told the actor, [...] "I don't know. You just come off with a sense of power. I think Dodd comes off with a sense of power, and I thought that you have the chops to find the humor in it." [...] Donovan gained 30 pounds in preparation for his role. Other major supporting roles in Fargo second season include: Bruce Campbell as Ronald Reagan, Keir O'Donnell as Ben Schmidt, and Elizabeth Marvel as Constance Heck.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than thirty}} years after The Naked Civil Servant, Hurt reprised the role of Quentin Crisp in the 2009 film An Englishman in New York. This {{television}} film depicts Crisp's later years in New York. He returned to Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, playing the on-screen Big Brother for the Paper Zoo Theatre Company's stage adaptation of the novel in June 2009. The theatre production premiered at the National Media Museum, in Bradford and toured during 2010. Hurt said, [...] "I think Paper Zoo {{thought it would be}} quite ironic to have the person who played Winston having risen in the party. From the Chestnut Tree Cafe, he's managed to get his wits together again, now understanding that 2 and 2 make 5, and becomes Big Brother. So it tickled my fancy, and of course I looked up Paper Zoo, and they seem to me to be the sort of company that's essential in the country as we know it, and doing a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>really</b> good stuff." ...|$|E

It doesn't seem like a crazy price to me. But again, I have no idea what the proper margins are. If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is. But if they don't, I totally understand. There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>really</b> cool stuff. What I'm hoping is that as time goes on... These things are still {{going to be on the}} shelf, it's not like we're taking it away. Maybe they don't buy it day one, but maybe they buy it in February? Maybe they buy it in March?
