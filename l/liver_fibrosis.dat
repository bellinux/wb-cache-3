5|$|The {{infectious}} disease hepatitis C {{is caused by}} the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which affects the liver and is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood. The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can cause inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis). This condition can progress to scarring of the <b>liver</b> (<b>fibrosis),</b> and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E

40|$|Context Limited {{clinical}} {{data suggest}} Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection {{may contribute to}} nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Objectives The effect of Hp eradication on hepatic steatosis (magnetic resonance imaging), nonalcoholic fatty <b>liver</b> disease <b>fibrosis</b> score and HSENSI (Homocysteine, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Index) in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients. Methods Thirteen adult patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, asymptomatic for gastrointestinal disease, underwent 13 C urea breath test; Hp positive patients received eradication therapy until repeat test become negative. Hepatic fat fraction, standard biochemical tests and calculation of nonalcoholic fatty <b>liver</b> disease <b>fibrosis</b> score and HSENSI were performed at baseline and month 12. Results Hepatic fat fraction was similar for between and within group comparisons. Nonalcoholic fatty <b>liver</b> disease <b>fibrosis</b> score showed a non-significant trend towards decrease in Hp(+) [- 0. 34 (- 1. 39 - 0. 29) at baseline and - 0. 24 (- 0. 99 - 0. 71) at month 12; P = 0. 116], whereas increase in Hp(-) group [- 0. 38 (- 1. 72 - 0. 11) and - 0. 56 (- 1. 43 - 0. 46), respectively; P = 0. 249]. HSENSI was significantly decreased only in Hp(+) group [1. 0 (1. 0 - 2. 0) at baseline and 1. 0 (0 - 1. 0) at month 12; P = 0. 048]. Conclusions Hp eradication had no long-term effect on hepatic steatosis, but showed a trend towards improvement in nonalcoholic fatty <b>liver</b> disease <b>fibrosis</b> score and HSENSI. These results warrant larger studies with paired biopsies...|$|R
30|$|In {{response}} to acute <b>liver</b> injury <b>fibrosis</b> arises {{as part of}} an attempted wound-healing response that aims to maintain organ structure and integrity [16]. However, in chronic <b>liver</b> injury prolonged <b>fibrosis</b> leads to a progressive tissue scaring process ending up in remodeling of the liver tissue structure. Ultimately, hepatic fibrosis can lead to liver cirrhosis and end stage liver disease. Moreover, cirrhosis is the major risk factor for HCC. A recent assessment of liver cirrhosis mortality led to a global estimate of just over one million deaths in 2010 which was approximately 2  % of all deaths [3, 103].|$|R

MethodsA total of 179 people with Type 2 diabetes were included in this study. Liver fat content (assessed using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy), fatty liver index score, non-alcoholic fatty <b>liver</b> disease <b>fibrosis</b> score, and SteatoTest and FibroTest scores were determined. ResultsAccording to proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 68. 7 % of participants had steatosis (liver fat content > 5. 5 %). The application of the guidelines using several combinations (fatty liver index + non-alcoholic fatty <b>liver</b> disease <b>fibrosis</b> scores, Steatotest + FibroTest scores, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy + non-alcoholic fatty <b>liver</b> disease <b>fibrosis</b> score, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy + FibroTest) resulted in a referral to a liver clinic for 33. 5 – 84. 9 % people with Type 2 diabetes. ConclusionsThe application of these new algorithms for the diagnosis, and follow-up of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease would lead to an excessive number of people with Type 2 diabetes being referred to a liver clinic. We suggest that new clinical and/or biological biomarkers of steatosis and fibrosis be specifically validated in people with Type 2 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Macrophages play a {{key role}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of <b>liver</b> granuloma and <b>fibrosis</b> in schistosomiasis. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully characterized. This study revealed that the macrophages infiltrating the liver tissues in a murine model of Schistosoma japonica infection exhibited M 2 functional polarization, and Notch 1 /Jagged 1 signaling was significantly upregulated in the M 2 polarized macrophages in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the blockade of Notch signaling pathway by a γ-secretase inhibitor could reverse macrophage M 2 polarization in vitro and alleviate <b>liver</b> granuloma and <b>fibrosis</b> in the murine model of schistosomiasis. These results implied that the Notch 1 /Jagged 1 signaling-dependent M 2 polarization of macrophages might play an important role in <b>liver</b> granuloma and <b>fibrosis</b> in schistosomiasis, and the inhibition of Notch 1 /Jagged 1 signaling might provide a novel therapeutic approach to administrate patients with schistosomiasis...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{lifestyle}} and environmental conditions {{give rise to}} an increasing prevalence of <b>liver</b> and lung <b>fibrosis,</b> and both have a poor prognosis. Promising results have been reported for recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) protein administration in experimental <b>liver</b> and lung <b>fibrosis.</b> However, the full potential of ACE 2 may be achieved by localized translation of a membrane-anchored form. For this purpose, we advanced the latest RNA technology for liver- and lung-targeted ACE 2 translation. We demonstrated in vitro that transfection with ACE 2 chemically modified messenger RNA (cmRNA) leads to robust translation of fully matured, membrane-anchored ACE 2 protein. In a second step, we designed eight modified ACE 2 cmRNA sequences and identified a lead sequence for in vivo application. Finally, formulation of this ACE 2 cmRNA in tailor-made lipidoid nanoparticles and in lipid nanoparticles led to liver- and lung-targeted translation of significant amounts of ACE 2 protein, respectively. In summary, we provide evidence that RNA transcript therapy (RTT) is a promising approach for ACE 2 -based treatment of <b>liver</b> and lung <b>fibrosis</b> to be tested in fibrotic disease models...|$|R

2500|$|Alcoholic {{hepatitis}} {{is characterized}} by the inflammation of hepatocytes. Between 10% and 35% of heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis (NIAAA, 1993). [...] While development of hepatitis is not directly related to the dose of alcohol, some people seem more prone to this reaction than others. [...] This is called alcoholic steato necrosis and the inflammation appears to predispose to <b>liver</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL8) are thought to be essential in the initiation and perpetuation of liver injury by inducing apoptosis and necrosis. One possible mechanism for the increased activity of TNF-α is the increased intestinal permeability due to liver disease. This facilitates the absorption of the gut-produced endotoxin into the portal circulation. The Kupffer cells of the liver then phagocytose endotoxin, stimulating the release of TNF-α. TNF-α then triggers apoptotic pathways through the activation of caspases, resulting in cell death.|$|E
40|$|Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are {{the main}} collagen-producing cells in liver fibrogenesis. With the purpose to analyze their {{presence}} and relevance in predicting <b>liver</b> allograft <b>fibrosis</b> development, 162 <b>liver</b> biopsies of 54 pediatric liver transplant (LT) recipients were assessed at 6 months, 3 and 7 years post-LT. METHODS: The proportion of activated HSCs, identified by α-smooth muscle actin (ASMA) immunostaining {{and the amount of}} fibrosis, identified by PicroSirious-red staining (PSR%), were determined by computer-based morphometric analysis. Fibrosis was also staged by using the semiquantitative <b>liver</b> allograft <b>fibrosis</b> score (LAFSc), specifically designed to score fibrosis in the pediatric LT population. RESULTS: <b>Liver</b> allograft <b>fibrosis</b> displayed progression along the time by PSR%, (p< 0. 001) and by LAFSc, (p< 0. 001). The ASMA expression decreased in the long-term, with inverse evolution respect to fibrosis (p< 0. 01). Patients with ASMA-positive HSCs area[*]≥[*] 8 % at 6 months (n= 20) developed higher fibrosis proportion compared to those with ASMA-positive HSCs area[*]≤[*] 8 % (n= 34) at the same period of time and in the long-term (p= 0. 03 and p< 0. 01, respectively), but not at 3 years (p= 0. 8). ASMA expression[*]≥[*] 8 % at 6 months, was found as independent risk factor for 7 years-fibrosis development by PSR% (r 2 = 0. 5, p< 0. 01) and by LAFSc (r 2 = 0. 3, p= 0. 03). Further, ASMA expression[*]≥[*] 8 % at 3 years showed association with the development of fibrosis at 7 years (p= 0. 02). CONCLUSION: There is a high proportion of activated HSCs in pediatric LT recipients. ASMA[*]≥[*] 8 % at 6 months seems to be a risk factor for early and long-term fibrosis development. In addition, Activated HSCs showed inverse evolution respect to fibrosis in the long-term. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{analysed}} the Trent Hepatitis C cohort {{to determine}} standardised mortality ratios in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), {{and to identify}} risk factors and associations with all-cause and liver-related mortality. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Patients with HCV infection attending secondary care within the Trent region of England. Patients: 2285 patients with hepatitis C, followed for 1 year or more. Main outcome measures: The death rate in the cohort was compared to that seen in an age- and sex-matched English population. We performed Cox regression analyses to identify factors predictive of all-cause mortality and deaths from liver disease. Results: Standardised mortality ratios in the cohort were three times higher than those expected {{in the general population}} of England. The excess deaths were due to liver-related causes and those associated with a drug-using lifestyle. Significant independent predictors of all-cause mortality were age, sex, treatment (protective) and <b>liver</b> biopsy <b>fibrosis.</b> Age, treatment, <b>liver</b> biopsy <b>fibrosis</b> and mean alcohol consumption were predictors of liver-related mortality.

40|$|While {{the immune}} {{pathogenesis}} caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection {{has been studied}} extensively, {{little is known about}} direct pathogenic effects of HBV surface proteins. Here, we have investigated pathological cellular effects of HBV surface protein expression in the liver of transgenic mice with different genetic background. The impact of HBV surface protein expression on the liver was studied in two mouse strains, BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6. Histology and hydroxyproline assays were performed to investigate <b>liver</b> morphology and <b>fibrosis.</b> Gene expression and signaling were analyzed by microarray, qPCR and Western blotting. Expression of HBV surface proteins in the liver of transgenic mice induced activation of protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF 2 α) phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of eIF 2 α resulted in activation of the ER stress markers glucose regulated protein (GRP) 78 and pro-apoptotic C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in transgenic mice on BALB/c genetic background leading to stronger <b>liver</b> injury and <b>fibrosis</b> in comparison with transgenic mice on C 57 BL/ 6 background. Hepatic stellate cells represented the main collagen-producing liver cells in HBV transgenic mice. The key regulators of hepatocyte proliferation, transcription factors c-Jun and STAT 3 were activated in HBV transgenic mice. Tumour incidence in transgenic mice was strain- and sex-dependent.
