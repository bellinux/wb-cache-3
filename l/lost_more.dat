5|$|Balzac {{suffered}} from health problems throughout his life, possibly {{due to his}} intense writing schedule. His relationship with his family was often strained by financial and personal drama, and he <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than one friend over critical reviews. In 1850, Balzac married Ewelina Hańska, a Polish aristocrat and his longtime love; he died in Paris five months later.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht had <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than {{a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided {{to remain in the}} city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy casualties. The Polish {{casualties were}} particularly severe. In {{a relatively short}} time the Polish Second Army <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total). Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead). Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000. According to Polish historian Zbigniew Wawer, this was the most bloody battle that the Polish Army had been involved in since the battle of Bzura in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Debates over {{rules and}} {{schedules}} {{might have been}} solvable had the league achieved economic stability but losses amongst American teams were drastic and widespread. In 1995 alone, Fred Anderson estimated that the U.S. teams had collectively <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than US$20 million. The Baltimore Sun provides a similar estimate of US$21 million. The $10 million estimated loss in Birmingham was the most substantial, followed by US$4 to $6 million estimated for Anderson's Texans. Memphis and Shreveport losses were estimated at about US$3 million apiece. The Baltimore losses were comparatively modest at US$1 to $1.5 million, but stung the league given {{the prestige of the}} franchise.|$|E
5|$|During World War I many Shetlanders {{served in}} the Gordon Highlanders, a further 3,000 {{served in the}} Merchant Navy, and more than 1,500 in a special local naval reserve. The 10th Cruiser Squadron was {{stationed}} at Swarbacks Minn (the stretch of water {{to the south of}} Muckle Roe), and during a single year from March 1917 more than 4,500 ships sailed from Lerwick as part of an escorted convoy system. In total, Shetland <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than 500 men, a higher proportion than any other part of Britain, and there were further waves of emigration in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E
5|$|Endara's term {{in office}} saw marked {{economic}} recovery from the nation's years of military rule. During his presidency, Panama had an average annual economic growth of 8%. However, unemployment also rose near 19%. In February 1990, the overweight Endara began a hunger strike in the Metropolitan Cathedral {{to call attention to}} the nation's poverty and to pressure US President George H. W. Bush to dispense previously pledged American aid. In the course of the strike, he <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than thirty of his two hundred and sixty pounds.|$|E
5|$|First-class cricket resumed in 1945–46 {{after the}} Allied victory, and Brown began the post-war phase {{of his career}} with a steady season, scoring 604 runs at 46.46 with five half-centuries in seven matches. This placed him second to Sid Barnes in the run-scoring aggregates. His best effort was a 98 against South Australia, denied a century by a run out. Queensland <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than they won, with two {{victories}} and three losses. At {{the end of the}} season, Brown captained an Australian side on a tour of New Zealand, and all five matches resulted in convincing victories.|$|E

After his release and rehabilitation, he joined the Special Air Service (SAS) and went on to serve in various conflicts around the world, hunting communist guerrillas in Malaya, suppressing rebellions in Oman and Aden, and conducting deniable cross-border reconnaissance and raids during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation.|$|E
5|$|He {{was named}} {{manager of the}} team in 1905, but did not receive {{additional}} pay; he was, however, offered a bonus if the team didn't lose money. In 1905, Tenney tried to sign William Clarence Matthews, an African-American middle infielder from Harvard University, to a contract. Tenney later retracted his offer due to pressure from MLB players. Defensively, he led the majors in errors committed by a first baseman and finished second in most putouts for any position. Tenney led the 1906 Beaneaters to a 49–102 record. For the second straight year, the Boston team <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than 100 games.|$|E

Washington sent reinforcements under General John Cadwalader, which were successful in driving Mawhood and the British from Princeton, with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton.

He did, however, win the Madrid Masters after Nishikori got injured while dominating Nadal 6–2, 4–2 in that final. Nadal went on to defend his French Open title, defeating Murray in the semi-final and Djokovic in the final.|$|E

Tallon also made seven dismissals for the match.

As in 1993, Well Dunn <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> matches than they won in each series, but they had occasional victories against established tag teams and were often booked to defeat jobber tag teams.|$|E
5|$|At Dürenstein a {{combined}} force of Russian and Austrian troops trapped a French division commanded by Théodore Maxime Gazan. The French division {{was part of}} the newly created VIII Corps, the so-called Corps Mortier, under command of Édouard Mortier. In pursuing the Austrian retreat from Bavaria, Mortier had over-extended his three divisions along the north bank of the Danube. Mikhail Kutuzov, commander of the Coalition force, enticed Mortier to send Gazan's division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns. They were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division, under command of Pierre Dupont de l'Étang. The battle extended well into the night, after which both sides claimed victory. The French <b>lost</b> <b>more</b> than a third of their participants, and Gazan's division experienced over 40percent losses. The Austrians and Russians also had heavy losses—close to 16percent—but perhaps the most significant was the death in action of Johann Heinrich von Schmitt, one of Austria's most capable chiefs of staff.|$|E
