Measuring the organic solvent concentrations in working environments and breathing zone air, and the noise level in workplaces were also done. The readings suggested that most exposures to organic solvents and/or noise were within the occupational exposure limits. The prevalence rate of the upper <b>limit</b> of <b>hearing</b> below 75 th percentile curve was higher in workers exposed to organic solvents and noise than expected (25 percent) and the other groups, whereas it was about 25 percent in the noise and control groups.

AimTo establish the prevalence of hearing impairment in infants at risk, born between June 2006 and July 2008, and to correlate the variables with hearing loss. Type of studydescriptive and cross-sectional. Materials and Methods 188 newborns were evaluated using evoked otoacoustic emissions and distortion product and auditory behavior. Tests were repeated if the results were altered. If altered results persisted, the child was referred for impedance testing and, when necessary, for medical evaluation. Infants with normal conduction were referred for {{brainstem auditory evoked potential}} testing. ResultsOf 188 children two (1. 1 %) were excluded, and 174 (92. 6 %) had results within normal <b>limits.</b> <b>Hearing</b> impairment was found in 12 children (6. 3 %); hearing loss was retrocochlear in three infants (25 %). Unilateral hearing loss was present in two infants (16. 7 %); bilateral hearing loss was present in 10 infants (83. 3 %).

Researchers have tried to understand the evolution of LF and infrasonic hearing in mysticetes by linking {{the shape of the}} inner ear cochlea or individual cochlear measurements to known hearing frequencies and making inferences to extinct species. Using landmark-based shape analysis of complete cochlear coiling, we show that cochlear coiling shape correlates with LF and high-frequency (HF; >  10  kHz) <b>hearing</b> <b>limits</b> in cetaceans. Very LF ([*]≤[*]  50  Hz) and infrasonic hearing are associated with, for example, a protruding second turn, a descending apex, and a high number of turns. Correlations between cochlear and cranial variables and cochlear and cranial shape indicate that low LF <b>hearing</b> <b>limits</b> are furthermore connected to longer cochleae and relatively larger cranial widths. Very LF hearing in Mysticeti appeared in the middle Miocene, and mysticete infrasonic hearing had evolved by the late Miocene.

5000|$|Malling-Hansen's {{period as}} a {{principal}} at the Royal Institute for the Deaf, from 1865 to 1890, {{was a period of}} change and new ideas. Malling-Hansen very soon understood that the teaching of deaf-mutes was ineffective because of the large variation of the pupils' abilities. Some of them were totally deaf and had no speech ability, and some were what we today would call mentally retarded. Others had a slight hearing ability, and could also speak. From Malling-Hansen came, in 1867, a proposal to divide the pupils into 3 different groups, depending on their abilities. Malling-Hansen also saw to it that the newest pedagogical method, the speech method (reading of the lips) was put into use for the group called the not originally deaf; those who had a <b>limited</b> <b>hearing</b> ability and could also speak. The sign method was still to be used when teaching the group called the originally deaf, those who had no hearing ability and no language, and the mentally retarded. Together with the Keller Institutions, the Royal Institute divided these groups between them. The Institute was to educate the originally deaf, and the Keller Institutions the not originally deaf and the mentally retarded.|$|E

40|$|The ontogenetic {{development}} of acoustic communication {{has so far}} only been investigated in one fish species. In order to determine whether detectability of conspecific sounds changes during growth in a species with <b>limited</b> <b>hearing</b> abilities (generalist), we investigated the {{development of}} auditory sensitivity and agonistic vocalizations in the Lusitanian toadfish Halobatrachus didactylus. Agonistic grunts were recorded, their sound pressure levels determined, and auditory sensitivities measured in five different size groups ranging from 3 to 32 ·cm standard length. Hearing thresholds were obtained using the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) recording technique. Dominant frequency, sound duration and number of pulses decreased, whereas pulse period and sound level increased with increasing fish size. The best hearing was below 300 ·Hz in all groups. Lower hearing sensitivity {{was found in the}} smallest juveniles at 100 ·Hz as well as at higher frequencies (800 and 1000 ·Hz). Comparisons between audiograms and sound spectra within the same-sized fish revealed that smaller juveniles would be barely able to detect agonistic grunts, while these vocalizations were clearly perceived by larger fish. In the latter, the main energy of sounds was found at the most sensitive frequencies. This study demonstrates that acoustic communication in the Lusitanian toadfish might be absent in early developmental stages and seems to start when juveniles are able to generate grunts of higher sound level and lower dominant frequency...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{a public}} concern of {{the health effects of}} the {{extensive}} use of mobile phone. Many studies were conducted producing controversial results. Very few studies were performed in the Middle East. Objective: To study the effects of the mobile phone on the hearing function of the users. Method: Forty-eight Students aged 18 - 23 years old were divided into three groups. They were investigated from September 2005 till October 2007. Group one 16 girls who have used mobile phones frequently and spoken approximately 3 - 4 hours per day for two years. Group two 16 girls who have used mobile phones for 1 - 2 hours per day for two years. Group three 16 girls who have never used mobile phones (control group). Medical history was obtained and pure tone was performed. Result: Examination showed that four students from group one had reported ear pain, headache, tinnitus, weddings noise, and party noise in the used ear and only one from group two suffered from tinnitus and headache. While two from group three suffered from tinnitus. Conclusion: Our findings, conducted on small number of individuals for limited period, showed that high degree of <b>limited</b> <b>hearing</b> loss might be associated with long-term use of the mobile phones. However, the possibility remains that there could be other health effects and that we need to conduct further study on larger number of individuals and for a longer period. ...|$|E
40|$|Macaca fuscata) were {{assessed}} {{before and after}} receiving two-stage bilateral lesions of auditory cortex. Thresholds {{were assessed}} for each ear {{with the use of}} insertion earphones. 2. The bilateral lesions resulted in a large initial hearing loss followed by partial recovery that left the animals with a perma-nent hearing loss in both ears. 3. The initial hearing loss consisted of a total insensitivity to sound in the ear contralateral to the second lesion with <b>limited</b> <b>hearing</b> in the other ear. However, the animal with the most complete lesion was initially unable to hear sound in either ear. Broadband noise was often more effective in eliciting a behavioral response than tones. 4. Partial recovery occurred in all animals and was observed as early as the first week after surgery. Most of this recovery occurred during the first 3 - 7 wk after surgery. This rapid phase of recovery was sometimes followed by a more gradual phase although thresh-olds were still elevated after 94 wk. 5. The permanent hearing loss, which averaged from 30 to 44 dB, was not constant across frequency. Threshold shifts were smallest at 63 Hz and progressively increased with frequency to a maximum loss from 8 to 25 kHz with slightly less loss at 32 kHz. 6. Analysis of the psychophysical functions and threshold sta-bility gave no indication of any nonsensory deficits in attention or vigilance. 7. These results, taken with those of previous experiments, in-dicate that each hemisphere is primarily involved in the detection of sound in the contralateral ear and secondarily involved in de-tection in the ipsilateral ear. This arrangement differs from that seen in sound localization where each hemisphere is involved with the contralateral hemifield as opposed to the contralateral ear. Thus it appears that the functional organization of auditory cortex for sound localization is different from that for the detec-tion and identification of sound itself...|$|E
