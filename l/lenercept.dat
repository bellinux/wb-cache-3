40|$|OBJECTIVE: Phase III {{study to}} confirm a trend {{observed}} in a previous phase II study showing that a single dose of <b>lenercept,</b> human recombinant p 55 tumor necrosis factor receptor-immunoglobulin G 1 (TNFR 55 -IgG 1) fusion protein, decreased mortality in patients with severe sepsis or early septic shock. DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, phase III, placebo-controlled, randomized study. SETTING: A total of 108 community and university-affiliated hospitals in the United States (60), Canada (6) and Europe (42). PATIENTS: A total of 1, 342 patients were recruited who fulfilled the entry criteria within the 12 -hr period preceding the study drug administration. INTERVENTION: After randomization, an intravenous dose of 0. 125 mg/kg <b>lenercept</b> or placebo was given. The patient was monitored for up to 28 days, during which standard diagnostic, supportive, and therapeutic care was provided. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was 28 -day all-cause mortality. Baseline characteristics were as follows: a total of 1, 342 patients were randomized; 662 received <b>lenercept</b> and 680 received placebo. The mean age was 60. 5 yrs (range, 17 - 96 yrs); 39 % were female; 65 % had medical admissions, 8 % had scheduled surgical admissions, and 27 % had unscheduled surgical admissions; 73 % had severe sepsis without shock, and 27 % had severe sepsis with early septic shock. <b>Lenercept</b> and placebo groups were similar at baseline with respect to demographic characteristics, simplified acute physiology score II-predicted mortality, profiles of clinical site of infection and microbiological documentation, number of dysfunctioning organs, and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) plasma concentration. <b>Lenercept</b> pharmacokinetics were similar in severe sepsis and early septic shock patients. Tumor necrosis factor was bound in a stable manner to <b>lenercept</b> as reflected by the accumulation of total serum tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations. There were 369 deaths, 177 on <b>lenercept</b> (27 % mortality) and 192 on placebo (28 % mortality). A one-sided Cochran-Armitage test, stratified by geographic region and baseline, predicted 28 -day all-cause mortality (simplified acute physiology score II), gave a p value of. 141 (one-sided). <b>Lenercept</b> treatment {{had no effect on}} incidence or resolution of organ dysfunctions. There was no evidence that <b>lenercept</b> was detrimental in the overall population. CONCLUSION: <b>Lenercept</b> had no significant effect on mortality in the study population...|$|E

40|$|Signaling {{molecules}} of immune system are cytokines that may either stimulate or suppress {{the responses of}} various cells involved in host immune mechanisms and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) {{is one of the}} leading members of the group of cytokines. TNF-α from activated macrophages and LT-α/TNF-Β from T cells have now become representatives of a distinctive superfamily of cytokine ligands (TNF ligand superfamily) along with their corresponding receptors (TNF receptor superfamily); altogether constituting the TNF Superfamily. These are highly conserved proteins, found in all mammals having important ligand members which interact with the either of the two receptors, TNFR 1 and TNFR 2, that initiate varied signaling cascades leading to diverse cellular responses. It has been established that the appropriate regulation of TNF ligand and receptor interactions and functions are crucial for the proper immune system activity. Excessive production of various TNF cytokines has been attributed with the development of an array of autoimmune as well as inflammatory conditions. TNF cytokines help to reduce mortality due to cardiovascular diseases. Therapeutic TNF blockers include:monoclonal antibodies to TNF (Infliximab and Adalumimab) and TNF receptor fusion proteins (Etanercept and <b>Lenercept)</b> and are effective against rheumatoid arthritis; ankylosing spondylitis; psoriasis and asthma. Preclinical studies conducted in murine models and the pivotal role played by the TNF superfamily in cytokine mediator system will make it easier for researchers as well as scientists to develop novel drugs in near future. This review has covered all these aspects concerning TNF as mediator of inflammatory diseases and its therapeutic targeting...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{an important}} cause of progressive neurological disability, typically commencing in early adulthood. There {{is a need for}} safe and effective therapy to prevent the progressive central nervous system (CNS) damage and resultant disability that characterize the disease course. Increasing evidence supports a chronic autoimmune basis for CNS damage in MS. In the present study, we review current concepts of autoimmune pathogenesis in MS, assess current therapies aimed at countering autoimmune attack and discuss potential therapeutic strategies. Among currently available therapies, beta_interferon and glatiramer acetate have a modest effect on reducing relapses and slowing the accumulation of disability in relapsing-remitting MS. Beta_interferon is of doubtful efficacy in secondary progressive MS and appears to aggravate primary progressive MS, possibly by increasing antibody-mediated CNS damage through inhibition of B-cell apoptosis. Mitoxantrone may reduce relapses and slow disability progression in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS, but its use is limited by the risk of cardiomyopathy. There are currently no effective treatments for primary progressive MS. Many therapies that are effective in the animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are either ineffective in MS or [...] in the case of gamma_interferon, <b>lenercept</b> and altered peptide ligands [...] actually make MS worse. This discrepancy may be explained by the occurrence in MS of defects in immunoregulatory mechanisms, the integrity of which is essential for the efficacy of these treatments in EAE. It is likely that the development of safe, effective therapy for MS will depend on a better understanding of immunoregulatory defects in MS...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapy for}} {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) {{has changed dramatically}} over the past decade. Recent immunobiological findings and current pathophysiological concepts together with advances in biotechnology, improvements in clinical trial design and development of magnetic resonance imaging {{have led to a}} variety of evaluable therapeutic approaches in MS. However, in contrast to the successfully introduced and established immunomodulatory therapies (e. g. interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate), there have been a remarkable number of therapeutic failures as well. Despite convincing immunological concepts, impressive data from animal models and promising results from phase I/II studies, the drugs and strategies investigated showed no benefit or even turned out to have unexpectedly severe adverse effects. Although to date there is no uniformly accepted model for MS, there is agreement on the significance of inflammatory events mediated by autoreactive T cells in the CNS. These can be modified therapeutically at the individual steps of a hypothetical pathogenetic cascade. Crucial corners like: (i) the prevalence and peripheral activation of CNS-autoreactive T cells in the periphery; (ii) adhesion and penetration of T cells into the CNS; (iii) local activation and proliferation and; (iv) de- and remyelination processes can be targeted through their putative mediators. Like a 'specificity pyramid', therapeutic approaches therefore cover from general immunosuppression up to specific targeting of T-cell receptor peptide major histocompatibility (MHC) complex. We discuss in detail clinical MS trials that failed or were discontinued for other reasons. These trials include cytokine modulators [tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha antagonists, interleukin- 10, interleukin- 4, transforming growth factor-beta 2], immunosuppressive agents (roquininex, gusperimus, sulfasalazine, cladribine), inducers of remyelination [intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) ], antigen- derived therapies [oral tolerance, altered peptide ligands (APL), MHC-Peptide blockade], T cell and T-cell receptor directed therapies (T cell vaccination, T-cell receptor peptide vaccination), monoclonal antibodies against leucocyte differentiation molecules (anti-CD 3, anti-CD 4), and inactivation of circulating T cells (extracorporeal photopheresis). The main conclusions that can be drawn from these 'negative' experiences Lire as follows. Theoretically promising agents may paradoxically increase disease activity (<b>lenercept,</b> inflixiniab), be associated with unforeseen adverse effects (e. g. roquinimex) or short-term favourable trends may reverse with prolonged follow-up (e. g. sulfasalzine). One should not be too enthusiastic about successful trials in animal models (TNFalpha blockers; oral tolerance; remyelinating effect of IVIg) nor be irritated by non-scientific media hype (deoxyspergualine; bone marrow transplantation). More selectivity can imply less efficacy (APL, superselective interventions like T-cell receptor vaccination) and antigen- related therapies can stimulate rather than inhibit encephalitogenic cells. Failed strategies are of high importance for a critical revision of assumed immunopathological mechanisms, their neuroimaging correlates, and for future trial design. Since failed trials add to our growing understanding of multiple sclerosis, 'misses' are nearly as important to the scientific process as the 'hits'...|$|E
