2500|$|From Middleton {{the path}} ascends Teesdale {{on the right}} bank of the River Tees, below the village of Holwick. It passes the waterfalls of <b>Low</b> <b>Force</b> and High Force, and reaches the {{scattered}} settlement of Forest-in-Teesdale. Further up the Tees, the path climbs beside the waterfall of Cauldron Snout below the dam of Cow Green Reservoir. The trail then ascends the gently rising side valley of Maize Beck to reach High Cup Nick, {{one of the most}} photographed places on the Pennine Way. From High Cup the trail descends to the village of Dufton.|$|E
2500|$|A type of {{electric}} propulsion, spacecraft such as Dawn use an ion engine. In an ion engine, electric power {{is used to}} create charged particles of the fuel, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets {{is limited by the}} chemical energy stored in the fuel’s molecular bonds, which limits the thrust to about 5km/s. [...] This gives them power (for lift-off from Earth, for example) but limits the top speed. By contrast, ion engines have <b>low</b> <b>force,</b> but the top speed in principle is limited only by the electrical power available on the spacecraft and on the gas ions being accelerated. The exhaust speed of the charged particles range from 15km/s to 35km/s.|$|E

The patient had been well until 4 weeks earlier, when she developed an upper respiratory tract infection characterized by sinus conges-tion, sore throat, nonproductive cough, and low-grade fe-vers. Her symptoms all resolved {{after a few days}} except for the cough, which was persistent and raised concern about residual bronchial hyperresponsiveness, so spirom-etry with bronchodilator testing was conducted (Table 1 and Fig. 1).

2500|$|A {{hammer drill}} has a {{specially}} designed clutch that allows it to not only spin the drill bit, but also to punch it in and out (along the axis of the bit). The actual distance the bit travels in and out and the force of its blow are both very small, and the hammering action is very rapid—thousands of [...] "BPM" [...] (blows per minute) or [...] "IPM" [...] (impacts per minute). Although each blow is of relatively <b>low</b> <b>force,</b> these thousands of blows per minute are more than adequate to break up concrete or brick, using the masonry drill bit's carbide wedge to pulverize it for the spiral flutes to whisk away. For this reason, a hammer drill drills much faster than a regular drill through concrete or brick. Holes in hard materials are needed for anchor bolts, concrete screws and wall plugs.|$|E

25|$|Flow-enhanced cell {{adhesion}} {{is still an}} unexplained phenomenon that could result from a transport-dependent increase in on-rates or a force-dependent decrease in off-rates of adhesive bonds. L-selectin requires a particular minimum of shear to sustain leukocyte rolling on P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and other vascular ligands. It has been hypothesized that <b>low</b> <b>forces</b> decrease L-selectin–PSGL-1 off-rates (catch bonds), whereas higher forces increase off-rates (slip bonds).|$|R

50|$|Vibe is {{the latest}} marker in Smart Part's low cost lineup, as it was {{released}} {{at the same time}} as the SP1, the EOS, and the Ion XE. It is an electropneumatic marker operating at approximately 180 PSI, similar to that of the Ion. It is also extremely inexpensive for an electropneumatic marker - it can be bought for $140. It doesn't include eyes, instead it has a <b>low</b> <b>force</b> bolt. With the <b>low</b> <b>force</b> bolt - chopping is nearly eliminated. The newer Vibe has 4 firing modes; tournament lock semi auto, semi auto, 3 shot burst, and fully automatic. The first batch of Vibes didn't include these modes and because of the upgrade so close after the release - Smart Parts will upgrade your non select fire board free of charge.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of eccentric exercise on the ability to exert steady submaximal forces with muscles that cross the elbow joint. Eight subjects performed two tasks requiring isometric contraction of the right elbow flexors: a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and a constant-force task at four submaximal target forces (5, 20, 35, 50 % MVC) while electromyography (EMG) was recorded from elbow flexor and extensor muscles. These tasks were performed before, after, and 24 h after a period of eccentric (fatigue and muscle damage) or concentric exercise (fatigue only). MVC force declined after eccentric exercise (45 % decline) and remained depressed 24 h later (24 %), whereas the reduced force after concentric exercise (22 %) fully recovered the following day. EMG amplitude during the submaximal contractions increased in all elbow flexor muscles after eccentric exercise, with the greatest change in the biceps brachii at <b>low</b> <b>forces</b> (3 - 4 times larger at 5 and 20 % MVC) and in the brachialis muscle at moderate forces (2 times larger at 35 and 50 % MVC). Eccentric exercise resulted in a twofold increase in coactivation of the triceps brachii muscle during all submaximal contractions. Force fluctuations were larger after eccentric exercise, particularly at <b>low</b> <b>forces</b> (3 - 4 times larger at 5 % MVC, 2 times larger at 50 % MVC), with a twofold increase in physiological tremor at 8 - 12 Hz. These data indicate that eccentric exercise results in impaired motor control and altered neural drive to elbow flexor muscles, particularly at <b>low</b> <b>forces,</b> suggesting altered motor unit activation after eccentric exercise...|$|R
