50|$|The <b>lackey</b> <b>moth</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} across Europe, Asia and North Africa. Its habitat is {{the edges of}} woodland, bushy grassland, coppices, hedgerows and road verges. The caterpillar's food plants include apple, pear, plum, willow, hornbeam, lime and oak.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lackey</b> <b>moth</b> (Malacosoma neustria) {{is common}} across {{southern}} Britain and central Europe. Malacosoma species are notable for their caterpillars which are brightly coloured and form silken tents to regulate their temperature. Malacosoma neustria caterpillars are brown with blue, orange and white stripes. The adults are a fairly uniform brown. The larvae feed mainly on {{trees and shrubs}} from within their tents.|$|E
50|$|Malacosoma castrense (or Malacosoma castrensis), {{the ground}} <b>lackey,</b> is a <b>moth</b> {{of the family}} Lasiocampidae. It is a tent {{caterpillar}} found in Europe.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} salt marsh, {{intertidal}} mud, grazing marsh {{and a fresh}} water reservoir. The salt marsh has scarce species including lax-flowered sea-lavender and One-flowered Glasswort. Rough grass has dense populations of the nationally scarce Roesel's Bush-cricket. The site is internationally important for wintering dark-bellied brent geese, and nationally important for black-tailed godwits, shelducks and shoveler ducks. There are Red Data Book species of invertebrates such as the ground <b>lackey</b> <b>moth.</b>|$|E
50|$|Eggs of the <b>lackey</b> <b>moth</b> {{are laid}} in ring-like bands {{in late summer}} on twigs of the host trees where they overwinter. On hatching, the larvae are gregarious and weave for {{themselves}} a silken canopy of webbing. They eat the young foliage of the tree and moult several times as they grow larger. When ready to pupate they drop {{to the ground and}} undergo metamorphosis, each forming a pupa sandwiched between leaves of plants growing beneath the tree. In both Britain and Germany the flight period is from June to August.|$|E
