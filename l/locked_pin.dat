40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a <b>lock</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>lock</b> block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle. A lock tab on the lock block serves to align and register the respective holes on the lock block and switch handle. A <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect the lock block to the switch handle. Once the lock block and the switch handle are connected, the position of the switch handle is prevented from being changed by the lock tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is installed, an apertured-end portion of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is in registration with another hole on the lock block. Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H. A. regulations can be installed, with one or more padlocks, on the lockout assembly to prevent removal of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> from the lockout assembly, thereby preventing removal of the lockout assembly from the circuit breaker...|$|R

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> that slid behind flanges on the lock torque tube (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the <b>locking</b> <b>pins,</b> making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|R
40|$|A {{multifunction}} <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> is fabricated from a semi-flexible or elastic material. The <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> is {{also designed}} {{to function as}} a seal. The pin section serves especially to temporarily close up a threaded recess such as a drill hole. The deformable plastics pin effects a seal against the thread in the drill hole as the pin is screwed into the hole. USE - Multifunction blocking pin for use especially to temporarily close up and protect holes otherwise exposed to galvanic process. ADVANTAGE - Single-use pin is automatically inserted and provides low-cost system for protecting especially threaded components...|$|R

40|$|Two damaged I stage {{compressor}} rotor blades {{along with two}} <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> belonging to an aeroengine were forwarded to the laboratory for investigation. Fractographic examination showed that the blade number 24 had fractured by sudden overload such as impact. The fracturing of this blade was secondary in nature and subsequent to the primary failure. Evidences suggest that the dislodgement of blade number 5 {{was responsible for the}} engine failure. The dislodgement of the whole blade without any breakage is not possible unless the locking mechanism fails. It appears most probable that in this particular case, this was possible due to an assembly error wherein a <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> of length 27. 0 mm was used against the specification of 32. 0 mm...|$|R
50|$|The Cam Profile Switching (CPS) {{system uses}} a tri-lobe {{camshaft}} to switch between two different cam profiles. One cam profile provides low valve lift, {{while the other}} cam profile has a high valve lift. The low valve lift cam profile is used at low to mid engine speeds to maintain idling quality and reduce emissions, while the high lift cam profile is used when the engine is spinning at mid to high engine speeds improve peak horsepower and torque. Unlike the other similar variable valve timing systems such as the Honda VTEC, the Toyota VVT-i and the Mitsubishi MIVEC which use rocker arm <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> to change the valve timing, the CPS system uses direct-acting tappets with <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> to change the valve timing and lift profile.|$|R

50|$|Rekeying a lock is {{replacing}} the old <b>lock</b> <b>pins</b> with new <b>lock</b> <b>pins.</b> <b>Locks</b> are usually re keyed to build master-key systems, make {{a set of}} locks share a common key, or to eliminate compromised keys. Sometimes worn pins are replaced with new pins if the old pins become too short to reach the shear-line. The shear-line is the thin line shared by the plug and it's cylindrical housing. If a pin sits flush with the circumference of the plug it will allow lock rotation. Lock cylinders use different length pins in different combinations to create relatively unique key bitting. Most keys have 5 cuts from bow to tip. If a key has 5 cuts, the <b>lock</b> has 5 <b>pins.</b> Different brand <b>locks</b> each vary in many small ways, this is most true when servicing them. Many manufacturers offer product specific manuals. Information disclosed in manufacturer manuals is often otherwise difficult to find, as is locksmith material in general.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Transtibial amputees have {{a variety}} of {{suspension}} systems available to them. One of the more common systems uses a <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> to create a mechanical connection to their prosthesis. For those using a <b>locking</b> <b>pin,</b> it is common for the user to partially doff while seated in order to release pressures created by the socket on the residual limb. When attempting to re-don, there can be difficulty aligning and inserting the <b>pin</b> into the <b>lock,</b> requiring multiple attempts or for the user to stand with a not yet connected prosthesis. This can be an issue and possibly a fall risk for a new user or someone who has poor proprioception. By introducing an auto-retracting tether between the socket and pin, a constant connection is created. The retraction guides the <b>pin</b> into the <b>lock</b> without fail and allows for ease of donning while seated. In this investigation, a prototype design is modelled and built. Transtibial amputee participants are fitted with the system and provide feedback to further develop the system. Feedback was overall positive with a majority saying they would personally use the system. This improved functionality is designed to promote the frequency of partial doffing which may positively impact limb health...|$|R
