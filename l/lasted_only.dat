5|$|For {{the first}} season of the club's existence, the team played in a {{predominantly}} white strip. This is variously reported as all-white, or as white shirts with blue shorts and socks. This colour scheme was the direct descendant of the colours worn by the precursor Aberdeen club, but <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> one season before being replaced.|$|E

Other sources state the air battle over Belgrade <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 April.

5|$|After its {{suspension}} {{with the}} December 1798 issue, the Analytical Review lay dormant {{until it was}} briefly revived as The Analytical Review (New Series) {{during the first six}} months of 1799. It was printed and sold by T. Hurst of Paternoster Row, apparently without any connection to Johnson or the prior reviewers. Unlike its predecessor, the new series was cautious; it reviewed relatively uncontroversial works and its articles did not have initialled signatures. This series <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> from January until June 1799.|$|E
5|$|Air Wonder Stories and Science Wonder Stories were merged in 1930 as Wonder Stories, and the {{quarterly}} was renamed Wonder Stories Quarterly.

The last issue was dated Winter 1955, {{and the title}} was then merged with Startling Stories, another of Pines' science fiction magazines. Startling itself <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> {{to the end of}} 1955 before finally succumbing to the decline of the pulp magazine industry.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a handful}} of men reached Illinois Country, help {{never made it to}} the fort. Most of the {{remaining}} members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans after the invasion of 43AD. This <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> until around 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground. The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.|$|E
5|$|Animal House {{inspired}} Co-Ed Fever, another sitcom {{but without}} {{the involvement of the}} film's producers or cast.

NBC also had its Animal House-inspired sitcom, Brothers and Sisters, in which three members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC's Delta House, Brothers and Sisters <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> three months.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{investigation}} undertaken by the German General Staff following the sinking of Athenia, U-30 remained in port until 9 December 1939, when she was finally allowed to put to sea again for her second war patrol. It <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> six days, during which time she travelled up to the southern coast of (then neutral) Norway before returning to Wilhelmshaven on 14 December 1939. During the voyage U-30 did not encounter any enemy vessels, consequently she returned to port without any claims.|$|E
