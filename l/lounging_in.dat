500|$|In March 1893, Crane {{spent hours}} <b>lounging</b> <b>in</b> Linson's studio while having his {{portrait}} painted. He became fascinated {{with issues of}} the Century that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the Civil War. [...] Frustrated with the dryly written stories, Crane stated, [...] "I wonder {{that some of those}} fellows don't tell how they felt in those scraps. [...] They spout enough of what they did, but they're as emotionless as rocks." [...] Crane returned to these magazines during subsequent visits to Linson's studio, and eventually the idea of writing a war novel overtook him. [...] He would later state that he [...] "had been unconsciously working the detail of the story out through most of his boyhood" [...] and had imagined [...] "war stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers." [...] This novel would ultimately become The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E
500|$|The [...] are a {{small group}} of immortal beings, often called (by both {{themselves}} and others) [...] Referred to as gods by some, but unknown to the major religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a vital role in the history of Ivalice such as the creation of the Espers and granting power to King Raithwall to conquer the countries of Ivalice with the Dawn, Dusk, and Midlight shards of nethicite. The Occuria were first designed to be a race of Mindflayers, a type of enemy monster in the game. Earlier concept artwork portrayed these [...] "Mindflayers" [...] as wearing luxurious robes and turbans and <b>lounging</b> <b>in</b> a bar and smoking pipes. The design was changed during development and the Mindflayer was placed as a special monster, retaining the initial design; the Occuria were then given a different design of glowing eyes in a mist-like form.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Crane {{published}} his first novel, , in March 1893 {{at the age}} of 22. Maggie was not a success, either financially or critically. Most critics thought the unsentimental Bowery tale crude or vulgar, and Crane chose to publish the work privately after it was repeatedly rejected for publication. Crane found inspiration for his next novel while spending hours <b>lounging</b> <b>in</b> a friend's studio in the early summer of 1893. There, he became fascinated with issues of Century Magazine that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the Civil War. Frustrated with the dryly written stories, Crane stated, [...] "I wonder that some of those fellows don't tell how they felt in those scraps.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Hilson <b>lounging</b> <b>in</b> her bed. Upset by her partner, she {{walks over to}} the closet and rips down all of his clothes. The video then cuts to Hilson sitting in a chair at a beauty salon, where she gets a new haircut and dyes her hair from black to blonde. She later begins a choreographed routine with her girlfriends, who appear to also have been mistreated by their men. The women then march down Auburn Avenue before they head home to throw their men's clothes off the balcony. The video {{received}} mixed to positive reviews. Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy was positive and called it a [...] "beautifully shot portrait of a woman {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown", and The Fader writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd regarded it as an accurate representation of how women act when they are [...] "wronged by dudes". On the other hand, Robbie Daw of Idolator deemed it tiresome, calling it a [...] "visual snoozefest". He wrote, [...] " [...] goes to a salon, orders up Rihanna's Rated R haircut and sasses men who are wrongin' the ladies. Hey, girlsâ€”her love has a limit!

500|$|The game {{opens with}} Sam and Max <b>lounging</b> <b>in</b> their office, {{awaiting}} a new case {{after a long}} hiatus. Eventually, the commissioner sends them out to investigate a group of former child stars, the Soda Poppers, who have been causing trouble in the neighborhood. The Soda Poppers are attempting to promote a self-help video called Eye-Bo, which (when watched) hypnotizes the viewer. After seeking assistance from Sybil to reverse the hypnotism on the Soda Poppers by knocking them unconscious, the Freelance Police learn that the scheme has been devised by one Brady Culture [...] another former child star who owes his fall from popularity {{to the rise of}} the Soda Poppers. Sam and Max and the Soda Poppers confront Culture, who hypnotizes the Soda Poppers again. However, Sam manages to fool Culture into ordering the Soda Poppers to attack himself, subduing the threat. The next case the Freelance Police gets involves liberating a studio audience held hostage by a deranged TV talk show host, Myra Stump. At the TV station, Sam and Max deduce that Myra has been hypnotized and, after using other shows in the studio to become celebrities, they convince her to let them become guests on her show. Once on the show, Sam notes a strange toy bear on the host's desk, the source of the hypnotism. Using the studio sound system, Sam electrocutes both Myra and the bear, allowing the audience to leave.|$|E

500|$|Summed up by James Dinh of MTV News, [...] " [...] 'Party' takes viewers {{back to an}} old-school {{backyard}} celebration full {{of colorful}} bikinis, freestyle dancing and a few familiar faces. Throughout the video, [...] lets loose, playing a sort of party host. If she is not <b>lounging</b> <b>in</b> beach chairs, she is dancing among her friends or mowing the lawn." [...] The clip is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and a saucepan caught in fire. Then, BeyoncÃ© appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy garments, sporting neon-colored oval shaped nails, and bright-colored lipstick. She is cooking in a skillet while one of her neighbors drinks from a hose. As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard barbecue, where BeyoncÃ© and her friends dance as Solange is deejaying. This is followed by scenes of BeyoncÃ©, floating in an above ground pool while singing and entertaining her guests. She is wearing a pink one-piece swimsuit, dropping earrings and her hair looks crimped. Other girls bask {{in the sun and}} splash in the pool as Solange works the turntables.|$|E
500|$|In Philadelphia, Henry Fairfield Osborn is {{introducing}} artist Charles R. Knight to Edward Drinker Cope, a paleontologist whose entire house {{is filled with}} bones and specimens. Cope is commissioning a painting, something to [...] "catch the spirit" [...] of the sea creature Elasmosaurus (but has unwittingly mistaken its neck for a tail). Cope then leaves for the West, as the official scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). On the way, he meets Othniel Charles Marsh, a fellow paleontologist, and shows him his dig site at a marl pit in New Jersey; after Cope leaves, Marsh talks to {{the owner of the}} land and pays him off to gain exclusive digging rights. At Fort Bridger, Wyoming, Cope meets Sam Smith, a helper to the USGS. During excavations, Cope finds some of the richest bone veins ever. Sending back carloads of dinosaur bones east by train, Cope encounters Marsh, who is heading out west as well. Marsh travels in style, <b>lounging</b> <b>in</b> coach while the rest of his team travels third classâ€”Marsh even berates them for playing cards, saying it is [...] "low class" [...] and that Yale graduates should look more presentable. [...] At Fort McPherson, Nebraska, Marsh meets [...] "Buffalo" [...] Bill Cody, who serves as their guide, along with the Native American Indian tribe. Marsh discovers many new fossils, and promises to Chief Red Cloud that he will talk to the President of the United States about the situation of the Native Americansâ€”they have been given spoiled food in exchange for their land. Back East, Knight has finished his reconstruction of Elasmosaurus. He and Knight return to the marl pits of New Jersey, but are forced away. Cope becomes furious and storms away when he learns Marsh has bought the digging rights and published a paper revealing his interpretation of Elasmosaurus flawed.|$|E

Rao threw himself to the sidewalk, however, and four young children were wounded in the attack. One of them, five-year-old Michael Vengalli, later died at Beth David Hospital. After the Vengalli killing, New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker dubbed Coll a [...] "Mad Dog".|$|E

2500|$|Since May 2009, the {{portions}} of Broadway through Duffy Square, Times Square, and Herald Square {{have been closed}} entirely to automobile traffic, except for cross traffic on the Streets and Avenues, {{as part of a}} traffic and pedestrianization experiment, with the pavement reserved exclusively for walkers, cyclists, and those <b>lounging</b> <b>in</b> temporary seating placed by the city. The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010. Though the anticipated benefits to traffic flow were not as large as hoped, pedestrian injuries dropped dramatically and foot traffic increased in the designated areas; the project was popular with both residents and businesses. The current portions converted into pedestrian plazas are between West 47th Street and West 42nd Street within Times and Duffy Squares, and between West 35th Street and West 33rd Street in the Herald Square area. Additionally, portions of Broadway in the Madison Square and Union Square have been dramatically narrowed, allowing ample pedestrian plazas to exist {{along the side of the}} road.|$|E
