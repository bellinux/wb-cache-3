40|$|The {{determination}} of bridge lifetime load {{effect is a}} complex problem. Usually, statistical extrapolation of simulated static load effect is used to derive a <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristic</b> static load effect. In reality, when a vehicle crosses a bridge, dynamic interaction occurs which often causes a greater total load effect. This total load effect {{is related to the}} static load effect through a dynamic amplification factor (DAF). Often the worst estimated DAF is applied to the lifetime static load effect to obtain a total <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristic</b> load effect. This does not allow for the reduced probabilities of both high static loading and high dynamic interaction. The authors present an approach that accounts for this reduced probability by using multivariate extreme value theory, in conjunction with extensive static simulations and 3 -D finite element bridge-truck dynamic interaction models. It is found that the DAF that should be applied to the characteristic static load effect is significantly less than originally thought. This has significant implications for the type of traffic (free-flowing or congested) thought to govern short- to medium-length bridges...|$|E
40|$|Green {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) mutants {{have become}} {{the most widely used}} fluorescence markers in the life sciences, and although they are becoming increasingly popular as mechanical force or strain probes, there is little direct information on how their fluorescence changes when mechanically stretched. Here we derive high-resolution structural models of the mechanical intermediate states of stretched GFP using steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. These structures were used to produce mutants of EGFP and EYFP that mimic GFP’s different mechanical intermediates. A spectroscopic analysis revealed that a population of EGFP molecules with a missing N-terminal a-helix was significantly dimmed, while the fluorescence <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the anionic chromophore state remained unaffected. This suggests a mechanism how N-terminal deletions can switch the protonation state of the chromophore, and how the fluorescence of GFP molecules in response to mechanical disturbance might be turned off...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A generational {{collection}} strategy {{utilizing a}} single nursery cannot efficiently manage objects in application servers due to variance in their lifespans. In this paper, we introduce an optimization technique designed for application servers that exploits an observation that remotable objects {{are commonly used}} as gateways for client requests. Objects instantiated as part of these requests (remote objects) often live longer than objects not created to serve these remote requests (local objects). Thus, our scheme creates remote and local objects in two separate nurseries; each is properly sized to match the <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the residing objects. We extended the generational collector in HotSpot to support the proposed optimization and found that given the same heap size, the proposed scheme can improve the maximum throughput of an application server by 14 % over the default collector. It also allows the application server to handle 10 % higher workload prior to memory exhaustion. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of characteristic bridge load {{effect is a}} complex problem. Usually, statistical extrapolation of simulated static load effects is used to derive a <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristic</b> static load effect. However, when a vehicle crosses a bridge, dynamic interaction occurs which often causes a greater total load effect. This total load effect {{is related to the}} static load effect through a dynamic amplification factor (DAF). Specifications often recommend a conservative level for DAF, based on bridge length, number of lanes, and type of load effect only. Therefore significant improvements in the accuracy of this calculation are possible if a DAF, specific to the considered bridge, is applied. In this paper, the authors develop a novel method that considers site-specific bridge and traffic load conditions and allows for the reduced probability of both high static loading and high dynamic interaction occurring simultaneously. This approach utilises multivariate extreme value theory, in conjunction with static simulations and finite element vehicle-bridge dynamic interaction models. It is found that the dynamic allowance for the sample bridge and traffic considered, is significantly less than recommended by bridge codes.

40|$|European Road freight {{transport}} {{has increased by}} 38 % between 1995 and 2005 and this strong growth trajectory seems likely to continue into the future. To address this growth without compromising the competitiveness of European transport, some countries are contemplating the introduction of longer and heavier trucks, with up to 8 axles and gross weights of up to 60 t. This {{has the advantage of}} reducing the number of vehicles for a given volume or mass of freight, reducing labour, fuel and other costs. However, many roads authorities are concerned about the implications for Europe’s bridge infrastructure. For bridge loading, it is the combination of gross weight and truck length that determine load effects such as bending moment and shear force in the deck. A probabilistic analysis is required to assess whether these proposed trucks will lead to greater maximum <b>lifetime</b> (<b>characteristic)</b> load effects. If this was found to be the case, it would necessitate the strengthening of a great number of vulnerable bridges throughout the continent or it could even prevent the introduction of heavier trucks.

40|$|Carrier-selective {{contacts}} (i. e., {{minority carrier}} mirrors) {{are one of}} the last remaining obstacles to approaching the theoretical efficiency limit of silicon solar cells. In the 1980 s, it was already demonstrated that n-type polysilicon and semi-insulating polycrystalline silicon emitters form carrier-selective emitters which enabled open-circuit voltages (Voc) of up to 720 mV. Albeit promising, to date a polysilicon emitter solar cell having a high fill factor (FF) has not been demonstrated yet. In this work, we report a polysilicon emitter related solar cell achieving both a high V oc= 694 mV and FF= 81 %.

40|$|One {{phenomenon}} {{observed at}} hypervelocity impacts (HVI) is {{the generation of}} plasma with a very short lifetime of a few microseconds. Due to this short <b>lifetime,</b> <b>characteristic</b> plasma parameters such as the electron density and the electron temperature of the expanding plasma were not investigated thoroughly in the past. This paper will present a method to measure these parameters with a time-resolution of 500 ns for the full period of impact plasma expansion and discuss results gained in impact experiments. At the Fraunhofer EMI, impact experiments on solar panels were performed using a two-stage light-gas gun to accelerate aluminum spheres with a diameter of a few millimeters up to a speed of 8 km/s. A measurement system consisting of a spectrograph and a streak camera was applied for time-resolved spectroscopy of the impact plasma. To derive plasma properties, the recorded streak image was evaluated using different methods for different expansion states of the plasma cloud. The spectra show strong self-absorption lines in the first microseconds of expansion. In the present work, these features are explained by the electron density and temperature gradient in the plasma. For the determination of electron temperature and density, a one-dimensional radiative transfer model was adapted to the measured spectra. After 2 μs of expansion, the plasma is optically thin and emission lines can be observed. For this expansion state, the electron temperature {{was determined by the}} ratio of line to continuum radiation, whereas the electron density was determined through the line broadening due to the Stark effect. Using these methods, {{it was found that the}} electron temperature decreases in the first 3 μs of propagation from 45, 000 K to 2, 000 K in the experiments performed.

40|$|This work {{reports the}} first example of a {{single-chain}} protein computationally designed to contain four α-helical segments and fold to form a four-helix bundle encapsulating a supramolecular abiological chromophore that possesses exceptional nonlinear optical properties. The 109 -residue protein, designated SCRPZ- 1, binds and disperses an insoluble hyperpolarizable chromophore, ruthenium(II) [5 -(4 '-ethynyl-(2, 2 '; 6 ', 2 ″-terpyridinyl)) - 10, 20 -bis(phenyl) porphinato]zinc(II) -(2, 2 '; 6 ', 2 ″-terpyridine) (2 +) (RuPZn) in aqueous buffer solution at a 1 : 1 stoichiometry. A 1 : 1 binding stoichiometry of the holoprotein is supported by electronic absorption and circular dichroism spectra, as well as equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. SCRPZ- 1 readily dimerizes at micromolar concentrations, and an empirical redesign of the protein exterior produced a stable monomeric protein, SCRPZ- 2, that also displayed a 1 : 1 protein:cofactor stoichiometry. For both proteins in aqueous buffer, the encapsulated cofactor displays photophysical properties resembling those exhibited by the dilute RuPZn cofactor in organic solvent: femtosecond, nanosecond, and microsecond time scale pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopic data evince intensely absorbing holoprotein excited states having large spectral bandwidth that penetrate deep in the near-infrared energy regime; the holoprotein electronically excited triplet state exhibits a microsecond time scale <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the RuPZn chromophore. Hyper-Rayleigh light scattering measurements carried out at an incident irradiation wavelength of 1340 nm for these holoproteins demonstrate an exceptional dynamic hyperpolarizabilty (β 1340 = 3100 × 10 (- 30) esu). X-ray reflectivity measurements establish that this de novo-designed hyperpolarizable protein can be covalently attached with high surface density to a silicon surface without loss of the cofactor, indicating that these assemblies provide {{a new approach to}} bioinspired materials that have unique electro-optic functionality. status: publishe...|$|E

All complexes are 10 -coordinate. Crystallographic analysis of [M(L 1) 2 (NO 3) ] (M = Pr, Er) showed {{that for the}} smaller Er(III) ions steric congestion at the metal centre results {{in two of the}} Er–N(pyridyl) distances being particularly long, which does not occur with the larger Pr(III) ion that is better able to accommodate 10 -fold coordination. On UV irradiation, both Pr(III) complexes show, in the visible region of their luminescence spectra, transitions originating from both the 3 P 0 level (at ca. 21 000 cm− 1) and the 1 D 2 level (at ca. 17 000 cm− 1), a consequence {{of the fact that the}} lowest triplet state of the coordinated pyrazolylborate ligands lies at ca. 24 000 cm− 1 in each case so is high enough in energy to populate both levels. This contrasts with Pr(III) complexes based on diketonate ligands in which the lower triplet energies of the ligands result in emission from the 1 D 2 level only. At longer wavelengths, near-infrared luminescence arising from the 1 D 2 emissive level is observed with lifetimes (in both the solid state and solution) being in the range 50 – 110 ns. For both Er(III) complexes, luminescence at 1530 nm occurs following UV excitation of ligand-centred transitions. In CH 2 Cl 2 both complexes gave dual-exponential luminescence, with the major component having a <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristic</b> of an intact Er(III) complex (≈ 1. 5 µs) and the minor component being much shorter lived (0. 2 – 0. 5 µs), suggestive of a species in which a ligand is partially detached and the metal is solvated, with the two forms interconverting slowly. This behaviour is consistent with the steric congestion and long M–N(pyridyl) bonds that were observed in [Er(L 1) 2 (NO 3) ]. In the solid state both Er(III) complexes gave very weak luminescence, which could be fitted to a single exponential decay with a lifetime similar to the longer-lived of the solution components...|$|E
40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a {{treatment}} for superficial tumorous and dysplastic tissue in which light is used to excite photosensitizers within tissue to transform molecular oxygen, via energy transfer processes, into oxygen radicals. As the accumulation of the sensitizers {{takes place in the}} tissue selectively, the cytotoxic reaction of the radicals which destroy the surrounding tissue only occurs locally. The effect of PDT is based on the transformation of molecular oxygen into radicals, so that exact knowledge regarding the oxygen concentration in tissue is crucial {{to the success of the}} therapy. An oxygen monitoring system is therefore required. The molecular oxygen concentration can be calculated by measuring the luminescence lifetime of dyes by making use of selective oxygen-sensitive luminescence dyes used in optical molecular imaging to diagnose diseases and processes. The luminescence lifetime of theses dyes is shortened by energy transfer processes dependent on the concentration of quencher molecules. This means that knowledge of the <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristic</b> can be used to evaluate the quencher concentration. The process is called dynamic quenching and is described by the Stern-Volmer-equation. The correlation between lifetime and quencher concentration is quantified by the Stern-Volmer-constant which is dependent on the diffusion coefficients of molecule and quencher, and therefore, dependent on the temperature and solvent. Molecular oxygen is an example of a quencher for luminescent ruthenium-complexes. The luminescence lifetime can be calculated pixel-wise with the Rapid-Lifetime-Determination-method (RLD) and a CCD-camera, making it possible to calculate an oxygen concentration image. Within the framework of this work a complex, but nevertheless modular, luminescence lifetime imaging system was constructed with which it is possible to calculate and display the lifetime and the oxygen concentration using a CCD-camera and the RLD-method. Two dyes, Ruthenium-tris-bipyridyl (Ru(bpy) 32 +) dissolved in aqueous media and the oxygen-permeable Sol-Gel-layer FOXY-SGS-M with an embedded ruthenium-complex were used to test the system. Time-consuming temperature- and oxygen concentration measurements were carried out using two different cuvettes: a flow-through cell and a calibration cell, both specially constructed for this work. The functionality of the system was proved by comparing the measured Stern-Volmer-constant of Ru(bpy) 32 +-solutions with values from the literature, which showed very good agreement. The lifetime dependencies of both dyes were comparable to established oxygen sensors making them suitable for oxygen concentrations measurements. The realized luminescence lifetime measuring system is highly suitable for two-dimensional oxygen concentration analysis of probes and tissue and presents a key step forward to a monitoring technique for PDT. Determination of the oxygen concentration in tissue and whether the progress of therapy can be evaluated by the superficial measurement will be the aim of further research projects...|$|E

Results Sixteen eyes from 8 patients with advanced choroideremia (mean ± SD age, 55 ± 13 years) were included in this study and compared with 10 age-matched healthy participants. Whereas fundus autofluorescence intensity measurement identified areas of remaining retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), autofluorescence lifetime maps identified areas with remaining photoreceptor layers in OCT but RPE atrophy. In these areas, mean (±SEM) lifetimes were 567 ± 59 ps in the short and 603 ± 49 ps in the long spectral channels (+ 98...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{realization}} of completely autonomous {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSN) has been hindered with difficulties in implementing a truly “perpetual” power supply. Typically, the generic power supply for a sensor node is a battery, which is limited in cycle life. Current research in energy scavenging technology, along {{with the use of}} innovative energy storage devices such as supercapacitors, has demonstrated the improvement of sensor node <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristics.</b> In this paper, we present the experimental results on a novel electrochemical supercapacitor (with improved electrical characteristics) manu-factured using a “direct write ” deposition tool. This technology allows one to print the supercapacitors with capacitances above 40 mF/cm 2 directly on board of a sensor node covering any unoccupied surface area. Experiments on the printed storage chrarging with (AC) and (DC) based ambient energy via a spe-cially developed generic energy scavenging module (ESM), and 24 -hours dep-loyment with a typical sensor node have showed promise towards extending sensor node lifetime...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} FAST {{project is}} to provide an {{implementation}} of a lazy functional language on a transputer array. An important component of this system is a highly optimising compiler and runtime system for a single transputer. Efficient storage management is crucial in such an implementation, and this paper explores the demands placed on the storage manager by our compiled code. Statistics are presented illustrating the <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristics</b> of cells, a break down of claimed cells by type, and other information which is {{of interest to the}} designer of a storage management system. We conclude that most cells are short lived, and that cell turnover is quite high. In addition, application cells are found to die much younger than cells of other types. We also examine the effect of vector apply cells on suspension forming activities. Finally we explore the possibility of using contextual information when predicting the lifetime of application and vector application cells, and suggest a wa [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A new rating scale, the Lifetime Dimensions of Psychosis Scale (LDPS), is described. The LDPS {{creates a}} profile of the <b>lifetime</b> <b>characteristics</b> of each case based on {{retrospective}} ratings, encompassing the positive, bizarre, negative, and disorganized symptom factors identified by previous studies of psychotic disorders, plus mood-related symptomatology, degree of deterioration, and complicating factors over the course of illness. A preliminary 39 -item scale and instruction manual were developed. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for positive symptom and mood item total scores were 0. 76 to 0. 87 (mean of 0. 70 for all items). Highly intercorrelated (tau-b coefficients) or unreliable items were eliminated to create the final 20 - item version 2. Good-excellent reliability was observed in a second study using different raters. The LDPS is designed for use by experienced clinicians or researchers who have access to comprehensive clinical information, including semistructured diagnostic interviews, psychiatric records, and family history reports. Dimensional scores and multidimensional patterns might prove useful in studying the relationship of clinical phenotype to genotypes, treatment response, and other variables. They may also be useful in clinical practice...|$|R
