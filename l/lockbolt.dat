25|$|A <b>lockbolt</b> is a {{fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a <b>lockbolt</b> has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the <b>lockbolt</b> in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a <b>lockbolt</b> and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a <b>lockbolt,</b> the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E

40|$|Joining by {{mechanical}} forming technologies, e. g. lockbolts, are, {{in comparison}} with metallic welding, very well suitable for connecting different combinations of materials. Lockbolts are usually installed at ambient temperature. Because of thermal loads during the employment of predominantly friction continuity <b>lockbolt</b> assemblies, problems can occur due to heat strain effects in steel-aluminium combinations and thereby caused a change of the pretension. Computation references, norms and regulations for this case are only limited available or rather missing completely, so that many potential applications can not be realized.

40|$|In {{the context}} of this {{research}} project a concept for quality assurance of lockbolts connec-tions by monitoring the installation process was developed using the parameters installation path and installation force. For this purpose, initially the process capability of selected <b>lockbolt</b> systems was examined by an analytical consideration of the natural scatter of the installation curves. Next, the effects of typical installation process irregularities were compared both to the process curve {{as well as on the}} bearing behavior of the joined connection determined numerically and with experimental data. From this it was possible to identify some ranges of the installation curve which were effected by installation process irregularities and specific evaluation window are derived. Their implementation enables advanced On-Line - Process monitoring. An advanced process monitoring can be used in addition to the previously customary simple plausibility check for the specific failure diagnosis. Furthermore it is possible by knowledge of the characteristic influence of the irregularities on the bearing behavior, to interrupt the manufacturing process only on the occurrence of critical errors, thus reducing time and cost intensive rework. To reduce the experimental effort special attention was payed to the use of numerical simulation for the automated generation of installation curves to reflect the natural scatter ranges of the real installation process. In conjunction with a sensitivity analysis, the most important influencing variables on the bearing capacities of the joined connection should be identified. Thereby, the procedures for setting up a joining task in SMEs can be optimized, as only the verification of numerically determined installation curves needs to be performed. Requirements for fasteners, installation equipment and installation process monitoring for the prevention and identification of installation process irregularities have been summarized in {{the context of}} a case class concept, which allows the user quality-oriented conception of <b>lockbolt</b> installation processes...|$|E
40|$|The joining of {{different}} materials and material combinations can be occur either metallic continuity like welding, bonding and soldering or also on a form-fit and frictional continuity {{like in the}} screwing and rivets. The mechanical connection offers a large potential to join different materials without thermal loading. The <b>lockbolt</b> (SRB) as a high-strength friction grip fastening system represents in this regard a synthesis between full rivet and screw. They find in practice many applications. Computation references, norms and regulations for a comprehensive employment are only limited available or rather missing completely, thatÂ´s why potential users can often not use this alternative joining technology. Analysed are setting behavior and selective strength properties of lockbolts with numeric computations as a contribution to advance the determination of these properties for constructive dimensioning and to compare with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid (bolted/bonded) joining is {{becoming}} one of the innovative joining processes for light weight structures in the transport industry, especially in the aerospace industry where weight reduction and high joining requirements are permanent challenges. Combining the adhesive bonding with the mechanical joining -riveting for instance- can lead to an enhancement of the properties of the joint compared to the wide established riveting, {{as a result of a}} synergistic load bearing interaction between the fastener and the adhesive bondline. The influence of the rivet installation process on a hybrid joint regarding the joint stress state, the change of the bondline thickness as well as its effects on the joint performance and load transfer are some of the factors that drive the users to a better understanding of the hybrid joining process. This paper deals therefore on one hand with the numerical simulation of the rivet installation process in an adhesively bonded joint to understand the phenomena occurring during the installation process and on the other hand with the investigation of the load transfer depending on the joint parameters. In order to simulate the rivet installation in adhesively bonded aluminium (2024 -T 351) adherends, two models have been developed. One for a solid rivet specified by the European standard EN 6081 another for a <b>Lockbolt</b> specified by the standards ASNA 2041 /ASNA 2045. The developed simulation model for the rivet installation process has been validated by comparing the simulation results with experiments regarding the qualitative change of the bondline thickness depending on the adhesive's Young's modulus and on the rivet type. The experimental rivet installation process for the validation of the simulation model takes place in a fully automated C-frame riveting machine with all-electric drilling and riveting operations aptitude. A generic numerical study to determine the effects of the adhesive's Young's modulus on the joint stress state and the effect of the rivet installation on the adhesive bondline has been carried out. In order to determine the load transfer behaviour in a hybrid joint, a single lap joint model for the above mentioned and aluminium (2024 -T 351) adherends has been developed. A generic study to investigate the effect of the rivet installation and the adhesive Young's modulus on the load transfer has been carried out. To validate the simulation model for the single lap shear test, the simulation results have been compared with the experiments regarding the force displacement curves...|$|E
40|$|On November 5, 2010, Space Shuttle mission STS- 133 was {{scrubbed}} due to {{a hydrogen}} leak at the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUCP). After the scrub, {{a crack in the}} foam thermal protection system (TPS) was observed on the External Tank (ET) near the interface between the liquid oxygen (LOX) tank and the Intertank. When the damaged foam was removed, two 9 -in. long cracks were found on the feet of Intertank stringer S 7 - 2, and the stringer failure was the cause of the TPS crack. An investigation was conducted to determine the root cause of the cracks, establish a remedy/repair for the stringers, and provide flight rationale for the damaged tank, ET- 137. The Space Transportation System (STS) Super Lightweight ET (SLWT) is comprised of two propellant tanks (an aft liquid hydrogen (LH 2) tank and a forward LOX tank) and an Intertank. The Intertank serves as the structural connection between the two propellant tanks and also functions to receive and distribute all thrust loads from the solid rocket boosters. The Intertank is a stiffened cylinder structure consisting of eight mechanically joined panels (two integrally-stiffened, machined thrust panels to react the booster loads and six stringer-stiffened skin panels). There are one main ring frame, four intermediate ring frames, and forward and aft flange chords that mate to the respective propellant tanks [...] The skin/stringer panels utilize external hat-section stringers that are mechanically attached with rivets along most of their length and with specialty fasteners, such as GP <b>Lockbolts</b> and Hi-Loks, at the forward and aft ends where the stringers attach to the flange chords. During the STS- 133 Intertank stringer crack investigation, cracks were found on a total of five stringers. All of the cracks were at the LOX end, in the feet of the stringers, and near the forward fasteners (GP <b>Lockbolts).</b> Video of tanking for the November 5 launch attempt was used to determine that the TPS failure, and thus the stringer failure, occurred as the LOX liquid level crossed the LOX tank / Intertank interface ring frame. Hence, cryogenically-induced displacements were suspected as a contributing cause of the stringer cracks. To study the behavior of Intertank stringers subjected to similar displacements, static load tests of individual stringers, colloquially known as "single stringer bending tests" were performed. Approximately thirty stringers were tested, many of which were cut from the partially completed Intertank for what would have been ET- 139. In addition to the tests, finite element (FE) analyses of the test configuration were also performed. In this paper, the FE analyses and test-analysis correlation for stringer test S 6 - 8 are presented. Stringer S 6 - 8 is a "short chord" configuration with no doubler panels...|$|R
