5|$|The 5th Mountain Division, {{together}} with the reinforced 125th Infantry Regiment, crossed the Struma river under great hardship, attacking along both banks and clearing bunkers until they reached their objective on 7 April. Heavy casualties caused them to temporarily withdraw. The 72nd Infantry Division advanced from Nevrokop across the mountains. Its advance was delayed by a shortage of pack animals, medium artillery and mountain equipment. Only {{on the evening of}} 9 April did it reach the area north-east of Serres. Most fortresses—like Fort Roupel, Echinos, Arpalouki, Paliouriones, Perithori, Karadag, <b>Lisse</b> and Istibey—held until the Germans occupied Thessaloniki on 9 April, at which point they surrendered under General Bakopoulos' orders. Nevertheless, minor isolated fortresses continued to fight for a few days more and were not taken until heavy artillery was used against them. This gave time for some retreating troops to evacuate by sea. Although eventually broken, the defenders of the Metaxas Line succeeded in delaying the German advance.The Metaxas Line, requiring 150,000 men, could have held out longer, but the bulk of the Greek army was facing the Italians in Albania.|$|E
2500|$|Common acts {{include a}} variety of acrobatics, {{gymnastics}} (including tumbling and trampoline), aerial acts (such as trapeze, aerial silk, corde <b>lisse),</b> contortion, stilts, and {{a variety of}} other routines. Juggling is one of the most common acts in a circus; the combination of juggling and gymnastics is called equilibristics and include acts like plate spinning and the rolling globe. Acts like these are some of the most common, and the most traditional. Clowns are common to most circuses and are typically skilled in many circus acts; [...] "clowns getting into the act" [...] is a very familiar theme in any circus. Famous circus clowns have included Austin Miles, the Fratellini Family, Rusty Russell, Emmett Kelly, Grock, and Bill Irwin.|$|E
60|$|Imagine a tall, dignified, spiritual woman, whose clear muslin cap shades {{waves of}} silvery hair, parted on a broad, clear forehead, which overarches {{thoughtful}} gray eyes. A snowy handkerchief of <b>lisse</b> crape is folded neatly across her bosom; her glossy brown silk dress rustles peacefully, as she glides {{up and down}} the chamber.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, I MUST have my dress to be married in. I don't think mother would regard it as a legal {{marriage}} if I hadn't, and if you knew how nice it will be, {{you would not have}} the heart to interfere with it. Try to picture it, silver-grey--I know how fond you are of greys--a little white chiffon at neck and wrists, and the prettiest pearl trimming. Then the hat en suite, pale-grey <b>lisse,</b> white feather and brilliant buckle. All these details are wasted upon you, sir, but you will like it when you see it. It fulfils your ideal of tasteful simplicity, which men always imagine to be an economical method of dressing, until they have wives and milliners' bills of their own.|$|E
60|$|Then {{when every}} {{preparation}} {{has been made}} for the dinner--that solemn climax of the British day, there is plenty for Maude to do. There is the white chiffon {{to be taken out}} of the neck of that dress, and the pink to be put in. Amateur dressmaking is always going on at The Lindens, and Frank has become more careful in his caresses since he found one evening that his wife had a row of pins between her lips-- which is not a pleasant discovery to make with your own. Then there are drawers to be tidied, and silver to be cleaned, and the leaves of the gutta-percha plant to be washed, and the feather which was damped yesterday to be re-curled before the fire. That leaves just time before lunch to begin the new novel by glancing at the last two pages to see what DID happen, and then the three minutes lunch of a lonely woman. So much for business, now for the more trying social duties. The pink dressing-gown is shed and a trim little walking dress-- French grey cloth with white <b>lisse</b> in front and a grey zouave jacket- -takes its place. Visiting strangers is not nearly so hard when you are pleased with your dress, and even entertaining becomes more easy when your costumiere lives in Regent Street. On Tuesdays Maude is at home. Every other day she hunts through her plate of cards, and is overwhelmed by the sense of her rudeness towards her neighbours. But her task is never finished, though day after day she comes back jaded with her exertions. Strangers still call upon her--'hope it is not too late to do the right thing, and to welcome,' etc., etc.--and they have to be re-visited. While she is visiting them, other cards appear upon her hall table, and so the foolish and tiresome convention continues to exhaust the time and the energies of its victim.|$|E
6000|$|By {{her side}} sat {{a woman with}} a bright tin pan in her lap, into which she was {{carefully}} sorting some dried peaches. She might be fifty-five or sixty; but hers was one of those faces that time seems to touch only to brighten and adorn. The snowy <b>lisse</b> crape cap, made after the strait Quaker pattern,--the plain white muslin handkerchief, lying in placid folds across her bosom,--the drab shawl and dress,--showed at once the community to which she belonged. Her face was round and rosy, with a healthful downy softness, suggestive of a ripe peach. Her hair, partially silvered by age, was parted smoothly back from a high placid forehead, on which time had written no inscription, except peace on earth, good will to men, and beneath shone a large pair of clear, honest, loving brown eyes; you only needed to look straight into them, to feel that you saw to the bottom of a heart as good and true as ever throbbed in woman's bosom. So much has been said and sung of beautiful young girls, why don't somebody wake up to the beauty of old women? If any want to get up an inspiration under this head, we refer them to our good friend Rachel Halliday, just as she sits there in her little rocking-chair. It had a turn for quacking and squeaking,--that chair had,--either from having taken cold in early life, or from some asthmatic affection, or perhaps from nervous derangement; but, as she gently swung backward and forward, the chair kept up a kind of subdued [...] "creechy crawchy," [...] that would have been intolerable in any other chair. But old Simeon Halliday often declared it was as good as any music to him, and the children all avowed that they wouldn't miss of hearing mother's chair for anything in the world. For why? for twenty years or more, nothing but loving words, and gentle moralities, and motherly loving kindness, had come from that chair;--head-aches and heart-aches innumerable had been cured there,--difficulties spiritual and temporal solved there,--all by one good, loving woman, God bless her! ...|$|E
