Aldo Rossi derived his "Theory of permanence" from Marcel Poëte and his fundamental research for Paris and the city. Poëte proposed a method {{for the study of}} the city which started with "urban facts", namely the main indicators of the condition of a settlement. and which recognised the lesson of the past as something unavoidable and necessary for those who wanted to intervene in the city. The analysis of the ancient city and its representations enables the detection of the original structure and the factors which determined its evolution, starting with the geography of places, the site and the layout of various axes.

40|$|Vengono discusse due assunzioni tipiche in ontologia, la non-complementarità delle teorie degli oggetti e la tesi che la verità richieda fattori di verità. Segue riassunto <b>in</b> <b>inglese</b> Current {{ontology}} implicitly {{assumes that}} (i) certain theoretical options regarding {{the nature of}} particulars, substrates vs. bundles of universals vs. bundles of tropes, are mutually exclusive. Moreover, there is a long-standing tradition according to which (ii) truths require corresponding truthmakers as ontological grounds. Both theses are typically upheld as conceptual truths on an a priori basis. In spite of this, as regards (ii), we can legitimately interpret some empirical evidence from physics as suggesting that substrates, bundles of tropes and bundles of universals should co-exist in our ontological inventory. Similarly, as regards (ii), it is arguable that it is simply an in principle falsifiable empirical hypothesis that true propositisions about the past or future have truthmakers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract (<b>in</b> <b>inglese)</b> - Landscape {{seen as a}} "place of the mind" {{is a way of}} conceiving {{space as}} a {{combination}} of relationships and interactions which can never be firmly defined, never univocally grasped. A perceptive and cultural construction of reality, in a continuous oscillation between aesthetics and science, landscape reflects the world's uni-duality, in accord with flexible, mobile, open and interrogative thought. This seeks pregnant relationships in a totality which is not broken up into individual parts, inside of which the observer and the actual act of observation play vital and integral roles. The architectural experiments proposed as "(land) scapes-like" seem to emphasise this endless aperture, this new adherence to what reality is becoming. In this way, they represent a ‘metaphor of landscape' able to bring out, through the continuous fluctuation of their horizons, broad limits for drifting and intersecting borders. Dynamism predominates over immobility, metamorphosis over stability, dialogue with the customer and the environment prevails over self-reflection, revealing a world of relationships in which everything is connected beyond each and every set configuration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>in</b> <b>inglese</b> presente nella rivista: Beginning {{with the}} issue of the renowned {{sculptor}} J. Chinard, destined to become even more famous during the years of the Napoleonic Empire, and the young architect I. Rater, the two Frenchmen arrested by the Governor's police in Rome in 1792 with the charge of heresy and revolutionary conspiracy against the State and handed over to the Holy Office, this essay analyzes the politically reality of Rome in the nineties of the Eighteenth Century, before the proclamation of the Republic. These are years of religious condemnation of the French Revolution, considered to be heretic and an offspring of Jansenism, the Enligtenment, Freemasonry, and libertine tradition. Particular attention is accorded to the places used for social gatherings and the universe of the Roman artists, partucularly involved in the democratic movement, as well as the relevance of the popular idea at the time regarding symbolic and behavioral elements (clothing, lifestyle, sexuality, gesture-like expressiveness) in determining judgements, even popularly widespread, on political, moral, and religious identity of the French revolutionnaries and their Roman sympathizers...|$|R

Why a theatre laboratory? This book {{attempts}} {{to answer these}} questions, focusing on the experiences and theories, the visions and the techniques, the differencxes and similarities of European theatre laboratories in the twentieth century. It studies in depth the Studios of Stanislavski and Meyerhold, the school of Decroux, the Theatre Laboratorium of Jerzy Grotowski and Ludwik Flaszen, as well as Eugenio Barba’s Odin Teatret. Laboratory theatres have rarely been at {{the centre of the}} news. Yet their underground activity has influenced theatre history. Without them, our very ideas of theatre, as shaped throughout the course of the twentieth century, would have been quite different. In this book, Mirella Schino recounts the vicissitudes of a group of practitioners and scholars who try to uncover the technical, political and spiritual perspectives behind the word “laboratory” when applied to the theatre...|$|R

Tale meccanismo attivo permette di spiegare l'amplificazione e propagazione dell'onda meccano-acustica nella coclea.

Di seguito è riportato un abstract <b>in</b> <b>inglese</b> del lavoro: A nonlinear active feed-forward/feed-backward mechanism exciting the basilar membrane (through {{the activity of}} the outer hair cells) has been highlighted in previous works as responsible for remarkable amplification in the cochlea. A saturation phenomenon in the transduction process has further been pointed out as a significant nonlinear feature. In this work, a candidate nonlinearity is accounted for through the stretching effect in a one-dimensional string model of the basilar membrane. An asymptotic treatment of the partial differential equations of motion [...] including the space-delayed terms represented by the feed-forward and feed-backward outer hair cells forces [...] shows some properties of the nonlinear vibrational behavior of the basilar membrane which may pave the way to understanding some experimentally observed nonlinear features...|$|R

Segue sommario <b>in</b> <b>inglese.</b> This paper {{examines}} {{the challenge that}} the argument known as Bradley's regress poses to the friends of states of affairs (facts), in its requesting {{an explanation of the}} existence of a fact as a unitary whole in addition to its constituents. All the main theoretical options, short of denying that there are facts, are considered. It is argued that only two of them are viable, namely a Brute fact approach, according to which the existence of a fact cannot be explained with the typical tools of ontologists, and Fact infinitism, according to which, for any given fact, one should posit for explanatory purposes an infinite number of distinct states of affairs involving exemplification relations of higher and higher levels. Fact infinitism is defended against various objections and it is suggested that it should be preferred to the brute fact approach by those who are not too shy in vindicating for ontology a role, alongside with the empirical sciences, in the task of postulating entities in order to achieve explanations...|$|R

The other partners in the consortium were Adelphi Consult, IOEW Office Heidelberg, SPRU Sussex University and Valør & Tinge A/S. The fundamental aim of the Ever study has been to provide recommendations for the revision of these voluntary schemes: Emas and the EU Eco-label. In particolar, the Ever study aimed, on one hand, at delivering a critical appraisal of both the Emas and the Eco-label scheme: the study analysed the relevance (take up and use), the effectiveness (impact on production and consumption patterns) and the efficiency (including cost efficiency) of the two schemes. Furthermore, it identified the drivers and barriers of both voluntary instruments, and investigate their utility (appropriateness as policy instruments) and their viability. On the other hand, the study aimed at providing recommendations by detailing options for improvement: these options shall regard the instruments themselves, linkages between them and linkages to other related initiatives and policies. The options and recommendations proposed for the schemes are based on the evidence collected in the different phases of the Ever study: the ‘desk research’, consisting of a thorough review of existing literature and previous studies and surveys on the schemes, and the ‘in-field’ research, carried out by way of direct interviews and case studies, provided the background relating to their strengths and weaknesses.

The present work reports the results with water superficial velocities in the range 0. 95 - 3. 61 m/s and air superficial velocities in the range 0. 44 - 34. 5 m/s. Flow patterns were also visualised systematically by filming the flow patterns across the three pipes in each experimental run.
