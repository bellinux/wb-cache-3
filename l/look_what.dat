Stryper made their mainstream breakthrough in 1986 {{with the release of}} their platinum album To Hell with the Devil and brought Christian lyrics to their hard rock music style and glam metal looks. Two Pennsylvania bands, with Harrisburg's Poison and Philadelphia's Cinderella released multi-platinum début albums, respectively <b>Look</b> <b>What</b> the Cat Dragged In and Night Songs in 1986. Van Halen released 5150 their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the U.S. for three weeks and sold over six million copies. Additionally, some established hard rock bands of the era such as the Scorpions, Whitesnake, Aerosmith, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Judas Priest began incorporating glam metal elements into their sounds and images, as the genre's popularity skyrocketed in 1985-86.|$|E

500|$|On December 21, 1970, Presley {{engineered}} {{a meeting}} with President Richard Nixon at the White House, where he expressed his patriotism and his contempt for the hippies, the growing drug culture, and the counterculture in general. He asked Nixon for a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge, to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people {{and that it was}} therefore important he [...] "retain his credibility". Presley told Nixon that the Beatles, whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era, exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti-Americanism and drug abuse in popular culture. On hearing reports of the meeting, Paul McCartney later said he [...] "felt a bit betrayed" [...] and commented: [...] "The great joke was that we were taking [...] drugs, and <b>look</b> <b>what</b> happened to him", a reference to Presley's death, hastened by prescription drug abuse.|$|E
500|$|According {{to initial}} police statements, {{at this point}} {{one or more of}} the {{suspects}} began firing with semiautomatic handguns and Trooper Foerster fired four times before falling mortally wounded. At Acoli's trial, Harper testified that the gunfight started [...] "seconds" [...] after Foerster arrived at the scene. At this trial, Harper said that Foerster reached into the vehicle, pulled out and held up a semi-automatic pistol and ammunition magazine, and said [...] "Jim, <b>look</b> <b>what</b> I found", while facing Harper at the rear of the vehicle. At this point, Assata Shakur and Zayd Shakur were ordered to put their hands on their laps and not to move; Harper said that Assata Shakur then reached down to the right of her right leg, pulled out a pistol, and shot him in the shoulder, after which he retreated to behind his vehicle. Questioned by prosecutor C. Judson Hamlin, Harper said he saw Foerster shot just as Assata Shakur was felled by bullets from Harper's gun. Harper testified that Acoli shot Foerster with a [...]38 caliber semiautomatic pistol and then used Foerster's own gun to [...] "execute him". According to the testimony of State Police investigators, two jammed semi-automatic pistols were discovered near Foerster's body.|$|E

500|$|Following the defeat, the England {{selectors}} {{made several}} {{changes for the}} fourth Test; both Barnes and Jessop were left out. MacLaren favoured Jessop's inclusion but the selectors considered him unreliable. Although Barnes was not fully fit, later commentators suggested the selectors omitted him because of MacLaren's actions at Sheffield. A further player {{was added to the}} squad in case the pitch was affected by rain before the match, but rather than choosing Haigh, the leading wet-pitch bowler in the country, Hawke insisted that Sussex's Fred Tate was included—critics have suggested that Hawke wanted to prevent Haigh's absence from the Yorkshire team, of which Hawke was captain, given the unlikeliness of the extra bowler being needed. According to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, when MacLaren saw the list of players in the team, he responded: [...] "My God, <b>look</b> <b>what</b> they've sent me". MacLaren was angry with Hawke, and when it rained before the match, included Tate in the final eleven at the expense of George Hirst, a leading all-rounder. Gibson suggests that Tate was only included by the selectors [...] "because they thought MacLaren could not possibly pick him" [...] and so he could not make any further late changes to the team; MacLaren, according to Gibson, in turn included Tate out of spite. Other writers have suggested that MacLaren, as a Lancastrian, preferred a Sussex player to a Yorkshire one.|$|E
500|$|On 31 July 2009, Robson died of {{lung cancer}} at his home in County Durham, aged 76, after a long battle with the disease. After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of {{football}} and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a [...] "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." [...] Gary Lineker said, [...] "It is a sad day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." [...] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a [...] "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones.
