LKA 1 exhibits specificity towards α- 1, 4 and α- 1, 6 linkages and large amounts of reducing sugars are liberated from highly branched amylopectin and glycogen and linear amylose. LKA 2, on the other hand, shows high reactivity towards <b>lintner</b> <b>starch,</b> dextrin and amylase, although only small amounts of reducing sugars are liberated from branched substrates, such as amylopectin and glycogen. These enzymes share the four conserved segments of the catalytic domain found in {{other members of the}} family, but have some major variant amino acids within these segments. In addition, LKA 1 consists of an N-terminal starch-binding domain (SBD). This is the only α-amylase known to possess this N-terminal domain and it exhibits homology to the N-terminal SBD of Rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase. It shares no homology with the C-terminal starch-binding domains present in the cyclodextrin glucanotransferases, glucoamylases or α-amylases. The evolutionary tree based on the sequence alignment of SBDs reveals that the N-terminal SBDs are separated from the C-terminal SBDs...|$|E
40|$|N 1938 I DESCRIBED TWO METHODS for the assay of amylase in {{biologic}} material (1) and subsequently published excerpts of studies (2, 3) {{dealing with the}} kinetics of the saccharogenic action of the amylase {{that served as the}} basis for my first analytic procedure. The second method, which is based on the amyloclastic action, yields results that run quantitatively parallel with those obtained by the first method; its simplicity and rapidity recommend it as a convenient tool for clinical diagnostic tests. In the course of years I introduced some modifications in both methods, which are reported in this paper. The modifications are concerned with the preparation of the substrates, leaving the funda-mental elements of the two methods virtually unaltered; yet they contribute, I feel, to the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. METHOD BASED ON THE ESTIMATION OF SACCHAROCENIC ACTIVITY From the beginning I insisted upon the use of corn starch as asubstrate and raised objections to substitution by soluble starch because the latter (Lintner ‘s), prepared by partial acid hydrolysis of potato starch, contains a whole array of intermediate degradation products (among them reducing substances), the size and variety of which affect the rate of amylase action. Soluble starches vary in composition not only from manufacturer to manufacturer, but even from batch to batch originating from a single source: I have received a <b>Lintner</b> <b>starch</b> that gave (with iodine) the color of erythrodextrin...|$|E
40|$|Extracellular {{pullulanase}} (pullulan 6 -glucanohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 41) was purified from cell free culture supernatants of Thermoanaerobium Tok 6 -B 1 by {{ammonium sulphate}} precipitation, affinity precipitation, gel exclusion and ion exchange chromatography. A final purification factor of over 1600 was achieved. A molecular weight of 120 kD {{was determined by}} steric exclusion HPLC. Enzyme activity was specifically directed towards the 1 – 6 glucosidic linkages of pullulan resulting in 100 % conversion to maltotriose and also possessed activity towards 1 – 4 linkages of starch, amylopectin and amylose producing maltooligosaccharides (DP 2 -DP 4) as products. Maltotetraose was slowly hydrolysed to maltose. Values of K m (% w/v) were 7. 3 × 10 ⁻³ for pullulan, 2. 7 × 10 ⁻³ for amylopectin and 4. 7 × 10 ⁻³ for <b>Lintner's</b> <b>starch.</b> Pullulanase activity was resistant to 6 M urea and was thermostable at temperatures up to 80 °C (t 1 / 2 {{in the order of}} hours). Above 80 °C thermal denaturation was significant (t 1 / 2 = 17 min at 85 °C; 5 min at 90 °C) but became less so in the presence of substrate (pullulan or starch). Thermostability was greatest at the pH activity optimum (pH 5. 5) and was promoted by Ca²⁺ ions...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen gas, {{which is}} {{produced}} during fermentation {{in the human}} colon, is either excreted in breath or metabolised by gut bacteria {{through a variety of}} pathways. These may include methanogenesis, dissimilatory sulphate reduction, and acetogenesis. To determine which of these routes predominates in the large intestine, stools were taken from 30 healthy subjects and incubated as 5 % (w/v) slurries with <b>Lintner's</b> <b>starch.</b> In 23 of 30 subjects, methane production was the main method of hydrogen disposal. In the remaining seven, high rates of sulphate reduction were recorded together with raised production of H 2 S. All samples showed relatively low rates of hydrogen evolution and of acetate formation from CO 2 and H 2. Sulphate reduction and methanogenesis seem to be mutually exclusive in the colon and this is probably linked to sulphate availability. Sulphate reduction, methanogenesis, and acetogenesis were strongly influenced by pH. Sulphate reduction was optimal at alkaline pH values whereas methane production was maximal at a neutral pH and acetogenesis favoured acidic conditions. Faecal H 2 S values were related to carriage of sulphate reducing bacteria. These data show that a number of competing pathways for hydrogen disposal are possible in the large gut and that a variety of factors such as colonic pH and sulphate availability can determine which of these mechanisms predominates...|$|R
40|$|For lintners with {{negligible}} amylose retrogradation, crystallinity related inversely to starch amylose content and, {{irrespective of}} starch source, incomplete removal of amorphous material was shown. The latter was more pronounced for B-type than for A-type starches. The two predominant lintner populations, with modal degrees of polymerization (DP) of 13 - 15 and 23 - 27, were best resolved for amylose-deficient and A-type starches. Results indicate {{a more specific}} hydrolysis of amorphous lamellae in such starches. Small-angle X-ray scattering showed a more intense 9 -nm scattering peak for native amylose-deficient A-type starches than for their regular or B-type analogues. The experimental evidence indicates a lower contrasting density within the "crystalline" shells of the latter starches. A higher density in the amorphous lamellae, envisaged by the lamellar helical model, explains the relative acid resistance of linear amylopectin chains with DP > 20, observed in <b>lintners</b> of B-type <b>starches.</b> Because amylopectin chain length distributions were similar for regular and amylose-deficient starches of the same crystal type, we deduce that the more dense (and ordered) packing of double helices into lamellar structures in amylose-deficient starches {{is due to a}} different amylopectin branching pattern. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2015. Major: Food Science. Advisor: Alessandra Marti. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 131 pages. In this work, {{the roles of}} two universal features of starch biosynthesis were investigated to better understand their impact on starch molecular structure. To investigate the impact of diurnal photosynthetic activity on starch fine structure, normal and waxy barley were cultivated in a greenhouse under normal diurnal, or constant light photosynthetic conditions. The impact of starch branching enzymes on starch structure was investigated by studying the <b>lintners</b> of barley <b>starch,</b> which had all known genes coding for starch branching enzymes (SBE I, SBE IIa, SBE IIb) suppressed in the grain resulting in a novel amylose-only starch (AOS). The structure of AOS lintners was compared to lintners from normal barley starch (NBS) and waxy barley starch (WBS). Unexpectedly, NBS and WBS displayed growth rings regardless of lighting regimes. It was observed that the molecular structure and composition of (NBS) {{was influenced by the}} diurnal lighting regime, as NBS contained lower quantities of amylose, and a lower ratio of long chain amylose:short chain amylose (determined by gel permeation chromatography) when cultivated under the diurnal lighting regime compared to the constant light regime. While the composition of WBS remained constant, higher relative crystallinity values (determined by X-ray diffraction), and greater crystalline quality (determined by differential scanning calorimetry) were observed when cultivated under the diurnal lighting regime. When considering the fine structure of amylopectin from NBS and WBS, differences in structure were observed when cultivated under the different lighting regimes. The structure of clusters and building blocks of amylopectin were investigated following their isolation by partial and complete hydrolysis with α-amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Clusters of amylopectin from NBS and WBS cultivated under diurnal photosynthetic conditions were larger, and contained a greater number of building blocks compared to their counterparts cultivated in constant light conditions. AOS exhibited irregular morphological features and contained multi-lobed granules with a rough surface texture. When viewed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), acid hydrolyzed components of AOS displayed strong textured aggregates with an organization not previous seen in other specimens, whereas NBS and WBS displayed expected stacks of elongated elements with a width of 5 - 7 nm, believed to represent crystalline amylopectin side chains viewed longitudinally. High performance anion-exchange chromatography of lintners at equivalent levels of acid hydrolysis (45 wt%) revealed that the average degree of polymerization of the AOS lintner was 21, substantially smaller than that of NBS and WBS (42). While NBS and WBS lintners displayed size distribution and chain length profiles expected of those from barley <b>starch,</b> the AOS <b>lintner</b> displayed a unique size distribution profile wherein a repeat-size of the molecules corresponding to 5 - 6 glucose residue was observed, which corresponds to the approximate number of residues required per turn of the helical structure of amylose. These data suggests that both diurnal photosynthetic activity, and the suppression of all genes coding for SBEs had significant impacts on the structure of barley starch granules...|$|R
