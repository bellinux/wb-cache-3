5000|$|The <b>leaping</b> <b>bonito</b> (Cybiosarda elegans) is {{a species}} of {{saltwater}} finfish from the Scombridae (Mackerel) family. Scombridae includes such tribes as the mackerels, tunas, and bonitos - the latter of which, the Sardini tribe, this fish is a member. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Cybiosarda, which is therefore called a monotypic taxon. [...] Since the bonitos and tunas are close relatives, this fish has variously been referred to by such other common names as Australian tuna, striped bonito, and Watson's bonito.|$|E
40|$|Small juveniles of {{the nine}} species of scombrids in Australian waters are morphologically similar to one another and, consequently, {{difficult}} to identify to species level. We show that the sequence of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene region is {{a powerful tool for}} identification of these young fish. Using this method, we identified 50 juvenile scombrids collected from Exmouth Bay, Western Australia. Six species of scombrids were apparent in this sample of fish: narrow-barred Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta), frigate tuna (Auxis thazard), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), <b>leaping</b> <b>bonito</b> (Cybiosarda elegans), and kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis). The presence of Indian mackerel, frigate tuna, <b>leaping</b> <b>bonito,</b> and kawakawa is the first indication that coastal waters may be an important spawning habitat for these species, although offshore spawning may also occur. The occurrence of small juvenile S. commerson was predicted from the known spawning patterns of that species, but other mackerel species (Scomberomorus munroi, Scomberomorus queenslandicus, Scomberomorus semifasiciatus) likely to be spawning during the sampling period were not detected among the 50 small juveniles analyzed here...|$|E
30|$|Fourteen fishing trips {{took place}} during 2012 – 2013 (as {{detailed}} in Table  2), from which a total of 19 fish were individually captured by using rod and reel. The captured fish were handled with maximum care and placed in custom-designed tuna tubes for transport back to the holding tank at BIRC. Out of the 19 captured fish, 5 mackerel tuna and 3 <b>leaping</b> <b>bonito</b> (making out 42.1  % of the total fish) were transported alive to the holding tank during the 2013 fish migration season. Out of these, just 3 (15.8  % of total fish) acclimatized to the tank: 2 mackerel tuna survived for 11  months and 1 <b>leaping</b> <b>bonito</b> survived for 6  months. Fish were captured in 4 out of the 14 trips, the first of them occurred {{in the beginning of}} March 2012, and the rest during a 1 -month period, from mid-April to mid-May 2013. This distribution of captures demonstrates the narrow window of opportunities, when the fish are migrating through the region. The fourth fishing trip (March 01, 2012), in which six fish were easily and quickly captured at the most distant location (3  h boat ride north from BIRC), resulted in zero transport survival. Following that trip, it was concluded that to reduce transportation time, and thus increase survival chances, fishing efforts should focus on a maximum radius of 15  km, or 1.5  h boat ride from BIRC (map of fishing area presented in Fig.  5).|$|E
30|$|Two of the {{mackerel}} tuna that {{were introduced in}} the first batch, survived in the tank for 11  months, {{and one of the}} <b>leaping</b> <b>bonitos</b> survived in the tank for 6  months. The cause of the mortalities was unknown. Post mortem examination of one of the fish that was found in non-degraded state, revealed it was a sexually undeveloped male (GSI =  0.042  %), which grew to 1.4  kg and total length of 45.6  cm.|$|R
30|$|The {{transport}} of live fish {{is a crucial}} step to establish fish culture in captivity, and is especially challenging for species {{that have not been}} commonly cultured before, therefore transport and handling methods need to be optimized and tailored. This study describes the use of tuna tubes for small-scale {{transport of}} medium-sized pelagic fish from the Scombridae family. Tuna tubes are an array of vertical tubes that hold the fish, while fresh seawater is pumped up the tubes and through the fish mouth and gills, providing oxygen and removing wastes. In this study, 19 fish were captured using rod and line and 42  % of the captured fish were transported alive in the custom-designed tuna tubes to an on-shore holding tank: five mackerel tuna (Euthynnus affinis) and three <b>leaping</b> <b>bonito</b> (Cybiosarda elegans). Out of these, just three (15.8  % of total fish) acclimatized to the tank’s condition. Based on these results, we discuss an improved design of the tuna tubes that has the potential to increase survival rates and enable a simple and low cost method of transporting of live pelagic fish.|$|E
40|$|The Southern {{bluefin tuna}} (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii) {{is one of}} Australia’s most {{valuable}} aquaculture species, with total production valued at $ 153 million in 2012 / 2013. The aquaculture of SBT is currently based solely on capture of wild fish and as such, it is limited by fishing regulations quotas and seasonal variation in the fish availability. In order to provide sustainable, unlimited supply of SBT, novel and innovative methods are needed to successfully breed it in captivity, despite size and late maturation age limitations. Germ cell transplantation (GCT) is an innovative technology {{for the production of}} inter-species surrogates, capable of revolutionizing the aquaculture industry by facilitating easy handling, shorter generation time and a more economical management of large bodied broodstock, such as the SBT. This study aimed at developing the specific methods, molecular tools and knowledge to establish SBT surrogates for the SBT. Yellowtail kingfish (YTK, Seriola lalandi), was assessed as a potential surrogate host for GCT of SBT spermatogonial cells, to produce SBT donor-derived gametes upon sexual maturity. In order to achieve this objective, germ cell populations were described in testis of donor SBT males using basic histology and the molecular markers vasa and dead-end genes. The peripheral area of SBT testis was found to contain the highest proportions of dead-end-expressing transplantable type A spermatogonia (ASG). Percoll-enriched SBT testicular germ cells preparations were then transplanted into the coelomic cavity of 7 - 9 days post hatch YTK larvae. Fluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis have detected presence of SBT cells in the gonads of the transplanted YTK fingerlings at 18, 28, 39 and 75 days post transplantation (dpt), indicating that the transplanted cells migrated to the genital ridge and had colonized the developing gonad. However, further PCR and in situ hybridization analyses of YTK gonads at 165 dpt and PCR analysis of semen collected from sexually mature transplanted YTK males at 1. 5 years post transplantation, were not able to detect SBT germ cell-derived DNA or RNA, suggesting that the donor cells were not maintained in the hosts’ gonads. This study demonstrates that YTK larvae can support migration and colonization of transplanted SBT spermatogonial cells, despite the phylogenetic distance between the two species. Other species from the Scombridae family (which are phylogenetically closer to SBT) were considered as potential surrogate hosts for GCT of SBT spermatogonial cells, to increase the chances of successful development of the transplanted cells. A method for capture and transport of live pelagic Scombrid fish using “tuna tubes” was developed and optimized. Eight mediumsized mackerel tuna (Euthynnus affinis, also known as eastern little tuna or kawakawa) and <b>leaping</b> <b>bonito</b> (Cybiosarda elegans) were captured and transported alive to the holding tank at the Bribie Island Research Centre (BIRC), 3 of them acclimatized to the tank conditions. Twenty-eight additional small-sized blue mackerels (Scomber australasicus) were captured and transported alive to BIRC, using a 300 L rectangular transport tank, and were treated to induce spawning. None of the captured fish spawned in captivity, but the methods and equipment that were developed and optimized, proved useful for small-scale capture and transport of live Scombrids, as a preliminary step {{for the establishment of a}} potential surrogate host broodstock for the SBT. Key genes involved in the reproductive molecular pathway and specifically, germ cell development in the gonads, were described using transcriptome analysis of male and female SBT gonad cells, acquired by next-generation RNA-sequencing. Expression profiles of transcripts from ovary and testis cells were compared, as well as Percoll-enriched cell preparations (as used in GCT) to crude testis cells. ASG-specific genes were identified for the first time in SBT, and were used to develop molecular markers to allow specific identification and localization of different germ cell populations in SBT gonads. These SBT germ cell-specific molecular probes were used to distinguish between transplanted SBT germ cells and the YTK host endogenous cells in a GCT experiment. The methods, experience, tools and knowledge acquired in this study present for the first time the exciting possibility of GCT to produce inter-species surrogates for the SBT. The tools established in this research will enable the Australian aquaculture industry to continue and pursue surrogate technology for the SBT, as well as to other hard-to-breed, large and late-maturing highvalued species.
