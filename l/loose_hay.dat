40|$|Forty-two {{crossbred}} lambs sired by Suffolk rams and out {{of commercial}} fine-wool ewes were used. Twenty-one were implanted with 3 mgs. Stilbestrol each. Lambs averaged 24 days of age when started on test, February 17. They nursed their mothers until May 1, when all were weaned. A pelleted ration of 45 % sorghum grain, 2. 5 % soybean oil meal, 7. 5 % molasses, 45 % dehydrated alfalfa meal, and 10 mgs. aureomycin per pound was self-fed in a creep before lambs were weaned and in a self-feeder after that. <b>Loose</b> alfalfa <b>hay</b> was fed free choice {{in addition to the}} pellets...|$|R

60|$|Another hour passed, and Ralph {{began to}} grow sleepy. He laid down, and, making a pillow of some <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> {{in the bottom of}} the car, began to take it easy. In ten minutes more he was sound asleep.|$|E
5000|$|A beaverslide is {{a device}} for {{stacking}} hay made of wooden poles and planks that builds haystacks of <b>loose,</b> unbaled <b>hay</b> stored outdoors {{to be used}} as fodder for livestock. The beaverslide consists of a frame supporting an inclined plane up which a load of hay is pushed to a height of about 30 ft, before dropping through a large gap. The resulting loaf-shaped haystacks can be up to 30 feet high, can weigh up to 20 tons, and can theoretically last up to five or six years. It was invented in the early 1900s and was first called the Beaverhead County Slide Stacker after its place of origin, the Big Hole Valley in Beaverhead County, Montana. The name was quickly shortened to [...] "beaverslide." ...|$|R
40|$|Twenty four Najdi ram lambs, {{weighing}} {{an average}} of 42. 0 + 0. 6 kg were utilized in this experiment to evaluate the effects of various alfalfa hay particle lengths in the diets and frequency of feeding on nutrients digestibility, ruminal retention time, total mean retention time and transit time. Lambs were randomly placed in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of three dietary treatments: 9. 5 and 14 mm diets where alfalfa hay was processed to 9. 5 and 14 mm particle lengths, respectively mixed with 3 parts of concentrate and pelleted as total mixed ration and long hay diet where one part of <b>loose</b> alfalfa <b>hay</b> (17. 8 ± 2. 4 cm) was offered in combination with 3 parts of only-concentrate pellet and two feeding frequencies: once daily feeding at 0800 h and twice daily feeding in two equal portions at 0800 and 1500 h. All dietary treatments were homogeneous in their ingredient composition. Altering the particle length of alfalfa hay in diets {{did not affect the}} digestibility of DM or CP whereas digestibilities of ADF and NDF and ruminal retention time were 4. 2 and 5. 3 % units higher (p 0. 05) the lower tract retention time and transit time...|$|R
60|$|Tom had {{scarcely}} spoken {{when the}} shock came, and beams, boards, and shingles flew in all directions. It was a terrifying occurrence {{and not knowing}} {{what else to do}} the five boys dug into the <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> and threw themselves flat. Each felt as if {{the end of the world}} had come.|$|E

I heard somebuddy at the flyin' machine and sneaked up to see who it was. Hang my skin if a young feller wasn't there with a lighted candle an' some <b>loose</b> <b>hay,</b> and wantin' to start a fire close to the {{gasoline}} tank!

60|$|She {{entered the}} last room. There was no lock or bar upon the door. But {{the room was}} large and dark, and it was half full of bales of alfalfa hay. Probably it was the safest place in the house; at least time would be {{necessary}} to find any one hidden there. She dropped her valuables in a dark corner and covered them with <b>loose</b> <b>hay.</b> That done, she felt her way down a narrow aisle between the piled-up bales and presently crouched in a niche.|$|E
60|$|When {{she reached}} the wagon Alison found it covered by a heavy {{waterproof}} sheet which was stretched across a pole. <b>Loose</b> <b>hay</b> had been strewn between a row of wooden cases and {{one side of the}} vehicle and the space beneath the sheeted roof was filled with a faint aromatic odor, which she afterward learned was the smell of the wild peppermint that grows in the prairie grass. When she had spread one blanket on the hay the couch felt seductively soft, and she sank into it contentedly. Tired as she was, however, she did not go to sleep immediately, for it was the first night she had ever spent in the open, and for a time the strangeness of her surroundings reacted on her.|$|E
60|$|Ira reflected. He {{could also}} send {{them about their}} {{business}} if they thought of returning. He lifted his hat from the floor, took his rifle down carefully from its pegs, and slouched out into the road. Sue watched him until he was well away, then flew to the back door, stopping only an instant {{to look at her}} face in a small mirror on the wall,--yet without noticing her new prettiness,--then ran to the barn. Casting a backward glance at the diminishing figure of her husband in the distance, she threw open the door and shut it quickly behind her. At first the abrupt change from the dazzling outer plain to the deep shadows of the barn bewildered her. She saw before her a bucket half filled with dirty water, and a quantity of wet straw littering the floor; then lifting her eyes to the hay-loft, she detected the figure of the fugitive, unclothed from the waist upward, emerging from the <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> in which he had evidently been drying himself. Whether it was the excitement of his perilous situation, or whether the perfect symmetry of his bared bust and arms--unlike anything she had ever seen before--clothed him with the cold ideality of a statue, she could not say, but she felt no shock of modesty; while the man, accustomed to the public half-exposure in tights and spangles, was more conscious of detected unreadiness than of shame.|$|E
50|$|The hayloft {{is filled}} with <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> {{from the top of}} a wagon, thrown up through a large door, usually some 3 m or more above the ground, often in the gable end of the building. Some haylofts have slots or holes (sometimes with hatches), each above a {{hay-rack}} or manger in the animal housing below. The hay could easily be dropped through the holes to feed the animals.|$|E
50|$|On some farms the <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> was {{stored in}} a barrack, shed, or barn, {{normally}} {{in such a way}} that it would compress down and cure. Hay could be {{stored in a}} specially designed barn with little internal structure to allow more room for the hay loft. Alternatively, an upper storey of a cow-shed or stable was used, with hatches in the floor to allow hay to be thrown down into hay-racks below.|$|E
50|$|A hay barrack (haybarrack) {{is an open}} {{structure}} with a movable roof for storing <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> on a farm. Hay barracks were widespread in northern Europe in medieval times, {{also found in the}} Alps and North America, but are rare today. Early usage of this term was noted as being peculiar to New York state. Hay barracks were used in much of Europe and parts of colonial America, but were very common in the Netherlands, where they are called hooiberg or kapberg.|$|E
50|$|The {{fire was}} {{believed}} to have resulted from someone having accidentally thrown <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> on a match tub. Two or three American vessels lying at anchor off Leghorn were able to render valuable assistance, losing several men in the effort as the vessel's guns exploded in the heat. Captain A. Todd wrote several accounts of the disaster that he gave to sailors {{to give to the}} Admiralty should they survive. He himself perished with his ship. The crew was unable to extinguish the flames and at about 11am the ship blew up with the loss of 673 officers and men.|$|E
50|$|One <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> {{stacking}} technique {{seen in the}} British isles is to initially stack freshly cut hay {{into smaller}} mounds called foot cocks, hay coles, kyles, hayshocks or haycocks, to facilitate initial curing. These are sometimes built atop platforms or tripods formed of three poles, used to keep hay {{off the ground and}} let air into the center for better drying. The shape causes dew and rain water roll down the sides, allowing the hay within to cure. People who handle the hay may use hayforks or pitchforks to move or pitch the hay in building haycocks and haystacks. Construction of tall haystacks is sometimes aided with a ramp, ranging from simple poles to a device for building large loose stacks called a beaverslide.|$|E
50|$|When {{put to the}} vote, thirty-one members favoured implementation, while {{seventeen}} remained unconvinced. The {{wording of}} the notice depicted a significant change, for he would now base the final calculation upon his entire capital, inclusive of his outside investments. When later published, the balance sheet showed a profit of £1,715. He awarded £546 to his full-time workers, each of whom received £11. However, in {{the final year of}} the scheme, there were no further payments, primarily because of the blighting of the potato crop and the devastation caused by the ‘Great Fire’. The disastrous fire began after the gas works manager repaired a fault with a lighted candle. Although no one suffered injury, the subsequent explosion ignited a heap of <b>loose</b> <b>hay,</b> and quickly spread to the dutch barn, packed to the roof with the recent harvest. The intensity of the blaze was such that within half an hour the flames were visible to the inhabitants of Wigton. The insurance company paid damages of £1,000.Regarding co-operation, in many respects Lawson took a huge gamble. He was, in the words of George Jacob Holyoake, probably the only man in England prepared to commit his entire fortune to promote a scheme that many regarded as folly.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of {{the noise}} {{exposure}} of agricultural machine operators requires that machine operation time and intermittancy of work patterns be determined. One method of obtaining such data is by using event activity recorders. These data are available for haying machines operated at the University of Nebraska Field Laboratory, Mead during the 1963 through 1966 seasons. Approximately 60 machine operator days per season were recorded on service recorder charts for the following machines: 1. self-propelled windrowers 2. self-propelled and pull-type balers 3. self-propelled and pull-type bale wagons In addition some motion-time study data are available for the newer <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> stackers and large roll balers. One seasons data, 1965, has been analyzed for a self-propelled baler to illustrate the information already available. Machine operator time and intermittancy work patterns were determined for the 35 days of baling when activity charts were obtained. Briefly, the results are summarized as follows...|$|E
40|$|A {{summary of}} three years' {{study of the}} {{relationship}} of physical balance to the utilization of pelleted and nonpelleted fattening lamb rations was reported in Circular 358. Results of this work indicated the following: (l) the optimum ratio in nonpelleted lamb-fattening rations was 45 percent. concentrate to 55 percent roughage; (2) pelleted rations produced faster, more efficient ga. ins than nonpelleted rations' (3) pelleted rations consisting of 40 percent concentrate and 60 percent roughage produced gains as fast and as efficiently as pelleted rations of 50 percent concentrate and 50 percent roughage; and (4) field-cured alfalfa hay produced faster and more economical gains than dehydrated alfalfa when mixed and pelleted with a concentrate. This year's test was concerned primarily with finding the optimum concentrate to roughage ratio for pelleted lamb fattening rations and with determining the value of feeding <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> with a complete pelleted ration for lambs. The value of 3 -mg. stilbestrol implants also was studied...|$|E
40|$|New {{technology}} in hay handling and harvesting methods for stacking <b>loose</b> <b>hay</b> has been introduced. This {{new technology is}} in the form of two machines: (1) a large self-propelled mower-windrower combination and (2) a power-take-off operated stacking machine. One man can now mow and windrow the hay in one operation. The stack can then be made by one man, as the stacker is pulled through the field picking up hay from the windrow and elevating or blowing it into a stack-making container. The finished stacked can then either be dropped in the field or hauled to another location for unloading. This new technology will change the way farmers handle and harvest hay. Therefore, this thesis has the following primary objectives: 1. To evaluate the experiences of those who have adopted the completely mechanized haying systems. 2. To determine the acres and yields necessary to justify investment in the completely mechanized system. 3. To compare the costs of the mechanized system with the costs of alternative systems. 4. To develop a decision of criterion for the selection of the least expensive haying system. Advisor: Thomas L. Fre...|$|E
40|$|The thesis in {{the first}} part deals with the {{characteristics}} of major equipment as a source of coarse fodder for preservation. Given the difficult preservability is more prominent characteristic of legumes and their importance in the cultivation of coarse fodder. It describes the significance of clover-grass mixtures in the production of coarse fodder. Methods of harvesting and conservation of grassland biomass. It is also described silage corn, the preservability, harvest methods and importance in animal nutrition. Quality coarse fodder and the factors affecting it. Influence the quality of the biomass input on preservation processes. Furthermore, also deals with the procedures and principles of the production of silage, hay and silage, preservatives and finally summarizes the deterioration of the quality of silage and forage and impact deteriorated for receiving fodder and animal performance. The second part is focused on the monitoring of sensory properties and quality assessment laboratory conserved forage preservation in different ways - <b>loose</b> <b>hay,</b> hay bales, silage pits in silage, clover silage bales and silage in silage pits on lands selected agricultural cooperative.

40|$|The {{production}} of ventilated barn hay {{results in a}} high quality fodder for ruminants. Nevertheless, this production method is still a niche in Germany even it is found in organic farming. Reasons are the few publications about required investments of the needed technology for hay drying in the barn. This article provides investment and energy costs for different drying techniques: for box hay drying three different farm sizes were compared, for bale hay drying only one farm size is calculated. Bale hay drying demands more power and investment cost as box hay drying of <b>loose</b> <b>hay.</b> Bale drying {{is more complicated than}} barn drying in that the number of bale drying locations in a barn is a limiting factor to throughput, as is also the drying of densely packed bales. Barn drying is above all practical on farms where hay is the only forage on offer. Its particular advantage is the large amounts of crop that can be dried at the same time. Bale drying tends to be applied more on farms that want their forage partly as grass silage and partly as barn-dried hay...|$|E
