50|$|As European harps {{evolved to}} play more complex music, a key {{consideration}} was {{some way to}} facilitate the quick changing of a string's pitch {{to be able to}} play more chromatic notes. By the Baroque period, in Italy and Spain, more strings were added to allow for chromatic notes in more complex harps. In Germany in the second half of the 17th century, diatonic single-row harps were fitted with manually turned hooks which fretted individual strings to raise their pitch by a half step. In the 18th century, a <b>link</b> <b>mechanism</b> was developed connecting these hooks with pedals, leading to the invention of the single-action pedal harp.|$|E
50|$|Developments {{after the}} {{separate}} expansion valve {{led to more}} sophisticated valve gears that could achieve the same goal of varying inlet lap with a single valve. The first of these were the link valve gears, particularly the Stephenson link valve gear. This uses a pair of eccentrics with a sliding <b>link</b> <b>mechanism</b> between them {{that acts as a}} mechanical adding device. Selecting intermediate positions provides a valve actuation with the effect of increasing cut-off. As such valve gears also provided, and were first developed for, reversing, they were widely used on locomotives. Theoretically, the precise effect is that of reduced valve travel, rather than an earlier cut-off. This has the effect of reducing overall valve opening, reducing initial steam supply and so having the effect of wire-drawing rather than pure expansion. Despite this, the Stephenson gear became one of the two most-widely used gears for locomotives.|$|E

50|$|In shift {{operations}} using {{mechanical link}} mechanisms in rear-engined buses, the FCT detected {{the position of}} the shift lever and converted it into an electronic signal. These signals were then used to perform transmission changes using air pressure. This resulted in easy shift changes and reduced driver fatigue, and also reduced the weight of the <b>link</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A pseudo-reaction force was added to the operation to reduce driver discomfort. Moreover, elaborate fail-safe mechanisms were incorporated, such as one that prevented mis-shifts, and one that assured safe driving in the event of system failure. The FCT was used in MP series heavy duty route buses from November 1983 after basic research and multiple prototypes and practical tests over 10 years. It gained popularity in combination with measures to assist older drivers, and in the following year, it was applied to large heavy duty tour buses.|$|E

The anchor of the link is replaced by {{the contents of the}} destination node. One can close the destination node, which means that it is once again replaced by the text of the anchor. Thus, the basic method of navigation using Guide was the expansion button, in which a section was replaced when selected and in which an expansion would provide additional levels of detail. This allowed the user, whether they were a document author or a reader, to expand and contract a document, viewing the desired level at any time, not unlike viewing methods used in Adobe Acrobat files. Using this method means that the structure of the document must be strictly hierarchical.|$|E

40|$|There is an {{impressive}} body of research suggesting that transformational and charismatic leadership are positively associated with performance outcomes. The role of <b>linking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that facilitate the influence of transformational and charismatic leadership and the functioning of boundary conditions, however, is less well-understood. This dissertation {{is an attempt to}} address this research gap by providing three empirical studies analyzing <b>linking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and boundary conditions in the context of transformational and charismatic leadership on the individual and group level of analysis. This dissertation investigates two different performance outcomes (task and innovation performance) two <b>linking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (unit cohesion and commitment to change) as well as two distinct boundary conditions (positive affective tone and climate for initiative). Drawing on a sample of 206 units, Study 1 demonstrates that unit cohesion functions as a <b>linking</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the relationship between a transformational leadership climate and units’ task performance depending on positive affective tone as a boundary condition. Building on a sample of 196 employees, Study 2 reveals that transformational leadership is an antecedent of commitment to change and that its positive effect on followers’ innovation performance depends on a climate for initiative. Study 3 turns to charismatic leadership and explores the relative importance of trust in top management in influencing followers’ innovation performance. In a sample of 194 employees, results show that trust in top management has a stronger indirect effect through commitment to change on followers’ innovation performance than charismatic leadership. This dissertation shows that transformational and charismatic leadership have significant impacts on performance outcomes on the individual and group level of analysis. More importantly, the findings contribute {{to a better understanding of}} <b>linking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and boundary conditions in the transformational and charismatic leadership – performance linkage.
