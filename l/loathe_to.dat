5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is <b>loathe</b> <b>to</b> disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E
5|$|At this point, both armies {{began to}} draw apart; {{although}} sporadic fighting continued as night fell, by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex's plan to force {{his way past}} the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, <b>loathe</b> <b>to</b> give up the ground they had taken, fully expected the battle to continue. The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses {{and a lack of}} supplies, having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the battle to continue, he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards London.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy, {{which had}} {{recently}} received the German code books captured from the beached cruiser , {{was aware that}} an operation was taking place, but uncertain as to where the Germans would strike. Therefore, the Admiralty ordered David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, the six battleships of the 2nd Battle Squadron, {{and a number of}} cruisers and destroyers to attempt to intercept the German battlecruisers. However, Beatty's task force nearly ran headlong into the entire High Seas Fleet. At 6:20, Beatty's destroyer screen came into contact with the German torpedo boat V155. This began a confused 2-hour battle between the British destroyers and the German cruiser and destroyer screen, frequently at very close range. At {{the time of the first}} encounter, the Kaiser-class battleships were less than 10 miles away from the 6 British dreadnoughts; this was well within firing range, but in the darkness, neither British nor German admiral were aware of the composition of their opponents' fleets. Admiral Ingenohl, <b>loathe</b> <b>to</b> disobey the Kaiser's order to not risk the battlefleet without his express approval, concluded that his forces were engaging the screen of the entire Grand Fleet, and so 10 minutes after the first contact, he ordered a turn to port on a south-east course. Continued attacks delayed the turn, but by 6:42, it had been carried out. For about 40minutes, the two fleets were steaming on a parallel course. At 7:20, Ingenohl ordered a further turn to port, which put his ships on a course for German waters.|$|E

Willmarths war diarist noted that the Japanese planes seemed <b>loathe</b> <b>to</b> attack ships in the fueling area during daylight, probably because of the heavy concentration of anti-aircraft fire that could be directed at an attacker.|$|E

25|$|For Larkin {{the strike}} {{was seen as}} {{something}} of a triumph despite its unsatisfactory ending and it had served to establish his reputation. He would move south the following year and found that the authorities were frequently <b>loathe</b> <b>to</b> confront him, given his tough reputation and the spectre of the police mutiny that had accompanied the Belfast strike. As a result, Larkin enjoyed a high success rate in labour disputes until the Dublin Lock-out of 1913. The Sligo Dock strike of 1913 was one example of these successes.|$|E

25|$|The Democratic-Republican Party {{planned to}} have 72 of their 73 electors vote for both Jefferson and Burr, with the {{remaining}} elector voting only for Jefferson. The electors failed to execute this plan, so Burr and Jefferson were tied with 73 votes each. The Constitution stipulates that if no candidate wins a majority, the election is moved to the United States House of Representatives—which was controlled by the Federalists, at this point, {{many of whom were}} <b>loathe</b> <b>to</b> vote for Jefferson. Hamilton regarded Burr as far more dangerous than Jefferson and used all his influence to ensure Jefferson's election. On the 36th ballot the House of Representatives gave Jefferson the presidency, with Burr becoming vice president.|$|E
25|$|From the 1830s onwards, {{numbers of}} white {{settlers}} from the Cape Colony crossed the Orange River and started {{arriving in the}} fertile southern part of territory known as the Lower Caledon Valley, which was occupied by Basotho cattle herders {{under the authority of}} the Basotho founding monarch Moshoeshoe I. In 1845, a treaty was signed between the British colonialists and Moshoeshoe, which recognised white settlement in the area. No firm boundaries were drawn between the area of white settlement and Moshoeshoe's kingdom, which led to border clashes. Moshoeshoe was under the impression he was loaning grazing land to the settlers in accordance with African precepts of occupation rather than ownership, while the settlers believed they had been granted permanent land rights. Afrikaner settlers in particular were <b>loathe</b> <b>to</b> live under Moshoesoe's authority and among Africans.|$|E

[...] Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The variety of its cadaverous style is never less than inspired; never has the human skull's natural grin been redeployed so exhaustively for yuks." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying [...] "As an achievement in macabre visual wizardry, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride has to be reckoned some sort of marvel." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "Cinema's reinvigorated fixation with the living dead suggests {{that we are in the}} grip of an impossible longing, or perhaps it's just another movie cycle running its course. Whatever the case, there is something heartening about Mr. Burton's love for bones and rot here, if only because it suggests, despite some recent evidence, that he is not yet ready to abandon his own dark kingdom." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Corpse Bride sing, ultimately, is the breadth of imagination that it demonstrates; creating a cluttered, textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we're <b>loathe</b> <b>to</b> leave at the end." ...|$|E
