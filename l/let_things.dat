25|$|Whatever the {{promises}} {{and the costs}} of the many kinds of reform attempted by the Velasco government, the ship sank because of inadequate attention to balances between spending and productive capacity, and between export incentives and import demand. The Velasco government inherited recessionary conditions in 1968, with a positive external balance and productive capacity readily available for expansion. It maintained effective restraint on spending and deficits for several years but then <b>let</b> <b>things</b> get out of control. The central government's deficit was no more than 1 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1970, but its own deficit plus that of the greatly expanded group of state firms reached 10 percent of GNP by 1975. Correspondingly, the external current-account balance was positive in the period 1968-70 but showed a deficit equal to 10 percent of GNP by 1975.|$|E
25|$|Stieglitz's mother Hedwig died in November 1922, {{and as he}} {{did with}} his father he buried his grief in his work. He spent time with Paul Strand and his new wife Rebecca (Beck), {{reviewed}} the work of another newcomer named Edward Weston and began organizing a new show of O'Keeffe's work. Her show opened in early 1923, and Stieglitz spent much of the spring marketing her work. Eventually twenty of her paintings sold for more than $3,000. In the summer, O'Keeffe once again took off for the seclusion of the Southwest, and for a while Stieglitz was alone with Beck Strand at Lake George. He took a series of nude photos of her, and soon he became infatuated with her. They had a brief physical affair before O'Keeffe returned in the fall. O'Keeffe could tell what had happened, but since she did not see Stieglitz's new lover as a serious threat to their relationship she <b>let</b> <b>things</b> pass. Six years later she would have her own affair with Beck Strand in New Mexico.|$|E

When Heath telephoned Thatcher to inform {{her that he was}} going to sack Powell from the Shadow Cabinet, she recalled that she [...] "really thought that it was better to <b>let</b> <b>things</b> cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis". She believed that his main points about Commonwealth immigration were correct and that his selected quotations from his speech had been taken out of context. In a 1991 interview for Today, Thatcher stated that she thought Powell had [...] "made a valid argument, if in sometimes regrettable terms".|$|E

500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Illinois were written, recorded, engineered, and {{produced}} by Stevens, {{with most of the}} material being recorded at The Buddy Project studio in Astoria, Queens, and in Stevens' Brooklyn apartment. As with his previous albums, Stevens recorded in various locations, with additional piano recorded in St. Paul's Church in Brooklyn; strings and vocals performed in collaborators' apartments; electronic organ recorded in the New Jerusalem Recreational Room in Clarksboro, New Jersey; and vibraphone played at Carroll Music Studios in New York City. Stevens mostly created the album without collaboration, focusing on the writing, performance, and technical creation of the album by himself: [...] "I was pretty nearsighted in the construction of Illinois. I {{spent a lot of time}} alone, a few months in isolation working on my own and in the studio. I <b>let</b> <b>things</b> germinate and cultivate independently, without thinking about an audience or a live show at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Lloyd and {{the troupe}} made their début at a mission in Nile Street, Hoxton, in 1880 and {{followed}} this with an {{appearance at the}} Blue Ribbon Gospel Temperance Mission later the same year. [...] Costumed by Matilda, they toured local doss-houses in East London, where they performed temperance songs, teaching people the dangers of alcohol abuse. [...] Eager {{to show off his}} daughter's talent, John secured her unpaid employment as a table singer at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton, where he worked as a waiter. Among the songs she performed there was [...] "My Soldier Laddie". Together with her performances at the Eagle, Lloyd briefly contributed to the family income by making babies' boots, and, later, curled feathers for hat making. [...] She was unsuccessful at both and was sacked from the latter after being caught dancing on the tables by the foreman. She returned home that evening and declared that she wanted a permanent career on the stage. [...] Although happy to have her performing in her spare time, her parents initially opposed the idea of her appearing on the stage full-time. She recalled that when her parents [...] "saw that they couldn't kick their objections as high as [...] could kick [...] legs, they very sensibly came to the conclusion to <b>let</b> <b>things</b> take their course and said 'Bless you my child, do what you like'." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Heath telephoned Margaret Thatcher to {{tell her}} {{that he was going to}} sack Powell, she responded: [...] "I really thought that it was better to <b>let</b> <b>things</b> cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis". Heath sacked Powell from his Shadow Cabinet the day after the speech and he never held another senior {{political}} post. Powell received almost 120,000 (predominantly positive) letters and a Gallup poll at the end of April showed that 74 per cent of those asked agreed with his speech and only 15 per cent disagreed, with 11 per cent unsure. One poll concluded that between 61 and 73 per cent disagreed with Heath sacking Powell.|$|E

2500|$|Often {{translated}} as [...] "releasement," [...] Heidegger's concept of Gelassenheit has been explained as [...] "the spirit of disponibilité [...] before What-Is which permits us simply to <b>let</b> <b>things</b> be in whatever may be their uncertainty and their mystery." [...] Heidegger elaborated {{the idea of}} Gelassenheit in 1959, with a homonymous volume which includes two texts: a 1955 talk entitled simply Gelassenheit, and a 'conversation' (Gespräch) entitled Zur Erörterung der Gelassenheit. Aus einem Feldweggespräch über das Denken ("Towards an Explication of Gelassenheit: From a Conversation on a Country Path about Thinking" [...] or [...] "Toward an Emplacing Discussion [...] of Releasement : From a Country Path Conversation about Thinking"). An English translation of this text was published in 1966 as [...] "Conversation on a Country Path about Thinking". He borrowed the term from the Christian mystical tradition, proximately from Meister Eckhart.|$|E

What is all this other stuff?'". Franzen also hinted that the new novel would probably also be long, adding [...] "I've let go of any illusion that I'm a writer of 150-page novels. I need room to <b>let</b> <b>things</b> turn around over time and see them from the whole lives of other characters, not just the single character. For better or worse, one point of view never seems to do it for me."

Reinhart is of German, Irish, and Italian descent. Around the age of three, her parents would hold her up on stage and have her sing the chorus or vocal harmonies for [...] "Brown Eyed Girl." [...] She began singing seriously when she was 7 or 8 years old, performing with her parents’ band, Midnight, which covers rock songs from the 1960s and 1970s. Reinhart's mother was also the lead singer for a band called The Company She Keeps before she joined Midnight in 1977. When she was nine years old, Reinhart sang LeAnn Rimes' 1996 arrangement of Bill Mack's 1958 classic, [...] "Blue", on a big stage at a tattoo convention, and she was met with [...] "overwhelming" [...] support from the audience. She has been writing poetry since she was eight years old and has competed in many poetry slam competitions throughout her life.

2500|$|In August 2012, Chad sees rescuing the kidnapped Melanie as his [...] "last {{chance for}} a normal life" [...] after the deaths of Lexie and Stefano. [...] "Melanie has become his family," [...] Deidrick said. He {{described}} Melanie and Chad's reunion as an [...] "overpowering emotion for Chad." [...] When he discovers that Gabi is behind Melanie's kidnapping, Chad is so shocked that [...] "He doesn't {{really know what to}} do with the information." [...] However, Chad rationalizes keeping Gabi's involvement from Melanie because he [...] "doesn't want to make things worse," [...] thinking she's been through enough. In the meantime Chad does everything to cut Gabi out of his life; [...] "he pretty much exiles her," [...] Deidrick said. Chad focuses all of his attention on Melanie and becomes extremely [...] "protective." [...] Chad feels the need to shelter Melanie. However it is Chad's lying that leads to their break. Though Chad seems overprotective, Deidrick said that Chad is overwhelmed after losing Lexie and Stefano and he reacts the way any normal person would. According to Deidrick, Chad reaches his boiling point and lashes out in anger. Chad sudden decision to ask Melanie to marry is his attempt to regain control of his life and his relationship. When she dumps him, Deidrick believed it is Chad's compupance for trying to control everything. It takes time for Chad to sort through his feelings. Deidrick explained that Chad has dealt with just about everything since his introduction and those experiences have hardened him. After losing Melanie, Chad immediately sets his sights on revenge. However, when Chad is at the end of his rope, he has no choice but to turn to his family, which allows for the writers to develop Chad's relationship with EJ. Deidrick relishes in Chad's attempt to destroy Gabi's budding romance with Nick Fallon (Blake Berris). But Chad is kind of left in limbo after Burnett's departure. Though he trusts the writers, Deidrick realized that Chad needed to make a change. And suddenly, it started, as Deidrick found ways to challenge himself by portraying Chad's [...] "pain and vulnerability" [...] with everyone he comes in contact with. Chad has yet to understand that, [...] "You have to <b>let</b> <b>things</b> go," [...] said Deidrick, a motto that he lives by in his personal life.|$|E
