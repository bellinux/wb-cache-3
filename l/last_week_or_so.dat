500|$|In July 2015, Greg Berlanti, {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer on both series, said: We've just been breaking into it over the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> actually ... so we're, really, excited about it. We've got a great story lined up for {{towards the end of}} the fall, early winter. This year our real hope is to make a crossover that's even bigger, and even more rewarding for the audience than the last years. The scripts for the [...] "Heroes Join Forces" [...] crossover were written in September 2015. Berlanti created the story for the event, and Kreisberg and Guggenheim helped to craft the story of The Flash and Arrow episodes, respectively. The teleplay for The Flash was written by showrunners Aaron and Todd Helbing; Arrows was written by Brian Ford Sullivan and Guggenheim.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 2015 Oldfield tweeted, via his {{official}} Twitter account [...] "I am continuing {{to work on}} ideas for [...] "A New Ommadawn" [...] for the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to see if [...] the idea actually works." [...] On 8 May 2016, Oldfield announced via his Facebook group page that the new Ommadawn project with the tentative title of Return to Ommadawn is finished, and he is awaiting a release date from the record company. He also suggested that he may soon be starting work on a possible fourth Tubular Bells album.|$|E

6000|$|Alan {{paused for}} a second, irresolute. [...] "Herminia," [...] he said at last, leaning forward till his face {{was very close to}} hers, and he could feel the warm breath that came and went so quickly; [...] "that's very, very kind of you. I needn't tell you I've been {{thinking}} a great deal about you these <b>last</b> three <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> You have filled my mind; filled it to the brim, and I think you know it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not necessarily, {{though they}} are {{certainly}} steadier. This man may have orders for some special flour for which our grade of red is preferable, though he could, of course, get other wheat which would, no doubt, do almost as well. Still, prices have, at least, stiffened. It is {{what is called a}} rally, and it may <b>last</b> a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> though it is somewhat strange it should happen now, when everybody has wheat to sell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's good to {{hear you}} say that, Duge," [...] he said. [...] "I tell you we have come pretty near being scared the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> I feel a lot more {{comfortable}} fighting with you in the ranks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's been {{a regular}} {{procession}} of them fellers, the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> walkin' through the country," [...] replied Jerry. [...] "To-day's {{the first time}} any of them got to me. But I've heerd talk. Sunday when I was in Palmer the air was full of rumors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} very busy since I was last here," [...] Winifred admitted, {{and then turned to}} Hastings. [...] "Until the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> there has been no {{slackening}} in the rush to sell. Everybody seems to have been throwing wheat on to the market." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a {{wonderful}} comfort to me," [...] Lady Greendale said, [...] "that I have met hardly anyone that I know. The <b>last</b> three <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> I have met two or three people, but I only said that I was up in town for a short time. Of course, they asked after you, and I {{said that you were}} not with me, as you were spending a short time with some people whom you knew. We intend to go down home tomorrow." ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>last</b> three <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in Egypt {{have been}} {{extraordinary}} and inspiring. Thousands {{of ordinary people}} joined together peacefully to demand the end to a despotic and corrupt regime. It {{is far from clear}} what will come next in Egypt, but even that uncertainty should not take away from the events the whole world has just witnessed. Understanding events in Egypt, and what they mean for the future of that country and the broader Middle East is a challenge which requires the ability to look at the issue from different angles and to consider multiple, often conflicting, ideas at the same time...|$|R
2500|$|Afterward, during {{qualifying}}, forty-nine {{cars were}} entered, but only forty-three was able because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Sadler clinched his eighth pole position during his career, {{with a time}} of 27.363, his first since May, 2006 at Talladega Superspeedway. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Biffle. Edwards qualified third, Montoya took fourth, and David Ragan started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified seventeenth, while Hamlin was scored thirtieth. The six drivers that failed to qualify for the race were J. J. Yeley, Scott Riggs, Michael McDowell, Jeff Green, Josh Wise, [...] and Brian Keselowski. Once the qualifying session completed, Sadler commented, [...] "I’m feeling Superman today! I could sit here and say it is me, or this or that, but [...] Todd Parrott is the man. He can do so much as a crew chief. He is good for me from the mental side and we have been qualifying so much better here the <b>last</b> six <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so...</b> that is a really fast lap for me. I got all I can get out of it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I wish to God I {{knew why}} it should!" [...] he answered, almost bitterly. [...] "Do {{you know what}} a fool I have been making of myself for the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so?</b> I have given up my club and all my friends, refused every invitation, and spent all my time going about from {{restaurant}} to restaurant, café to café, hoping somewhere to come across you." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{little is}} {{revealed}} about Haruhis origins or her family, she cites a revelatory incident in her childhood when she attended {{a baseball game}} with her family. Before the event, Haruhi tended to think of herself and her life as being special and interesting, but {{the sheer number of}} people packed into the stadium (and her later calculations that this only represented {{a small fraction of the}} population of Japan) caused her to come to the conclusion that the events of her life likely fit into the normal, everyday occurrences and habits of Japanese citizens and humans in general. Her belief that there had to be at least one person in the world who lived a truly interesting and unique life, and her desire to be that person, led her to begin a search for the extraordinary. Throughout middle school she gained a reputation as an eccentric, for incidents including painting hieroglyphs on the school grounds, moving all of the schools desks out into the hallways, and going out with and then dumping every boy who asked her out. (Her excuse for quick relationships is that they were boring; the longest <b>lasted</b> a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> with the shortest being about five minutes.) ...|$|R
40|$|Methoxetamine (MXE) is a psychoactive {{substance}} distributed mostly via the Internet {{and is not}} liable to legal regulation in Poland. MXE has a toxicity profile {{similar to that of}} ketamine but longer-lasting effects. The paper describes a case of acute poisoning that resulted from recreational use of MXE and amphetamine and ended in death. In mid-July 2012, a 31 -year old man was admitted to the clinical toxicology unit in Gdańsk because of poisoning with an unknown {{psychoactive substance}}. The patient was transported to the emergency department (ED) at 5 : 15 a. m. in a very poor general condition, in a deep coma, with acute respiratory failure, hyperthermia (> 39 °C) and generalized seizures. Laboratory tests showed marked leukocytosis, signs of massive rhabdomyolysis, hepatic failure and beginning of acute renal failure. Despite intensive therapy, the patient died 4 weeks after the poisoning in the course of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. Chemical and toxicological studies of serum and urine samples collected on the poisoning day at 1 : 40 p. m. confirmed that amphetamine and MXE had been taken earlier that day. Concentration of amphetamine in the serum (0. 06 μg/ml) was within the non-toxic range, while MXE (0. 32 μg/ml) was within the toxic range of concentrations. Amphetamine was also detected in the patient's hair, which suggested a possibility of its use within the <b>last</b> dozen <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> The serious clinical course of intoxication and co-existence of amphetamine and MXE in the patient's blood and urine suggest the possibility of adverse interactions between them...|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't {{stand the}} Golden Lion any longer," [...] he explained. [...] "Somehow or other, the place {{seems to have}} changed in the most {{extraordinary}} manner' during the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> Everybody drinks too much there. The table-linen isn't clean, and the barmaids are too familiar. I've found out a little place in Jermyn Street where I go now when I have time. We can talk there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Though {{he could}} not see the man's face for the dark, Gallwey fancied he was a little disconcerted at this announcement. In another half-hour, however, they were sitting down to a meal. Leland said very little until it was over, when, taking his pipe out, he pulled a hide chair up to the stove and looked at the man. [...] "Whom have you had round the place the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> Jeff?" [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|John {{stood and}} watched the inspanning absently. In truth, he, too, was {{conscious}} of a sensation of regret. He felt ashamed of himself for it, but there it was; he was sorry to leave the place. For the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> he {{had been living in}} a dream, and everything outside that dream was blurred, indistinct as a landscape in a fog. He knew the objects were there, but he could not quite appreciate their relative size and position. The only real thing was his dream; all else was as vague as those far-off people and events that we lose in infancy and find again in old age.|$|E
6000|$|His heart {{leaped up}} into his throat, and {{forthwith}} descended as low as his boots. A call! Who? Why? He wanted to rush out on the landing and shout to the servant: [...] "Not at home! Gone away abroad!" [...] . Any excuse. He could not face a visitor. Not this evening. No. To-morrow. [...] . Before he could {{break out of the}} numbness that enveloped him like a sheet of lead, he heard far below, as if in the entrails of the earth, a door close heavily. The house vibrated to it more than to a clap of thunder. He stood still, wishing himself invisible. The room was very chilly. He did not think he would ever feel like that. But people must be met--they must be faced--talked to--smiled at. He heard another door, much nearer--the door of the drawing-room--being opened and flung to again. He imagined for a moment he would faint. How absurd! That kind of thing had to be gone through. A voice spoke. He could not catch the words. Then the voice spoke again, and footsteps were heard on the first floor landing. Hang it all! Was he to hear that voice and those footsteps whenever any one spoke or moved? He thought: [...] "This is like being haunted--I suppose it will <b>last</b> for a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> at least. Till I forget. Forget! Forget!" [...] Someone was coming up the second flight of stairs. Servant? He listened, then, suddenly, as though an incredible, frightful revelation had been shouted to him from a distance, he bellowed out in the empty room: [...] "What! What!" [...] in such a fiendish tone as to astonish himself. The footsteps stopped outside the door. He stood openmouthed, maddened and still, as if {{in the midst of a}} catastrophe. The door-handle rattled lightly. It seemed to him that the walls were coming apart, that the furniture swayed at him; the ceiling slanted queerly for a moment, a tall wardrobe tried to topple over. He caught hold of something and it was the back of a chair. So he had reeled against a chair! Oh! Confound it! He gripped hard.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the release}} of Neu! 2, Brain still {{expected}} the group to tour {{in support of the}} album, but the failure of the previous years tour prompted Dinger and Rother to seek a new backing band and tour venues. To this end, Dinger travelled to London with his brother Thomas to try and organise a Neu! tour there. Although the visit was planned to <b>last</b> only six <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> the Dinger brothers failed to return, staying for substantially longer. Despite this they achieved, in Dingers words, [...] "nothing," [...] having met both John Peel and Karen Townshend (wife of Pete) and presented them with copies of Neu!s debut, but - in spite of receiving an enthusiastic response from Peel, who played several tracks from the album on his BBC Radio 1 show - failed to drum up any commercial interest in the band. Meanwhile, in Germany, Michael Rother had travelled to the famous Forst Commune, in an attempt to recruit Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius of Cluster to play in an extended Neu! line-up. Rother, who unlike Dinger was interested in the Krautrock scene contemporary with Neu!, had been impressed by the track [...] "Im Süden" [...] from Clusters second album Cluster II. He at first envisaged a Neu!-Cluster super-group, containing Dinger, Moebius, Roedelius and himself. After an initial jam between Moebius, Roedelius and Rother at Forst (captured in the track [...] "Ohrwurm" [...] on Harmonias debut) Rother decided to stay at Forst and prepare a new album with Moebius and Roedelius as Harmonia, essentially abandoning his work with Dinger. Rother keeps a studio at Forst to this day. Whilst Rother was at Forst, the Dinger brothers returned from London. Whilst in London, Dinger too had come up with a solution to Neu!s problems, hoping to expand Neu!s line-up to contain his brother and studio engineer Hans Lampe. Lampe had worked as Conny Planks assistant throughout much of 1972, and was keenly interested in Neu!, having engineered Neu! 2 with Plank. Dinger began taking guitar lessons, in the hope that {{he would be able to}} take up the role of frontman in a new Neu!, with Rother on lead guitar and Thomas Dinger and Lampe both on drums: [...] "During the recording of NEU! 2 I realized that I had done everything that I could do with drumming ... I wanted to be more concreted and to reach more people." ...|$|R

60|$|That {{man was not}} {{altogether}} a stranger to me. For the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> I had been rather on the look-out for him in all the public places where in a provincial town men may expect to meet each other. I saw {{him for the first}} time (wearing that same grey ready-made suit) in a legitimist drawing-room where, clearly, he was an object of interest, especially to the women. I had caught his name as Monsieur Mills. The lady who had introduced me took the earliest opportunity to murmur into my ear: “A relation of Lord X.” (Un proche parent de Lord X.) And then she added, casting up her eyes: “A good friend of the King.” Meaning Don Carlos of course.|$|E
60|$|It {{was always}} the custom for such Austinians as went up to {{represent}} the School at the annual competition to stop {{the night in the}} town. It was not, therefore, till just before breakfast on the following day that Tony arrived back at his House. The boarding Houses at St Austin's formed a fringe to the School grounds. The two largest were the School House and Merevale's. Tony was at Merevale's. He was walking up from the station with Welch, another member of Merevale's, who had been up to Aldershot as a fencer, when, {{at the entrance to the}} School grounds, he fell in with Robinson, his fag. Robinson was supposed by many (including himself) to be a very warm man for the Junior Quarter, which was a handicap race, especially as an injudicious Sports Committee had given him ten yards' start on Simpson, whom he would have backed himself to beat, even if the positions had been reversed. Being a wise youth, however, and knowing that the best of runners may fail through under-training, he had for the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> been going in for a steady course of over-training, getting up in the small hours and going for before-breakfast spins round the track on a glass of milk and a piece of bread. Master R. Robinson was nothing if not thorough in matters of this kind.|$|E
60|$|I {{am writing}} this in Major Hapgood's office--it is bright and pleasant, only the dust here in Washington {{is a great}} nuisance. Mother, your shirts do first rate--I am wearing them; the one I have on to-day suits me better than any I have ever yet had. I have not worn the thin coat the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> as {{it has not been}} very hot lately. Mother, I think {{something}} of commencing a series of lectures and reading, etc., through different cities of the North, to supply myself with funds for my hospital and soldiers' visits, as I do not like to be beholden to the medium of others. I need a pretty large supply of money, etc., to do the good I would like to, and the work grows upon me, and fascinates me--it is the most affecting thing you ever see, the lots of poor sick and wounded young men that depend so much, in one word or another, upon my petting or soothing or feeding, sitting by them and feeding them their dinner or supper--some are quite helpless, some wounded in both arms--or giving some trifle (for a novelty or a change, it isn't for the value of it), or stopping a little while with them. Nobody will do but me--so, mother, I feel as though I would like to inaugurate a plan by which I could raise means on my own hook, and perhaps quite plenty too. Best love to you, dearest mother, and to sister Mat, and Jeff.|$|E
