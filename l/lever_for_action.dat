40|$|Abstract only. In {{his report}} the {{economics}} of ecosystems and biodiversity, P. Sukhdev compared the valuation of ecosystem services and biodiversity to a compass which helps decision makers {{to engage in the}} conservation of environment and against the loss of biodiversity. Following this road, the authors present the results of an economic valuation of marine ecosystems for a sampling of MPA in four West African countries (Senegal, Cape Verde, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau). These provide arguments on the importance of the valuation of Total Economic Value in promoting the conservation of marine ecosystems and stopping the loss of biodiversity. This paper shows how the valuation of marine ecosystems can help reconnect science and policy and provide a <b>lever</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> toward the conservation of marine ecosystems. In particular, the papers shows how non-use values (which compute both nonmerchant services from the ecosystems and the perception and attachment of populations to the marine ecosystems) can provide key testimonies on the need to promote the establishment and strengthening of MPA and provide further instruments to govern under uncertainty and help adapting to change...|$|E
40|$|Chlordecone, an {{organochlorine}} insecticide, {{continues to}} pollute soils in the French West Indies. The {{main source of}} human exposure to this pollutant is food. Root vegetables, which are staple foods in tropical regions, can be highly contaminated and are thus a very effective <b>lever</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> to reduce consumer exposure. We analyzed chlordecone contamination in three root vegetables, yam, dasheen and sweet potato, which are among the main sources of chlordecone exposure in food in the French West Indies. All soil types {{do not have the}} same potential for the contamination of root vegetables, allophanic andosols being two to ten times less contaminating than non-allophanic nitisols and ferralsols. This difference was only partially explained by the higher OC content in allophanic soils. Dasheen corms were shown to accumulate more chlordecone than yam and sweet potato tubers. The physiological nature of the root vegetable may explain this difference. Our results are in good agreement with the hypothesis that chlordecone uptake by root vegetables is based on passive and diffusive processes and limited by transport and dilution during growth.

40|$|To limit climate change, {{the use of}} {{renewable}} energy is increasing worldwide. Biomass energy presents great development opportunities, environmental systainability and also economic and social suitability. Biomass base energy projects are developing rapidly in forms of, for example, electicity generation plants, biogas plants ar local heating plants. Biomass resources for energy can either be provided by energy crops and residues or by forest products. Biomass resources avaibility studies are mostly based on large scale data (national or regional scales) and take into account mostly biophysical drivers (soil types, climate, etc.). Agricultural and forest biomass availability depends also on stakeholders decision (e. g. : farmers, forest owners) regarding practices choices (e. g. : choice of the crop, wood exploitation timing). The massive use of biophysical based models to assess biomass energy potential leads to misestimates that could either harm the food/non-food balance or the global energy supply system. The challenge is then to integrate stakeholder decisions in biomass availability models in order to describe more precisely the processes involved to assess a more realistic biomass potential and to manage to yield large scale results (Verbruggen et al., 2010). Tis integration raises methodological question: on the hand the integration of biophysicial and human based processes and, on the other and, the integration of multi-scale processes as stakeholers' decisions can be made at different level of organization (farm, cooperative, energy plant, etc) and influenced by different level of factors (farm management, global markets, etc.). Two examples of biomass availability assessment methods will then be presented. The first model {{is based on a}} statistical approach (supervised learning) allowing taking into account the real miscanthus location practices of farmers. The other model is based on the comprehension of municipalities' strategies regarding their municipality-owned forest. The first method is then more generic in terms of outscaling potential. The second one is more adapted to identify <b>lever</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> that could be applied to other cases. The complementarity of those two methods to assess land use changes linked with energy issues taking into account different scales will then be discussed...|$|E

By combining stakeholder theory, actor network theory and theoretical conceptualizations of knowledge transfer approach, our research proposes simultaneously to understand how each stakeholder is an actor in the event CSR process and the methods facilitating the construction and dissemination of CSR knowledge between them during the process. Our empirical methodology is based on a single case study carried out under a research contract (CIFRE) in Angers Expo Congrès, a company in charge of a convention centre and exhibition complex. In this context, we study two units of analysis: 1) the CSR approach of the organization and 2) the CSR approach of the tradeshow Sival. The results of our research identify and position the stakeholders in the event CSR change process. They also highlight the methods of collective action around the event CSR change process and the methods of inter-organizational knowledge transfer between stakeholders.

Nicotine is the major determinant of tobacco addiction, causing psychoactive pharmacological effects, which together with the genetic, social and environmental factors, learned or conditioned, are the substrate of smoking status. We conducted a retrospective study on a cohort of 535 smokers presenting to the Smoking Cessation Counseling Medical Office of the Iasi Clinical Rehabilitation Hospital between January 2009 -December 2012 aimed at studying the psychosocial and medical parameters associated with the vulnerability to nicotine addiction. The analyzed psychosocial factors were age, sex, marital status, absence or presence of other smokers in home and motivation to quit smoking. The measurable parameters of tobacco dependence were the number of previous attempts to quit smoking, the amount of cigarettes smoked (pack years), the carbon monoxide breath test, and score of Fagerström test for nicotine dependence. The {{results showed that the}} profile of the smokers with nicotine addiction who attempts to quit smoking is middle-aged men, married, with smoking partner, and severe chronic smoking expressed in a large number of pack years and elevated breath CO levels, and concern with his own health status.

40|$|AbstractComplexity is {{a useful}} frame of {{reference}} for disaster management and understanding population health. An important means to unraveling the complexities of disaster management is to recognize the interdependencies between health care and broader social systems and how they intersect to promote health and resilience before, during and after a crisis. While recent literature has expanded {{our understanding of the}} complexity of disasters at the macro level, few studies have examined empirically how dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure at the micro level influence community capacity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore empirically the complexity of disasters, to determine <b>levers</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> where interventions can be used to facilitate collaborative action and promote health among high risk populations. A second purpose was to build a framework for critical social infrastructure and develop a model to identify potential points of intervention to promote population health and resilience. A community-based participatory research design was used in nine focus group consultations (n =  143) held in five communities in Canada, between October 2010 and March 2011, using the Structured Interview Matrix facilitation technique. The findings underscore the importance of interconnectedness of hard and soft systems at the micro level, with culture providing the backdrop for the social fabric of each community. Open coding drawing upon the tenets of complexity theory was used to develop four core themes that provide structure for the framework that evolved; they relate to dynamic context, situational awareness and connectedness, flexible planning, and collaboration, which are needed to foster adaptive responses to disasters.

40|$|People trade favors {{when it is}} efficiency-enhancing to do so; {{will they}} also trade favors when it reduces efficiency? This dilemma may arise, for example, {{in a series of}} {{wasteful}} public projects where each project benefits an individual. We introduce the “Stakeholder Public Bad ” game to study this question. In each round, contributions to a common fund increase the earnings of one person (the “Stakeholder”) but reduce the earnings {{of the rest of the}} group so much that overall efficiency is reduced. The Stakeholder position rotates through group members and the promise of high Stakeholder rewards provides a <b>lever</b> <b>for</b> reciprocal <b>actions.</b> We hypothesize that some people will help a current Stakeholder by contributing in hopes of being rewarded later with a reciprocal gift. In a lab experiment, we find evidence of such favor trading. Favor trading does not increase public bad provision, but it could if the parameters or population were different. We show that information provision can enable efficiency-decreasing reciprocal acts. We also find that Stakeholders seem quite willing to sacrifice the good of the group to reap their own personal rewards, even when contribution decisions are public...|$|R

However, studies assessing {{the effect of}} facial mimicry on the recognition of emotion are still controversial.

The present study used the pathological model of PD to examine the role of facial mimicry on emotion recognition by investigating EMG responses in PD patients during a facial emotion recognition task (anger, joy, neutral). Our results evidenced a significant decrease in facial mimicry for joy in PD, essentially linked to the absence of reaction of the zygomaticus major and the orbicularis oculi muscles in response to happy avatars, whereas facial mimicry for expressions of anger was relatively preserved. We also confirmed that PD patients were less accurate in recognizing positive and neutral facial expressions and highlighted a beneficial effect of facial mimicry on the recognition of emotion.

40|$|The {{achievement}} of sustainable agriculture, economically viable, socially equitable, environmentally sound {{and capable of}} providing sufficient amounts of food in both quantity and quality for a population is a major challenge of agricultural research. In Guadeloupe, a French overseas territory located in the Caribbean, agriculture is currently facing some difficulties for reaching food self-sufficiency. Crop production weakly covers {{the needs of the}} population and consumers must buy expensive imported foodstuff. In this context, local and national decision-makers started thinking about the emergence of new local agricultural production in favor of food security by "the diversification of agricultural productions" towards local vegetables and fruits. However, achieving food self-sufficiency is highly complicated due to the multi-scale nature of this topic. Constraints for food crops cultivation can be found at each scale, the field with cropping systems not well adapted for the production of food crops, the farm with limited production resources, e. g. workforce, the region with a lack of water provision by specific water services. Agricultural policies can overcome these constraints by modifying {{the current state of the}} agricultural system at each spatial scale. In order to understand what would be the conditions for achieving food self-sufficiency, we built a static multi-scale bioeconomic model based on mathematical programming. This model simulates the decision process of 5336 farmers in Guadeloupe in terms of choice of cropping systems for their 25054 fields. A geographic database and activities compose the inputs of the model. The geographic database is built with a large range of geographical information encompassing the slope, the soil type, the altitude, the access to irrigation while the activities are a set of cropping systems determined by the expert knowledge of local farm advisers. that defined both allocation rules of the cropping systems at each spatial scale and mean outputs of cropping systems. A explorative scenario with new food crop systems at field scale, increased quantities of workforce at farm scale and extension of water provision areas at regional scale showed a large increase in food self-sufficiency. Such changes tested in our model appear as possible <b>levers</b> <b>for</b> <b>actions</b> that could be targeted by agricultural policies...|$|R
40|$|Analyses of yield gaps i. e. the {{difference}} between observed and attainable crop yields in a given location, have raised expectations of significant potential progress in crop productivity in sub-Saharan African countries. However, an important question remains unanswered: Are those biophysically-determined attainable yields possible given the socio-economic context of farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa? In this study, we explored the potential increase in efficiency of crop production given the diversity of farming systems and livelihood strategies for the case study of smallholder farmers in Malawi. We implemented a non-parametric frontier efficiency method, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which allows {{for the assessment of}} technical efficiency with respect to a production frontier. The frontier efficiency is based on best-performing farms in terms of input minimization and output maximization. Based on survey data of 102 households, we first built a typology of farming systems and distinguished two types, i. e. “maize-based smallholders under land pressure” (type 1) and “diversified crop-livestock producers” (type 2). By comparing results from farming system type-specific frontiers with those from an enveloping meta-frontier, we showed that the efficiency yield gap was overestimated by 13 % {{in the case of the}} meta-frontier approach. Moreover, based on observed farming system-specific livelihood strategies, we defined different directions for reaching the efficiency frontier. For type 1 farming system, we assumed efficiency increase through reduction of both labor and inputs. For type 2 farming system, as income was mainly derived from agricultural activities, we assumed that efficiency increase could be achieved through increase in outputs, i. e. total calorie production from all cultivated crops. We quantified efficiency scores and identified their determinants to provide more specific recommendations on the <b>levers</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> to increase efficiency of crop production. Common determinants for both farming system types were adult equivalents in the household and specific efficiency determinants were percentage of cultivated land and average walking time to fields for the type 1 farming system, and farmer's age and percentage of cultivated land allocated to groundnuts for the type 2 farming system. It is clear that maize-based smallholder farmers under land pressure have little room for improvement of crop yields, and assessing potential gains through more efficient input use is more appropriate than increasing crop yields per se. In this context, a more rational strategy for improving livelihoods is to stimulate labor markets for off-farm income, rather than pursuing increased crop production by closing the yield gap.

40|$|OOD {{has long}} been an {{explicit}} and implicit subject of both state and federal legislation in the United States. Federal legislation has addressed food safety through the regulation of content and labeling of food prod-ucts and regulation of the food production environ-ment (1). More indirectly, the Congress has promul-gated economic policies that subsidize many aspects of food production, ultimately affecting what foods are available to the consumer. Con-gress has also mandated and controlled federal programs such as the National School Lunch Program (2). States have enacted laws granting regulatory authority to state agencies that inspect and regulate food consumption. Many states also have statutory consumer protection laws that provide redress for individuals who have been injured by a food product. It is in these areas that legislatures have traditionally acted, and where legal <b>levers</b> <b>for</b> future <b>action</b> reside. Federal and state legislatures occasionally acknowledge the obesity epidemic, but little is being done to address the root causes of the problem. A long-standing tension, often styled as that between pater-nalism and individual liberty, pits public health against American individualism. Against a backdrop of government agriculture subsi-dies and economic protectionism, health is generally regarded as the sole responsibility of the individual consumer. The public and legisla-tures fail to recognize government and institutional responsibility for the current “toxic ” food environment. We provide a brief overview of the role of federal and state legislatures in mitigating the epidemic. Given the breadth of the subject, we have not attempted a compre-hensive analysis of legislation. Instead, we focus on three key domains: economic policy, federal programs, and food health and safety. W...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{budgets of}} {{agricultural}} systems give important information {{for assessing the}} impact of N inputs on the environment, and identify <b>levers</b> <b>for</b> <b>action.</b> N budgets of agro-ecosystems in the 27 EU countries are established for the year 2000, considering N inputs by fertiliser application, manure excretion, atmospheric deposition and crop fi xation, and N outputs by plant uptake, gaseous emissions, mineralisation, leaching and runoff. Country N budgets for agro-ecosystems {{are based on the}} models INTEGRATOR, IDEAg, MITERRA and IMAGE. Fine geographic distribution is depicted with the former two models, which have higher spatial resolution. INTEGRATOR is the only available model for calculating non-agricultural terrestrial N budgets systems. For EU- 27, the models estimate a comparable total N input in European agriculture, i. e. 23. 3 – 25. 7 Mton N yr− 1, but N uptake varies largely from 11. 3 – 15. 4 Mton N yr− 1, leading to total N surpluses varying from 10. 4 – 13. 2 Mton N yr − 1. Despite this variation, the overall diff erence at EU- 27 is small for the emissions of NH 3 (2. 8 – 3. 1 Mton N yr − 1) and N 2 O (0. 33 – 0. 43 Mton N yr− 1) but estimates vary largely at a regional scale. Th e estimated sum of N leaching and runoff at EU- 27 is roughly equal to the sum of NH 3, N 2 O and NOx emissions to the atmosphere, but estimates vary by a factor two, from 2. 7 to 6. 3 Mton N yr − 1. Trends in N fl uxes in agro-ecosystems since 1970 show an increase in N inputs by fertilisers and manure up to 1985, followed by a decrease since 1985 in response to a decrease in crop production and in animal numbers. Actually, livestock decreased since 1970, but in the period 1970 – 1985 the N input by manure excretion still increased due to an increase in N excretion rates. In non-agricultural system (forests and semi-natural vegetation), the estimated total N input is near 3. 2 Mton N yr − 1, while the net N uptake is near 1. 1 Mton N yr − 1, leading to a surplus near 2. 1 Mton N yr − 1. Compared to agricultural systems, the estimated N fl uxes in non-agricultural systems are about fi ve times lower for N 2 O emissions and 10 times lower for NO x and NH 3 emissions and for the sum of N leaching and runoff. The largest uncertainties in fl ux values, as estimated from inter-model comparison, concerns N leaching and runoff, followed by N 2 O emissions, from agricultural ecosystems. Recommendations: • Future research should focus on reducing the fl uxes with the most uncertainty (N leaching and runoff, followed by N 2 O emissions, from agricultural ecosystems), including studies on denitrifi cation. • To improve model assessments and enable model validation, databases should be set up of: (i) N contents in major crops/vegetation in various regions (to improve estimates of N uptake and N surplus), (ii) NH 3 and N 2 O emissions based on inverse modelling approachesJRC.

Notwithstanding, empirical evidence that supports social capital's role {{in the existence of}} health inequity is limited and inconclusive. Furthermore, social capital literature experiences important challenges with regard to (1) the level on which social capital is measured and analyzed; (2) the measurement of the concept in line with its multidimensional nature; and (3) the cross-cultural validity of social capital measurements. The Social capital and Well-being In Neighborhoods in Ghent (SWING) study is designed to meet these challenges. The collected data can be used to investigate the distribution of health problems and the association between social capital, health and well-being, both at the individual and at the neighborhood level. The main goals of the SWING study are (1) to develop a coherent multilevel dataset of indicators on individual and neighborhood social capital and well-being that contains independent indicators of neighborhood social capital at a low level of aggregation and (2) to measure social capital as a multidimensional concept. The current article describes the background and design of the SWING study. Methods/Design: The SWING study started in 2011 and data were collected in three cross-sectional waves: the first in 2011, the second in 2012, and the third in 2013. Data collection took place in 142 neighborhoods (census tract level) in the city of Ghent (Flanders, Belgium). Multiple methods of data collection were used within each wave, including: (1) a standardized questionnaire, largely administered face-to-face interviews for neighborhood inhabitants (N = 2, 730); (2) face-to-face interviews with key informants using a standardized questionnaire (N = 2, 531); and (3) an observation checklist completed by the interviewers (N = 2, 730 in total). The gathered data are complemented by data available within administrative data services.
