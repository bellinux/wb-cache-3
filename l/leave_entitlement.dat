50|$|When taking annual leave, {{employees}} {{were entitled to}} at least the basic pay rate they were on {{at the time of}} commencing the annual leave. It was possible for employees to request to cash out up to 2 weeks (or the pro rata equivalent for part-time employees) of their accrued annual <b>leave</b> <b>entitlement</b> every 12 months. However, this could only occur if a term in a workplace agreement specifically permitted cashing out. Requests to cash out annual leave had to be in writing and could be refused by an employer. An employer could not require an employee to cash out an entitlement to annual leave, or exert undue influence or pressure on an employee.|$|E
50|$|Leaveism (Leavism) {{is a term}} first coined in 2013 by Dr Ian Hesketh, a {{researcher}} at Lancaster University Management School in the UK, to describe the phenomena of employees using flexitime, annual leave, rest days and other <b>leave</b> <b>entitlement</b> schemes to have time off {{when they are in}} fact too unwell to go to work. He later extended this to include occasions whereby employees took work home and/or on holiday that they could not complete in paid working hours. Hesketh's research, which centred on well-being in the UK police service, sought to identify a lacuna in current thinking around Absenteeism and Presenteeism; of which there is a plethora of academic study and commentary. The aim of his studies was to highlight that the true extent of sickness absence may be masked by the practice of Leaveism, and {{that there may be a}} hidden populus experiencing significant workload overload.|$|E
5000|$|Initiatives {{were taken}} by Van Acker's fourth cabinet to expand social {{spending}} on pensions, housing, employment, and education. Steps were also taken to reduce the workweek and to reduce the term of compulsory military service from 21 to 18 months. A 45-hour workweek was introduced in 1955, and in 1956 a law was passed that doubled holiday <b>leave</b> <b>entitlement</b> from 6 to 12 days. Earnings-related pension schemes were introduced for manual workers (1955), seamen (1956), and white-collar workers (1957). Allowances were introduced in 1955 to cover demolition and rehousing while pension contributions were made obligatory in 1956. An Act of June 1954 increased the minimum pension and introduced index-lining of for pension benefits, while an Act of July 1957 introduced a wage-related pension formula for white-collar workers. Under the 1955 Collard Act, municipalities could only admit private schools “after they had created public-sector ones and only where there a need for them was felt.” New schools were also built, while in the 1956 budget, provision was made (for the first time) the purchase by the State of school supplies for “the benefit of pupils in primary and nursery-infant sections attached to State secondary education establishments." [...] In addition, a law of March 1958 made public authorities responsible {{for the cost of}} transporting (where necessary) abnormal and similarly handicapped children to special schools.|$|E

A father is more likely to take parental leave if he has a partner who is more highly educated or older. We also find that employment through a temporary working contract substantially lowers the chances that a man will take advantage of parental leave, while being employed in the public sector increases the likelihood that a man will use his parental <b>leave</b> <b>entitlement...</b>|$|E

40|$|A growing {{literature}} {{indicates that}} the representation of women in legislatures is positively associated {{with the passage of}} female-friendly social policy.

Yet, almost all advanced industrial democracies are parliamentary democracies, where policies typically originate within the cabinet and governments typically enjoy substantial control over the legislative process. Thus, to the extent that women promote female-friendly policy, women in cabinet positions should be ideally placed to do so, and indeed, possibly be more influential than women in legislatures.
