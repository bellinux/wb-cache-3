500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. It featured an unusual amount of animation glitches because the animation studio in Korea was training {{a new group of}} animators, and this episode was one of their first efforts. Show runner Mike Reiss said he will always remember it as the episode [...] "that came back animated with a thousand mistakes in it and was just a complete and utter mess." [...] Reardon said there was [...] "literally a mistake in every other scene" [...] when the episode came back from Korea. Several scenes had to be re-animated in the United States because of these glitches, but according to Reardon, [...] "you can still see the lesser ones that got through, such as <b>line</b> <b>quality</b> problems particularly in the first act." [...] Though it aired in season three, [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] was produced during the previous season. It was recorded in spring 1991 when the previous season came to an end, and was scheduled to air in autumn that year. The staff therefore had more time to fix the glitches during the summer.|$|E

Based on {{the ground}} {{penetrating}} radar's work mechanism, this article briefly introduces the working principle and the data processing method of ground penetrating radar detecting the tunnel lining. In view of the <b>lining</b> <b>quality</b> detection's characteristics, it summarizes a series of atlas reflection characteristic of the examination target such as the lining thickness, the backfill quality, the steel bar reinforcement situation, the adjacent formation structural feature and so on, and analyses and comments on them with project examples. The research believes that under appropriate working condition, as an important means to guarantee the construction security and maintain the tunnel health, ground penetrating radar technology can examine the <b>lining</b> <b>quality</b> fast and effectively, and {{meet the needs of}} the tunnel <b>lining</b> <b>quality</b> detection with suitable equipment, working method and data processing plan...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether kindergarten children possess the ability to recognize, match, and discuss <b>lines</b> and <b>line</b> <b>qualities.</b> Using graphics and art reproductions, three matching tasks were constructed which examined young children's awareness of the <b>line</b> <b>qualities</b> of length, width, straightness, direction, movement, and uniformity. Graphics and art reproductions were also used to construct two tracing tasks employed to examine young children's awareness of actual and implied lines. The tasks were administered to 69 kindergarten students from four elementary schools in a public school district in the north central Texas area...|$|R

However, Sunray Travel also registered the route, and remained operating it with ex-Countryliner buses throughout, also offering free travel while <b>Quality</b> <b>Line</b> were running. On Tuesday 16th, the Traffic Commissioner accepted Sunray's registration and rejected <b>Quality</b> <b>Line's,</b> meaning that Sunray could start charging fares and leading to <b>Quality</b> <b>Line</b> withdrawing its service.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Somali Civil War in 1991, the task of running schools in Somalia was initially taken up by community education committees established in 94% of the local schools (Ihebuzor, Noel 2005).

To address these concerns, the intellectual people established schools and most of these schools follow the national educational policy for primary, intermediate and secondary schools.|$|R
