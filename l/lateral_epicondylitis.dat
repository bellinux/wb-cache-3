40|$|Background: Tennis elbow is {{a common}} {{orthopedic}} disease affecting elbow in middle aged people. Ninety percent of patients are cured using conservative treatments. In the past, {{emphasis was placed on}} the use of long arm splints for its treatment; however, recent studies put doubt on the use of this method of treatment for the complications arising from the application of splints. The results of using long arm splints for the treatment of Methods: This was a case series non randomized clinical trial involving 25 patients treated with long arm castsplints, and 25 patients treated without the use of splint. Local corticosteroid injections and oral NSAIDs were administered for all patients. The two groups were compared in the third week, third month and sixth month of their treatment for the presence of local tenderness and pain in passive flexion test of wrist and fingers against resistance. Using SPSS 9. 0, data were analyzed via repeated measurements test of ANOVA Results: Patients in case and control groups had mean ages 43. 6 ± 7. 2 and 43. 6 ± 6 years, respectively. Prior to any treatments, all patients in this study suffered from pain and tenderness in the origin of forearm extensor muscles. Their pain exacerbated upon passive flexion of wrist and fingers against resistance. No significant difference was seen in third week, third month and sixth month (P value = 0. 32), and no significant difference was seen in the results of our tests regarding the presence of local tenderness and pain in passive flexion of wrist and fingers against resistance between the two groups Conclusions: After a follow-up period of six months, this study demonstrated no statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} treated with and without long arm splints.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade the {{clinical}} and anatomical studies proved that <b>lateral</b> humeral <b>epicondylitis</b> can be successfully treated arthroscopically. Purpose {{of the study is}} to identify the optimal method of surgical treatment for patients with <b>lateral</b> humeral <b>epicondylitis.</b> Material and methods. The authors conducted an integral study consisting of two sections: clinical and anatomical. Anatomical section included precision preparation of extensor muscles of the forearm. Clinical section was dedicated to comparative analysis of statistically valid and matched by lesion severity groups of patients who underwent open and arthroscopic procedures. All patients were divided into three groups. Patients of Group I underwent arthroscopic release of extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon (ECRB) without decorticating of the lateral humeral epicondyle. Patients of Group II underwent arthroscopic release of ECRB in combination with decortication of the lateral humeral epicondyle. Patients in Group III underwent an open release of ECRB. Results. Patients who underwent arthroscopic release of ECRB demonstrated less pronounced pain syndrome as compared to patients after ECRB release along with decortication of epicondyle or after open release (р< 0, 05). VAS pain score in Group I decreased from 7 to 1 point, in Group II — from 7 to 3 points, in Group III — from 7 to 4 points. Mean time until full recovery after the surgery was 24, 2 ± 7, 8 days in Group I, 39, 4 ± 5, 6 days in Group II and 60, 2 ± 15, 6 days in Group III (р< 0, 05). Functional outcomes were assessed by Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) in 9 weeks postoperatively: Group I — improvement from 60 to 79 points, Group II — from 62 to 75 points, Group III — from 60 to 75 points. Conclusion. Drilling or removal of periosteum of the damaged epicondyle does not provide a positive effect. Decortication also has certain disadvantages like postoperative pain intensification leading to lesser range of motion in elbow and increased bleeding of the wound. Patients after simple release of ECRB demonstrated minimal postoperative pain which allows early rehabilitation and return to daily and professional activities...|$|R

Measurement of the minimum anteroposterior diameter of the cervical spinal canal, the anteroposterior diameters of the cervical vertebral bodies, and the ratio of intervertebral disc height to adjacent vertebral body height in the cervical spine, however, showed a consistent trend to smaller measurements in the carpal tunnel group. Differences were significant at several vertebral levels in each of these dimensions.

40|$|This {{experiment}} investigated maximum forearm pronation and supination torques and forearm discomfort, for intermittent torque exertions in supine {{and prone}} forearm angles {{for the right}} arm. Twenty two subjects {{participated in the study}} that comprised two parts, the first of which involved measurement of maximum forearm torque in both twisting directions at five forearm angles including neutral. This was followed by endurance tests at 50 % MVC in both directions. The second part of the study involved subjects performing five minute long intermittent isometric torque exercises at 20 % MVC in both directions at eleven forearm angles. Regression equations were developed that accurately predict torques as a function of forearm angle expressed as a percentage of maximum motion. Analysis of the discomfort data for the intermittent isometric torque exertions indicated that both forearm angle and twisting direction significantly affected forearm discomfort (p< 0. 001). A significant two-way interaction (p< 0. 01) was identified between forearm angle and direction for supine forearm angles only. The results provide important strength and discomfort models for the design of tasks involving static or repetitive forearm twisting. Such tasks have a strong association with forearm injuries including <b>lateral</b> and medial <b>epicondylitis.</b> These results provide needed data on the risk factors associated with these injuries so they can be prevented.

40|$|Introduction : <b>Lateral</b> and medial <b>epicondylitis</b> {{associated}} with work activity {{is a common}} upper extremity musculoskeletal disorder with a prevalence of 4 – 30 % depending upon the work setting and diagnostic criteria. The influence of treatment, ergonomic factors, medical history, psychosocial variables, and aging on the improvement of symptoms has not been well defined. Methods : This was a prospective cohort study of a cohort of 45 workers with active elbow tendonitis {{for an average of}} 13 months. Complete resolution of symptoms was the defined outcome measure. Results : The predictive factors for persistent elbow tendonitis included older age (OR = 1. 1, 95 % CI: 0. 99, 1. 33), higher hand repetition level for their job(s) (OR = 2. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 00, 6. 25), more deviation from a neutral wrist position during the work activity (OR = 2. 0, 95 % CI: 0. 80, 5. 56), and lower perceived decision authority on the job (OR = 0. 9, 95 % CI: 0. 79, 0. 98). Other ergonomic, psychosocial, and electrophysiologic measures were not predictive. The models had relatively high sensitivity and specificity. Treatment effects could not be evaluated due to incomplete data available. Conclusions : Older workers with jobs requiring more repetition and awkward wrist postures, and less decision authority were less likely to have resolution of their elbow tendonitis. Implications : Workers at highest risk for persistent elbow tendonitis should be placed at jobs with lower repetition levels and that use more neutral wrist postures. Effective interventions must address both the ergonomic and psychosocial risk factors in a multifaceted approach to this problem...|$|R
40|$|Tennis elbow is {{a painful}} {{condition}} on {{and around the}} bony prominence on the lateral side of the elbow. This location gives tennis elbow its technical name: <b>lateral</b> epicondylal-gia or <b>epicondylitis.</b> It is a repetitive overuse injury pro-ducing microtears in the tendons that attach the extensor muscles to the epicondyle. In tennis players, it most often results from overload while performing a backhand stroke. Lateral epicondylalgia more likely occurs in unskilled ten-nis players who use a racket that is too stiff, who hit the ball late, who frequently “frame ” the ball, or whose forearm muscles are weak. Those who are older than 40 appear most susceptible. 33 Recent treatment modalities of lateral elbow epicondy-lalgia are evaluated {{on the grounds of}} evidence-based med-icine criteria. Systematic reviews have failed to identify evidence for the use of acupuncture, 6, 7 for the effectiveness of orthotic devices, 30 and for the effectiveness of physio-therapy or corticosteroid injection. 27, 28 The situation is par-ticularly frustrating regarding surgery, in which hardly any controlled trials exist. 1, 2, 11, 14 Concerning extracorpore-al shock wave treatment (ESWT), however, variable results have been reported in several prospective studies. † In 2002, Haake et al 9 published results of a large, double-blinded, prospective, randomized, multicenter study on lat-eral epicondylitis which examined the effects of active ESWT under local anesthesia compared to those of place-bo ESWT under local anesthesia.
