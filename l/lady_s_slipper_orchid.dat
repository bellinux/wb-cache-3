5000|$|Lady's <b>slipper</b> <b>orchids</b> (also {{known as}} lady <b>slipper</b> <b>orchids</b> or <b>slipper</b> <b>orchids)</b> are orchids in the {{subfamily}} Cypripedioideae, which comprises the genera Cypripedium, Mexipedium, Paphiopedilum, Phragmipedium and Selenipedium. They are characterised by the slipper-shaped pouches (modified labellums) {{of the flowers}} [...] - [...] the pouch traps insects so {{they are forced to}} climb up past the staminode, behind which they collect or deposit pollinia, thus fertilizing the flower.|$|R

40|$|Natural {{exposure}} of {{extremely low frequency}} electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) occurs in the environment and acts {{as one of the}} abiotic factors that affect the growth and development of organisms. This study was conducted to determine the effect of ELF-EMF on the tissue cultured banana and <b>slipper</b> <b>orchid</b> chlorophyll content as one of the indicators in measuring plant photosynthetic capacity. Four days old banana (Musa sp. cv. Berangan) corm and seven days old <b>slipper</b> <b>orchid</b> (Paphiopedilum rothschildianum) cultures were exposed to 6 and 12 mT ELF-EMF generated by controllable ELF-EMF built up machine for 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 hours. After exposure, the banana and orchid cultures were incubated at 25 ° C for 8 and 16 weeks, respectively. The results showed that the ELF-EMF exposure had different effects on banana and <b>slipper</b> <b>orchid</b> cultures though both plant species belong to monocotyledon. The highest increase in chlorophyll content on banana was resulted by the high intensity and long duration of ELF-EMF exposure (12 mT for 4 hours), whereas on <b>slipper</b> <b>orchid</b> the modest and short duration of ELF-EMF exposure produced the most excessive chlorophyll content. Different ELF-EMF exposures (12 mT for 4 hours and 6 mT for 30 minutes) had potential to be applied on each plant to improve in vitro plant (banana and <b>slipper</b> <b>orchid,</b> respectively) growth. The increased chlorophyll and carotene/xanthophyll content on banana indicated that the banana was more tolerant to ELF-EMF exposure compared to <b>slipper</b> <b>orchid.</b>  </p...|$|R

40|$|Intercontinental disjunctions between {{tropical}} regions, which harbor {{two-thirds of}} the flowering plants, have drawn great interest from biologists and biogeographers. Most previous studies on these distribution patterns focused on woody plants, and {{paid little attention to}} herbs. The Orchidaceae {{is one of the largest}} families of angiosperms, with a herbaceous habit and a high species diversity in the Tropics. Here we investigate the evolutionary and biogeographical history of the <b>slipper</b> <b>orchids,</b> which represents a monophyletic subfamily (Cypripedioideae) of the orchid family and comprises five genera that are disjunctly distributed in tropical to temperate regions. A relatively well-resolved and highly supported phylogeny of <b>slipper</b> <b>orchids</b> was reconstructed based on sequence analyses of six maternally inherited chloroplast and two low-copy nuclear genes (LFY and ACO). We found that the genus Cypripedium with a wide distribution in the northern temperate and subtropical zones diverged first, followed by Selenipedium endemic to South America, and finally conduplicate-leaved genera in the Tropics. Mexipedium and Phragmipedium from the neotropics are most closely related, and form a clade sister to Paphiopedilum from tropical Asia. According to molecular clock estimates, the genus Selenipedium originated in Palaeocene, while the most recent common ancestor of conduplicate-leaved <b>slipper</b> <b>orchids</b> could be dated back to the Eocene. Ancestral area reconstruction indicates that vicariance is responsible for the disjunct distribution of conduplicate <b>slipper</b> <b>orchids</b> in palaeotropical and neotropical regions.
