50|$|Panic Attack turned X-Terminator 2 over, {{and due to}} a spike {{that was}} {{attached}} to the front, it couldn't self-right. Panic Attack pressed the pit button, and rolled X-Terminator back on its wheels. X-Terminator 2 then drove on top of Panic Attack's <b>lifting</b> <b>forks,</b> and Panic Attack slowly pushed X-Terminator into the pit. Winner: Panic Attack.|$|R

In particular, Dolphin proposed a design of the lifting carriage of a masted <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> truck which applies a downward thrust to counteract the bending moment produced on the mast by the load on the load support The team also patented a solution to prevent <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> trucks having to keep repositioning to lift loads by designing a horizontally movable slide.|$|R

Heavy lifting is done by machines such as overhead cranes or <b>fork</b> <b>lifts.</b> Each worker typically performs one simple operation.|$|R

5000|$|Flying - The 1995 US Robot Wars event had {{a flying}} competitor: S.P.S. #2 was a lighter-than-air craft buoyed by three weather {{balloons}} and propelled by small electric fans.

Nearly invulnerable to attack, it won the first match against Orb of Doom (see reference below), but ventured {{too close to the}} arena floor in the second match and was dragged down and [...] "popped". Starting in 2016, BattleBots permitted the use of quadcopter drones as [...] "nuisance bots"; these typically proved hard to control, and one was memorably swatted out of the air by a rake that competitor HyperShock had attached to its <b>lifting</b> <b>forks.</b>|$|R

50|$|The lift tow is {{the most}} common modern method for short {{distance}} transportation. The casualty is winched onto a lifting grid and then raised by lifting the grid, with the casualty’s tires strapped to the grid. The grid is shaped like a large pair of spectacles, which accounts for the common name of this type of vehicle, the speclift or spectacle lift. With commercial vehicles, it is more common to use a set of <b>lifting</b> <b>forks</b> to attach to the suspension, axle or chassis of the casualty. In many cases, e.g., with automatics, it is the 'driven' wheels that need to be lifted. This will sometimes result in a rear lift, if the driven wheels are at the rear. In this case the casualty's steering must be locked in the straight ahead position.|$|R
