Why, I know'd you at Gargery's {{when you}} {{was so small}} a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked you away dead (as I'd {{thoughts}} o' doing, odd times, when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you hadn't found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the <b>leg-iron</b> wot Old Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year ago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like a bullock, as he means to drop you--hey?--when he come for to hear that--hey?" ...|$|E

Send me away how you will and where you will, send keepers with me with whips and chains, let them take me in a strait waistcoat, manacled and <b>leg-ironed,</b> even to gaol, but let me go out of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. I am {{speaking}} from the depths of my heart, of my very soul. You don't know whom you wrong, or how, and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell. By all you hold sacred, by all you hold dear, by your love that is lost, by your hope that lives, {{for the sake of the}} Almighty, take {{me out of this}} and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you understand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and earnest now, that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul? Oh, hear me! Hear me! Let me go, let me go, let me go!" ...|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{had been}} taken away from {{any part of the}} house. Neither, beyond the blowing out of the candle,--which stood on a table between the door and my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struck,--was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, {{excepting}} such as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when Joe picked her up, was a convict's <b>leg-iron</b> which had been filed asunder.|$|E

50|$|Realizing that a lynching was imminent, Wesley {{removed his}} boot and with it, the shackle of the <b>leg-iron</b> {{with which he}} had been {{shackled}} to Brown. Brown tied the loose end of the <b>leg-iron</b> to his leg with his bandana allowing him to run unencumbered. Smith, handcuffed to Wheeler, was able to slip the handcuff over his small hand resulting, unknown to the gathering mob, in all four being free. When the lynch mob came at 9 pm and opened the door, Brown burst through the startled lynch mob to an alley alongside the jail. As he ran past, he was blasted with both barrels of a shotgun at almost point blank range. He died being nearly torn in half. Wheeler ran about 100 yards before being horribly wounded in a barrage of gunfire but lived long enough to hang with Smith and Wesley shortly afterwards when the three were hung on an elm tree by the mob.|$|E
5000|$|Daytime DrinkingFirst sip: gentle as {{a stream}} overreaching,supple as a rope-bridge in the air;The second, {{long as the}} creak of floorboards,firm as a <b>leg-iron</b> clasp;The third, sudden as the trap door beneath you,the rudderless slide back to thirst. From Jilted City (2010) McGuinness {{published}} his first poetry collection, The Canals of Mars, in 2004. The book was translated into Italian (2006). In 2009 Alexandra Buchler and Eva Klimentova translated McGuinness' poems from The Canals of Mars and 19th Century Blues into Czech ...|$|E
