5|$|The outer <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{epidermis}} (outer skin) consists of: sensory cells; {{cells that}} secrete mucus, which protects the body; and interstitial cells, which can transform into {{other types of}} cell. In specialized {{parts of the body}} the outer layer also contains colloblasts, found along the surface of tentacles and used in capturing prey, or cells bearing multiple large cilia, for locomotion. The inner <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epidermis contains a nerve net, and myoepithelial cells that act as muscles.|$|E

5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona.

5|$|Hexagonal BN {{is used in}} xerographic {{process and}} laser {{printers}} as a charge leakage barrier <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photo drum. In the automotive industry, h-BN mixed with a binder (boron oxide) is used for sealing oxygen sensors, which provide feedback for adjusting fuel flow. The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride is {{also used}} in xerographic process {{as one of the}} <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photo drum.

Because of its good elastic properties, silicon nitride, along with silicon and silicon oxide, is the most popular material for cantilevers — the sensing elements of atomic force microscopes.|$|E

5|$|The central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, is {{an unusual}} type of blood vessel.

5|$|The heliosphere, the tenuous {{outermost}} {{atmosphere of}} the Sun, {{is filled with the}} solar wind plasma. This outermost <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfvénic—that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfvén waves, at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU).|$|E
5|$|The muscular <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{esophagus}} has {{two types}} of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E

5|$|According to Tchernov's 1962 paper, Passer predomesticus {{was found}} in the middle Acheulean (middle Pleistocene, {{probably}} more than 400,000 years old) layer E1 of the Oumm-Qatafa cave in Wadi Khareitoun near Bethlehem. In 1984, however, Tchernov wrote that P.predomesticus was about 140,000 years old, from the Yabrudian. Layer E1 contained remains of about 40bird species, including a premaxilla Tchernov described as a precursor of the Dead Sea sparrow (Passer moabiticus) and a tarsometatarsus and humerus tentatively allied with the house sparrow. An undetermined Acheulean <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same cave also contained fossils Tchernov described as precursors of both the house and Spanish sparrows.|$|E

30|$|Chemical pulp fibres are {{produced}} through chemical pulping where lignin and hemicellulose are extracted. Chemical pulp fibres have a surface, which is characterised {{by a particular}} pattern created by wrinkles and microfibrils in <b>the</b> outer <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fibre wall structure (Figure 1 a). <b>The</b> surface structure <b>of</b> chemical pulp fibres corresponds mainly to the primary and S 1 <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fibre wall, which are preserved during chemical pulping. Contrary to <b>the</b> outer <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fibre wall (primary and S 1 layers), the S 2 layer is characterised by having a structure of microfibrils organised in a helical manner [12].|$|R

The occupational categorization in Chirand covers three periods – Period I Neolithic (2500–1345 BC), Period II Chalcolithic (1600 B.C) and Period III Iron age.

5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Rhytismataceae. A {{widespread}} species, particularly in temperate areas, it colonizes the dead fallen leaves of vascular plants, particularly oak and chestnut. The fungus apothecia, which form in the epidermal <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaf host, resemble dark hexagonal spots scattered on a multi-colored mosaic pattern bounded by thin black lines. When mature, the apothecia open by triangular flaps to release spores. The anamorph form of C.dentatus is Tricladiopsis flagelliformis. Lookalike species can be distinguished by {{the shape of the}} apothecia, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
