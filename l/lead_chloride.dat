The main difficulty with working with beryllium was its high toxicity. A closed bomb was used to minimize the possibility of producing toxic beryllium dust. The process worked, but the high temperatures and pressures created by the magnesium sulphide meant that it was potentially explosive.

Kohl was used not only as a cosmetic but also as a medicinal collyrium (from Gr. kollurion). Two of kohl's <b>lead</b> compounds—the <b>lead</b> <b>chlorides</b> laurionite and phosgenite—were not natural to the Nile valley. It is believed they were intentionally synthesized by the ancient Egyptians for this purpose.
