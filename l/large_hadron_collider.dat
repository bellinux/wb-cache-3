30|$|However, data {{velocity}} {{not only}} challenges communication networks but also processing capabilities of a constant inflow of data streams [59]. Big data technologies have to process information in real-time (streaming processing). According to Dumbill [51] {{some level of}} analysis is necessary during the data inbound {{in order to keep}} storages levels practical. This can include on-the-fly data strips, compression or heuristics. For example, the <b>large</b> <b>hadrons</b> <b>collider</b> (LHC) generates more raw data than the CERN computing grid can store; thus data has to be instantly analysed [60]. This problem seems to be straightforward, but real-time analytics challenges traditional parallel and distributed computation [61].|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{the past}} decade, {{the demand for}} {{computing}} and storage power has increased tremendously. The huge amount of data is being generated by the real time systems; say for example the <b>Largest</b> <b>Hadron</b> <b>Collider</b> (LHC) built at the CERN physics laboratory generates about 10 Petabytes or 107 Gigabytes of data a year [1]. To manage such {{a large amount of}} data one needs to have huge storage and computational capacity. So, as meet such growing needs Grid Computing Middlewares are designed, on top of which one can develop a Grid Environment and manage this growing demand in a distributive fashion.

5|$|Low {{atomic number}} also makes {{beryllium}} relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, {{it is used}} to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the <b>Large</b> <b>Hadron</b> <b>Collider</b> (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the Tevatron and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety of}} high energy {{particle}} collisions was {{a topic of}} widespread discussion and topical interest during {{the time when the}} Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and later the <b>Large</b> <b>Hadron</b> <b>Collider</b> (LHC)—currently the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator—were being constructed and commissioned. Concerns arose that such high energy experiments—designed to produce novel particles and forms of matter—had the potential to create harmful states of matter or even doomsday scenarios. Claims escalated as commissioning of the LHC drew closer, around 2008–2010. The claimed dangers included the production of stable micro black holes and the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets, and these questions were explored in the media, on the Internet and at times through the courts.|$|E
