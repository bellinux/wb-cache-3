Lennon bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and a drum machine for Christmas in 1973, and {{encouraged}} Julian's interest in music by showing him some chords. [...] "Dad and I got on a great deal better then," [...] recalls Julian. [...] "We {{had a lot of}} fun, <b>laughed</b> <b>a</b> lot and had a great time in general when he was with May Pang.

500|$|J.R. Rotem, who {{previously}} produced a track for Minaj's debut album, originally conceived [...] "Marilyn Monroe". According to Minaj, [...] "He hit {{me up and}} he said, 'I have a song that I think only an icon can sing'. I was like, 'Oh J.R., shut up!' We <b>laughed</b> <b>a</b> little bit on iChat." [...] It was written by Minaj, Daniel James, Leah Haywood, Ross Golan and Rotem. Rotem and Dreamlab produced the track, with vocal production handled by Nicholas Cooper.

500|$|Lennon's {{relationship}} with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to Manhattan in 1971, Julian {{would not see}} his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian (and his mother) to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls {{that he and his}} father [...] "got on a great deal better" [...] during the time he spent in New York: [...] "We had a lot of fun, <b>laughed</b> <b>a</b> lot and had a great time in general." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Bender, conducted an interview with The Wall Street Journal following the airing of the episode, and spoke about filming the play with Arya in Braavos, stating [...] "I staged the whole play, we did it, and the producers came in to watch the rehearsal, including all the fart jokes, all that stuff, some of which was written. So, after we watched the rehearsal, and the guys <b>laughed</b> <b>a</b> lot, I said, 'My only concern is, am I mocking your brilliant show too much?' And they said, 'No, do it more!' They're completely unpretentious, David and Dan, and they loved it." [...] He also noted that several other extra scenes were filmed, but were cut from {{the final version of}} the episode, noting that they will likely be released as deleted scenes on the DVD for the season.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} former {{poet laureate}} Robert Pinsky as himself. Pinsky {{was chosen to}} guest star because the writers wanted an intellectual reference for Lisa, [...] and because they knew that Pinsky was {{a fan of the}} show, having read an article of The Time in which Pinsky stated that he [...] "admired the writing" [...] of The Simpsons. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Pinsky stated that he flew to the Simpsons recording studios in Los Angeles on September 10, 2001, and, following the September 11 attacks, was [...] "stranded" [...] there for four days, since no planes were flying following the attacks. Pinsky enjoyed his stay however; [...] "Ian [...] and The Simpsons people were very nice to me," [...] he said. [...] "... One of the things they did for me is they invited me to a table-read of another episode Thursday the 13th I remember everybody laughed like hell It felt really good. People just went to work and everybody <b>laughed</b> <b>a</b> lot." ...|$|E
500|$|Jenna Fischer {{stated that}} [...] "Health Care" [...] was her {{favorite}} episode of season one. Fischer {{went on to say}} that [...] "We <b>laughed</b> <b>a</b> lot while making this episode. Particularly during the scene where Dwight confronts everyone in the office about who has been writing fake diseases on their health forms. Rainn Wilson kept improvising new fake diseases, and we didn't know what he would say next." [...] Fischer notes that several of the scenes that involved laughing were not scripted and were in fact the casts genuine reaction to Wilson's fake diseases. The episode was rebroadcast on March 29, 2007 as part of a [...] "Human resources Nightmares" [...] marathon hosted by Paul Lieberstein. Lieberstein's character Toby Flenderson is the Human Resources Representative for the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, where The Office is set. [...] "Health Care" [...] was one of two first season episodes, the other being [...] "Hot Girl", to not contain commentary by members of the cast and crew on the season DVD.|$|E

500|$|Gilbert and Winnick co-wrote and co-designed the project, {{but they}} worked {{separately}} as well: Gilbert on programming and Winnick on visuals. As {{both of them}} enjoyed B horror films, they {{decided to make a}} comedy-horror game set in a haunted house. They drew inspiration from a film whose name Winnick could not recall. He described it as [...] "a ridiculous teen horror movie", in which teenagers inside a building were killed one by one without any thought of leaving. This film, combined with clichés from popular horror movies such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, became the basis for the game's setting. Early work on the game progressed organically: according to Gilbert, [...] "Very little was written down. Gary and I just talked and <b>laughed</b> <b>a</b> lot, and out it came." [...] Lucasfilm Games relocated to the Stable House at Skywalker Ranch during Maniac Mansions conception period, and the ranch's Main House was used {{as a model for the}} mansion. Several rooms from the Main House received exact reproductions in the game, such as a library with a spiral staircase and a media room with a large-screen TV and grand piano.|$|E
2500|$|Ethel Skinner was {{the second}} out of the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith (the first to be created was Lou Beale). Ethel {{was based on an}} elderly woman that Smith had encountered in a pub in Hackney. She had bright ginger hair, a face plied with make-up, she <b>laughed</b> <b>a</b> lot and was obviously [...] "the life and soul of the party". She also had a little dog, Willie, who she dressed in a red ribbon, tied in a neat bow on its head. Smith felt that a character like this would be an excellent inclusion to the show.

[...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me. She had one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in our part of the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she <b>laughed</b> <b>a</b> lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E
