5000|$|<b>Lomerizine</b> {{has also}} been shown to possess neuroprotective effects, {{specifically}} in the case of retinal damage. Doses of [...]03 mg/kg given intravenously as a pretreatment were shown to prevent glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, while also providing protection against NMDA-induced and kainate-induced neurotoxicity. <b>Lomerizine</b> was shown to have little affinity for NMDA or kainate receptors, so its protectivity against neurotoxicity in these cases is believed to be due to the blocking of Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels. [...] By blocking these channels and preventing Ca2+ release, <b>lomerizine</b> increases circulation in the optic nerve head. These effects show that <b>lomerizine</b> may prove to be a useful treatment for ischemic retinal diseases, such as glaucoma.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{lipophilic}} {{nature and}} small molecular size, <b>lomerizine</b> {{is able to}} cross the blood brain barrier. For delivery in aqueous systems, nanoparticle therapy may be used. Along with lipids, <b>lomerizine</b> is soluble in chloroform, methanol, and DMSO.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lomerizine</b> {{works as}} a calcium {{antagonist}} by blocking voltage-dependent calcium channels. [...] A study using 3HNitrendipine showed that <b>lomerizine</b> allosterically inhibits binding in calcium channels at a site different than the 1,4 dihydropyridine binding site. However, its antimigraine effects {{are believed to be}} due not to the blocking of calcium channels, but to the antagonizing effects of <b>lomerizine</b> on the 5HT2A receptor. The drug was shown to competitively inhibit binding of 3Hspiperone to 5-HT2A receptors, inhibiting the 5-HT driven release of Ca2+.Lomerizine treatment of 5-HT2A expressing cells led to the inhibition of Ca2+ release in response to 5-HT, while Ca2+ release in response to ATP was unaffected. By preventing the release of Ca2+, <b>lomerizine</b> prevents serotonin-induced contraction of the basilar artery, which can lead to migraines.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lomerizine</b> {{may cause}} {{drowsiness}} and flushing, but {{it lacks the}} serious cardiovascular effects and hypotension produced by other calcium antagonists.

5000|$|In a {{clinical}} study, long-term <b>lomerizine</b> usage {{was shown to}} be both safe and effective {{in the treatment of}} migraines.

5000|$|While some calcium-channel blockers, such as flunarizine, {{act on the}} dopaminergic system, <b>lomerizine</b> is {{ineffective}} in vivo at inhibiting the release of dopamine. However, {{it has been observed}} to weakly inhibit the binding of 3Hspiperone to D2 dopamine receptors in vitro. [...] While researchers are unsure of the reason for this difference, one hypothesis is that the doses administered cannot reach a high enough concentration in the brain to affect D2 receptors.|$|E
5000|$|Administered {{intravenously}} in rabbits at {{a dose of}} [...]03 mg/kg, {{the drug}} reached an average peak plasma concentration of 19.5 ± 6.5 ng/ml.

5000|$|<b>Lomerizine</b> {{also shows}} neuroprotective effects against {{secondary}} degeneration resulting from injury in retinal ganglion cells. In this case, increased membrane depolarization, {{in conjunction with}} the inability of the sodium-calcium exchanger to function due to depleted ATP stores, causes the activation of calcium-dependent signal transduction. These processes lead to cell death through either apoptosis or necrosis. [...] Lomerizine's role in blocking Ca2+ can rescue these cells from death by preventing excitotoxicity. Decreased intracellular calcium also prevents necrosis by decreasing permeability, and apoptotic death is reduced through the reduction of calcium-dependent apoptotic agents.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{report a}} rare case of benign {{paroxysmal}} vertigo (BPV) of childhood transitioning into basilar migraine (BM) that was effectively treated with <b>lomerizine.</b> A 6 -year-old male visited our hospital complaining of repeated attacks of vertigo for 3 months. The patient's vertigo attacks lasted {{for several hours}} and were accompanied by nausea, vomiting, intense fear and loss of consciousness. No nystagmus was observed during the vertigo attacks. Blood tests and imaging examinations revealed no abnormal findings. The results of electronystag-mography and the caloric test were unremarkable. Pure-tone audiometry revealed profound right-side sensorineural hearing loss. Among the differential diagnoses, delayed endolymphatic hydrops, epilepsy and BM were considered. Delayed endolym-phatic hydrops was considered unlikely since no nystagmus occurred during the vertigo attacks {{and there was no}} change in hearing; electroencephalography revealed no epileptic seizure waves. The attacks of vertigo were well-controlled with <b>lomerizine.</b> The patient was diagnosed with BM since the use of <b>lomerizine,</b> an agent for the treatment for migraine, was effective. Since it was reported that BPV is closely related to migraine and the onset of the vertigo attacks was accompanied by a loss of consciousness, we concluded that this patient had BM transitioning from BPV...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: After partial {{optic nerve}} (ON) injury, intact retinal {{ganglion}} cells (RGCs) undergo secondary death, but the topographic distribution of this death is unknown, {{and it is}} unclear which cell death pathways are involved. Although the calcium channel blocker <b>lomerizine</b> reduces RGC death after partial ON injury, it is unknown whether this drug alleviates necrotic or apoptotic death. METHODS: The dorsal ON was transected in adult Piebald-Virol-Glaxo (PVG) rats, and the site of secondary RGC death was determined using anterograde and retrograde DiI tracing. RGC death was assessed at 2 and 3 weeks. Retrograde tracing with fluorogold injected into the superior colliculus 3 days before euthanatization was used to identify RGCs undergoing secondary death. Overall cell loss was quantified using betaIII-tubulin immunohistochemistry. <b>Lomerizine</b> (30 mg/kg, oral) or vehicle was given twice daily, and retinal wholemounts were analyzed for necrotic morphology (nucleic acid stain) or anticleaved caspase- 3 expression at 2 and 3 weeks. RESULTS: Ventral retina was identified {{as the site of}} secondary RGC death, and central and dorsal retinae were defined as sites of both primary and secondary death. Overall RGC loss occurred by 2 weeks in central and ventral retina (P < 0. 05) and by 3 weeks in dorsal retina (P < 0. 05). Secondary RGC death was characterized mainly by necrotic morphology, with caspase- 3 expression in some RGCs. <b>Lomerizine</b> reduced secondary necrosis at 2 weeks and secondary caspase- 3 expression at 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Lomerizine</b> had differential effects on necrotic and apoptotic death with time, but its inability to completely prevent secondary death suggests that full neuroprotection will require combinatorial treatments.

30|$|Cyproheptadine {{hydrochloride}} (CH) {{is rarely}} {{used to treat}} adult patients with migraine in Japan because it causes sleepiness. In this study, we investigated the preventive effect of CH in 12 patients who had {{failed to respond to}} conventional preventive treatments among 103 migraine patients treated at our hospital. These 12 subjects had all received unsuccessful migraine prophylaxis with <b>lomerizine,</b> valproic acid and topiramate, or had discontinued these treatments due to adverse reactions. Initially, the subjects were given 4  mg CH before sleeping. In those who experienced no clinically significant sleepiness following the treatment, the drug was orally administered at 4  mg after breakfast as well (8  mg per day in total). Drug efficacy was evaluated by examining the frequency of migraine at one month and three months after the start of treatment. The frequency of migraine was dramatically reduced in all patients within 7 to 10  days after starting treatment. The average frequency of migraine during the three-month period was 2.6 episodes per month, representing a significant (p[*]<[*] 0.01) reduction from the pretreatment frequency of over 10 per month. Our results indicate that CH may be effective as a migraine-preventive treatment for patients in whom conventional drugs have been ineffective or have caused side effects. But this study is not a double blind randomized trial, and an open study with no control group.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- Purpose. <b>Lomerizine</b> {{dihydrochloride}} (LOM) is a Ca 2 + channel blocker {{used as an}} antimigraine drug, {{which is}} currently administered orally in Japan. We therefore investigated the effect of terpenes in propylene glycol (PG) solvent on the percutaneous absorption of LOM by hairless mouse skin. Methods. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) were carried out to analyze the effects of terpene enhancers on the biophysical properties of the stratum corneum (SC) of the skin. Results. Of the terpenes tested, the highest permeation rate of LOM (28. 8 g/cm 2 /h) was observed with 1, 8 -cineole, while nerolidol conferred the lowest enhancement of LOM flux (14. 2 g/cm 2 /h). ATR-FTIR studies revealed that terpenes/PG induced higher CH 2 stretching frequencies of SC lipids than PG alone. The extent of penetration of the lipophilic fluorescence probes Nile Red and DiI was measured by CLSM in in vitro skin permeation studies, using either PG or terpenes/PG as skin permeation enhancers. With PG alone, both fluorescence dyes were undetectable in the skin. In contrast, when co-administered with terpenes/PG, both probes were distributed into the intercellular space between corneocytes and detected in the deeper layers of the skin. SAXS measurements showed that in SC treated {{with a combination of}} 1, 8 -cineole and PG, the scattering peak of the SC was broad and very weak in intensity compared to untreated SC, whereas pretreatment with PG alone di...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{transcriptional}} regulator, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) /Rel {{family are}} involved in neuronal cell death and survival. Previously, we reported that NF-κBp 50 -deficient (p 50 -deficient) mice exhibit many features resembling human normal tension glaucoma (NTG). The developmental mechanism of human NTG is not clearly understood, and a radical curative treatment {{has yet to be}} established. Our aim is to elucidate the signal cascade which mediates the spontaneous optic neuropathy in p 50 -deficient mice as a model of NTG. Methods: To demonstrate the expression and activation of pro-apoptotic factors, which mediate the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in p 50 -deficient mice, western blot (WB) and luciferase reporter assays with retinas from p 50 deficient and wild type mice, and cultured RGC- 5 cells were performed. Furthermore, we tested the neuroprotective effects of chemical reagents (memantine, <b>lomerizine,</b> and tacrolimus) against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -susceptible RGC damage according to in vitro experiments with RGC- 5 cells. To elucidate the NF-κB-mediated death signaling, the effects of chemical reagents on spontaneous optic neuropathy were examined by histopathological studies. Results: WB experiments and luciferase reporter assays showed that NF-κB-inducible BCL 2 -associated X protein (Bax) and a pro-apoptotic factor, activated caspase 3 were expressed in the retina of p 50 -deficient mice as well as NMDA-treated RGC- 5 cells. Further, the constitutivelyactivecleaved forms of calcineurin (CaN), which havebeen reported to lead to apoptosis, were detected in the retina of p 50 -deficient mice as well as NMDA-treated RGC- 5 cells.

40|$|AIM: To {{research}} the neuroprotective effects of lomerizine(LOM) on retinal ganglion cells(RGCs) in the diet-induced obese C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. METHODS: Fifty-four mice were randomly {{divided into two}} groups which were fed a high-fat diet for 19 wk. One group mice were lavaged LOM by the dosage of 80 mg/kg daily at the same time. The obese mice were selected and divided into diet-induced obesity(DIO) group, diet-induced obesity and lomerizine(DIO+LOM) group. The mice in the control(CON) group were fed a basal diet. The ultrastructural changes of RGCs were detected by transmission electron microscope. The cellular apoptosis was detected by TUNEL. The laser scanning confocal microscope was used to measure intracellular calcium ion concentration. RESULTS: Compared with the CON group, the RGCs in DIO group showed smaller and condensation of nuclear chromatin and increased electron density of the cytoplasm, whereas the changes in DIO+LOM mice were obviously diminished. TUNEL staining showed that the number of apoptosis cells in the ganglion cell layer(GCL) increased in DIO group and the percentage of apoptotic cells was much higher than that in the CON groups(P P 2 + staining intensity of RGCs in DIO group increased and its staining intensity ratio was significantly higher than in CON group(P 2 + staining intensity and its staining intensity ratio in DIO+LOM group were significantly decreased than the DIO group(P CONCLUSION: <b>Lomerizine</b> has neuroprotective effects on damage of retinal ganglion cells in diet-induced obesity mice, which {{may be related to the}} attenuation of intracellular Ca 2 + overload...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a {{combined}} application of several ion channel inhibitors immediately after central nervous system injury can inhibit secondary degeneration. However, for clinical use, {{it is necessary to}} determine how long after injury the combined treatment of several ion channel inhibitors can be delayed and efficacy maintained. In this study, we delivered Ca 2 + entry-inhibiting P 2 X 7 receptor antagonist oxidized-ATP and AMPA receptor antagonist YM 872 to the optic nerve injury site via an iPRECIO@ pump immediately, 6 hours, 24 hours and 7 days after partial optic nerve transection surgery. In addition, all of the ion channel inhibitor treated rats were administered with calcium channel antagonist <b>lomerizine</b> hydrochloride. It {{is important to note that}} as a result of implantation of the particular pumps required for programmable delivery of therapeutics directly to the injury site, seromas occurred in a significant proportion of animals, indicating infection around the pumps in these animals. Improvements in visual function were observed only when treatment was delayed by 6 hours; phosphorylated Tau was reduced when treatment was delayed by 24 hours or 7 days. Improvements in structure of node/paranode of Ranvier and reductions in oxidative stress indicators were also only observed when treatment was delayed for 6 hours, 24 hours, or 7 days. Benefits of ion channel inhibitors were only observed with time-delayed treatment, suggesting that delayed therapy of Ca 2 + ion channel inhibitors produces better neuroprotective effects on secondary degeneration, at least in the presence of seromas...|$|E
