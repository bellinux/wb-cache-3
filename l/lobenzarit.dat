40|$|The {{protective}} effects of <b>lobenzarit</b> disodium against the toxicity of allyl alcohol were investigated in vitro using isolated rat hepatocytes and in vivo using mice. In mice, at i. p. doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg <b>lobenzarit</b> significantly decreased {{the activity of}} alanine amino transferase (ALT) in serum and the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver homogenates, {{both of which were}} increased by allyl alcohol at a dose of 64 mg/kg. At concentrations of 0. 2 and 0. 3 mM, <b>lobenzarit</b> reduced the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by 0. 4 mM of allyl alcohol in isolated rat hepatocytes. However, <b>lobenzarit</b> did not increase the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) depleted by allyl alcohol in any of the two experimental models. The {{protective effects}} of <b>lobenzarit</b> were dose- and concentration-dependent and they were most obvious when <b>lobenzarit</b> was administered 30 min before allyl alcohol. It is concluded that <b>lobenzarit</b> exerts the observed protective effects most likely by its antioxidant properties...|$|E
40|$|<b>LOBENZARIT</b> disodtulIl (CCA) {{is a novel}} {{immunomodulatory}} drug {{useful in}} the treatment of chronic inflammations. Its principal mechanism of action seems to be through enhancing the T suppressor/ T helper lymphocyte ratio. However, the molecular basis for these actions remains unclear. In this study it was found that CCA inhibits the production of guanosine 3 ’, 5 ’-cyclic monophosphate almost completely when present in concentrations of lmM. Further results demonstrated that such inhibition could also be explained by interference in constitutive nitric oxide generation. In addition to previous f’mdings, more insight into the molecular mechanism of action of CCA is provided...|$|E

40|$|Percolation {{theory is}} a {{multidisciplinary}} theory that studies chaotic systems. It {{has been applied}} in the pharmaceutical field since 1987. The application of this theory to study the release and hydration rate of hydrophilic matrices allowed for first time to explain the changes in release and hydration kinetic of swellable matrices type controlled delivery systems. The objective of the present paper is to estimate the percolation threshold of HPMC K 4 M in matrices of <b>lobenzarit</b> disodium and to apply the obtained result {{to the design of}} hydrophilic matrices for the controlled delivery of this drug. The materials used to prepare the tablets were <b>Lobenzarit</b> disodium (LBD) and HPMC of viscosity grade K 4 M. The drug mean particle size was 42 ± 0. 61 μm and the polymer was sieved and 150 - 200 μm granulometric fraction was selected. The formulations studied were prepared with different excipient contents in the range of 10 - 80 % w/w. Dissolution studies were carried out using the paddle method and the water uptake measurements were performed using a modified Enslin apparatus. In order to estimate the percolation threshold, the behaviour of the kinetic parameters with respect to the volumetric fraction of each component at time zero, was studied. According to percolation theory, the critical points observed in dissolution and water uptake studies are attributed to the existence of an excipient percolation threshold. This threshold was situated between (18. 58 to 24. 33 % v/v of HPMC). Therefore, the LBD-HPMC K 4 M matrices with a relative HPMC particle size of should be formulated with an excipient content above 24. 33 % v/v of HPMC, to obtain a control of the drug release from these systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{single dose}} of either cyclosporin-A (CsA) or <b>lobenzarit</b> (CCA) given with an arthrogenic {{adjuvant}} completely prevented expression of experimental adjuvant arthritis in rats. The {{aim of this}} study was to understand how these drugs prevented the arthritis expression by studying the popliteal lymph nodes draining the arthritic joints at various times after adjuvant injection. Neither drug affected the proliferation in popliteal lymph nodes at the time arthritis was normally expressed, however, there was a marked change in the types of cells present. Immunofluorescence assays showed a reduction in the proportion of CD 4 + cells, while the proportion of B-lymphocytes was almost doubled. This coincided with a marked elevation in the ability of these cells to produce interleukin (IL) - 6. At the same time production of other cytokines (IL- 2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN) -gamma) was not greatly affected. However, one day after adjuvant injection IL- 2 and IFN-gamma production was reduced. In vitro experiments showed that IL- 6 production by lymphoid cells was relatively unaffected by CsA and CCA but IL- 2, TNF and IFN-gamma were suppressed by CsA. The results indicate that CsA and CCA may modify the response to the arthritic adjuvant by specifically inhibiting IL- 2, TNF and IFN-gamma production at the time of adjuvant injection. The lack of inhibition of IL- 6 by these drugs reveals it may not play a key role in the initiation of this model of chronic inflammation...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{practical}} handicaps {{for the application of}} the percolation theory to estimate the percolation threshold of drugs in controlled release systems {{is the fact that the}} dissolution studies must be carried out so that only one surface of the tablet is exposed to the dissolution medium. The aim of this work is to estimate the percolation threshold of the antiarthritic drug <b>lobenzarit</b> dissodium (LBD) in inert matrices prepared with the excipients Ethocel® 100 and Eudragit® RS-PO (10 — 75 % w/w). Release assays were performed using the paddle method. The whole surface of the tablets was exposed to the dissolution medium. For the first time, a new mathematical method is developed to transform the amount of drug released in amount released per surface area in order to calculate the percolation thershold of LBD. The mathematical method proposed allows to calculate, using a new equation, the evolution of the mean surface area (O(t)). The new method was validated and three novel results were achieved: A constant value of (O(t)) at critical time (q) in the matrices (O(q) 1. 272 cm 2); a linear relationship between initial surface area (O(0)) and critical time; and a linear relationship between O(t) and time. Employing the values of O(t), it was possible to calculate for the first time, the percolation threshold (pc 1) for LBD in Ethocel® 100 (pc 1 0. 2800. 102) and Eudragit® RS-PO (pc 1 0. 3440. 07) matrices...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to estimate {{for the first time}} the percolation threshold of a new series of dextran (native dextran of high molecular weight [B 110 - 1 - 2, Mw= 2 × 106]), in matrices of <b>lobenzarit</b> disodium (LBD) and to apply the obtained result to the design of hydrophilic matrices for the controlled delivery of this drug. The formulations studied were prepared with different amounts of excipient in the range of 20 % to 70 % wt/wt. Dissolution studies were performed using the paddle method (100 rpm) and one face water uptake measurements were performed using a modified Enslin apparatus. The Higuchi, zero-order, and Hixson-Crowell models as well as the nonlinear regression model were employed as empiric methods to study the release data. Values of diffusion exponent 0. 563 <n< 0. 786 (Korsmeyer equation) for dissolution profile and water uptake mechanism 0. 715 <n< 1 (Davidson and Peppas equation) suggested anomalous or complex mechanisms. On the other hand, the contribution of the relaxation or erosion and of the diffusive mechanism in Peppas-Sahlin equation indicated that the main mechanism for drug delivery from tablets is swelling controlled delivery (Kr/Kd< 1). The critical points observed in kinetic parameters above 58. 63 % vol/vol of native dextran B 110 - 1 - 2 plus initial porosity in the LBD-dextran matrices with a relative polymer/drug particle size of 4. 17 were attributed to the existence of an excipient percolation threshold...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{estimate}} the excipient percolation threshold for a new combined matrix native dextran (DT), series B 110 - 1 - 2 (Mw 2 × 106) : HPMC K 4 M CR: <b>lobenzarit</b> disodium (LBD) system and demonstrate the advantages of this ternary system with respect to previously reported binary dextran:LBD and HPMC:LBD tablets. The formulations studied were prepared with different amounts of excipient (DT:HPMC, 4 : 1 (wt/wt) for all tablets and relative polymer/drug particle size of 4. 17) {{in the range of}} 10 - 70 % (wt/wt). Dissolution studies were carried out using the paddle method (100 rpm) and one face water uptake measurements were performed using a modified Enslin apparatus. The Higuchi's models as well as the non-linear regression were employed as empiric methods to study the released data. Values of diffusion exponent 0. 588 < n < 0. 784 (Korsmeyer equation) for dissolution profile and water uptake mechanism 0. 715 < n < 0. 960 (Davidson and Peppas equation) suggests anomalous or complex mechanisms in all cases. The critical points in ternary tablets were reduced from 44. 75 % (v/v) of excipient (correspond to purely native dextran) to 22. 34 % (v/v) (corresponding to mixture native dextran:HPMC, 4 : 1, wt/wt). The initial porosity (IP) of hydrophilic matrices above the values of 20 % has an important influence on the percolation threshold as well as on establishment of the gel barrier responsible for the controlled release from the DT:HPMC:LBD tablets...|$|E
