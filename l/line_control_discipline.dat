40|$|ABSTRACT: Imagery {{acquired}} from amateur cameras {{has become an}} important data source for volunteered geographic information. The derived 3 D information for objects from the images can, thus, be employed in spatial modeling. The first step for the 3 D object reconstruction is the orientation modeling for images. However, the direct georeferencing capability of those amateur cameras is not always available or accurate enough. Thus, the control information is needed in precision positioning. Line features provide topological information for orientation modeling. Artificial building edges in 3 D GIS database {{can be used for}} <b>line</b> <b>control.</b> However, the <b>line</b> features are deformed because of the large lens distortions on amateur cameras imagery. The distortions might interfere the feature line extraction. Thus, this paper analyzes the influence of lens distortion to object-image feature <b>line</b> <b>control</b> for orientation modeling. The major works in this study contain line feature extraction and object-image feature <b>line</b> <b>control</b> orientation modeling. Considering that a majority of buildings are composed of straight lines, we use straight line features as <b>line</b> <b>controls</b> for orientation modeling. The test data includes several simulated images with different lens distortion. The extracted image feature lines are used as <b>line</b> <b>controls</b> in the orientation modeling. 1...|$|R

50|$|Discipline is the {{suppression}} of base desires, and is usually understood to be synonymous with self-restraint and <b>control.</b> <b>Discipline</b> is when one uses reason {{to determine the best}} course of action regardless of one's desires, which may be the opposite of excited.

40|$|AbstractA {{state space}} {{model for a}} class of Large Homogeneous {{communication}} networks with Markovian access <b>control</b> <b>disciplines</b> is considered. It is assumed that each user has a finite or infinite buffer. Asymptotic analysis of the resulting stochastic finite-difference equations reveals the following, previously unknown properties common to all networks in this class: (i) the load line is an algebraic curve of order N, where N is {{the length of the}} buffers; (ii) for N = ∞, the average steady state buffer occupancy is yS = y 1 (1 − y 1) where y 1 is the intersection point of the load and transmission lines; an analogous expression is derived also for N < ∞; (iii) the local stability of a steady state is determined by the slopes of the load and transmission lines. Numerical experiments are described to support these findings. The results of this paper give {{a solution to the problem}} of dynamic analysis of Large Homogeneous communication networks with Markovian access <b>control</b> <b>disciplines</b> if the steady state is unique. The case of multiple steady states is considered in Part II...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The basic {{configuration}} and operation modes {{of the series}} extended-range electric vehicle were analyzed and a new method of engine choice and fuel economy evaluation was proposed. A co-simulation platform is set up with Cruise and Matlab/Simulink to evaluate the rule-based engine on-off and optimal operation <b>line</b> <b>control</b> strategies. The simulation results with typical driving cycles illustrate that: firstly, the engine on-off control strategy makes engine and generator operate on their best efficiency points, and its fuel economy is better than optimal operation <b>line</b> <b>control</b> strategy; secondly, when the optimal operation <b>line</b> <b>control</b> strategy is adopted in Extended-Range Mode, the engine downsizing will be beneficial and the extended-range electric vehicle (E-REV) will achieve a better fuel economy and control effect...|$|R
