40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{political}} mantras to-day is that education is the handmaiden of economic growth and prosperity.

Population ageing which is set to hit many OECD and non-OECD economies over the next few decades will also increase the pressure on individuals and firms to invest more in upgrading their skills and competences in order to maintain productivity growth and living standards in the future.

40|$|Abstract To {{assess the}} {{prospects}} of comprehensive health care reform during the Clinton administration, we must examine {{the changes that have}} occurred in the politi-cal and structural contexts in which reform is debated. The political context includes the status {{of the health care system}} itself as well as public attitudes and voting patterns associated with health care reform; it may be friendlier now to reform than it has been in any previous period, but it cannot on its own produce policy change. The struc-tural context, the representational community of organized interests and government institutions, is the means by which politics is either thwarted or translated into action. Changes in these organized interests and in Congress have transformed the health care reform policy community from an “iron triangle ” dominated by an antireform alli-ance of medicine, insurance, and business to a more loosely bound policy network in which a reform coalition may now be able to prevail, especially under the direction of an activist president <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton.</b> I consider three hypotheses: The first claims that, despite the apparent structural changes, the core power relationships will remain the same as in the past, and the antireform alliance either will continue to block polic...|$|E
40|$|Women {{constitute}} {{more than}} half of the world’s population. It is widely claimed that empowering women has transformational effects on development and humanity in general – women empowerment has positive implications on, among other things, food security, global health, poverty reduction, education, climate, environment, and overall sustainable global development. It was therefore not a surprise that “to promote gender equality and empowering women” featured prominently in the eight Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations. Sadly, despite the tremendous implication of the role of women on ensuring sustainable global development and the worldwide recognition of the same, the reality is that women comprise the majority of world’s economically disadvantaged groups. It was against this background that the Bangladeshi economist, Muhammad Yunus, received high recognition when he in the 1970 ’s boldly declared that he had found the magic bullet namely microcredit, which he claimed has the capacity to help “end poverty on the planet once and for all”. The claimed potentials of microcredit were highly convincing and its development implications on women were double – it would not only empower them, but also move them out of poverty. As a result development institutions worldwide including the United Nations, high profile personalities, academic scholars and celebrities <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Bono and Jeffrey Sachs all bought into the microcredit idea. However, in recent times, the claim that microcredit empowers women and reduces poverty has been heavily contested - some development practitioners and academic scholars are producing mountain of evidence to the contrary. Despite the contestation, the number of microcredit institutions worldwide keep on increasing making the need for further studies on the implications of microcredit on women’s empowerment imperative. This study sought to assess the extent to which the provision of microcredit lead to women empowerment...|$|E
