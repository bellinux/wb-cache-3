5|$|Unlike in Ellendale and Georgetown, the Millsboro–South and Milford {{proposals}} faced strong opposition. In the Millsboro–South area, DelDOT's preferred alternative, the Blue Alternative, was {{an eastern}} bypass that would diverge from existing US 113 north of Selbyville; {{pass to the}} east of Frankford and Dagsboro, cross the Indian River, and parallel DE 24 west to rejoin US 113's present course north of Betts Pond north of Millsboro.

40|$|Agriculture {{requires}} {{large amounts}} of land. Food consumption patterns have large effects on these agricultural <b>land</b> <b>requirements.</b> This study assessed the relationship between consumption patterns and <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> for food. Firstly, it calculated the land needed to produce individual foods. Secondly, it assessed the <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> of food consumption patterns. The study observed large differences among requirements for specific foods. Especially livestock products, fats and coffee have large <b>land</b> <b>requirements.</b> The data obtained were applied to assess <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> related to food consumption patterns. The study showed that expenditure {{and the use of}} specific foods can change rapidly over time and result in shifts in related <b>land</b> <b>requirements.</b> A rise or fall of <b>land</b> <b>requirements,</b> however, depended on the original consumption pattern. Patterns based on animal foods shifting towards market foods containing more vegetable foods required less land. This dietary change direction was shown for Dene/Métis communities in Canada. Patterns based on vegetable foods shifting toward diets containing more livestock and beverages required more land. This change direction was observed in the Netherlands. Per capita <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> for food differed among countries. Requirements for US consumption were 34 % larger than for the European mean, mainly caused by differences in meat consumption. In Europe, Portugal showed the smallest per capita land requirement (1814 m 2), Denmark the largest (2479 m 2). The Danish pressure was mainly caused by a large consumption of beer, coffee, fats, pork and butter. The observed trend toward food consumption associated with affluent life styles will bring with it a need for more land. This will cause competition with other claims, such as infrastructural developments, ecological forms of agriculture, energy crops, and food production for the world market. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{governments of}} Brazil and India are {{planning}} a large expansion of bioethanol and biodiesel production in the next decade. Considering that limitation of suitable land and/or competition with other land uses might occur in both countries, assessments of potential crop productivity can contribute to an improved planning of <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> for biofuels under high productivity or marginal conditions. In this paper we model the potential productivity of sugarcane and jatropha in both countries. <b>Land</b> <b>requirements</b> for such expansions are calculated according to policy scenarios based on government targets for biofuel production in 2015. Spatial variations in the potential productivity lead to rather different <b>land</b> <b>requirements,</b> depending on where plantations are located. If jatropha is not irrigated, <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> to fulfill the Indian government plans in 2015 would be of 410000 to 95000 km(2) if grown in low or high productivity areas respectively (mean of 212000 km(2)). In Brazil <b>land</b> <b>requirements,</b> are of 18000 - 89000 km(2) (mean of 29 000 km(2)), suggesting a promising substitute to soybean biodiesel. Although future demand for sugarcane ethanol in Brazil is approximately ten times larger than in India, <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> are comparable in both countries due to large differences in ethanol production systems. in Brazil this requirement ranges from 25 000 to 211000 km(2) (mean of 33000 km(2)) and in India from 7000 to 161000 km(2) (mean 17000 km. Irrigation could reduce the <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> by 63 % and 41 % (24 % and 15 %) in India (Brazil) for jatropha and sugarcane respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Land {{for food}} {{production}} is limited. We investigate how land demand for food develops as populations grow, diets change and agricultural practices become more intensive. The Philippines provide an excellent case: during the 20 th century population grew tenfold implying similar increases in basic dietary needs. To quantify occurring changes, we link average dietary patterns to their arable <b>land</b> <b>requirements.</b> For this, we utilize data on population, dietary patterns and crop yields from 1910 to 2003. While average per capita food supply improved during the century, {{the amount of}} land required to feed a person declined, albeit not continuous: it was at about 2500 m(2) in 1910, at 2000 m(2) in 1960, at 1000 m(2) in 1985. and did not change greatly since then. Accounting for population growth, this translates to a fourfold increase in total land required for food from 1910 to 2003. When investigating what drove the observed developments at national level, we find {{that in the first}} half of 20 th century population growth was linked to increased <b>land</b> <b>requirements,</b> before strong increases in yields were enabling constant <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> for about two decades. Recently, the combined effect of dietary change and population growth led again to increased <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> for food. Different yield developments in individual crops caused shifts in the relative <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> of different food items. Our findings suggest that developments in <b>land</b> <b>requirements</b> for food and underlying factors are often non-linear. Caution is warranted when discussing futures of global food supply, based on assumptions of linear or continuous trends. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
