25|$|LAA-approved {{modifications}} include ground-adjustable propellers, tundra tyres, {{additional fuel}} tanks and fuel-injection. The LAA has approved the fitting {{and testing of}} vortex generators, {{with a view to}} reducing stall speed and improving <b>landing</b> <b>flare.</b>|$|E
40|$|Results {{are given}} of an {{extensive}} investigation of conventional <b>landing</b> <b>flares</b> in general aviation type airplanes. A {{wide range of}} parameters influencing flare behavior are simulated in experimental landings in a variable-stability Navion. The most important feature of the flare {{is found to be}} the airplane's deceleration in the flare. Various effects on this are correlated in terms of the average flare load factor. Piloting technique is extensively discussed. Design criteria are presented...|$|R
50|$|During a {{helicopter}} <b>landing,</b> a <b>flare</b> {{is used to}} reduce both vertical and horizontal speed to allow a near zero-speed touchdown.|$|R
40|$|Upon {{aircraft}} <b>landing</b> approach, <b>flare</b> path command {{signals of}} altitude, vertical velocity and vertical acceleration are generated as functions of aircraft position and velocity {{with respect to}} the ground. The command signals are compared with corresponding actual values to generate error signals which are used to control the flight path...|$|R
25|$|Captain Peter Hamilton and First Officer Donald Rowland {{had flown}} on various flights {{together}} before, {{and had an}} ongoing discussion on when to arm the ground spoilers. They both agreed they did not like arming them {{at the beginning of}} the final approach, as specified in the checklist, fearing it could lead to an inadvertent spoiler deployment. The captain preferred arming them on the ground, while the copilot preferred arming them during the <b>landing</b> <b>flare.</b>|$|E
25|$|Author {{and pilot}} William Langewiesche {{asserted}} that insufficient credit {{was given to}} the A320's fly-by-wire design, by which the pilot uses a side-stick to make control inputs to the flight control computers. The computers then impose adjustments and limits of their own to keep the plane stable, which the pilot cannot override even in an emergency. This design allowed the pilots of Flight 1549 to concentrate on engine restart and deciding the course, without the burden of manually adjusting the glidepath to reduce the plane's rate of descent. Sullenberger said that these computer-imposed limits also prevented him from achieving the optimum <b>landing</b> <b>flare</b> for the ditching, which would have softened the impact.|$|E
2500|$|The Hewland AE75 engine, {{which is}} no longer available, has a life of 800 hours, after which time {{alternative}} engines are installed. Replacement engines have all been heavier than the [...] original, needing a lead counterweight in the tail to maintain balance. The empenage is short-coupled and its area is a little marginal for the <b>landing</b> <b>flare,</b> so flaring with a stopped engine might prove difficult.|$|E
6000|$|The {{rattling}} of {{the blocks}} was soon heard, {{and the enormous}} sheets of canvas that hung from the lower yards were instantly suspended [...] "in the brails." [...] When this change was effected, all on board stood silent and breathless, as if expecting to learn their fate by the result. Several contradictory opinions were, at length, hazarded among the officers, when Griffith seized the candle from the lantern, and springing {{on one of the}} guns, held it on high, exposed to the action of the air. The little flame waved, with uncertain glimmering, for a moment, and then burned steadily, in a line with the masts. Griffith was about to lower his extended arm, when, feeling a slight sensation of coolness on his hand, he paused, and the light turned slowly toward the <b>land,</b> <b>flared,</b> flickered, and finally deserted the wick.|$|R
40|$|Pilot/vehicle {{analysis}} {{techniques for}} optimizing aircraft handling qualities are presented. The analysis approach considered {{is based on}} the optimal control frequency domain techniques. These techniques stem from an optimal control approach of a Neal-Smith like analysis on aircraft attitude dynamics extended to analyze the <b>flared</b> <b>landing</b> task. Some modifications to the technique are suggested and discussed. An in depth analysis of the effect of the experimental variables, such as prefilter, is conducted to gain further insight into the <b>flared</b> <b>land</b> task for this class of vehicle dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this ongoing effort is to provide the capability to model and simulate rotorcraft aeromechanics behaviors in real-tune. This would be accomplished {{by the addition of}} an aeromechanics element to an existing high-fidelity, real-time helicopter flight simulation. As a first step, the peak vertical vibration at the pilot floor location was considered in this neural-network-based study. The flight conditions considered were level flights, rolls, pushovers, pull-ups, autorotations, and <b>landing</b> <b>flares.</b> The NASA/Army UH- 60 A Airloads Program flight test database was the source of raw data. The present neural network training databases were created in a physically consistent manner. Two modeling approaches, with different physical assumptions, were considered. The first approach involved a "maneuver load factor " that was derived using the roll-angle and the pitch-rate. The second approach involved the three pilot control stick positions. The resulting, trained back-propagation neural networks were small, implying rapid execution. The present neural-network-based approach involving the peak pilot vibration was utilized in a quasi-static manner to simulate an extreme, time-varying pull-up maneuver. For the above pull-up maneuver, the maneuver load factor approach was better for real-time simulation, i. e., produced greater fidelity, as compared to the control stick positions approach. Thus, neural networks show promise for use in high-fidelity, real-time modeling of rotorcraft vibration...|$|R
50|$|The <b>landing</b> <b>flare</b> is a {{maneuver}} or stage {{during the}} landing of an aircraft.|$|E
50|$|LAA-approved {{modifications}} include ground-adjustable propellers, tundra tyres, {{additional fuel}} tanks and fuel-injection. The LAA has approved the fitting {{and testing of}} vortex generators, {{with a view to}} reducing stall speed and improving <b>landing</b> <b>flare.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is described}} as easy to fly, with light control forces and well balanced controls. The aircraft has full-span ailerons on the bottom wing that droop together when the stick is pulled back, giving the same effect as flaps in the <b>landing</b> <b>flare.</b>|$|E
40|$|Flexible Aircraft Takeoff and Landing Analysis Program, FATOLA, simulates {{aircraft}} takeoff {{and landing}} dynamics. Program includes maneuver logic and autopilots for glide slope, <b>flare,</b> <b>landing,</b> and takeoff and is modular so performance of aircraft in flight and during landing and ground maneuvers {{can be studied}} separately or in combination...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAutorotation landing is {{a special}} {{manoeuvre}} for helicopter when the engine failed. In this situation, it requires the pilot's accurate management, correct judgment and decision on time to enter into steady autorotation. After entry into steady autorotation, then according to the flight altitude and speed, select the <b>landing</b> position, <b>flare</b> from autorotation, and perform a power-off landing successfully. Herein, it will be discussed how the helicopter performs the autorotation when losing the power, including the affecting factors. And refer to the airworthiness regulation, review the relevant sections, discuss the concerning aspect in the certification flight. Finally, it will through reviewing the autorotation flight compliance report of a helicopter, to understand those concerning aspects...|$|R
40|$|Neural network {{relationships}} between the full-scale, flight test hub accelerations and the corresponding three N/rev pilot floor vibration components (vertical, lateral, and longitudinal) are studied. The present quantitative effort on the UH- 60 A Black Hawk hub accelerations considers the lateral and longitudinal vibrations. An earlier study had considered the vertical vibration. The NASA/Army UH- 60 A Airloads Program flight test database is used. A physics based "maneuver-effect-factor (MEF) ", derived using the roll-angle and the pitch-rate, is used. Fundamentally, the lateral vibration data show high vibration levels (up to 0. 3 g's) at low airspeeds (for example, during <b>landing</b> <b>flares)</b> and at high airspeeds (for example, during turns). The {{results show that the}} advance ratio and the gross weight together can predict the vertical and the longitudinal vibration. However, the advance ratio and the gross weight together cannot predict the lateral vibration. The hub accelerations and the advance ratio can be used to satisfactorily predict the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal vibration. The present study shows that neural network based representations of all three UH- 60 A pilot floor vibration components (vertical, lateral, and longitudinal) can be obtained using the hub accelerations along with the gross weight and the advance ratio. The hub accelerations are clearly a factor in determining the pilot vibration. The present conclusions potentially allow for the identification of neural network {{relationships between}} the experimental hub accelerations obtained from wind tunnel testing and the experimental pilot vibration data obtained from flight testing. A successful establishment of the above neural network based link between the wind tunnel hub accelerations and the flight test vibration data can increase the value of wind tunnel testing...|$|R
50|$|The {{design has}} progressed through {{four generations of}} models, the Prima, Prima 2, 3 and 4, each {{improving}} on the last. The Prima 4 incorporates leading edge battens and an improved <b>landing</b> <b>flare</b> capability. The models are each named for their rough wing area in square metres.|$|E
50|$|The runway overrun {{was caused}} by a {{combination}} of a long <b>landing</b> <b>flare,</b> the wet runway, landing without autobrake selected on, and one engine thrust reverser that was deactivated. The aircraft had been dispatched with the port engine thrust reverser deactivated. This condition caused it to veer to the right when the captain activated reverse thrust in both engines in order to stop the aircraft within 2080 m of runway left. Reports indicated the occurrence of a big sandstorm at Khartoum earlier that day that was followed by low visibility and heavy rain and winds {{at the time of the}} accident. Contributing to the long <b>landing</b> <b>flare</b> was that the crew had been incorrectly informed that they had a 7 kn headwind for landing when they actually had a 15 kn tailwind.|$|E
50|$|On 12 February 2000, a Transafrik International cargo Boeing 727 crashed upon {{landing on}} runway 23. Due to high winds gusting to between 50 and 80 knots, the {{aircraft}} had executed a missed approach, and upon the <b>landing</b> <b>flare</b> {{of the second}} attempt, witnesses saw the right wing touch the ground.|$|E
50|$|On February 20, 2013, a 14-year-old San José club fan {{was killed}} during a Copa Libertadores match against Corinthians at the Estadio Jesús Bermúdez after {{being hit by}} a flare thrown into the home fans {{allegedly}} from the Corinthians section. According to the Association Press it has been ascertained that he died after a plastic tubular <b>flare</b> <b>landed</b> directly in his eye and “penetrated his skull”, killing him instantly.|$|R
5000|$|O’Donnell {{bought the}} {{machinery}} of O’Briens closed down newspaper, the Irish People, moved to Galway and there set up the Connaught Champion. When <b>land</b> agitation <b>flared</b> up in 1905 he was imprisoned {{for his part in}} it to two months hard labour. He was re-elected in the January 1906 general election despite attempts by south Mayo priests to oppose him, squashed by O'Brien's threat to abandon a pact with the party to avoid contests at the election. After the election O’Donnell was identified as one of the little knot of O’Brien’s die-hard supporters, both he and D. D. Sheehan being expelled that autumn from the IPP. In 1908 O’Donnell formally rejoined the party on the initiative of its leader John Redmond, in the interest of unity.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2008 {{science fiction}} film WALL-E, the BNL starliner Axiom is {{depicted}} as having numerous 6-person escape pods aboard. These pods are able to deploy a parachute, inflate a raft on their underside {{in case of a}} water <b>landing,</b> and deploy <b>flares.</b> They also have artificial gravity through some means, as indicated by WALL-E not floating weightlessly even after the pod he is in is well away from the Axiom. Strangely for vehicles designed to keep its occupants alive, the Axioms escape pods are also demonstrated to have a self-destruct sequence included.|$|R
50|$|High {{aspect ratio}} parachutes have the flattest glide {{and the largest}} {{tolerance}} for timing the <b>landing</b> <b>flare,</b> but the least predictable openings. An aspect ratio of 2.7 is about the upper limit for parachutes. High aspect ratio canopies typically have nine or more cells. All reserve ram-air parachutes are of the square variety, because of the greater reliability, and the less-demanding handling characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The Hewland AE75 engine, {{which is}} no longer available, has a life of 800 hours, after which time {{alternative}} engines are installed. Replacement engines have all been heavier than the 49 kg original, needing a lead counterweight in the tail to maintain balance. The empenage is short-coupled and its area is a little marginal for the <b>landing</b> <b>flare,</b> so flaring with a stopped engine might prove difficult.|$|E
50|$|If the helicopter's engine fails, the tip jets on {{the rotor}} {{increase}} {{the moment of}} inertia, hence permitting it to store energy, which makes performing a successful autorotation landing somewhat easier. However, the tip jet also typically generates significant extra air drag, which demands a higher sink rate and means that a very sudden transition to the <b>landing</b> <b>flare</b> must occur for survival, with little room for error.|$|E
5000|$|Slater's {{attorney}} {{has said}} that {{at the beginning of}} the flight, two female passengers had argued over the allocated bag space in the overhead bin. Once the plane <b>landed,</b> the dispute <b>flared</b> again when one of the women was told that a bag she had checked at the gate would not be immediately available. She then began to curse at Slater. [...] According to a Port Authority police officer quoted by the Wall Street Journal, no passenger or other crew member has corroborated Slater's account of a confrontation with a passenger.|$|R
60|$|At length {{the black}} {{mass of the}} côtes of Vaud took more {{distinct}} and regular forms. Here and there, a tower or a tree betrayed its outlines against the sky, and then the objects on {{the margin of the}} lake began to stand out in gloomy relief from the <b>land.</b> Lights <b>flared</b> along the strand, and cries reached them, from the shore. A dark shapeless pile stood directly athwart their watery path, and, at the next moment, it took the aspect of a ruined castle-like edifice. The canvass flapped and was handed, the Winkelried rose and set more slowly and with a gentler movement, and glided into the little, secure, artificial haven of La Tour de Peil. A forest of latine yards and low masts lay before them, but, by giving the bark a rank sheer, Maso brought her to her berth, by the side of another lake craft, with a gentleness of collision that, as the mariners have it, would not have broken an egg.|$|R
50|$|Bearing in {{mind that}} {{distress}} flares had been designed to burn out at a height of not less than 150 feet and that, notwithstanding the long-standing practice of firing off flares to celebrate the New Year, {{there had never been}} a fire caused in that fashion, the court held that, even if the project engineer and port engineer had known of the practice (which, they testified, they had not), the possibility of a <b>flare</b> <b>landing</b> while still burning and setting fire to the gutter of a building constructed with an otherwise non-combustible shell was so remote as not to have been reasonably foreseeable.|$|R

50|$|Instructors {{who favor}} {{the use of}} touch-and-gos contend that it makes it {{possible}} to practice more landings per hour of instruction. Students doing touch-and-gos find it easier to master landing, particularly the final stage known as <b>landing</b> <b>flare,</b> which is often difficult to learn. Preparing to take off while landing is a necessary safety skill, they add, because any pilot must {{be able to do it}} in order to reject a landing.|$|E
5000|$|A NASA C-47 {{was used}} {{for all of the}} air tows. The first was on August 16, 1963. The M2-F1 had {{recently}} been equipped with an ejection seat and small rockets - referred to by the test team as [...] "instant L/D" [...] - in the tail to extend the <b>landing</b> <b>flare</b> for about 5 seconds if needed, and Thompson prepared for the flight with a few more tows behind the Pontiac.|$|E
50|$|After shakedown, on 7 August 1944 Grand Forks sailed from San Francisco, California, to take {{station in}} the Northern Pacific off the California coast as a plane guard ship, {{returning}} to San Francisco on 3 September. She continued on this duty until decommissioning, spending an average of 3 weeks at sea and 2 in port. Late in the night 11 October 1944, Grand Forks picked up a distress call from a PB2Y about to make an emergency <b>landing.</b> Sending up <b>flares</b> and star shells to guide the plane through the dark, Grand Forks rescued 15 crewmen and passengers from the sea, as well as 114 sacks of mail.|$|R
40|$|Data from wind-tunnel {{measurements}} are presented {{to show the}} magnitude of adverse ground effects on the longitudinal aerodynamic coefficients of a powered-lift STOL airplane. A steady-state analysis shows the changes in thrust and angle of attack required during the <b>landing</b> approach and <b>flare</b> as the airplane flies close to the ground. The piloting problems that these ground effects may create were investigated with an in-flight simulator to find the consequences of lift loss during the landing-flare maneuver for a STOL transport. Flight tests were made using the variable stability Navion setup with STOL transport aerodynamics and control responses and were flown at design approach speeds and descent conditions...|$|R
5|$|Soon thereafter, {{a number}} of A-10 ground-attack {{aircraft}} arrived but {{found it difficult to}} pinpoint enemy targets and began dropping flares to illuminate the zone. One of these <b>flares</b> <b>landed</b> on a friendly vehicle, and although the vehicle radioed in its position, it was hit by an AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile that killed the entire crew except for the driver. Following the incident, the company was withdrawn and the remaining vehicles reorganized into another nearby company. With observation post 4 cleared, the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade withdrew over the border to Al-Wafrah under heavy fire from Coalition aircraft. Coalition forces had lost 11 troops to friendly fire and none to enemy action.|$|R
