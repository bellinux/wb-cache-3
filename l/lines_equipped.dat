25|$|Several {{different}} companies and municipalities operated London's electric tramways. The largest was the LCC, with <b>lines</b> <b>equipped</b> {{with an unusual}} form of electricity supply via an underground conduit located between the running rails. Other operators mainly used the more conventional overhead electric wires. Many of London's trams had to be equipped with both systems of electricity supply, with routes being equipped with change points.|$|E
25|$|During the inter-war years, {{the battery}} was {{reformed}} twice {{as part of}} the Citizen Forces. Initially, it was reformed in 1920 in Sydney, but the following year Australia's part-time military was reorganised to perpetuate the numerical designations and formations of the AIF, and the unit was disbanded and re-formed in Western Australia {{as part of the}} newly re-raised 3rd Field Brigade, which was headquartered at Guildford, Western Australia. In doing so, it drew personnel from the previously existing 38th and 39th Field Batteries. Throughout the inter-war years, the battery remained in this form until after the start of World War II. As a Militia formation, the 103rd Battery could not be deployed overseas to fight after the outbreak of the war, and while some of its members volunteered for service with the Second Australian Imperial Force it remained in Australia. In 1941, Australia's artillery formations were reorganised along regimental <b>lines,</b> <b>equipped</b> with two field batteries. As a result, the 103rd was disbanded, with its howitzers being used to provide a troop of guns each to the newly raised 3rd Field Regiment's 7th and 8th Field Batteries.|$|E

50|$|Automatic {{signals are}} used on <b>lines</b> <b>equipped</b> with {{automatic}} block signaling. Their colour language {{is the same}} as aspects S1-S5 of semi-automatic signals.

50|$|Traction current {{lines are}} always {{equipped}} with an earth conductor.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the company also}} desired to have {{circulating}} modular trains {{so that they may}} have been expanded during peak hours. <b>Lines</b> <b>equipped</b> with stations of at least 75 m supported trains with two trainsets and those with stations of at least 105 m supported trains with three trainsets.

50|$|The cost of {{implementing}} PTC {{on up to}} 25 commuter rail services in the United States has been estimated at over $2 billion and because of these costs, several services are having to cancel or reduce repairs, capital improvements, and service. Other services simply {{do not have the}} funds available for PTC and have deferred action assuming some change from Congress. Railroads that operate <b>lines</b> <b>equipped</b> with cab signalling and existing Automatic Train Control systems have argued that their proven track record of safety, which goes back decades, is being discounted because ATC is not as aggressive as PTC in all cases.|$|E
50|$|In British usage {{the term}} {{platelayer}}s' hut {{refers to a}} lineside shelter in which a platelayer would historically be based. In the heyday of steam railway operation a platelayer might be assigned to each mile or two miles of track, with a platelayers' hut as his shelter and working base. He would regularly patrol his section of track. In modern railway operation platelayers tend to operate in mobile teams, and the lineside of the British railway network still includes {{a large number of}} abandoned and generally dilapidated platelayers' huts. Platelayers' huts were generally a single room, immediately adjacent to the running <b>lines,</b> <b>equipped</b> with a table, chairs, and a simple heating stove.|$|E

These MTR trains were delivered to Hong Kong between 2011 and 2013 to enhance train frequency on the existing lines to cater for increased patronage on the Island Line, Kwun Tong Line, Tsuen Wan Line and Tseung Kwan O Line.These trains feature new 22" [...] LCD TVs, like their counterpart trains on former-KCR <b>lines</b> <b>equipped</b> with Newsline Express, offering infotainment such as news and announcements.

25|$|X {{is closed}} and bounded (as {{a subset of}} any metric space whose {{restricted}} metric is d). The converse may fail for a non-Euclidean space; e.g. the real <b>line</b> <b>equipped</b> with the discrete metric is closed and bounded but not compact, as the collection of all singletons of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. It is complete but not totally bounded.|$|R
