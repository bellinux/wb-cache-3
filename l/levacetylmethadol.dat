5000|$|<b>Levacetylmethadol</b> was {{previously}} {{used to treat}} opioid dependence. In 2003 the drug's manufacturer discontinued production. There are no available generic versions. LAAM produced long-lasting effects, which allowed the person receiving treatment to visit a clinic only three times per week, as opposed to daily as with methadone. [...] In 2001, <b>levacetylmethadol</b> {{was removed from the}} European market due to reports of life-threatening ventricular rhythm disorders. In 2003, Roxane Laboratories, Inc. discontinued Orlaam in the US.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levacetylmethadol</b> (INN), levomethadyl acetate (USAN), OrLAAM (trade name) or levo-α-acetylmethadol (LAAM) is a {{synthetic}} opioid similar in structure to methadone. It {{has a long}} duration of action due to its active metabolites. It was approved in 1993 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{for use in the}} treatment of opioid dependence. In 2001, <b>levacetylmethadol</b> was removed from the European market due to reports of life-threatening ventricular rhythm disorders. In 2003, Roxane Laboratories, Inc. discontinued Orlaam in the US.|$|E
5000|$|Dioxaphetyl {{butyrate}} (INN; {{trade names}} Amidalgon, Spasmoxal) is an opioid analgesic {{which is a}} diphenylacetic acid derivative, related to other open-chain opioid drugs such as dextropropoxyphene, <b>levacetylmethadol</b> (LAAM), lefetamine and dimenoxadol.|$|E
50|$|Betacetylmethadol is a {{synthetic}} opioid. It is a diastereoisomer of alphacetylmethadol (as well as <b>levacetylmethadol).</b> In the United States, betacetylmethadol is a Schedule I drug Narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act, with an ACSCN of 9607 and a 2 gramme manufacturing quota as of 2014.|$|E
50|$|Alphamethadol (INN), or α-methadol, {{also known}} as alfametadol, is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is an isomer of dimepheptanol (methadol), the other being betamethadol (β-methadol). Alphamethadol is composed of two isomers itself, L-α-methadol, and D-α-methadol. The former compound, L-α-methadol, is an important active metabolite of <b>levacetylmethadol</b> (LAAM), an opioid substitute drug that is used clinically. Both of alphamethadol's isomers bind to and activate the μ-opioid receptor and are active as opioid analgesics, similarly to those of alphacetylmethadol (α-acetylmethadol).|$|E
50|$|Alphacetylmethadol (INN), or α-acetylmethadol (AAM), is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. Its levorotary enantiomer, <b>levacetylmethadol,</b> is an FDA-approved treatment for opioid addiction. Alphacetylmethadol {{is very similar}} in structure to methadone, a widely prescribed treatment for opioid addiction. In the United States, it is a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (presumably because it was never marketed in the US, {{as is the case}} with other common opiate/opioid medications such as diacetylmorphine and alphaprodine), with an ACSCN of 9603 and a 2013 annual manufacturing quota of 2 grammes.|$|E
50|$|Acetylmethadol (INN), {{also known}} as methadyl acetate (USAN), is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is a racemic mixture of alphacetylmethadol (α-acetylmethadol) and betacetylmethadol (β-acetylmethadol), which are in turn racemic mixtures of <b>levacetylmethadol</b> (LAAM; L-α-acetylmethadol) and D-α-acetylmethadol and L-β-acetylmethadol and D-β-acetylmethadol, respectively. Hence, acetylmethadol has four possible optical isomers. All of these isomers {{have been shown to}} partially or fully substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of heroin in rats, and thus it can be inferred that, in addition to LAAM which is used clinically as such, they are all likely to be active opioid analgesics in humans.|$|E
40|$|Dear Editor – Methadone is a {{synthetic}} opioid {{which has been}} successful used in treating heroin addiction and chronic pain syndrome in palliative care for more than 30 years. Methadone maintenance programmes for heroin dependency has shown reduction in mortality and morbidity. It has shown direct reductions in addiction related crime and drug arrests. Several case reports have highlighted methadone’s association with QT prolongation {{and the risk of}} Torsades de Pointes, a potentially lethal ventricular tachycardia. <b>Levacetylmethadol,</b> a derivative of methadone was withdrawn from US markets in 2003 due to prolongation of QT interval and an association with Torsades de Pointes...|$|E
40|$|The medical {{community}} {{and government agencies}} have raised concerns about medications associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). This alter-ation in cardiac repolarization {{may result in a}} serious and poten-tially fatal arrhythmia known as torsade de pointes (TdP; see Side Box for a review of the QT and TdP). Particular concerns relating to medications used in the treat-ment of opioid addiction surfaced in 2001 and focused on 10 patients administered LAAM (<b>levacetylmethadol</b> or Orlaam®) who developed cardiac electrophysiologic disturbances: QT interval prolongation and/or TdP. LAAM was subsequently withdrawn from European markets (EMEA 2001). In the United States, the FDA strengthened warnings about this arrhythmo-genic potential (FDA 2001) and screening ECGs were recom-mended prior to and during LAAM titration (AATOD 2001) ...|$|E
