25|$|Although Colchen's {{high jump}} and {{basketball}} career coincided, it <b>look</b> <b>her</b> {{a little longer}} to reach the same heights in basketball. Playing as a centre, she made her international debut for the French basketball team in February 1946, appearing against Belgium. In her first major tournament appearance at the 1950 FIBA European Women's Basketball Championship she was France's leading points scorer in two of their group games and two games in the final group stage (amassing 25 against Italy) in their last game. The team finished fourth overall, with Colchen averaging 14.5 points per game. At 87 in total, she was the tournament's leader on points. She returned for the 1952 European Championship but played a smaller role, appearing in only two games, but still being the team's third-highest scorer. France finished seventh that year.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Googoosh began a {{meteoric}} rise to {{fame and}} success {{as she drove}} the edge of Iranian pop music further and further. Known for her flamboyant outfits and fashion sense, Googoosh wowed her pop culture hungry fans in Iran and abroad with her trademark hairdos and hip-elegant style. Iranian women changed hairdos with Googoosh and she was always {{one step ahead of}} them with a new <b>look.</b> <b>Her</b> music ranged from upbeat 1960s and 1970s pop, given an Arabic-tinged edge, to declamatory, emotional ballads dealing with love and loss, which at times edged towards chanson and Édith Piaf territory. She starred in over 25 movies, one of which was to be the most commercially successful Iranian motion picture of all time. Googoosh performed many times for the royal family and was a favorite of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's wife and children. She performed at the party given for the 1977 birthday of Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran.|$|E
500|$|Although Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with Mercedes' sister, Jacqui (Claire Cooper), he and Mercedes had sex. Metcalfe explained this was because Mercedes was intoxicated and unaware of her actions, [...] "but she was also furious at Jacqui for giving her a slap". Metcalfe explained that when Mercedes woke up, she was in disbelief about the events of the previous night and felt [...] "appalled". She added that Mercedes did not fancy Tony and that they did not even like each other, which was why [...] "neither of them can understand what happened between them". Regarding Mercedes' feelings about hurting Jacqui, Metcalfe stated: [...] "Mercedes hates herself for it. She feels incredibly guilty and ashamed of what she's done. It's surprising Jacqui doesn't guess something is wrong because Mercedes can't <b>look</b> <b>her</b> in the eye".|$|E

500|$|Pinchwife {{was played}} by the elderly Michael Mohun, who was best known for playing menacing villains, such as Volpone and Iago. Mrs. Pinchwife was Elizabeth Boutell or Bowtel, a young actress who had [...] "a childish <b>look.</b> <b>Her</b> voice was weak, tho' very mellow; she {{generally}} acted the young innocent lady whom all the heroes are mad in love with". Boutell's previous recorded roles had in fact all been unmarried as well as innocent girls, and Margery was her first married role. Matching Boutell and Mohun as a couple would emphasise [...] "her youth and innocence against Mohun's age and violence". The other husband to be cuckolded by Horner, Sir Jaspar Fidget, was played by another elderly actor, William Cartwright, best known for comic parts such as Falstaff. This casting suggests that Sir Jaspar was played as a straightforwardly comic part, while Pinchwife would be [...] "alarming as well as funny".|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Glenn {{declined}} Gilligan's and {{the state}} Democratic party's request that he run for lieutenant governor and challenged Metzenbaum again for the other Ohio Senate seat (vacated by Republican William B. Saxbe, who became U.S. Attorney General in early 1974). Metzenbaum was the short-term incumbent, appointed by Gilligan in January. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had [...] "never held a payroll". Glenn's reply {{became known as the}} [...] "Gold Star Mothers" [...] speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and [...] "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother and you <b>look</b> <b>her</b> in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job". He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating Ralph Perk (the Republican mayor of Cleveland) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999. Glenn was reelected in 1980, defeating Republican challenger Jim Betts by over 40 percent. Metzenbaum ran again in 1976 against the incumbent, Taft, winning a close race on Jimmy Carter's coattails.|$|E
500|$|Sevigny {{has long}} been {{considered}} a fashion icon and regularly appears on best dressed lists. Throughout her career, she has modelled for several high-profile designers, including Miu Miu, H, Louis Vuitton and Chloé. Prior to her career as an actress, she had achieved fame for her unique style. While her sense of style in the early 1990s only reflected small downtown scenes and trends, it still made a significant impression on high class fashion chains which began to emulate Sevigny's <b>look.</b> <b>Her</b> interest in fashion and clothing, {{as well as her}} career as a fashion model in her late teenage years and early twenties, have led to a career as a prominent and well-respected fashion designer. She has expressed interest in fashion design throughout the entirety of her career, even dating back to her childhood: [...] "Little House on the Prairie was my favorite show. I would only wear calico print dresses, and I actually slept in one of those little nightcaps!", she told People in 2007. Her unorthodox style (which garnered her initial notoriety in the early '90s) has often been referred to as very eclectic. Sevigny has since released several clothing lines designed by herself, both solo and in collaboration, and has earned a title as a modern fashion icon.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, seven-year-old Amelia Pond (Caitlin Blackwood) finds {{instructions}} from the Doctor leading her to the National Museum, where the Pandorica is on display. She touches the box, allowing it to revitalise Amy and release her. They are soon joined by the Doctor and Rory, now a museum guard who secretly survived the Blitz. After a tearful reunion, they are chased by a Dalek restored {{by the light of}} the Pandorica. The Doctor uses the vortex manipulator to go back and give Rory his screwdriver, as well as leave Amelia the clues to the museum. Amelia soon disappears: a sign, according to the Doctor, that the universe is collapsing rapidly. The injured body of a future version of the Doctor appears and whispers something to his earlier self. The Doctor takes off with Amy and Rory to the roof of the museum, where he discovers that the [...] "sun" [...] is the still-exploding TARDIS. Rory hears a voice coming from the exploding TARDIS and the Doctor amplifies the voice and discovers it is River Song in a time-loop, implemented by the TARDIS to keep her alive. The Doctor saves River, and as the quartet reunites, the Doctor is shot by the Dalek and sends himself backwards in time. Amy and Rory depart while River threatens the Dalek, telling it to <b>look</b> <b>her</b> up in its data records. Upon doing so, the Dalek begins to shake in terror and plead for mercy before River kills it.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Haunted" [...] was {{directed}} by Swedish film and music video director Jonas Åkerlund and styled by Dagmarette Yen and B. Åkerlend. It was shot using four cameras and {{in a period of}} two days. On November 15, 2013, Popjustice reported that one of the actors who was featured in the video, J-Hustle, shared a picture on his Twitter account while being on a five-day set for the filming. He added that a song with [...] "a slow vibe" [...] was played in the background during the shooting and that its potential name was [...] "Ghost Haunted". Beyoncé first discussed about the video with Åkerlend during a concert she had in Stockholm in 2013. Having invited him for the performance, the singer played several songs for the director afterwards and the pair went on to exchange several ideas about its concept. During an interview with Vulture, Åkerlend talked about the process, [...] "It was not like a solid plan of 'This is what I think we should do.' It was a pretty long process. And she was traveling and touring, so we had time to bounce ideas back and forth, figure out what the best vision was. And meanwhile, she was shooting all these other videos and I wasn't really involved in what those other ideas were." [...] He noted that several ideas of the video which were initially conceived were similar with [...] "other videos that people were working on". Beyoncé conceived some of the initial ideas behind the looks and the scenarios for many of the rooms which were eventually shot. He also explained that the video contained many sexually explicit scenes and ideas when initially shot. However, he felt that the team managed to balance between the singer's <b>look,</b> <b>her</b> performance and a strong idea along with several other things. Åkerlund further noted that its concept remained largely unchanged as none of the big ideas were excluded. Beyoncé's look remained largely the same as the director pictured it before the filming of the video had started.|$|E

2500|$|Nana is Umaru's buxom classmate {{and friend}} who lives by {{herself in the}} ground floor {{apartment}} below the Domas. She is very shy, and is originally from Akita, occasionally reverting to its dialect when nervous. Because of her big breasts, Nana has lack of confidence because most people look at her breasts before her eyes. The first person to <b>look</b> <b>her</b> in the eyes is Taihei, whom she later has a crush on and gets flustered whenever he gives her compliments.She later reveals to Taihei that she has an older brother who is working {{at a restaurant in}} Tokyo; Taihei suspects he might have met him on his business trip.

[...] Mary Martin said that Richard Rodgers composed songs for her for South Pacific, knowing she had a small vocal range, and the songs generally made her <b>look</b> <b>her</b> best. [...] She also said that Rodgers and Hammerstein listened to all her suggestions and she worked extremely well with them. Both Rodgers and Hammerstein wanted Doris Day for {{the lead in the}} film version of South Pacific and she reportedly wanted the part. [...] They discussed it with her, but after her manager/husband Martin Melcher would not budge on his demand for a high salary for her, the role went to Mitzi Gaynor.|$|E

2500|$|Jean Grey-Summers (under {{the name}} of [...] "Phoenix") appears in the {{crossover}} fighting game [...] as a playable character, voiced once again by Jennifer Hale. She is widely considered to be one of, if not, the most powerful character in the game winning many major tournaments and being played by many high level players. She has the lowest vitality of any character in the game, {{a little less than}} half of the next lowest health characters, but compensates for this by having tremendous damage output. She can teleport at distances, use telekinesis for her throw attacks, and heal her red-damage life bar with Healing Field Level 1 hyper (by getting close to enemies). Her main projectile attack is TK Shot, a cosmic fireball that varies in speed depending on the button pressed. Her one and only offensive Hyper Combo is Phoenix Rage, where she shoots a huge cosmic Phoenix raptor at her enemy, heavily burning enemy at contact. If her lifebar is emptied with the Hyper Combo gauge at maximum (5), she will transform into Dark Phoenix. Although her health is completely restored upon turning into the Dark Phoenix, her life bar depletes at a steady rate. However, her attacks become more powerful, shoots out small projectile fire feathers with normal attacks, and the Hyper Combo gauge refills at a faster rate than normal. Phoenix sports four alternate color schemes based on her classic <b>look,</b> <b>her</b> early 1990s appearance drawn by Jim Lee, which shares similarities with her appearance in Chris Claremont's X-Men Forever, and her costumes from Greg Pak's [...] and Grant Morrison's [...]|$|E
