25|$|One general {{characteristic}} of games that Wittgenstein considers in detail {{is the way}} in which they consist in following rules. Rules constitute a family, rather than a class that can be explicitly defined. As a consequence, it is not possible to provide a definitive account of what it is to follow a rule. Indeed, he argues that any course of action can be made out to accord with some particular rule, and that therefore a rule cannot be used to explain an action. Rather, that one is following a rule or not is to be decided by <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the actions conform to the expectations in the particular form of life in which one is involved. Following a rule is a social activity.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{intellectual}} effect {{of being a}} TCK {{has not yet been}} widely explored, there has been such research in the area. One particular study by Lee and Bain (2007) that was found to have significant findings was conducted on young native Koreans who had recently moved to the United States and were attending school in America. The researchers were <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how these students would respond to explicit instruction aimed to work with their originality and fluency and that is specific to TCKs. This was measured through the level of creativity demonstrated in assigned tasks given to the students. TCKs were found to be able to demonstrate significantly higher levels of creativity and originality for problem solving than TCKs not given this same explicit instruction. This study has implications for the ways that TCKs can be instructed differently from the traditional curriculum to enhance their creativity and problem solving abilities because of their third culture experience.|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Kevin Feige, {{president}} of Marvel Studios said the studio {{was beginning to}} look at their Phase Two films, which would start with Iron Man 3 and would culminate in a second Avengers film. In March 2012, Joss Whedon, director of the first film, stated that he would want a sequel to be [...] "smaller. More personal. More painful. By being the next thing that should happen to these characters, and not just a rehash of what seemed to work the first time. By having a theme that is completely fresh and organic to itself." [...] Despite the production of the film becoming increasingly wider in scope, Feige maintained that this was not their intention, always <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where the team wanted to take the characters, over how to make it bigger than The Avengers.|$|E

500|$|The {{earthquake}} swarm was noted on October 12, 2007 in the Prince George Citizen by citizen staff, {{three days after}} the earthquakes began. Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist John Cassidy of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist Catherine Hickson, who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, [...] "the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|By <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> when tones started {{preventing}} actions, {{the researchers}} supposedly know {{the length of}} time (in seconds) that exists between when a subject holds a conscious intention to move and performs the action of movement. This moment of awareness (as seen in the graph below) is dubbed [...] "T" [...] (the mean time of conscious intention to move). It can be found by looking at the border between tones and no tones. This enables the researchers to estimate the timing of the conscious intention to move without relying on the subject's knowledge or demanding them to focus on a clock. The last step of the experiment is to compare time T for each subject with their Event-related potential (ERP) measures (e.g. seen in this page's lead image), which reveal when their finger movement genesis first begins.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was sitting}} at my desk {{examining}} the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn't that I believed I could make it work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, {{but it was all}} I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd keep coming back to my desk <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if it was still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{adjourning}} for the weekend, {{the trial}} resumed on Monday June 17. [...] Local newspapers had reported that Mrs. Reavis had arrived from Denver on Friday afternoon and the courtroom {{was packed with}} spectators <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the third Baroness. [...] Upon taking the stand, she told of her childhood memories and then confirmed her husband's claim that an archivist in Seville had demanded a bribe before allowing documents related to the Peralta Grant to be copied. [...] She was however unable to provide any details about the claim papers. [...] Throughout the proceedings, Mrs. Reavis maintained she was the granddaughter of the second Baron despite intense questioning about his existence. [...] Monday's testimony ended with Bishop Salpointe stating he {{was familiar with the}} San Xavier record book from his historical studies and the documents related to Miguel de Peralta in the record book had not been present before the book had been sent to Philadelphia for the Centennial Exposition.|$|E
2500|$|Hawking {{began his}} {{university}} education at University College, Oxford in October 1959 {{at the age}} of 17. For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonelyhe [...] found the academic work [...] "ridiculously easy". His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, [...] "It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how other people did it." [...] A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort [...] "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction. Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing crew. The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.|$|E
2500|$|The English King Henry VIII, {{angered by}} the Scots reneging on the initial agreement, made war on Scotland in 1544–1549, a period which the writer Sir Walter Scott later christened the [...] "Rough Wooing". In May 1544 an English army landed at Granton and {{captured}} Leith to land heavy artillery for an assault on Edinburgh Castle, but withdrew after burning {{the town and the}} Palace of Holyrood over three days. Three years later, following another English invasion and victory at Pinkie Cleugh in 1547, the English attempted to establish a [...] "pale" [...] within Scotland. Leith was of prime strategic importance because of its vital role as Edinburgh's port, handling its foreign trade and essential supplies. The English arrived in Leith on 11 September 1547 and camped on Leith Links. The military engineer Richard Lee scouted around the town on 12 September <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if it could be made defensible. On 14 September the English began digging a trench on the south-east side of Leith near the Firth of Forth. William Patten wrote that the work was done as much for exercise as for defence, since they stayed only five days.|$|E

2500|$|NOAA {{describes}} {{the goal of}} Mussel Watch as “to support ecosystem-based management through an integrated nationwide program of environmental monitoring, assessment and research to describe the status and trends of our nation’s estuaries and coasts." [...] Mussel Watch is a program that monitors the health of bivalves, mussels and clams for contaminants along the coasts of the United States. This program was launched in 1986 and since then is the longest government-run monitoring program that has national influence. It was made {{in response to a}} legislative mandate to preserve the marine environment. In 2008 they released an assessment of their data from 1986 through 2005. In this report, concentrations of many different metals and organic pollutants are shown over the two decades of data collection. Using this set of data, trends can be identified for different coastal areas. Starting in 2000, the scientists that NOAA sent out to collect the mussels changed companies and the Mussel Watch program began employing citizen scientists to collect the mussels; this approach saved a good deal of money for the program. This can be seen on the local level in Washington State where The Snohomish County’s Natural Marine Resources Committee coordinated with the Mussel Watch program in 2007 to employ citizens to collect samples from the nearshore water Snohomish County. In 2010 and 2012 Western Washington University students assisted Whatcom County Public Works. [...] Mussel Watch originally monitored areas known for contamination where data would be easily found and monitored for trends in the toxicity data. Now the focus is to shift to areas of concern directed by organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Instead of focusing just on trends in the data Mussel Watch is <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if a given policy has actually made a positive impact on a specific environment.|$|E
