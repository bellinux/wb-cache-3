25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the {{benchtop}} that tools or jigs can be bolted to. In applications where repeated removal and reinstallation of the tool or jig is desirable, screwing into the wood of the benchtop with woodscrews or <b>lag</b> <b>bolts</b> is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated disassembly and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated disassembly and reassembly trouble-free. They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. T-nuts (aka tee nuts) are an easy way to create a hardpoint. Custom nuts similar to T-nuts but with holes for woodscrews in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of TABs is their strength, requiring fewer tree penetrations for robust fastening of a treehouse and hence less damage to a live tree. A typical TAB consists of a threaded metal bolt and a larger diameter collar. The latter provides an extra bending strength by bearing upon the compression strength of the tree grain. Since treehouses are subject to frequent load reversal produced by winds, TABs must be made of spring steel The bolts are able to support from between 9,000 and 12,000 lbs kg, a much greater load than conventional <b>lag</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the cam-type hammer drill, a rotary/pneumatic hammer drill accelerates only the bit. This is accomplished through a piston design, rather than a spinning cam. Rotary hammers have much less vibration and penetrate most building materials. They {{can also be used}} as [...] "drill only" [...] or as [...] "hammer only" [...] which extends their usefulness for tasks such as chipping brick or concrete. Hole drilling progress is greatly superior to cam-type hammer drills, and these drills are generally used for holes of 19 mm (3/4 inch) or greater in size. A typical application for a rotary hammer drill is boring large holes for <b>lag</b> <b>bolts</b> in foundations, or installing large lead anchors in concrete for handrails or benches.|$|E
50|$|The Loft Bed - After {{a lesson}} on framing, the contestants must build a loft bed (essentially, an indoor deck), {{complete}} with <b>lag</b> <b>bolts</b> to secure the frame to a post, from which a plywood board is placed on top, to support the bed's mattress. Matt does this easily, as he is experienced at building decks. Deen also passes after some work, though he mismeasures his plywood covering. The rest, however, do not fare as well. Simon admits to failing after failing to support the outside corner. Cory, ambitious to decorate the posts after quickly finishing the structure, fails after admitting to not reading the instructions to the post covering.

30|$|Limited {{researchers}} {{investigated the}} performance of the cold-formed Steel connections. Munse and Chesson (1963) studied riveted and bolted joints and examined factors that reduce net section capacity, conducted numerous experiments on various specimens and connection details. Prior to these studies, tension member capacity was based solely on gross section yielding or net section rupture. Kulak and Wu (1997) studied shear <b>lag</b> in <b>bolted</b> angle tension members and examined shear lag effects and presented accountings for shear lag in American and Canadian design specifications (which are based on AISC LRFD specifications), conducted a number of tension tests considering only net section rupture. The failure of these specimens was preceded by a necking down of the net area between the leg edge and lead bolt hole. Rupturing of the specimen initiated at the leg edge and propagated through to the bolt hole and then on {{through the rest of the}} specimen. Barth et al. (2002) studied behavior of steel tension members subjected to uniaxial loading and performed load tests on three series of short tension member specimens to investigate the influence of varying connection eccentricity and connection length on the load capacity of the members. Pan (2004) studied the prediction of the strength of bolted cold-formed channel sections in tension and investigated the shear <b>lag</b> effect in <b>bolted</b> cold-formed steel tension members. Shear lag effect occurs when some elements of the tension member are not connected. This effect reduces the strength of the member because the stresses distributed over the entire section are not uniform. Pan (2004) 23 Prediction of the Strength of Bolted Cold-Formed Channel Sections in Tension. This study is concentrated on the investigation of the shear <b>lag</b> effect on <b>bolted</b> CFS tension members. Channel sections with different dimensions tested using bolted connections were discussed in this study. Bolandim et al.

40|$|Fracture of {{the neck}} of the femur {{continues}} to be regarded as “ the unsolved fracture,” but its claim to this distinction becomes increasingly insecure. Since the introduction of the Smith-Petersen nail in 1931, unrelenting endeavours have been made to solve this problem, and the literature reveals a wide variety of anatomical studies, statistical reviews, new methods of reduction, fixation and bone-grafting techniques. The overall picture is one of some confusion but two elementary points of universal agreement are seen to emerge: reduction must be perfect; and fixation must be secure. No one wi,ll deny the advantage of perfect reduction in the treatment of this or any other fracture, but accurate reduction is not essential to union in fractures elsewhere. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that in fractures of the femoral neck full reduction is of particular importance. In regard to fixation many new methods of treatment have been devised. Wires, nails, multiple screws and <b>lag</b> <b>bolts,</b> combined bone-grafting procedures, sliding and compression devices have all been described, each striving to achieve rigid apposition ofthe fracture surfaces.

30|$|As {{the designs}} for timber {{structures}} grow larger and larger, contractors are increasingly using lag screw connectors in their projects [1]. The benefits of lag screw joints include less loosening and slippage when a load is first applied than bolted timber joints; however, they also require more caution, making construction management {{an important consideration}} [2]. For example, screwing in a lag screw without first drilling a pilot hole can cause the timber member to crack, or driven in using a hammer. In addition, overtightening beyond a lag screw’s pullout strength risks damaging the joint, weakening it compared with its original performance. One potential solution to prevent the latter scenario is to apply a torque control method to provide suitable torque {{by means of a}} torque wrench or other tool. However, no one has yet developed a torque control method for lag screw timber joints: contractors today rely on their own experiences and intuition when tightening lag screw connectors, an arbitrary judgment. Torque control methods involve different tightening speeds, because tools such as torque wrenches and nut runners are turned manually to provide torque. For metallic bolted joints, differences in tightening speed are known to result in different coefficients of friction and torque, important factors that determine the feasibility of a given torque control method as well as in variation in axial force (“clamp force” below) [3]. In a previous study on bolted timber joints, we discovered that the torque coefficient decreases at higher tightening speeds and were able to reduce fluctuations in the clamp force by setting the tightening speed to 20  rpm [4]. For lag screw timber joints, however, {{there appears to be no}} research that has clarified the effects of tightening speed on the torque coefficient. This point needs to be clarified, since construction management is more important for lag screw timber joints than for bolt joints, and because no torque control method has been established for lag screw timber joints. In a previous study, we developed a high damping shear wall in which timber members were joined together, or to steel plates, with <b>lag</b> screws or <b>bolts.</b> Tightening generates a clamp force, which in turn generates a frictional resistance force between two timber members, or between one and a steel plate [5]. Our later research investigated how to apply torque control methods to control this clamp force, a serious issue that must be addressed to control the expression of this frictional resistance force [6, 7]. One of the resulting challenges we faced in developing our high damping shear wall was how to determine the effects of lag screw tightening speed on the joint’s torque coefficient.|$|R
