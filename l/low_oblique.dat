40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the value of}} analysing a range of remotely sensed imagery in order to study {{the development of the}} historic landscape in Southern Dobrogea (Romania).

40|$|When {{studying}} {{the development of}} different geomorphic processes, floods, glaciers or even cultural heritage through time, one cannot rely only on regular photogrammetrical procedures and metrical images. In a majority of cases the only available images are the archive images with unknown parameters of interior orientation showing the object of interest in oblique view. With the help of modern high resolution digital elevation models derived from aerial or terrestrial laser scanning (lidar) or from photogrammetric stereo-images by automatic image-matching techniques even single nonmetric high or <b>low</b> <b>oblique</b> image from the past can be applied in the monoplotting procedure to enable 3 D-data extraction of changes through time. The first step of the monoplotting procedure is the orientation of an image in the space by the help of digital elevation model (DEM). When using oblique images tie points between an image and DEM are usually too sparse to enable automatic exterior orientation, still the manual interactive orientation using common features can resolve such shortages. The manual interactive orientation can be very time consuming. Therefore, {{before the start of}} the manual interactive orientation one should be certain if one can expect useful results from the chosen image. But how to decide which image has the highest mapping potential before we introduce a certain oblique image in orientation procedure? The test examples presented in this paper enable guidance for the use of monoplotting method for different geoscience applications. The most important factors are the resolution of digital elevation model (the best are the lidar derived ones), the presence of appropriate common features and the incidence angle of the oblique images (<b>low</b> <b>oblique</b> images or almost vertical aeria...|$|E

40|$|The Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing {{laboratory}} 2 ̆ 7 s Image Generation model, DIRSIG, combines {{computer aided design}} (CAD), {{ray tracing}} techniques, radiometric principles, and thermodynamic models to create synthetic imagery.

This paper describes enhancements to the radiometric portion of the code that permits inclusion of variations with azimuth of downwelling sky radiance, solution of the radiometric propagation models using specific radiosonde data including adjustments for the time of day, and the incorporation of background effects from objects adjacent to the target. Simulated scenes are presented that show how these enhancements produce imagery that more closely match observed phenomena.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if infection levels of dwarf mistletoe on ponderosa pine could be detected with color aerial photography. The photography was taken in early September using Kodak Ektachrome Infrared Aero and Ektachrome Aero films at scales of 1 / 4000, 1 / 2000, and 1 / 1000.
