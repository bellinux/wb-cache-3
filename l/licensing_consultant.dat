40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} factors related to socioeconomic status that affect a mother’s ability to breastfeed and the role that nurses play in breastfeeding promotion within a community setting. Research is conducted through a review of the literature and interviews with <b>licensed</b> lactation <b>consultants</b> and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) employees in order to determine various nursing interventions that are most effective in promoting breastfeeding of the specified population. Contributing factors that enhance breastfeeding rates will be included in the review of literature and discussion of findings. Current statistics suggest that there is a disparity in breastfeeding rates between the general population and those women enrolled in supplemental feeding programs such as Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Per WIC, in 2015 only 30. 9 % of WIC infants were exclusively breastfed nationally and only 12. 9 % of those infants were exclusively breastfed until 6 months of age. This paper will examine the various influences that affect breastfeeding rates and how nurses can be utilized in community settings to support mothers of low socioeconomic status. B. S.

40|$|Teaching {{children}} with psychiatric disorders {{can be a}} challenging task. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the impact of the Good Behavior Game (GBG) in {{children with}} psychiatric disorders, and their teachers, in special education. Teachers were trained by <b>licensed</b> school <b>consultants</b> to implement positive behavior support strategies to elicit desired behavior in students. A total of 389 children and their 58 teachers at 11 schools for special primary education were included in the study. Using a cluster randomized controlled design, special education schools were assigned to an intervention condition or an education as usual condition. An increase in emotional and behavioral problems was found in the control group, whereas no change was seen in the intervention group, indicating a modest intervention effect. No effects were found on children’s relationships with teachers or peers. The GBG affected teachers’ sense of self-efficacy in engaging students in schoolwork, but no effects were found on teachers’ self-efficacy in classroom management or on teachers’ burnout symptoms. Thus, although children with psychiatric disorders and their teachers in special education can benefit from the GBG, given the partial effects and modest effect sizes, a longer duration program complemented with additional elements is recommended...|$|R

The Energy Information Administration states that "nuclear power plants generate approximately 20 percent of U. S. electricity (23 percent for Georgia), and the plants in operation today are often seen as attractive assets in the current environment of uncertainty about future fossil fuel prices, high construction costs for new power plants (particularly nuclear plants), and the potential enactment of GHG regulations. " For almost 30 years, no new commercial nuclear plants have been developed in the US. In recent years, interest has been rekindled in this generation source because of the age of existing nuclear power plants and projected demand for power. However, the March 2011 earthquake that hit Japan and damaged several reactors has caused a careful examination of nuclear power plant design and deployment...|$|R
