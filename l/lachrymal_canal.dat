40|$|Objectives:This study {{aimed to}} review the results related to head and jaw {{disorders}} in cases of ectodermal dysplasia. The evaluation of ectodermal dysplasia cases was made by clincal examination and examination of the jaw and facial areas radiologically and on cone-beam 3 -dimensional dental tomography (CBCT) images. Study Design: In the 36 cases evaluated in the study, typical clinical findings of pure hypohidrotic ectodermal displasia (HED) were seen, such as missing teeth, dry skin, hair and nail disorders. CBCT images were obtained from 12 of the 36 cases, aged 1. 5 - 45 years, and orthodontic analyses were made on these images. Results: The clinical and radiological evaluations determined, hypodontia or oligodontia, breathing problems, sweating problems, a history of fever, sparse hair, saddle nose, skin peeling, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, finger and nail deformities, conical teeth anomalies, abnormal tooth root formation, tooth resorption in the root, gingivitis, history of epilepsy, absent <b>lachrymal</b> <b>canals</b> and vision problems in the cases which included to the study. Conclusions: Ectodermal dysplasia cases have a particular place in dentistry and require a professional, multidisciplinary approach in respect of the chewing function, orthognathic problems, growth, oral and dental health. It has been understood that with data obtained from modern technologies such as three-dimensional dental tomography and the treatments applied, {{the quality of life}} of these cases can be improved...|$|R
