5|$|Paul's second children's {{book was}} {{published}} - again by Albert Whitman & Company - in October 2015. Based on his Christmas poem The Night the <b>Lights</b> <b>Went</b> <b>Out</b> on Christmas, the book, illustrated by Scott Brundage, is the whimsical yet heartwarming story of a neighborhood where families trying to outdo one another with Christmas lights and decorations use so much electrical power that the neighborhood is thrown into darkness. The poem originally appeared on Paul's City of Silver Dreams Christmas CD and is included as a downloadable mp3 file with the book.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, the <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> before he {{had the chance to}} do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1914, Lady Diana Cooper's future husband, Duff Cooper, then a Foreign Office official, dined at the Ritz {{with the}} Earl of Essex and his American wife, Adele Capell (née Grant) and Patrick Shaw-Stewart, and {{later that day}} {{announced}} that World War I had broken out to the party. Before the war began, the German and Austrian embassies both retained tables at the Ritz Restaurant. The hotel suffered during the war, and lost nearly £50,000 in 1915 alone; the ballroom was usually empty and <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> by 10pm, but rooms were still in demand and the hoteliers believed it to be worth keeping open. Socialites such as Lady Cynthia Asquith, daughter-in-law of H. H. Asquith and Lord Basil Blackwood were documented in her diaries to have dined at the Ritz {{in the spring of}} 1916. The following year, she held a lavish dinner party with the likes of Osbert Sitwell, Gilbert Russell and Maud Nelke and Clare Tennant.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{passengers}} on board San Juan were able to jump onto {{the deck of the}} S.C.T. Dodd before the two ships drifted apart. Not long after the collision occurred, the <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> on board the San Juan. While heading up to the San Juan's deck, passenger George Houghton, observed a group of distressed passengers by the main stairwell, shouting at each other and praying. Houghton compared the sight to Dante's Inferno. Shortly after the collision, the San Juan began to capsize on its port side and start sinking stern first. Wireless operator Clifford Paulson hurriedly returned to his room and began sending out distress signals. Soon after a single ship had replied, water rushed in through Paulson's door and completely flooded his room. Luckily, Paulson was able to escape.|$|E
25|$|The {{brothers}} {{continued their}} rivalry with their individual opponents before reuniting for a rematch {{on the last}} SmackDown! before Armageddon. This time, the match {{would go to a}} double disqualification as Kennedy threatened to run over Kane with a hearse parked ringside. The Undertaker, who had run off MVP, emerged in the passenger seat as his gong tolled and the <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> thus scaring Kennedy out of the vehicle. At Armageddon, Undertaker defeated Kennedy in a Last Ride match, which was why the hearse had been at ringside for the last two weeks, and Kane defeated MVP earlier in an inferno match. The next week on SmackDown!, the Brothers would reunite once again, defeating King Booker and Finlay, before parting ways as Kane began a rivalry with The Great Khali while Undertaker successfully pursued the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 23.|$|E
25|$|Undertaker {{would return}} on the March 6 episode of Raw after Braun Strowman called out Reigns. Strowman left the ring {{following}} a brief staredown with Undertaker, who was then confronted by Reigns. After disrespectful comments were made by Reigns, The Undertaker performed a chokeslam on him. This led to a No Holds Barred match between Undertaker and Reigns at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Undertaker lost to Reigns after five spears in his fourth WrestleMania main event. After the match, Undertaker left his gloves, coat and hat {{in the center of}} the ring before slowly making his exit, also walking over to his wife Michelle McCool to kiss her, then walked up the ramp and performed his signature arm-raised pose as smoke surrounded him and he descended down into the ramp to the sound of his music. After he disappeared, the <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> and his signature gong sounded off three times to end the show.|$|E

25|$|The {{return of}} the Brothers of Destruction was {{announced}} on October 27, 2006 episode of SmackDown!. Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) interfered with Kane's match against Mr. Kennedy, helping Kennedy beat down on him before the <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> and the Undertaker's music came on. When the lights came back on Kane was gone, nowhere to be found. As {{a result of the}} interference, General Manager Theodore Long scheduled a tag team match: The Brothers of Destruction vs. Kennedy and MVP. The next week on SmackDown!, the Brothers of Destruction reunited {{for the first time as}} a tag team in five years and gathered three wins over MVP and Mr Kennedy in that one night. The first win was made by countout, the second was by a disqualification at which point General Manager Theodore Long twice came out and restarted the match with no disqualifications or countouts. Finally, the brothers hit simultaneous chokeslams, and Undertaker finished with a Tombstone Piledriver to Mr. Kennedy.|$|E
25|$|As {{the ship}} turned slowly to comb torpedoes, two sticks of bombs fell {{on either side}} of the tanker. The vessel lifted, and went on lifting until she was clean out of the water. Cascades of spray and bomb {{splinters}} lashed the deck, she fell back with a crash. Ohio had differential gearing which slowed the propeller automatically; on other ships, the same effect would have shaken the engines out of their rooms. Continuously bombed, the tanker kept on steaming until another explosion to starboard sent her reeling to port. The engine-room <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> plunging her into darkness. The master switches had been thrown off by the force of the explosion, but they were quickly switched on again by an electrician. This time, the ship had not escaped damage. The boiler fires were blown out, and it was a race against time to restore them before the steam pressure dropped too low to work the fuel pumps. The engineers lit the fire starter torches to restart the furnaces.|$|E
25|$|Rossakoff {{arrives at}} Poirot's flat. She happily confesses to Poirot that {{she put the}} jewels in the professor's pocket as she had found them in her own bag when the raid started, and {{so she had to}} get rid of them as quickly as she could. It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E

25|$|The race {{began at}} 15:30 local time. The damage to Ye's {{car from the}} {{qualification}} race {{was so great that}} he was unable to start the main event. Ilott's right-rear tyre was changed after he reported vibrations on his warm-up lap. As the five red <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to signal the start of the race, Ilott made a fast start and moved in front of Félix da Costa. However, neither driver took the lead, as Sette Cãmara used the slipstream to his advantage and gained the lead going through Mandarin corner and defended the position heading into the inside of Lisboa corner as other drivers attempted to brake later than him. Félix da Costa managed to claim second position from Ilott with the British driver falling to fifth after being passed by Yamashita and Rosenqvist. Rosenqvist made a good start moving from sixth to fourth {{by the end of the}} first lap. At the end of the first lap, Sette Cãmara led Félix da Costa by 1.2 seconds which he extended by two-tenths of a second at the conclusion of the following lap. Rosenqvist attacked Yamashita on lap two but could not overtake the Japanese driver. Yamashita lost third place on the third lap when he was overtaken by Rosenqvist going into Lisboa corner which allowed Ilott to move to the inside lane and take fourth place from the Japanese driver at San Francisco Bend turn despite minor contact between the two drivers.|$|E
500|$|Titanic was {{subjected}} to extreme opposing forces– the flooded bow pulling her down while {{the air in the}} stern kept her to the surface– which were concentrated at one of the weakest points in the structure, the area of the engine room hatch. Shortly after the <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> the ship split apart. The submerged bow may have remained attached to the stern by the keel for a short time, pulling the stern to a high angle before separating and leaving the stern to float for a few minutes longer. The forward part of the stern would have flooded very rapidly, causing it to tilt and then settle briefly until sinking. The ship disappeared from view at 02:20, 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg. Thayer reported that it rotated on the surface, [...] "gradually [...] her deck away from us, as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle... Then, with the deadened noise of the bursting of her last few gallant bulkheads, she slid quietly away from us into the sea." ...|$|E

Nash reported that McEntire [...] "still hits her stride {{with the more}} traditional songs of emotional turmoil, above all combining a spectacular vocal performance with a terrific song on 'Buying Her Roses,' a wife's head-spinning discovery of her husband's other woman." [...] The release peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, while also reaching No. 13 on the Billboard 200, and eventually sold four million copies. Its title track became McEntire's sixteenth number-one, followed by [...] "Is There Life Out There", which also reached No. 1 on the Billboard country music chart. The third single, [...] "The Greatest Man I Never Knew," [...] peaked in the Top 5 and her cover of Vicki Lawrence's [...] "The Night the <b>Lights</b> <b>Went</b> <b>Out</b> in Georgia" [...] reached No. 12. [...] "If I Had Only Known," [...] a cut from this album, was later included in the soundtrack to the 1994 film 8 Seconds.|$|E

When the five red <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to signal {{the start of the}} race, Vettel maintained his pole position advantage heading into the second corner. Hamilton accelerated faster than Webber off the line, overtaking him heading into the second turn. Vettel fended off an challenge from Hamilton who made contact with Vettel's right wheel in the second corner and Hamilton reported that he had a vibration in his left-front tyre. The contact damaged Hamilton's front wing. Webber made contact with Button and dropped to ninth {{by the end of the}} first lap. Petrov lost the most amount of places, falling from tenth to 16th by the conclusion of the lap. This was due to Petrov experiencing a large amount of wheelspin when he drove away from his starting position. At the end of the first lap, Vettel led from Hamilton, Alonso, Massa, Kubica, Button, Barrichello, Hülkenberg, Webber, Buemi, Schumacher, Sutil, Liuzzi, Rosberg, Petrov, Alguersuari, de la Rosa, Kobayashi, Kovalainen, di Grassi, Glock, Chandhok and Trulli.|$|E

Most drivers started on the super-soft compound tyre. Alguersuari started from the pit lane as his team discovered a coolant leak in his car. As the five red <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to signal {{the start of the}} race, Alonso maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner and withstood Vettel's attempt to pass him. Button got an early advantage over teammate Hamilton, but Hamilton fought him to retain third place. Barrichello fell from sixth to eighth place. Kubica passed Rosberg at the start but the German regained the sixth position in the same lap. Further down the field, the early momentum was broken when Heidfeld, attempting to overtake both Force India cars at turn seven, hit Sutil's rear, damaging his front wing. Liuzzi subsequently went into Heidfeld's rear-end after the latter squeezed him towards the wall, causing front wing damage to his car. Heidfeld made a pit stop for a replacement front wing at the end of lap one, while Massa made his only pit stop of the race for the medium compound tyres.|$|E

The top ten qualifiers started on the super-soft compound tyre. As the five red <b>lights</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to signal the start of the race, Vettel released his clutch pedal, found that he had poor acceleration driving off his starting position, but avoided stalling his engine. He drove right towards Alonso in an attempt to squeeze the latter towards the pit lane wall heading into the first corner. Alonso was running on the racing line and managed to overtake Vettel. However, neither driver took the lead as Massa had made a fast start and passed both drivers around the outside. Button avoided hitting the back-end of Vettel's car by swerving and braking early for the first corner. Further round, Alguersuari committed to the braking zone late at the turn six hairpin, drove into the rear of his teammate Buemi, which removed Buemi's rear wing and Alguerusari's front wing, and debris was littered across the track. Hamilton passed Webber for fourth place on the same lap. At {{the end of the first}} lap, the order was: Massa, Alonso, Vettel, Hamilton, Webber, Button, Kubica, Schumacher, Rosberg and Kobayashi.|$|E
