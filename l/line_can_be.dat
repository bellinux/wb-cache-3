5|$|At the {{headland}} at Grenen, {{the northernmost}} point of Denmark, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea meet. Because of their different densities, a clear dividing <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen. As {{a result of}} turbulent seas, beachings and shipwrecks were common. These frequent losses combined with the town's strategic location as the gateway to the Baltic led to Skagen being the site of one of Denmark's earliest lighthouses, Vippefyr, a lever light constructed in 1627. A faithful copy has now been constructed {{on the site of}} the original.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E
5|$|Transfer to the Kolsås-, Røa- and Holmenkoll Line is {{available}} at Majorstuen; transfer to the Lamberseter, Østensjø- and Furuset Line {{is available}} at Tøyen and transfer to the Grorud Line {{is available at}} Carl Berners plass. Transfer to Oslo Central Station, which serves all trains in Eastern Norway, is available at Jernbanetorget. Most west-bound trains can also be reached at Nationaltheatret, and trains along the Gjøvik <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reached at Grefsen Station, that is close, but not adjacent, to Storo. The Oslo Tramway can be reached from several stations. In the city centre, transfer to all lines is possible at Jernbanetorget; all lines but no. 12 can also be reached at either Stortinget or Nationaltheatret. Lines 11, 12 and 19 all terminate at Majorstuen; lines 17 and 18 run via Forskningsparken; lines 11, 12 and 13 {{can be reached at}} Storo; and line 17 runs past Carl Berners plass.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lines</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{classified}} into three types.|$|R

25|$|Any finite {{straight}} <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{extended in}} a straight line.|$|E
25|$|In a plane, {{through a}} point {{not on a}} given {{straight}} line, at most one <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> drawn that never meets the given line.|$|E
25|$|Pointing {{the whip}} {{in front of}} the head, going under the longe <b>line,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to ask a horse to slow or halt.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{thin and}} thick <b>lines</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{replaced}} with <b>lines</b> of different colours.|$|R
50|$|Not only statements, {{but also}} systems of points and <b>lines</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> dualized.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lines</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> visualized {{by placing}} a viscous film on the surface.|$|R
25|$|The Eritrean Railway {{originally}} {{ran from}} Massawa, a port on the Red Sea, via the capital Asmara to Agordat. The <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{divided into three}} sections.|$|E
25|$|There is no regular {{freight traffic}} on the line. However, if there are {{closures}} of the Western Østfold Line, the Eastern <b>Line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used as a bypass if the trains are equipped with ERTMS.|$|E
25|$|In the West, {{the success}} of the Zenit <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> focused on the United Kingdom, {{primarily}} due to the marketing activity and service of TOE, and secondly the originally heavy UK tax-load of up to two-thirds on imported precision cameras.|$|E

25|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) {{tethered}} to a diver is usually towed on {{a thin line}} attached to a reel, spool or other device which allows the diver to control the line length, so that excessive slack <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> avoided.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the first}} <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> read {{from left to}} right or by moving from the first square to second line, third {{syllable}} (2.3) and then to 1.5 to 2.7 to 4.8 to 3.6 to 4.4 to 3.2.|$|E
25|$|A {{line with}} a chosen Cartesian system is called a number line. Every real number has a unique {{location}} on the line. Conversely, every point on the <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> interpreted as a number in an ordered continuum such as the real numbers.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, anti-parallel <b>lines</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> defined {{with respect}} to either lines or angles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} we present a way of {{representing}} pairs of orientations in the plane. This {{is an extension of}} the familiar way of representing single orientations in the plane. Using this framework, pairs of <b>lines</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> added, scaled and averaged over in a sense which is to be described. In particular, single <b>lines</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> incorporated and handled simultaneously. ...|$|R
25|$|All nations {{unilaterally}} {{determine their}} standard time zones, applicable only {{on land and}} adjacent territorial waters. This date <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> called de facto since it {{is not based on}} international law, but on national laws. These national zones do not extend into international waters.|$|E
25|$|Under some {{circumstances}} a guide <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{used as a}} reference for the divers to find the hole after the dive or in an emergency {{in a similar way}} to cave diving or wreck penetration instead of a lifeline. In these cases the divers should be competent in procedures for diving with a guideline.|$|E
25|$|Several of Brunel's bridges {{over the}} Great Western Railway might be {{demolished}} because {{the line is}} to be electrified, and there is inadequate clearance for overhead wires. Buckinghamshire County Council is negotiating to have further options pursued, in order that all nine of the remaining historic bridges on the <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> saved.|$|E

25|$|In August 2008 it was {{announced}} that a number of speed limits on the relief lines between Reading and London have been raised so that 86% of the <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used at , however the time allowed between stations for trains running on the relief lines has been reduced in the December 2008 timetable to improve timekeeping.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Wythop Mill is nearby to the north. From here the road can be {{followed}} {{up the narrow}} wooded valley between Ling and Sale Fell. Half a mile up, a good path breaks right onto the slopes of Ling Fell. After taking a contouring course around the northern flanks of the fell a direct <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> taken to the summit.|$|E
25|$|Because {{double and}} single track may use {{different}} signalling systems, {{it may be}} awkward and confusing to mix double and single track too often. For example, intermediate mechanical signal boxes on a double-track <b>line</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> closed during periods of light traffic, but this cannot be done {{if there is a}} single-line section in between. This problem is less serious with electrical signalling such as Centralized traffic control.|$|E
