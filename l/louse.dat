5|$|Humans host {{three species}} of <b>louse,</b> the head <b>louse,</b> the body <b>louse</b> and the pubic <b>louse.</b> The body <b>louse</b> has the {{smallest}} genome of any known insect; {{it has been}} used as a model organism and has been the subject of much research.|$|E
5|$|The {{human body}} <b>louse</b> Pediculus humanus humanus has (2010) the {{smallest}} insect genome known. This <b>louse</b> can transmit certain diseases while the human head <b>louse</b> (P. h. capitis), {{to which it}} is closely related, cannot. With their simple life history and small genomes, the pair make ideal model organisms to study the molecular mechanisms behind the transmission of pathogens and vector competence.|$|E
5|$|Lice were {{ubiquitous}} in human society {{until at least}} the Middle Ages. They appear in folktales, songs such as The Kilkenny <b>Louse</b> House, and novels such as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis. A <b>louse</b> {{was one of the}} early subjects of microscopy, appearing in Robert Hooke's 1667 book, Micrographia.|$|E
5|$|Humans host three {{different}} kinds of lice: head <b>lice,</b> body <b>lice,</b> and pubic <b>lice.</b> Lice infestations can be controlled with <b>lice</b> combs, and medicated shampoos or washes.|$|R
50|$|Body <b>lice</b> {{are spread}} through {{direct contact with}} the body, clothing, or other {{personal}} items of a person already carrying <b>lice.</b> Pubic <b>lice</b> are most often spread by intimate contact with an infested person. Head <b>lice</b> occur on the head hair, body <b>lice</b> on the clothing, and pubic <b>lice</b> mainly on the hair near the groin. Lice cannot burrow into the skin.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} contains {{information on}} the control of poultry insects. Poultry Lice Poultry <b>lice</b> are small, wingless insects with chewing mouthparts. The most common in Nebraska are brown chicken <b>lice</b> and chicken body <b>lice.</b> Less important are large chicken <b>lice,</b> shaft <b>lice,</b> chicken head <b>lice,</b> fluff <b>lice,</b> and several other species which are rarely present. Poultry Mites Several kinds of mites attack poultry. The most common are chicken mites and northern fowl mites. Occasionally scaley-leg mites are a problem...|$|R
5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of <b>louse</b> taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. <b>Louse</b> sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among <b>louse</b> subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E

5|$|Ectoparasites {{are seven}} species of mites, five ticks, five fleas, a <b>louse,</b> and the subdermal botfly larva, Cuterebra. Known endoparasites are three species of protozoans found in fecal smears, one trematode, four cestodes, seven nematodes, and nymphal pentastomids found in various {{internal}} organs.|$|E
40|$|Reciprocal {{selective}} effects between coevolving {{species are}} often influenced by {{interactions with the}} broader ecological community. Community-level interactions may also influence macroevolutionary patterns of coevolution, such as cospeciation, but this hypothesis has received little attention. We studied two groups of ecologically similar feather <b>lice</b> (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) that differ in their patterns of association with a single group of hosts. The two groups, “body lice” and “wing lice,” are both parasites of pigeons and doves (Columbiformes). Body <b>lice</b> are more host-specific and show greater population genetic structure than wing <b>lice.</b> The macroevolutionary history of body <b>lice</b> also parallels that of their columbiform hosts more closely than does the evolutionary history of wing <b>lice.</b> The closer association of body <b>lice</b> with hosts, compared with wing <b>lice,</b> can be explained if body <b>lice</b> are less capable of switching hosts than wing <b>lice.</b> Wing <b>lice</b> sometimes disperse phoretically on parasitic flies (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), but body <b>lice</b> seldom engage in this behavior. We tested the hypothesis that wing <b>lice</b> switch host species more often than body <b>lice,</b> and that the difference is governed by phoresis. Our results show that, where flies are present, wing <b>lice</b> switch to novel host species in sufficient numbers to establish viable populations on the new host. Body <b>lice</b> do not switch hosts, even where flies are present. Thus, differences in the coevolutionary history of wing and body <b>lice</b> {{can be explained by}} differences in host-switching, mediated {{by a member of the}} broader parasite community...|$|R
5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head <b>lice</b> and body <b>lice</b> provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body <b>lice</b> occupy distinct ecological zones: head <b>lice</b> live and {{feed on the}} scalp, while body <b>lice</b> live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body <b>lice</b> require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body <b>lice</b> from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of the}} date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|R
5000|$|Psocodea is a {{taxonomic group}} of insects {{comprising}} the bark <b>lice,</b> book <b>lice</b> and true <b>lice.</b> It was formerly considered a superorder, {{but is now}} generally considered by entomologists as an order. Despite the greatly differing appearance of <b>lice,</b> they {{are believed to have}} evolved from within the former order [...] "Psocoptera", which contained the bark <b>lice</b> and book <b>lice.</b> Psocodea contains around 11,000 species, divided among seven suborders.|$|R
5|$|In 1935 the Harvard medical {{researcher}} Hans Zinsser {{wrote the}} book Rats, Lice and History, alleging that both body and head lice transmit typhus between humans. Despite this, the modern view is that only the body <b>louse</b> can transmit the disease.|$|E
5|$|A louse's color {{varies from}} pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, {{it may become}} {{considerably}} darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond {{is very difficult to}} sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living <b>louse</b> eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead <b>louse</b> eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{new species}} of chewing <b>louse,</b> Psittacobrosus bechsteini, was {{described}} based on a dead specimen discovered on a museum skin of the Cuban macaw. It {{is thought to have}} been unique to this species, and is therefore an example of coextinction. The feather mite species Genoprotolichus eurycnemis and Distigmesikya extincta have also been reported from Cuban macaw skins, the latter new to science.|$|E
40|$|Background: Due {{to a lack}} of evidence, {{controversy}} exists {{about the}} role of bedding in the transmission of head <b>lice.</b> Aims: To determine the proportion of the head <b>lice</b> population found on pillowcases of people with head <b>lice,</b> and to test strategies available to householders to kill head <b>lice</b> on pillowcases. Methods: To assess the incidence of head <b>lice</b> on pillowcases, people with active pediculosis had their head <b>lice</b> collected and counted and the pillowcase they had used the night before examined for head <b>lice.</b> To test strategies to kill head <b>lice</b> on pillowcases, live head <b>lice</b> were experimentally placed in miniature pillowcases, and the cases were subjected to a hot wash, a cold wash, hot dryer, and hanging out to dry on an outdoor clothes line. Results: Forty-eight people and their pillowcases were recruited from Townsville, Qld, Australia (dry tropics). One thousand, eight hundred and forty-five <b>lice</b> were collected from their heads to give an average and median intensity of infection of 38. 4 and 21 <b>lice,</b> respectively. Two of the 48 pillowcases contained live <b>lice,</b> one nymph on each, 2 h and 9 h after the pillowcases had been removed from the bed. Another pillowcase contained a dehydrated nymph. The incidence of live <b>lice</b> on pillowcases was 4. 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} {{status of}} the head and body <b>lice</b> of humans has been debated for more than 200 yr. To clarify the specific status of head and body <b>lice,</b> we sequenced 524 base pairs (bp) of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of 28 head and 28 body <b>lice</b> from nine countries. Ten haplotypes that differed by 1 - 5 bp at II nucleotide positions were identified. A phylogeny of these sequences indicates that these head and body <b>lice</b> are not from reciprocally monophyletic lineages. Indeed, head and body <b>lice</b> share three of the 10 haplotypes we found. F-ST values and exact tests of haplotype frequencies showed significant differences between head and body <b>lice.</b> However, the same tests also showed significant differences among <b>lice</b> from different countries. Indeed, more of the variation in haplotype frequencies was explained by differences among <b>lice</b> from different countries than by differences between head and body <b>lice.</b> Our results indicate the following: (1) bead and body <b>lice</b> do not represent reciprocally monophyletic lineages and are conspecific; (2) gene flow among populations of <b>lice</b> from different countries is limited; and (3) frequencies of COI haplotypes can be used to study maternal gene flow among populations of head and body <b>lice</b> and thus transmission of <b>lice</b> among their human hosts...|$|R
50|$|Sucking <b>lice</b> (Anoplura, {{formerly}} known as Siphunculata) have around 500 species and represent the smaller of the two traditional suborders of <b>lice.</b> As opposed to the paraphyletic chewing <b>lice,</b> which are now divided among three suborders, the sucking <b>lice</b> are monophyletic.|$|R
5|$|Isospora anthochaerae is an Apicomplexan {{parasite}} {{that has}} been isolated from the red wattlebird in Western Australia, from oocytes collected from faecal samples. Species of bird <b>louse</b> that have been recorded on the red wattlebird include Menacanthus eurysternus {{and members of the}} genera Brueelia, Myrsidea and Philopterus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Louse</b> (plural: lice) is {{the common}} name {{for members of the}} order Phthiraptera, which {{contains}} nearly 5,000 species of wingless insect. Lice are obligate parasites, living externally on warm-blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal, except for monotremes, pangolins, bats and cetaceans. Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 5,000 {{species of}} <b>louse</b> have been identified, about 4,000 being {{parasitic}} on birds and 800 on mammals. Lice are present on every continent {{in all the}} habitats that their host animals and birds occupy. They are found even in the Antarctic, where penguins carry 15 species of lice (in the genera Austrogonoides and Nesiotinus).|$|E

We detected R. prowazekii in body <b>lice</b> from Burundi in 1997 and in <b>lice</b> from Burundi and Rwanda in 2001; B. quintana infections of body <b>lice</b> were widespread. We did not detect B. recurrentis in any <b>lice...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mallophaga are a {{suborder}} of <b>lice,</b> {{known as}} chewing <b>lice,</b> biting <b>lice</b> or bird <b>lice,</b> containing more than 3000 species. These <b>lice</b> are external parasites that feed mainly on birds, although some species also feed on mammals. They infest {{both domestic and}} wild animals and birds, and cause considerable irritation to their hosts. They have paurometabolis or incomplete metamorphosis.|$|R
40|$|Some people host <b>lice</b> on the {{clothing}} {{as well as}} the head. Whether body <b>lice</b> and head <b>lice</b> are distinct species or merely variants of the same species remains contentious. We sought to ascertain the extent to which <b>lice</b> from these different habitats might interbreed on doubly infected people by comparing their entire mitochondrial genome sequences. Toward this end, we analyzed two sets of published genetic data from double-infections of body <b>lice</b> and head lice: 1) entire mitochondrial coding regions (≈ 15. 4 kb) from body <b>lice</b> and head <b>lice</b> from seven doubly infected people from Ethiopia, China, and France; and 2) part of the cox 1 gene (≈ 486 bp) from body <b>lice</b> and head <b>lice</b> from a further nine doubly infected people from China, Nepal, and Iran. These mitochondrial data, from 65 <b>lice,</b> revealed extraordinary variation in the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms between the individual body <b>lice</b> and individual head <b>lice</b> of double-infections: from 1. 096 kb of 15. 4 kb (7. 6 %) to 2 bps of 15. 4 kb (0. 01 %). We detected coinfections of <b>lice</b> of Clades A and C on the scalp hair of three of the eight people from Nepal: one person of the two people from Kathmandu and two of the six people from Pokhara. Lice of Clades A and B coinfected the scalp hair of one person from Atherton, Far North Queensland, Australia. These findings argue for additional large-scale studies of the body <b>lice</b> and head <b>lice</b> of double-infected people...|$|R
5|$|The {{phylloxera}} {{epidemic in}} the 19th century severely affected the Languedoc wine industry, killing off {{many of the}} higher quality Vitis vinifera that were susceptible to the <b>louse.</b> American rootstock that was naturally resistant to phylloxera did not take well to the limestone soil on the hillside. In place of these vines, acres of the lower quality Aramon, Alicante Bouschet and Carignan were planted.|$|E
