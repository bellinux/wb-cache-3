It features a 5.7 inch 1920x1080 resolution OLED display, and operates at 120fps which can eliminate blur and produce a smooth image; the device also has a <b>low</b> <b>latency</b> of less than 18ms.

However, Cell's strengths may make it useful for scientific computing regardless of its mainstream success.|$|E

25|$|Like all thin clients, {{when using}} X across a network, {{bandwidth}} limitations can impede {{the use of}} bitmap-intensive applications that require rapidly updating large portions of the screen with <b>low</b> <b>latency,</b> such as 3D animation or photo editing. Even a relatively small uncompressed 640x480x24bit 30fps video stream can easily outstrip the bandwidth of a 100Mbit/s network for a single client. In contrast, modern versions of X generally have extensions such as MESA allowing local display of a local program's graphics to be optimized to bypass the network model and directly control the video card, for use of full-screen video, rendered 3D applications, and other such applications.|$|E
25|$|No {{efficient}} dedicated SLOG device, when synchronous {{writing is}} prominent — this is notably {{the case for}} NFS and ESXi; even SSD based systems may need a separate SLOG device for expected performance. The SLOG device is only used for writing apart from when recovering from a system error. It can often be small (for example, in FreeNAS, the SLOG device only needs to store the largest amount of data likely to be written in about 10 seconds (or the size of two 'transaction groups'), although {{it can be made}} larger to allow longer lifetime of the device). SLOG is therefore unusual in that its main criteria are pure write functionality, <b>low</b> <b>latency,</b> and loss protection – usually little else matters.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose To {{analyze the}} latency and {{amplitude}} of P 300 responses obtained with electrodes positioned at Cz and Fz {{and in different}} tasks of infrequent stimulus identification in normal hearing individuals. Methods Forty adults of both genders participated in the study. Three recordings with three different tasks were obtained for {{the identification of the}} infrequent stimulus; simultaneous recordings were obtained from Cz and Fz positions. Results Cz position showed significantly greater amplitudes and lower latencies than Fz. Regarding the three tasks, only &# 8220;pronouncing the word &# 8217;thin&# 8217;&# 8221; was different from &# 8220;raising a finger&# 8221;, with <b>lowest</b> <b>latencies</b> for the verbal task. Regarding amplitude, significantly higher values were observed for &# 8220;raising a finger&# 8221;, followed by &# 8220;pronouncing the word &# 8216;thin&# 8217;&# 8221; and mental counting.

2500|$|Waves, {{described}} by Google as [...] "equal parts conversation and document", are hosted XML documents that allow seamless and <b>low</b> <b>latency</b> concurrent modifications. Any participant {{of a wave}} can reply anywhere within the message, edit {{any part of the}} wave, and add participants at any point in the process. Each edit/reply is a blip and users can reply to individual blips within waves. Recipients are notified of changes/replies in all waves in which they are active and, upon opening a wave, may review those changes in chronological order. In addition, waves are live. All replies/edits are visible in real-time, letter-by-letter, as they are typed by the other collaborators. Multiple participants may edit a single wave simultaneously in Google Wave. Thus, waves can function not only as e-mails and threaded conversations but also as an instant messaging service when many participants are online at the same time. A wave may repeatedly shift roles between e-mail and instant messaging depending on the number of users editing it concurrently. The ability to show messages as they are typed can be disabled, similar to conventional instant messaging.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{incompatible}} {{in every}} way with any other consumer electronics product, the 64DD's magnetic storage technology resembles the generic floppy disk, and the large and sturdy shell of the proprietary Zip disk for personal computers. [...] Though various prominent sources have mistakenly referred to the medium as being magneto-optical technology, Nintendo's own developer documentation refers to it in detail as being magnetic. [...] Complementing their proprietary and copy-protected cartridge strategy, the proprietary 64MB disk format was Nintendo's faster, more flexible, and copy-protected answer to the commodity Compact Disc format, which is cheaper to produce but is much slower, read-only, and easier to copy on personal computers. The most advanced CD technology delivered by the contemporaneous Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation game consoles can hold at least 650megabytes (MB) of information with a peak 300kB/s throughput and more than 200ms seek speed. This compares to the Nintendo 64's cartridge's 4 to 64MB size and 5 to 50MB/s of <b>low</b> <b>latency</b> and instantaneous load times, and the 64DD's 64MB disk size and 1MB/s peak throughput with 75 ms average seek latency. The high seek latency and low maximum throughput of a 2x CD-ROM drive contribute to stuttering and to very long loading times throughout a gameplay session in many titles, {{in addition to a}} much higher production cost, testing cycle, and potential development time for all the potential extra content.|$|E

30|$|Current CPRI-based {{transport}} networks consider just {{two types of}} traffic to be transported: data and control signals. Synchronization is directly supplied via CPRI line rate. Given the variety of potential 5 G RATs, applications, and functional splits, {{many different types of}} traffic will have to be transported in 5 G {{transport networks}}, each with their own requirements. While split A traffic will require <b>low</b> <b>latencies,</b> split C traffic can typically cope with much relaxed latencies. On the other hand, Tactile Internet traffic will require <b>low</b> <b>latencies</b> even for split C. To transport these different types of traffic over a unified network with singular requirements based on the strictest use case would clearly be cost-inefficient. A future transport network will hence have to support streams with different qualities of service. Packet-based networking can here also help to facilitate this via packet prioritization. However, this will make the management of the network more challenging, calling for SDN solutions.|$|R
40|$|Applications {{of human}} action {{recognition}} in interactive {{systems such as}} games require the robust real-time recognition of human actions at <b>low</b> <b>latencies</b> from a stream of observations. The current paradigms of action recognition either treat the pre-segmented sequence as a whole unit to be classified, or classify a range of frames as action, evaluating the performance using a frame-by-frame measure. We argue that both paradigms are limited when addressing latency requirements. Instead, we propose the notion of “action points ” to serve as natural temporal anchors of simple human actions. Action points enable latency-aware training and evaluation of online recognition systems. To demonstrate the usefulness of action points we show how two different systems, a Hidden Markov Model and a direct classification approach {{can be used with}} action point annotations. We evaluate our approach on two data sets with different input modalities and show that our abstraction of action points is useful in settings where human action recognition has to be performed online and at <b>low</b> <b>latencies.</b> ...|$|R
