50|$|Budding's first {{machine was}} 19 in wide with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind. Cast-iron gear wheels {{transmitted}} {{power from the}} rear roller to the cutting cylinder, allowing the rear roller to drive the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. Another roller placed between the cutting cylinder and the main or <b>land</b> <b>roller</b> could be raised or lowered to alter the height of cut. The grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray-like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front to help pull the machine along. Overall, these machines were remarkably similar to modern mowers.|$|E
5000|$|Budding had {{the idea}} of the {{lawnmower}} after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a cutting cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap from the surface of woollen cloth and give a smooth finish.Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the lawn on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830. [...] It took ten more years and further innovations to create a machine that could be worked by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. The first machine produced was 19 inches in width with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind with motive power coming from the rear <b>land</b> <b>roller</b> which drove gears to transfer the drive to the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. There was another roller placed in between the cutting cylinder and the <b>land</b> <b>roller</b> which was adjustable to alter the height of cut. On cutting, the grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front of the machine which could be used to help pull it along. Two of the earliest Budding machines sold went to Regent's Park Zoological Gardens in London and the Oxford Colleges. [...] In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding, dated 18 May 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of development, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's surface. Budding went into partnership with a local engineer, John Ferrabee, and together they made mowers in a factory at Thrupp near Stroud.|$|E
5000|$|The roller coaster's maximum {{vertical}} angle is 112 degrees, {{making it the}} world's steepest roller coaster from 4 July 2009 until 16 July 2011. The official park press release stated that the Mumbo Jumbo opening will be attended by representatives of Guinness World Records. Andrea Banfi of Guinness World Records said: [...] "We will be in attendance {{at the opening of}} Flamingo <b>Land's</b> new <b>roller</b> coaster and look forward to this new Guinness World Records record in the 'Steepest roller coaster made from steel' category".|$|R

5|$|Athletes {{train to}} achieve endurance, strength, speed, skill and {{flexibility}} {{at different levels}} of intensity. Offseason training often occurs on dry <b>land,</b> sometimes on <b>roller</b> skis. The organization of cross-country ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences. As with other sports that require endurance, strength and speed, some athletes have chosen to use banned performance-enhancing drugs.|$|R

50|$|The film {{is set in}} the Venice, California {{suburb of}} Los Angeles {{at the height of the}} roller skating fad of the late 1970s. Two characters, Bobby James (Bray) and Terry Barkley (Blair), fall in love while boogie skating to disco music. Along the way they must thwart a {{powerful}} mobster who wants the <b>land</b> their favorite <b>roller</b> rink sits on and compete in the Boogie Contest.|$|R
50|$|Artistic roller skaters most {{commonly}} skate on traditional quad skates. Skates designed for artistic skating typically have leather boots, a strong sole plate, and a jump bar for reinforcement. The plate {{has to be}} made from a strong material as it {{has to be able to}} withstand the shock of jumping and <b>landing.</b> Artistic <b>roller</b> skates usually have stainless steel or aluminum plates for that reason, even though these are heavier than ones made from other materials such as plastic. Free skaters usually use a toe stop, which can be used in the take-off in certain jumps such as the Mapes or the flip. Dance skaters substitute toe plugs, as the large toe stops are cumbersome when performing dance footwork. Figure skaters generally have specially made plates for figure skating which have no receptacle for the toe stop.|$|R
50|$|Linda Marsh (Mary McDonnell) is a {{housewife}} {{who seems to}} have a perfect life: along with her husband, high school principal George (William Russ) and three loving children Drew (Erik von Detten), Mandy (Camilla Belle) and Willie (Hayden Tank), she is living in a suburban house in a small and peaceful town. One day, she decides to surprise her husband at his office to celebrate their 16th anniversary, and finds him kissing with one of the teachers, Ann Marie Scott (Michele Abrams). Immediately, her life falls apart, and she <b>lands</b> in a <b>roller</b> coaster of emotions.|$|R
50|$|Irritated by Jerry's defiance, Tom barges {{through the}} door, but Jerry puts a banana peel on the floor. Tom avoids it, but <b>lands</b> onto <b>roller</b> skates, which send Tom rolling into the basement. Tom then slides on banana peel and gets {{stuck in a}} wooden garden gate. Tom tries to jump though the upper level window, but due to the board being stuck around his waist, he gets stuck in the window. Jerry locks the window to prevent Tom from escaping. As {{punishment}} for being cruel to the kitten, he decides to spank Tom good.Acting {{on behalf of the}} kitten, Jerry carries out a plan of revenge. He ties up Tom's foot and paddles him on the buttock repeatedly with a very large paddle. The spanking is severe, reducing Tom to tears and complete surrender. After he waves a white flag, he is then forced to act as a slave to Jerry and the kitten. While the kitten happily sips milk from a straw, a disgruntled Tom gives Jerry a massage.|$|R
50|$|Ploughing is {{not always}} {{regarded}} as essential nowadays, but the plough can improve soil by inverting it to improve soil aeration and drainage, release nutrients through weathering, and expose harmful pests to predators. It is also an effective method of weed control. Ploughing depth in Britain varies between 5-6 inches in some limestone regions to up to 18 inches in deep stoneless silt land. Most British ploughs are designed to turn a furrow of up to about a foot deep, which is relatively shallow compared to some other countries, where furrows of up to 16 inches are common. Other machines used to prepare land include cultivators (to break up land too heavy for a normal plough), harrows (to level the surface of ploughed <b>land),</b> rolls or <b>rollers</b> (used for firming the soil), sprayers and dusters (used to spread herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and fertilisers).|$|R
5000|$|After {{a two-year}} {{military}} stint, Wilson settled in Los Angeles, touring the local nightclub circuit {{before joining the}} R&B vocal group the Jewels; from there he <b>landed</b> with the <b>Rollers,</b> followed by a stint with the instrumental combo the Souls. In 1966, Wilson signed with manager Marc Gordon, who quickly sought his client an acappella audition for Johnny Rivers. Wilson was signed to the Soul City imprint and Rivers produced the sessions that yielded the 1968 U.S. R&B hit single The Snake (U.S. Pop #27), which became popular on the Northern Soul circuit in the United Kingdom. It also provided Wilson with his only UK Singles Chart hit, reaching #41 in 1975. The minor hit [...] "Do What You Gotta Do" [...] appeared that same year. In 1969, Wilson charted with his cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's [...] "Lodi" [...] (U.S. #67), and Rivers' own [...] "Poor Side Of Town" [...] (U.S. #75).|$|R
50|$|Now Claude {{is really}} angry. He sharpens an axe {{and runs through}} the house like an axe-wielding maniac. Frisky watches from the upstairs hallway and Claude notices. Claude runs up the stairs toward Frisky but Frisky sneaks up behind Claude and lets out a loud bark, sending Claude and the axe skyward. Stuck on the ceiling, Claude {{falls to the floor}} when the axe handle comes out of the hole, landing on and sliding down the banister. He <b>lands</b> on a <b>roller</b> skate, which sends him {{wheeling}} through the house at break-neck speed. As he holds on for dear life, he moves to avoid any furniture in the way and in a chain reaction, shoots him out the door into a wagon. The wagon then hits a brick wall, sending him sailing through the neighbour's upstairs window, freaking out the lady of the house who lets out a blood-curdling scream. She kicks him back out the window and he lands in a rain barrel {{at the bottom of a}} downspout. Frisky notices and lets out a bark sending Claude airborne again. This time Claude has nothing to hold on to, and he falls into the chimney on the way down, clumsily landing on some fire logs which roll across the room. He grabs on to a water dispenser which doesn't slow him down and the logs, Claude and the water dispenser fall down the basement stairs with a crash. Claude comes back up the stairs but he is inside the water bottle, only his feet are outside the lip of the bottle. Frisky reappears and barks at Claude, sending him airborne toward the ceiling again. As he hits the ceiling, the bottle smashes open and the glass and what's left of the water fall toward the floor sending a frightened Frisky out of the scene.|$|R
