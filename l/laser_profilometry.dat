40|$|The {{determination}} of line crossing sequences between rollerball pens and laser printers presents difficulties {{that may not}} be overcome using traditional techniques. This research aimed to study the potential of digital microscopy and 3 -D <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry</b> to determine line crossing sequences between a toner and an aqueous ink line. Different paper types, rollerball pens, and writing pressure were tested. Correct opinions of the sequence were given for all case scenarios, using both techniques. When the toner was printed before the ink, a light reflection was observed in all crossing specimens, while this was never observed in the other sequence types. The 3 -D <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry,</b> more time-consuming, presented the main advantage of providing quantitative results. The findings confirm the potential of the 3 -D <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry</b> and demonstrate the efficiency of digital microscopy as a new technique for determining the sequence of line crossings involving rollerball pen ink and toner. With the mass marketing of laser printers and the popularity of rollerball pens, the {{determination of}} line crossing sequences between such instruments is encountered by forensic document examiners. This type of crossing presents difficulties with optical microscopic line crossing techniques involving ballpoint pens or gel pens and toner (1 - 4). Indeed, the rollerball's aqueous ink penetrates through the toner and is absorbed by the fibers of the paper, leaving the examiner with the impression that the toner is above the ink even when it is not (5). Novotny and Westwood (3) investigated the possibility of determining aqueous ink and toner crossing sequences by microscopic observation of the intersection before and after toner removal. A major disadvantage of their study resides in destruction of the sample by scraping off the toner line to see what was underneath. The aim of this research was to investigate the ways to overcome these difficulties through digital microscopy and three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry.</b> The former was used as a technique for the determination of sequences between gel pen and toner printing strokes, but provided less conclusive results than that of an optical stereomicroscope (4). 3 -D <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry,</b> which allows one to observe and measure the topography of a surface, {{has been the subject of}} a number of recent studies in this area. Berx and De Kinder (6) and Schirripa Spagnolo (7, 8) have tested the application of <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry</b> to determine the sequence of intersections of several lines. The results obtained in these studies overcome disadvantages of other methods applied in this area, such as scanning electron microscope or the atomic force microscope. The main advantages of 3 -D <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry</b> include the ease of implementation of the technique and its nondestructive nature, which does not require sample preparation (8 - 10). Moreover, the technique is reproducible and presents a high degree of freedom in the vertical axes (up to 1000 μm). However, when the paper surface presents a given roughness, if the pen impressions alter the paper with a depth similar to the roughness of medium, the results are not always conclusive (8). It becomes difficult in this case to distinguish which characteristics can be imputed to the pen impressions or the quality of the paper surface. This important limitation is assessed by testing different types of paper of variable quality (of different grammage and finishing) and the writing pressure. The authors will therefore assess the limits of 3 -D <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry</b> technique and determine whether the method can overcome such constraints. Second, the authors will investigate the use of digital microscopy because it presents a number of advantages: it is efficient, user-friendly, and provides an objective evaluation and interpretation...|$|E

The fretting experiments were performed under gross-slip regime. The influence of a number of fretting test parameters on the friction and wear behaviour was investigated, as the contact frequency, the normal load, and number of reciprocating sliding cycles.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to adapt the fabrication of cylindrical microchannels by directed assembly for industrial purposes. The directed assembly consists of the extrusion of a fugitive organic ink through a micro-nozzle under constant pressure combined with a layer-by-layer robotic deposition on a substrate for the creation of geometrically complex structures. A multi-axis motion platform has been developed in order to adapt this technique to rapid fabrication. This platform and custom-made software enable the writing of two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2 D and 3 D) ink networks at a high velocity and positioning accuracy. Improvements on the hardware, software and communication integration were accomplished on this dedicated platform in order to achieve the fast fabrication of precise 3 D microstructures. Under similar deposition conditions, the platform developed allowed maximum deposition velocities of more than one order of magnitude superior to the usual writing speeds (i. e., between 1 to 8 mm/s). The filaments deposited were characterized by <b>laser</b> scanning <b>profilometry</b> and optical microscopy.

40|$|Fretting wear {{behaviour}} of electrodeposited Cu/Ni multilayer {{films with}} 10 and 5 nm thick sublayers {{has been investigated}} against a hardened steel ball as the counter body and {{compared with that of}} the constituents, Cu and Ni. The wear tests were carried out by using a ball-on-flat geometry at a translation frequency of 8 Hz and slip amplitude of 100 mum. Friction force was recorded on line during the tests. At the end of the tests, the wear scars were examined by <b>laser</b> surface <b>profilometry,</b> scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. It has been observed that the frictional and wear mechanisms are very different for copper, nickel and Cu/Ni multilayers. Fretting of copper creates a relatively smooth wear scar mainly by mechanical ploughing of the asperities on steel counterbody (abrasive wear) and shows a very little third body interaction. Fretting of nickel involves adhesive wear resulting in a large transfer of steel to nickel, which is attributed to the strong chemical interaction between nickel and the steel counterbody. Fretting on multilayers involves a strong third body interaction resulting in ploughing mainly by debris (abrasive wear). The coefficient of friction is approximately 0. 45 for copper, and approximately 0. 8 for nickel as well as for multilayers. The values of the coefficient of friction for nickel and Cu/Ni multilayers found under the present fretting conditions are approximately double the corresponding values reported earlier for sliding wear conditions. It has been found that Cu/Ni multilayer is more resistance to fretting wear than the constituents, copper and nickel. Furthermore, the fretting wear resistance of Cu/Ni multilayers with 5 nm thick sublayer is better than that of the multilayers with 10 nm thick sublayers. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

We here focus on preclinical approaches which have been implemented to assess bacteriophage efficacy against Pseudomonas biofilms and infections. <b>Laser</b> interferometry and <b>profilometry</b> were applied to measure biofilm matrix permeability and surface geometry changes, respectively. These biophysical approaches were combined with an advanced Airway Surface Liquid infection model, which mimics in vitro the normal and CF lung environments, and an in vivo Galleria larvae model. These assays have been implemented to analyze KTN 4 (279, 593 [*]bp dsDNA genome), a type-IV pili dependent, giant phage resembling phiKZ. Upon contact, KTN 4 immediately disrupts the P. aeruginosa PAO 1 biofilm and reduces pyocyanin and siderophore production. The gentamicin exclusion assay on NuLi- 1 and CuFi- 1 cell lines revealed the decrease of extracellular bacterial load between 4 and 7 logs and successfully prevents wild-type Pseudomonas internalization into CF epithelial cells.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, [Ni (4. 5 nm) /Cu (t(Cu) = 2, 4 and 8 nm) ] multilayers were pulse {{electrodeposited}} on stainless steel (AISI SS 304) substrate from sulphate based single bath technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD) {{was used to}} investigate the structure and stress of the Ni/Cu multilayer. The results from XRD analysis indicated that the deposited multilayers had a preferred crystal orientation of [111] and presence of satellite reflection suggested the formation of superlattice. The stress level within the deposited multilayers {{was found to be}} sensitive to the sublayer thickness. Sliding wear behaviour of electrodeposited Ni/Cu multilayer films has been investigated against a tungsten carbide (WC) ball as the counter body and compared with that of the constituents, Cu and Ni coatings. The wear tests were carried out by using a reciprocating ball-on-flat geometry at translation frequencies of 5 and 10 Hz, slip amplitude of I mm and at five different loads of 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 N. Friction force was recorded on-line during the tests. At the end of the tests, the wear scars were examined by <b>laser</b> surface <b>profilometry</b> and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Friction coefficient was found to be dependent on load and Cu layer thickness (t(Cu)) and the values for multilayers were border between Ni and Cu. Among multilayers, sample with minimum t(Cu) has shown the lowest friction coefficient and wear rate. With increasing t(Cu), the wear mechanism changes from pure abrasive wear at t(Cu) = 2 nm, to particle entrapment at t(Cu) = 4 nm to particle embedding at t(Cu) = 8 nm. Detailed investigation of the wear scar morphology as well as wear rate measurement revealed that at low loads, (HIE) ratio and residual stress governed the wear rate and the principle wear mode was abrasive cutting. At intermediate loads, the role of residual stress became insignificant while wear was governed by (HIE) ratio and plastic deformation. However, at higher loads, plastic deformation played the major role. (c) 200...|$|R

Materials and MethodsFreshly mixed Carisolv® {{was applied to the}} oral mucosa of human and rat for 3 min. The soft tissue reactions were evaluated by visual inspection, and biopsies were taken from the rats and examined under light microscopy after histological preparation. Dentine cavities after caries excavation with burrs and Carisolv®, respectively, were chemically characterised with Fourier Transform (FT) Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). A topographical comparison of acid etched dentine cavities after burrs and Carisolv®, respectively, was performed with a Contact Stylus Pofilometer. Furthermore, the surface topography of 3 different types of dental ceramics, a composite resin, a polyacid modified composite resin, and a glass-ionomer material was measured before and after 5, 10, and 20 min exposure to solutions for chemo-mechanical caries removal; topography was performed with Confocal <b>Laser</b> Scanning <b>Profilometry</b> (CLSP), Optical Interferometry, and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). AFM was also used to investigate the effect of Carisolv® on salivary films formed on germanium prisms. ResultsNo or only weak inflammatory response was detected on the oral mucosa after direct contact with Carisolv® for 3 min. The dentine cavities after chemo-mechanical caries removal were chemically comparable to the dentine cavities after caries excavation with burrs. After phosphoric acid treatment dentine cavities exhibited a similar surface roughness, independently on whether the caries excavation had been performed with burrs or Carisolv®. Minor changes in the surface topography of the restorative materials investigated were detected after up to 20 min exposure to solutions used for chemo-mechanical caries removal. Five minutes Carisolv® exposure seemed to be sufficient for the removal of salivary films on germanium prisms. ConclusionsChemo-mechanical caries removal can be expected to have minor effects on the inflammatory response of oral mucosa, on the surface chemistry of dentine cavities, and on the surface topography of etched dentine cavities and restorative materials.

This paper presents the potentiality of the 3 D <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry,</b> which has been to determine the chronological sequence of homogenous ‘‘crossing lines’’.

40|$|Background Osseointegrated {{titanium}} implants {{are routinely}} used in clinical dentistry. Although the overall clinical results are good, there are situations when an improved implant healing is desirable, {{for instance in}} compromised bone or in order to decrease healing time. Six factors are proposed to affect titanium implant osseintegration, where one is surface quality. Attempts to optimize surface quality of titanium implants with respect to topography and biochemistry and to prepare possibly bioactive surfaces demonstrate promising results, {{yet there is a}} need for further investigations. Aim The aim of the thesis was to investigate the significance of surface orientation for bone tissue response in vivo and, furthermore, to investigate possibly bioactive titanium implant surfaces in vitro and in vivo. Material and Methods The thesis is based on five experimental studies, where 12 differently modified CP titanium implant surfaces were investigated. Topography and chemistry were characterized by <b>Laser</b> Scanning <b>Profilometry,</b> Optical Interferometry, Scanning Electron Microscope and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, respectively. In vivo bone responses were evaluated histomorphometrically and mechanically in a rabbit model (Study I, II). In vitro cell response were investigated in human primary monocyte (Study III, IV) and osteoblast (Study V) cell culture models, while calcium phosphate nucleation (CaP) capacity of the surfaces were investigated in simulated body fluids (SBF) (Study V). Results In Study I titanium implants prepared with isotropic and anisotropic surfaces with similar roughness demonstrated similar bone response in vivo after 3 months of implantation. In Study II the non-bioactive (anodized) and possibly bioactive (alkali-heat treated) titanium implants with and without covalently immobilized protein coatings (blood plasma) demonstrated similar bone response in vivo after 1 month of implantation. In Study III the non-bioactive (anodized) and possibly bioactive (anodized/Mg) titanium surfaces demonstrated increased inflammatory cell attachment, yet a similar early inflammatory cell response in vitro compared to the turned and blasted control surfaces. In Study IV the protein coatings influenced the early inflammatory response in vitro; however, cells on immobilized catalase surfaces, not fibrinogen, demonstrated the strongest inflammatory response. In Study V the possibly bioactive surfaces (alkali-heat treated, anodized/Mg, fluoride and nano HA coated), gave rise to an earlier CaP formation than the blasted control surfaces. Furthermore, the SBF treated (72 hours) alkali-heat treated fluoride and anodized/Mg surfaces demonstrated similar or decreased bone cell response, while the SBF treated blasted and nano HA surfaces increased bone cell response compared to the blasted controls. Conclusion Within the limits of the studies of the present thesis, surface orientation had no effect on bone response in vivo. Furthermore, possibly bioactive surfaces did not significantly increase bone response in vivo, while possibly bioactive/oxide modified and, in particular, bioactive/covalently immobilized proteins influenced early inflammatory cell response in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{correlation}} between the mix proportions, micro structural characteristics, and macro-scale properties of concrete (i. e. the process-structure-properties relationship) is fundamental to achieving a more advanced understanding of how to apply and optimise this abundant engineering material. Although, concrete has been traditionally evaluated by its physico-mechanical and functional properties; development of advanced and effective inspection techniques during the last decade has demonstrated that fundamental macro-level properties of concrete depend, to a great extent, on its properties at the micro- and nano levels. This research was intended to make a quantitative assessment of impact load-induced micro-structural damage in concrete and, more particularly, to investigate the influence of ITZ micro-and nano local properties (as influenced by aggregate characteristics) on the impact load-induced cracking behaviour of concrete. Five different types of concrete mixtures were designed with the same total water cement ratio either by using natural aggregates as reference or by totally replacing the natural coarse aggregate with unconventional aggregates (such as copper slag, blue brick, sintered fly ash and tyre rubber) having significant differences in strength, shape and surface texture, porosity and roughness, and elasticity. A range of advanced techniques including X-ray diffraction, mercury porosimetry, 3 D X-ray computed tomography coupled with digital image analysis, <b>laser</b> surface <b>profilometry,</b> 3 D nanotech vertical scanning interferometry and scanning electron microscopy fitted with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer were used to characterize the aggregates and the concrete micro-structures. Based on the results obtained a possible mechanism for the micro-structural damage in concrete was proposed. Poorer aggregate characteristics alone could be responsible for a greater ITZ deterioration after loading but the results demonstrated that in fact, the aggregate causes a change in the ITZ conditions and it is these altered ITZ conditions that have a major effect on overall mix behaviour and govern the damaging process of concrete under impact loading. It was also concluded that the presence of a weak and porous ITZ has two opposite effects on the failure process. First, the chemical and porosity heterogeneities within the ITZ can cause fluctuations/disordering in the cracking (fracture) path, resulting in an increase in the tortuosity and corresponding fracture energy dissipation. Second, a weak and porous ITZ transfers less stress from the matrix to the aggregate particles. This leads to a lower compressive strength but increased toughness due to micro crack path lengthening and energy dissipation. Finally, the effect of the aggregate on the surface area roughness of the ITZ was established {{for the first time in}} the concrete literature. The roughness number of the area near the ITZ was found to positively correlate with dissipated surface fracture energy. An increase in the roughness number is associated with an increase in the dissipated fracture energy. The significance of this correlation however, lies in the fact that the rougher near – ITZ fraction of the bulk paste is more resistant to cracking at the macro level. Findings from this study will lead to a better understanding of the impact load-induced micro-structural damage phenomena. In addition, the micro-structural data from SEM and X-ray CT obtained during impact and mechanical testing of the concrete mixtures could be used to develop a multi-scale finite element model to simulate and predict the behaviour and fracture damage of concrete subjected to dynamic loading.

The material modifications were analysed with scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy and <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry.</b> Comparison showed an improvement of the thermal shock resistance with increasing yttrium content. Additionally, three samples were tested at an elevated base temperature at 400 °C. The two materials with highest yttrium content cracked, indicating still brittle behaviour at the elevated base temperature when adding yttrium...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Characterization of top {{surfaces}} of WC-Co coatings obtained during deposition process of high velocity thermal spraying type was showed in this article. The feedstock powder was so called “superfine ” powder of WC- 17 Co types produced by Inframat. In {{first part of}} article short characterization of powder was presented, especially characterization of it morphology including shape, internal microstructure and grain size description. The second part of article is dedicated to characterization of microstructure and topography of top surface of coatings deposited by two different methods of high velocity thermal spraying. In this case analysis of top-surface condition by scanning microscopy with chemical analysis in microareas was used and {{as well as a}} qualitative and quantitative analysis of topography of carbides surface by traditional non-contact and <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} in vitro the short-term cellular response to surface physico-chemical properties of a new, purposed bioactive surface treatment called BioSpark performed on simply machined and on sand-blasted titanium. Material characterisation {{was carried out}} using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersion spectroscopy, <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry,</b> and thin film X-ray diffraction. The in vitro biological study showed a suitable cellular response with adhesion and spreading level comparable for all the tested specimens. The proliferation analysis demonstrated that all the surfaces successfully supported cellular colonisation; in particular, higher cellular proliferation activity was observed on the BioSpark-treated materials, with values higher than machined titanium. The {{results suggest that the}} BioSpark treatment represents a smart way to enhance osteoblastic cellular colonisation and thus improve osteointegration processes of machined and sandblasted titanium for orthopaedic and dental implants...|$|E
40|$|Nature of {{adhesive}} {{bonds between}} gas-thermal nickel alloy coating and carbon steel base was examined using <b>laser</b> <b>profilometry,</b> optical metallography, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The steel surface was plastically pre-deformed by an ultrasonic tool. Proved that ultrasound pre-treatment modifies the steel surface. Increase of dislocation density and formation of sub micro-structure are base elements of surface modification. While using high-speed gas-flame, plasma and detonation modes of coatings, surface activation occurs and durable adhesion is formed. Ultrasonic pre-treatment of base material is effective when sprayed particles and base material interact through physical-chemical bond formation. Before applying high-speed gas flame and plasma sprayed coatings, authors recommend ultrasonic pretreatment, which creates periodic wavy topography with {{a stroke of}} 250 microns on the steel surface. Before applying detonation sprayed coatings, authors recommend ultrasound pretreatment that create modified surface with a uniform micro-topography...|$|E
