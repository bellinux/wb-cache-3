The family eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout Buddhist who was recognized for her skills as a flautist. She invited him, his brothers, and his sisters to join her on meditation retreats. His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.|$|E

When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged {{his family and friends}} to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, and transferred his savings of £1,595 (£ today) from his bank in Zurich to one in London. He lived in hotels where lodging and meals cost about £5/5 a week. For those <b>less</b> <b>fortunate,</b> he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs, and persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He enlisted the help of academics such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it had helped to find places for over 2,500 refugee scholars.|$|E

Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a good man, a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Lucas di Grassi {{challenged}} Jarno Trulli for the lead, but Trulli closed the racing line into turn one. As Trulli lost the rear end of the car going into turn three, di Grassi took the lead. The other Audi Sport Abt of Daniel Abt was <b>less</b> <b>fortunate,</b> being sent into a spin at the same corner, dropping {{to the back of the}} field. Nelson Piquet, Jr. immediately made up for ground lost in qualifying, gaining three positions during the first lap, running in tenth place. At turn six on the following lap, he went past Stéphane Sarrazin (Venturi) for ninth. While di Grassi built an early lead, several manoeuvres were made behind him, with Nicolas Prost (e.dams-Renault) losing two positions to Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Dragon Racing) and Vitantonio Liuzzi (Trulli GP), dropping back to seventh. Pole sitter Jarno Trulli looked to be in trouble with his car and lost positions continuously, running in thirteenth after lap twelve. Third placed Nick Heidfeld was also unable to hold onto his podium position, being overtaken by d'Ambrosio on lap thirteen.|$|E
5|$|Embuscade was {{the next}} to surrender, having been {{battered}} in the opening exchanges by Magnanime, and further damaged by long-range fire from Foudroyant during the pursuit. Overhauled by several larger British ships, Captain de la Ronciére surrendered at 11:30 rather than allow his ship to be destroyed. Magnanime, suffering the effects of her engagement with Hoche, took possession of Embuscade and continued to follow slowly behind {{the rest of the}} fleet, while Robust, which had suffered severely in her duel with Hoche, remained alongside her erstwhile opponent to take possession. The direction of the French squadron's flight, following the direction of the wind, took them across the path of the straggling British ships, beginning with the Foudroyant. Most of the frigates were able outrun this ponderous enemy, but Bellone was <b>less</b> <b>fortunate</b> and a speculative shot from the battleship detonated a case of grenades in one of her topmasts. This began a disastrous fire which was eventually brought under control, but at a significant cost in speed. She was soon closely attacked by Melampus and suffered further damage. Nearby, the struggling Coquille surrendered after being outrun by the approaching Canada; Warren ordered the slowly following Magnanime to take possession.|$|E

40|$|We {{report in}} this paper {{a way of doing}} Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) that has its origin in {{multilingual}} MT and that is cognizant of the fact that parallel corpora, wordnets and sense annotated corpora are scarce resources. With respect to these resources, languages show different levels of readiness; however a more resource fortunate language can help a <b>less</b> resource <b>fortunate</b> language. Our WSD method can be applied to a language even when no sense tagged corpora for that language is available. This is achieved by projecting wordnet and corpus parameters from another language to the language in question. The approach is centered around a novel synset based multilingual dictionary and the empirical observation that within a domain the distribution of senses remains more or less invariant across languages. The effectiveness of our approach is verified by doing parameter projection and then running two different WSD algorithms. The accuracy values of approximately 75 % (F 1 -score) for three languages in two different domains establish the fact that within a domain it is possible to circumvent the problem of scarcity of resources by projecting parameters like sense distributions, corpus-co-occurrences, conceptual distance, etc. from one language to another...|$|R
6000|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} discoveries of recent years is [...] that of the new catacomb in Rome, which lies some distance to the [...] east of the well-known vaults of St. Calixtus. The finding of this [...] important burial-place, which is exceedingly rich in most [...] interesting early Christian remains, is due to the energy and [...] sagacity of Dr. Julius Burger, the young German specialist, who is [...] rapidly taking the first place as an authority upon ancient Rome. [...] Although the first to publish his discovery, it appears that a <b>less</b> [...] <b>fortunate</b> adventurer had anticipated Dr. Burger. Some months ago [...] Mr. Kennedy, the well-known English student, disappeared suddenly [...] from his rooms in the [...] "Corso", and it was conjectured that his [...] association with a recent scandal had driven him to leave Rome. It [...] appears now that he had in reality fallen a victim to that fervid [...] love of archaeology which had raised him to a distinguished place [...] among living scholars. His body was discovered {{in the heart of the}} [...] new catacomb, and it was evident from the condition of his feet and [...] boots that he had tramped for days through the tortuous corridors [...] which make these subterranean tombs so dangerous to explorers. The [...] deceased gentleman had, with inexplicable rashness, made his way [...] into this labyrinth without, as far as can be discovered, taking [...] with him either candles or matches, so that his sad fate was the [...] natural result of his own temerity. What makes the matter more [...] painful is that Dr. Julius Burger was an intimate friend of the [...] deceased. His joy at the extraordinary find which he has been so [...] fortunate as to make has been greatly marred by the terrible fate [...] of his comrade and fellow-worker.|$|R

After a failed attempt on Finn's life, the Misfits {{assemble}} {{to deal with the}} Rudy Two's delinquent gang. Rudy Two confronts Helen on her betrayal in the community centre but is knocked out by Karen. As the rest of this Misfits gang approach, they are attacked by Sam. Alex grabs onto Sam and takes his power from him via sexual intercourse mid-flight, causing them both to fall. Alex lands in a skip and survives the fall but Sam is <b>less</b> than <b>fortunate,</b> hitting the pavement with immense force. When the gang enter the community centre (except for Jess, who stays outside with Leo), they are then attacked by Karen who uses her camouflage and a knife in tandem with each other. As she is about to kill Alex, Finn uses his telekinesis to launch a piano at her in an unusual display of brilliance. Helen then appears, intent on killing the gang before Rudy Two intervenes. After a brief exchange Rudy Two rejoins Rudy who proceeds to tell Helen that together [...] "they are twice as strong" [...] (although this really has no truth). As Helen readies herself to kill them both, Rudy stalls for time and begins to pee himself, creating a trail of urine from him to Helen. Helen electrocutes Rudy but is fried herself as her electric current travels back to her through Rudy's stream of urine. Helen dies quickly but Rudy lays gravely injured in the gang's arms. Rudy gives Jess a scratch card, having won a quid on it, and tells Jess to look after the baby before dying himself.|$|R

60|$|It is {{certainly}} {{of service to}} a man to know who were his grandfathers and who were his grandmothers if he entertain an ambition {{to move in the}} upper circles of society, and also of service to be able to speak of them as of persons who were themselves somebodies in their time. No doubt we all entertain great respect for those who by their own energies have raised themselves in the world; and when we hear that the son of a washerwoman has become Lord Chancellor or Archbishop of Canterbury we do, theoretically and abstractedly, feel a higher reverence for such self-made magnate than for one who has been as it were born into forensic or ecclesiastical purple. But not the less must the offspring of the washerwoman have had very much trouble on the subject of his birth, unless he has been, when young as well as when old, a very great man indeed. After the goal has been absolutely reached, and the honour and the titles and the wealth actually won, a man may talk with some humour, even with some affection, of the maternal tub;--but while the struggle is going on, with the conviction strong upon the struggler that he cannot be altogether successful unless he be esteemed a gentleman, not to be ashamed, not to conceal the old family circumstances, not at any rate to be silent, is difficult. And the difficulty {{is certainly}} not <b>less</b> if <b>fortunate</b> circumstances rather than hard work and intrinsic merit have raised above his natural place an aspirant to high social position. Can it be expected that such a one when dining with a duchess shall speak of his father's small shop, or bring into the light of day his grandfather's cobbler's awl? And yet it is difficult to be altogether silent! It may not be necessary for any of us to be always talking of our own parentage. We may be generally reticent as to our uncles and aunts, and may drop even our brothers and sisters in our ordinary conversation. But if a man never mentions his belongings among those with whom he lives, he becomes mysterious, and almost open to suspicion. It begins to be known that nobody knows anything of such a man, and even friends become afraid. It is certainly convenient to be able to allude, if it be but once in a year, to some blood relation.|$|R
