40|$|This article {{examines}} how <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> in Indonesia, as developed under the European Union (EU) Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA), shapes {{who and what}} count as legal. A review of Indonesia’s evolving <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> system and in-depth stakeholder interviews reveal a process of commodification driven by international demand for an interchangeable label of “legality. ” This interchangeability is produced through a reduction of forest governance to a narrow set of legal standards and third-party, private auditing, which risks obscuring key governance challenges such as corruption and unclear tenure, and excluding most domestic and small-scale operators from economic and legal recognition. Given the market logic of legality licensing, {{it is more likely}} to “ratchet down” than “ratchet up” local access to, and benefit from, wood production, unless there is greater support and investment in legal and tenure reforms and improved local benefit capture...|$|E
40|$|Illegal {{logging in}} Indonesia {{has been raised}} as a key driver in {{deforestation}} and degradation, leading to biodiversity loss, increased climate emissions, and poor forest governance. This paper explores the pathways through which strategists might travel to combat illegal logging. This paper will focus on one proposed mechanism for combating illegal logging in Indonesia: <b>legality</b> <b>verification.</b> Problem Definition With 98. 7 million hectares of forest cover (Indonesian Ministry of Forestry 2012), Indonesia has the third-‐largest expanse of tropical forests in the world after Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, high rates of illegal logging in Indonesia (Seneca Creek Associates 2004) and {{hundreds of millions of}} cubic meters of illegal exports (Obidzinski et al. 2007) have combined to cause extensive deforestation and cost the Indonesian economy from $ 1 billion to $ 5 billion (U. S.) per year (Seneca Creek Associates 2004; Human Rights Watch 2009). Although it is estimated that rates have declined from 80 percent in the early 2000 s (Environmental Investigation Agency EIA and Telapak 2002) to 40 percent in 2009 (Lawson and MacFaul 2010), illegal logging remains one of the key challenges facing the Indonesia forest sector. In response, the Indonesia government in 2009 created a new national <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> system, Sistem Verifikasi Legalitas Kayu (SVLK), which domestic and international organizations now view {{as one of the most}} promising mechanisms for addressing illegal logging in Indonesia (Cashore and Stone 2013). However, the degree and extent of successful implementation of <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> will depend on the decisions made by policy makers and environmental practitioners in the coming years.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the disconnect between {{the literature on}} and practice of <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> (LV) in the forest sector and what {{would seem to be}} a logical extension into the literature on and responses to forest crime and, more specifically, transnational criminality associated with the trade in illegally logged timber. The apparently logical overlap between these two areas of endeavour arises because both are dealing with aspects of supply chains or chains of custody involving raw timber, forest products or timber products more generally. The disconnect, I suggest here, arises because of a lack of ‘joined up thinking’ between the two themes that are central to forest law enforcement and governance (FLEG) [...] that is, enforcement on the one hand and governance on the other. The former is frequently perceived to be relevant mainly to issues of criminality and the development of coercive responses by the state, the latter to normative standards and rules for defining legality and implementing verification in which actors other than the state have assumed a substantial role. The second purpose of this paper, then, is to explore the role of 2 ̆ 7 agents beyond the state 2 ̆ 7 in the spaces of transnational <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> and forest law enforcement. It does so as an initial response to the call from Biermann et al 2 ̆ 7 to document these various forms of governance through which actors exercise agency [beyond the state] and … to better understand the conditions for the emergence of agency at different levels and within different architectures...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports and}} {{reflects}} on the pilot application of an 11 -step policy learning protocol that was developed by Cashore and Lupberger (2015) based on several years of Cashore’s multi-author collaborations. The protocol was applied {{for the first time}} in Peru in 2015 and 2016 by the IUFRO Working Party on Forest Policy Learning Architectures (hereinafter referred to as the project team). The protocol integrates insights from policy learning scholarship (Hall 1993, Sabatier 1999) with Bernstein and Cashore’s (2000, 2012) four pathways of influence framework. The pilot implementation in Peru focused on how global timber <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> interventions might be harnessed to promote local land rights. <b>Legality</b> <b>verification</b> focuses attention on the checking and auditing of forest management units in order to verify that timber is harvested and traded in compliance with the law. We specifically asked: How can community legal ownership of, and access to, forestland and forest resources be enhanced? The protocol was designed as a dynamic tool, the implementation of which fosters iterative rather than linear processes. It directly integrated two objectives: 1) identifying the causal processes through which global governance initiatives might be harnessed to produce durable results ‘on the ground’; 2) generating insights and strategies in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. This paper reviews and critically evaluates our work in designing and piloting the protocol. We assess what seemed to work well and suggest modifications, including an original diagnostic framework for nurturing durable change. We also assess the implications of the pilot application of the protocol for policy implementation that works to enhance the influence of existing international policy instruments, rather than contributing to fragmentation and incoherence by creating new ones...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impacts of large scale land {{acquisition}} for agro-development by analyzing the Merauke Integrated Food and Energy Estate (MIFEE) in Indonesia. It also examines the potential for MIFEE to meet sustainability requirements under RSPO, ISPO, and FSC. The plantation development plans are characterized {{by a lack of}} reliable official data and limited public disclosure. The available information paints a skewed picture of expected outcomes, where short-term economic benefits from forest clearing dominate and environmental impacts and social implications appear to be underestimated. Our analysis indicates that oil palm concessions under MIFEE can be RSPO compliant if they resist the short term windfall profits from conversion timber. ISPO certification is possible without any major overhaul. On the other hand, FSC certification for timber concessions is not possible. Because MIFEE plantation program is dominated by timber plantations, they weigh heavily on the program's poor sustainability prospects. In order to meet the Indonesian government's own objectives and improve the project's sustainability, the government needs to push for the implementation of oil palm certification and timber <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> systems, reduce the size of plantations, target non-forestland, prioritize food crops, and secure local acceptance of plantation investments...|$|E
40|$|Raised {{public concern}} in the European Union (EU) about the {{legality}} of its timber imports has pushed the European Commission to raise its standards and legality demands for wood imports. Combining literature review, structured interviews and trade data analysis this study assesses the potential influence from FLEGT (with its VPA system and new legislation EUTR), and third party verification schemes on the timber trade between tropical countries and Europe. These instruments {{have the potential to}} reduce the amount of illegally sourced timber being placed on the market, and they seem to have resulted in both increasing support of <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> and certification uptake. However, there are signs of increased ambiguity in trade that could originate as a side effect of the transition towards a stricter regulation for tropical timber. Such ambiguity is explicitly taken into account here. Possible consequences from increased ambiguity are substitution of oak lumber for tropical hardwood lumber, and a diversion of exports of tropical timber to destinations with less stringent regulatory framework than the EU. Evidence of these trade patterns in the literature review, interviews, and trade data analysis seems to confirm that ambiguity in international trade markets has actually increased since the introduction of these instruments.

40|$|Focusing on {{potential}} impact on social sustainability in timber exporting or processing states outside the EU, {{this article discusses}} the EU’s Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) scheme and its regulatory implementa tion modalities. Drawing on Vietnam {{as a case study}} and the private Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) criteria {{as an example of a}} broader sustainability scheme, in the analysis we identify concerns of a human rights or labour rights character that risk becoming institutionalised in an adverse fashion as a result of the FLEGT’s scheme’s legality orientation with regard to exporting states as well as importers who place timber on the EUmarket, and the assumption that civil society involvement in exporting states will sufficiently ensure consideration of such concerns. Next we consider potential adverse impact on the usage of broader sustainability schemes, such as FSC, which address social sustainability as well as the environment but do not (yet) deliver <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> required by the EU Timber Regulation from March 2013. We also discuss possible contributions that could follow from adding a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) perspective to the FLEGT approach, given increasing recognition that CSR may be promoted by public regulation. We conclude that although the FLEGT scheme seeks to achieve commendable objectives, it could do more to address human rights related to forestry usage, harvest and timber processing through the combined force of law and the market on which the scheme builds...|$|E
40|$|Enactment of Timber <b>Legality</b> <b>Verification</b> System (known as SVLK) is an {{important}} issue for wooden handicraft industry, particularly in Bantul District. The majority of wood industry in Bantul still relies on manual methods in doing the business so that the data processing system and the administrative system are not running well. It causes slow process in preparation of export documents. Information technology is needed to improve these conditions; among others, to facilitate the management of the business, to meet the accountability aspects of the business, and in particular to support the administration of SVLK to be more effective and efficient. This paper describes the experience of implementation of information systems to support SVLK on wooden handicraft export industry in Bantul. From the analysis of software requirements; it is known that wooden craft entrepreneurs need software that is able to record daily transactions for goods flows. Since the implementation is known that the transaction data can be processed and presented for various purposes, ranging from daily to annual reports, financial statements, and specifically for the purpose of taking care of SVLK documents for export. From the initial trials showed that the information system (SIP-LK) is successfully developed and meet to the industrial needs, mainly to suppress human error at the time of making the reports and simplify the process of preparing documents for export purposes. The main finding in the implementation is that although the software is ready to use, but the commitment of employers to use it consistently remains low...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to identify and measure the relationships among stakeholders that influence the process of policy-making in defining legality of timber from private forests. The study focuses on the policy-making process of the Ministry of Forestry Regulation P. 38 /Menhut-II/ 2009 on Standard and Guidelines for Assessment of Sustainable Forest Management Performance and Timber <b>Legality</b> <b>Verification</b> of Concessionaire or of the Private Forest License Holder as the subject that has been implemented in several private forest management units as follow: Giri Mukti Wana Tirta in Lampung, Koperasi Serba Usaha APIK in Bali, Koperasi Hutan Jaya Lestari in South East Sulawesi, and Koperasi Wana Lestari Menoreh Kulonprogo in Yogyakarta. This research used a qualitative approach and the analysis method used in this research is a modified-stakeholder analysis that developed by ODA (1995), Reitbergen et al. (1998), and Mayer (2005). The stakeholder analysis shows that the interests and influences do not consider private forest farmers as primary stakeholder during  the process of policy formulation.   The strong national and international interests, supported by high authority could not be influnced by the role of the NGOs and academicians. The imbalance of responsibilities, rights, and revenues that was experienced by  farmers as the manager of private forest when started implementing the policy was more as burdens, it means implementation of the policy was more as burdens. Strong relationships between the Ministry of Forestry with the state as a core could not empower the relationship with private forest farmers. As result, policy assumptions cannot be implemented properly. Keywords: policy making process, timber legality, private forest, stakeholder. DOI: 10. 7226 /jtfm. 19. 2. 15...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} REDD+ governance and identifies policy options to increase synergies among REDD+, the sustainable management of forests and biodiversity conservation. REDD+ emerged {{at the international level}} as a point of convergemnce acorss the 'institutional complexes' of forests, climate and biodiversity. This convergence attracted the engagement {{of a wide range of}} institutions in REDD+ activities, which together have drawn on three primary sources of authority to influence REDD+ rule-making: government sovereignty, contingent finance and voluntary carbon markets. Intergovernmental processes, which represent the primary articulation of governmental authority at the global level, have generated few binding commitments to the sustainable management of forests or biodiversity due to conflicting country interests. These efforts instead have favoured normative guidance, monitoring and reporting, and <b>legality</b> <b>verification</b> initiatives that reinforce sovereign authority. Bilateral and multi-lateral finance initiatives have exerted ‘fund-based’ authority through the application of operational safeguards protecting indigenous and local communities and biodiversity, but limited funding and low capacity of REDD+ countries to absorb those funds have constrained their influence. Finally, non-state actors have developed voluntary certification schemes for forest and carbon as a ’fast track’ approach to elaborating more substantive international standards for environmentally- and socially-responsible forest practices. While the small size and voluntary nature of markets for forest carbon have greatly constrained the impact of these approaches, this could change if a significant regulatory market for REDD+ develops. Furthermore, the governance of REDD+, forest management and biodiversity is pluralistic, involving multiple institutions and actors. Efforts to promote REDD+ safeguarding at the international level exist in tension with national sovereignty and local autonomy. This complexity is taken into consideration in the suite of policy options provided in this chapter, which suggest the need to draw on a range of institutions and approaches and to consider how together they influence the balance of power and incentives across actors and scales...|$|E
