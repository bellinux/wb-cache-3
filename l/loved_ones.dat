40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The study {{presented}} in this thesis provides a description and interpretation of the experiences of family members during their older <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> delirium. Fourteen women, aged 51 to 74 years, {{participated in the study}} and, over an interview period of nineteen months, described their experiences. These twelve daughters and two wives supported and cared for their <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> at home, in residential aged care and/or while hospitalised. The approach used to explore the women’s experiences was existential phenomenology, informed by the philosophies of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. Changing family portraits: Sudden existential absence during delirium depicts the women’s experiences during their older <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> delirium. Existential absence for these women was experienced as the sudden absence of their familiar older <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> and the arrival of a stranger. The meaning of existential absence is further represented by the theme Living the fragility of a <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> presence and the sub-themes Facing a <b>loved</b> <b>one's</b> existential absence and Living with a stranger, as well as the theme Living life holding on and the sub-themes Waiting for a <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> In the dark, On the fringe but centre stage, On thin ice, and Keeping secrets. These themes describe the unexpected and distressing nature of their <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> absence during delirium, and how difficult it was for the women to cope and await their <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> return. The description and interpretation {{presented in}} this thesis reveals the profound impact of family member experiences during their older <b>loved</b> <b>one’s</b> delirium. It establishes the importance of health care staff appreciating family member experiences and relates the insights gained to health care practice, suggesting how family member experiences can inform ways health care staff include family members in their older person’s care and provide compassionate, sensitive support during delirium...|$|R

5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) of the living.

5|$|In his 1931 {{treatise}} On the Nightmare, Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones {{asserted that}} vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms.
