A three-way air pressure valve (part of the stall recovery system) was found to have been one-sixth of a turn out of position, and the <b>locking</b> <b>wire</b> which secured it was missing. Calculations carried out by Hawker Siddeley determined that if the valve was in this position during the flight then the reduction in engine power for the noise abatement procedure could have activated the warning light that indicated low air pressure in the system.

A captain who had flown Papa India on the morning of the accident flight noted no technical problems, and the public inquiry found that the position of the valve had no significant effect on the system.|$|E

Among the corrective actions, the existing bolt <b>lock</b> <b>wire</b> which provided resistance to potential bolt rotation was removed. The <b>lock</b> <b>wire</b> removal was because of concerns with creating voids during foam application and potential for <b>lock</b> <b>wire</b> to become debris. The bolts had been previously lubricated to facilitate assembly but, because of elimination of the <b>lock</b> <b>wire,</b> the ET Project wanted to enable the locking feature of the insert. Thus, the lubrication was removed from bolt threads and instead applied to the washer under the bolt head. Lubrication is necessary to maximize joint pre-load while remaining within the bolt torque specification. The locking feature is implemented by thread crimping in at four places in the insert. As the bolt is torqued into the insert the bolt threads its way past the crimped parts of the insert. This provides the locking of the bolt, as torque is required to loosen the joint after clamping...|$|R

50|$|The launch {{took place}} on Saturday, 24 March 2006 at 22:30 UTC, from the SpaceX launch site on Omelek Island in the Marshall Islands. It ended in failure {{less than a minute}} into the flight because of a fuel line leak and {{subsequent}} fire. The launch took place The vehicle had a noticeable rolling motion after liftoff, as shown on the launch video, rocking back and forth a bit, and then at T+26 seconds rapidly pitched over. Impact occurred at T+41 seconds onto a dead reef about 250 feet from the launch site. The FalconSAT-2 payload separated from the booster and landed on the island, with damage reports varying from slight to significant. SpaceX initially attributed the fire to an improperly tightened fuel-line nut. A later review by DARPA found that the nut was properly tightened, since its <b>locking</b> <b>wire</b> was still in place, but had failed because of corrosion from saltwater spray.|$|E
5000|$|In its {{redesign}} for the 1990 model year, Lincoln stylists {{sought a}} completely new design for the Town Car. To bring the Town Car into the 1990s, many traditional Lincoln styling cues were heavily reworked or abandoned completely. Although the Town Car would keep its formal notchback sedan roofline, the flat-sided fenders and angular lines seen since the Continentals and Mark IIIs of the late 1960s disappeared. In their quest to give the Town Car a more aerodynamic body than its predecessor, stylists trimming its drag coefficient from 0.46 to 0.36 (matching the 1988 Continental and besting the Mark VII). [...] While far sleeker than its 1980s counterpart, the 1990 Town Car retained several styling influences, including its vertical taillights, radiator-style grille, hood ornament, alloy wheels, and vertical C-pillar window. In a move to market the Town Car towards buyers of contemporary vehicles, several other changes were made. Although two-tone paint remained available (featuring a lower body accent color in gray metallic), monotone paint schemes would become increasingly standard. In a major change, a vinyl roof was no longer offered, since vinyl roofs declined in popularity among many buyers. Spoked aluminum wheels were dropped from the option list for 1990, while <b>locking</b> <b>wire</b> wheel discs remained through 1992.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{discontinuation}} of the Fleetwood coupe {{at the end}} of the 1992 model year, the 1993 Coupe de Ville was Cadillac's last six-passenger two-door car. The previously optional speed-sensitive suspension, [...] "Computer Command Ride", introduced {{last year}} became standard equipment, and now included a new speed-sensitive steering system as well. Minor trim changes included black-out trim in the grille (as seen on the 1992 Touring Sedan). GM built 4,711 Coupe de Villes this year. The previously optional Cabriolet roof became standard equipment this year, and appeared on 3,606 cars. The Phaeton roof, which re-created the dashing look of a convertible top (now just a $170 option since the Cabriolet roof was standard equipment), was found on 1,105 cars. There were no painted-roof Coupe de Villes this year. Again, the most popular color for 1993 was Cotillion White, with 1,147 manufactured, while the least chosen color was Dark Plum, which found its way onto 24 cars this year. The four wheel choices this year included the standard-design cast aluminum wheel on 2,012 cars, optional $235 lace-design squeeze-case aluminum wheel on 1,766 cars, optional $235 <b>locking</b> <b>wire</b> wheel disc on 749 cars, and the $1,195 chromed squeeze-case aluminum wheel on 184 cars. Only 18 Coupe de Villes were ordered with the no-charge option of blackwall Michelin radial tires, the other 4,693 models wore the standard-equipment white-wall version. 3,036 had mono-tone paint, while the others held a lower body accent color, with the breakdown as follows: Silver, 1,130; Dark Red, 275; Gunmetal Gray, 177; and Beige, 93. In total, 4,168 had the standard Symphony Sound system, while 543 were ordered with the optional Bose stereo (310 with cassette, 233 with compact disc). Nearly all Coupe de Villes had leather upholstery (the most popular color was Neutral, with 1,236 made), as only 239 velour interior models were manufactured this year (the least chosen cloth color was Taupe, with only 24 manufactured). No Coupe de Villes were produced for export this year, and only 523 of the 4,711 built included California emission equipment. The base price of the 1993 Coupe de Ville was $33,915.|$|E
