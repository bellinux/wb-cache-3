2500|$|The four {{remaining}} PCC {{cars were}} retired in 1999. These PCCs were from an original fleet of 12 [...] "homebuilt" [...] cars {{constructed in the}} 1980s in the Port Authority shops {{using a combination of}} new underframes, <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> front and rear ends, interiors, wiring and controls, together with reconditioned components such as trucks, motors, and upper body parts and windows reused from original Pittsburgh PCCs numbered in the 1700 series.

25|$|The Holden {{train was}} a new concept in Irish tourism. In 1902, A.W. Holden, a Larne hotelier who had hired trains from the BNCR for his summer tours, {{approached}} the railway to provide him with a special train. York Road works built the all first class four-car train. Three of the coaches were saloons and the fourth was a restaurant car, all being furnished to a high standard. They were bogie vehicles with corridor connections; the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> were finished in match boarding and the end doors were recessed {{in the manner of}} Pullman cars. Two six-wheel vans were fitted with corridor connections to work with the train.|$|R

Also for 2002, V6-equipped LS models gained [...] and [...] of torque.|$|R
50|$|The other racing {{driver was}} touring car ace Joachim Winkelhock. He wanted a {{lightweight}} E34 M5 and so some luxury items were removed.

5000|$|The CRX was a Civic with a {{different}} body; it was a 2-seater in North America with a lockable storage compartment, while it was offered {{to the rest of}} the world with a rear seat. The Si model was added to the CRX lineup in 1985, which used Honda's PGM-FI fuel injection on the 1,488 cc four-cylinder; in the United States this generated [...] while other markets received a considerably more powerful DOHC, 1.6-litre unit. The Si model added an pantograph rear wiper, sports seats, and a power sunroof. The CRX Si was also identifiable by body-colored <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> in 1986, new four hole [...] "dial" [...] alloy wheels and a body-colored rubber spoiler, now mounted on the back of the hatch as opposed to on the top portion of the lid.|$|R

Cruise control was now standard on V6 Rodeos, and an automatic transmission became standard on the LSE edition. A new Intelligent Suspension Control featuring a dashboard button to adjust shock damping between sport and normal settings became standard on the LSE and optional on LS models. The Honda Passport {{did not get the}} adjustable-shock system. A new Ironman package debuted for the LS, marking Isuzu's sponsorship of the Ironman triathlon competition. The package included white or black paint over gray <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> crossbars for the roof rack, and special graphics.|$|R
50|$|The Denali {{nameplate}} {{started as}} the top-of-the-line {{version of the}} GMC Yukon for the 1999 model year. It was also GM's first attempt to go after sales from the new-for-1998 Lincoln Navigator. At {{the time of its}} introduction General Motors decided to give Cadillac its own luxury SUV so the Denali's exterior was shared with the 1999 Cadillac Escalade, with only the front fascia and <b>lower</b> side <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> differing from the standard Yukon. Even though the Yukon was redesigned alongside the Chevrolet Suburban and Chevrolet Tahoe in 2000, the Denali, Escalade, and Tahoe Limited/Z71 retained their 1990s base design.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, at {{the time}} of its introduction, the Yukon Denali was GM's answer to the Lincoln Navigator, but then GM {{introduced}} a clone to the Yukon Denali and rebadged it [...] "Escalade" [...] under the Cadillac nameplate. The Yukon Denali's exterior was shared with the Cadillac Escalade, with the entire front clip and <b>lower</b> side <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> differing from the standard Yukon.

These included an upgraded leather interior, power seats, heated seats front and rear, Bose stereo system, and some woodgrain on the dashboard.|$|R
50|$|The {{units were}} painted various colours over the years. When {{initially}} built in 1939 {{they were the}} standard LMS maroon red. After railway nationalisation in the late 1940s units were repainted in light malachite green and further repainting from the 1950s to the standard BR dark green for EMUs. Towards {{the end of their}} green days, the units gained yellow warning panels on cab ends. When BR changed their liveries in the mid-1960s the units were repainted plain Rail Blue, continuing with the small yellow warning panel and eventually gaining full yellow ends, the white 'double arrow' British Rail symbol was carried on the DMBS only, continuing the tradition of the green livery of only carrying the BRITISH RAILWAYS symbols on motor coaches. First class lining and '1' numerals appeared on the bodyside next to the middle saloon of driving trailer composites, this was removed when the units were downrated to all second on 3 May 1971 and 'Merseyrail' branding appeared on the centre <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> of all coaches with the formation of the passenger transport executive shortly after. Towards the end of their life, in the late 1970s, they were repainted again in their first two-tone livery, the standard blue and grey, in which scheme they were withdrawn. Following withdrawal, two reinstated departmental units were repainted with wasp stripes on the cab ends.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999 at {{the time}} of its {{introduction}} the Yukon Denali's exterior, which it later shared with the 1999 Cadillac Escalade, differed from the standard Yukon in the front fascia and <b>lower</b> side <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> as well as having unique 16" [...] DICKIE polished aluminum wheels and a special exhaust cutout for a right side-exiting cast exhaust tip.

50|$|Like the GAZ-21 (and most Soviet-built cars), its {{exterior}} {{was inspired}} by US-models, essentially the Chevy II and its German stylistic derivative Opel Rekord A of the early '60s. Despite its more imposing appearance, the GAZ-24 was in fact 75 mm shorter in length and 120 mm in height, yet its wheelbase was extended by 10 mm. The <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> waist line, allowed the window area was to be increased, whilst using thinner linings in doors, roof and other <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> notably increased interior space.

50|$|Although the Lincoln Navigator {{shares the}} same {{bodyshell}} as the Ford Expedition, {{giving it a}} similar exterior appearance, Lincoln stylists would make many design changes to differentiate the two vehicles. Forward of the windshield, the Lincoln Navigator shares no <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> with its Ford counterpart, with its own front fascia (a grille design shared with the 1998 Lincoln Town Car and the 2000 Lincoln LS), wheels, roof rack, <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> trim, and taillights. The interior of the two vehicles shared more commonality, with the dashboard common to both vehicles (with greater use of wood trim); the Navigator was given its own seat design. To make for a quieter interior over the Expedition and Ford F-Series, the Navigator made greater use of sound deadening materials and higher-quality carpeting.|$|R
