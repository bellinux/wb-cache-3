40|$|INTRODUCTION: Insufficient primary {{stability}} is still reported for proximal humerus fractures in elderly patients. Fixation stability {{could be improved}} by aiming <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> at bone volumes with better properties. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the bone regions engaged by the <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> of a Proximal Humeral Nail (MultiLoc PHN), and to evaluate the influence of peri-screw bone quality on bone-nail construct stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve cadaveric humeri were divided into two groups. The distal locking part of the PHN was fixed to the specimens. The nails were removed and the bones scanned using HR-pQCT. Bone properties were evaluated at the locations where the proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> would have been positioned after complete instrumentation. A three-part fracture model was used for mechanical testing of the instrumented bones, considering axial displacement and varus deformation as parameters of interest. RESULTS: The secondary <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> targeted bone volumes in the posteromedial part of the humerus with statistically significant higher quality, thus reducing varus deformation. Significant correlation was found between axial displacement and bone properties at the primary proximal screws. Significant correlation was found between the varus deformation and apparent BMD at the secondary <b>locking</b> <b>screws.</b> CONCLUSION: The findings of this study confirmed that directing the proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> at bone regions with better properties can improve fixation stability...|$|R

30|$|Use of a glenosphere implant {{with a more}} {{lateral center}} of {{rotation}} was met with controversy based on historical implant failures seen with earlier generation implants [14 – 21]. The first modern reverse shoulder replacement to revisit a more lateralized center of rotation utilized a central screw baseplate and four peripheral non-locked 3.5 -mm screws. Using all peripheral non-locked screws, the glenoid baseplate failure rate was 11 % [22]. With continued understanding of surgical technique and replacement of the 3.5 -mm peripheral non-locked screws with 5.0 -mm <b>locked</b> <b>screws,</b> the incidence of glenoid baseplate failures was reduced to 0 % in a 5 -year minimum follow-up study [33]. This clinical experience validated the mechanical study reported by Harman et al. [11] which showed how peripheral <b>locked</b> <b>screws</b> were superior to non-locked screws at maximizing baseplate fixation < 150 µm micromotion threshold. Surgeons have thus gained comfort using a glenoid baseplate with four peripheral <b>locked</b> <b>screws.</b> There are certainly cases where four peripheral <b>locked</b> <b>screws</b> are either not possible {{or may not be}} of optimal surgical preference. Included in these scenarios are cases where there is limited bone remaining, such that a screw would capture minimal bone or result in a prominent screw; or cases where a larger <b>locked</b> <b>screw</b> might not be optimal, creating a potential stress riser for an acromion spine fracture [34]. Additionally, there are situations when further glenoid component compression is desirable, which can only be achieved by using a non-locked screw. In these cases, the surgeon may elect to utilize a non-locked screw rather than a <b>locked</b> <b>screw.</b> This concept of hybrid fixation is now commonplace in fracture management using locked plates, but prior to this study had not been tested for applicability in the reverse shoulder replacement glenoid component.|$|R

40|$|Background: Proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> {{deformation}} {{and screw}} fracture is a frequently seen problem for femur interlocking nailing that affects fracture healing. We {{realized that there}} is lack of literature for the right level for the proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw.</b> We investigated the difference of <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> bending resistance between the application of screws on different proximal femoral levels. Materials and Methods: We used a total of 80 proximal locking screws for eight groups, 10 screws for each group. Three-point bending tests were performed on four types of screws in two different trochanteric levels (the lesser trochanter and 20 mm proximal). We determined the yield points at three-point bending tests that a permanent deformation started in the locking screws using an axial compression testing machine. Results: The mean yield point value of 5 mm threaded locking screws applied 20 mm proximal of lesser trochanter was 1022 ± 49 (range 986 – 1057) (mean ± standard deviation, 95 % confidence interval). On the other hand, the mean yield point value of {{the same type of}} locking screws applied on the lesser trochanteric level was 2089 ± 249 (range 1911 – 2268). Which means 103 % increase of screw resistance between two levels (P = 0. 000). In all screw groups, on the lesser trochanter line we determined 98 – 174 % higher than the yield point values of the same type of locking screws in comparison with 20 mm proximal to the lesser trochanter (P = 0. 000). Conclusion: According to our findings, there is twice as much difference in <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> bending resistance between these two application levels. To avoid proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> deformation, locking screws should be placed in the level of the lesser trochanter in nailing of 1 / 3 middle and distal femur fractures...|$|E

40|$|Nikhil Nanavati, Marcus Walker Scunthorpe General Hospital, Scunthorpe, North East Lincolnshire, UK Abstract: Locking plates {{can be used}} in a {{bridging}} mode {{to treat}} fractures by means of secondary bone healing. This requires stimulation by interfragmentary micromotion. Recent data suggest that up to 20 % of fractures fixed with locking plates may encounter suboptimal fracture healing. Three main systems have been developed to improve bone healing, thereby reducing the risks of delayed or nonunion: overdrilling the near cortex; far cortical locking (FCL) screw; and dynamic <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> (DLS). Overdrilling the near cortex offers a cheap alternative to screw technology by reducing construct stiffness; overdrilling potentially causes repetitive loading and thus has consequences postoperatively such as failure and fatigue. FCL screws reduce construct stiffness and maintain construct strength but cannot be used in dynamic compression mode and therefore, require adequate fracture reduction. DLS is a new generation of <b>locking</b> <b>screw,</b> amalgamating locking technology with dynamic motion with the aim of improving interfragmentary motion at the near cortex.

In cases of malrotation, the nail and the distal part of the fracture were rotated and placed in the correct position.

An eight-hole locking compression plate was placed posteriorly on the humeral shaft and secured with either four or six bicortical <b>locking</b> <b>screws.</b> A 5 -mm middiaphyseal gap osteotomy was created to simulate a comminuted fracture without bony contact. Specimens were tested in offset axial compression, four-point anteroposterior bending, four-point medial– lateral bending, and torsion. After the initial testing in each of these modalities, the constructs were cyclically loaded in torsion and again tested in the four loading modalities. Lastly, the fixation constructs were then tested to failure in torsion. Results: There were no significant differences in stiffness between the group fixed with two screws per segment and the group fixed with three screws per segment.
