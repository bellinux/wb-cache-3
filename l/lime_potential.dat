40|$|The use of cheap, {{sparingly}} soluble calcium phosphate fertilizers is increasitgly widespread, {{particularly in the}} extensive agriculture systems of the tropics where very high yields are not sought, and phosphate deficiency is a major limitation to crop production. At present there is little quantitative understanding of the factors determining the rates of dissolution of calcium phosphates in soils. Existing quantitative treatments are inadequate, being either empirical or based on oversimplified theory. By developing a precise model of the dissolution process, {{it should be possible}} to short-cut the usual practice of running extensive field trials to establish the responses over a wide range of soil conditions and management practices. In this thesis a model which makes no arbitrary assumptions is developed for predicting the rates of dissolution of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) in soils. DCPD is the initial reaction product of the dissolution of many phosphatic fertilizers, and is an important fertilizer in its own right; the mechanisms governing its dissolution in soils are basically the same for other, more complex calcium phosphates. The simple case of a planar layer of DCPD in contact with soil is considered first to introduce the principles of the model. This is the simplest system for measuring experimentally the solute concentration profiles close to the dissolving surface, in order to test the model. The model is then extended to describe the dissolution of granules of DCPD in soil. The model comprises numerical solutions of mathematical equations describing the diffusion and reaction of calcium, phosphate and base in soil. The concentrations of calcium, phosphate and hydrogen ions in the soil solution at the mineral/soil boundary are found (a) from the ion activity product of DCPD and (b) by equating the fluxes of calcium, phosphate and base across the boundary (1 mol of DCPD gives 1 mol each of calcium, phosphate and base). In the granular system, the diminution of the granules as they dissolve, and the effect of neighbouring particles on each other are allowed for. The solute concentration profiles predicted for the planar system agreed with experimentally measured profiles; and the predicted net rates of dissolution of granules of DCPD agreed with the rates determined by a radioactive-tracer technique, in which 45 Ca dissolved from labelled DCPD is recovered from the soil with an extractant, saturated with respect to DCPD. Thus all important processes have been accounted for in the model. Since the theory is non-specific, the model should apply equally well to most other soils. The model has nine input parameters : the concentrations of calcium and phosphate in the native soil solution, the native soil pH, the phosphate and <b>lime</b> <b>potential</b> buffer capacities of the soil, the moisture status, the diffusion impedance factor, and the rate of application and particle size of the DCPD. A sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the rate is particularly dependent on particle size, rate of application, and the pH and concentration of calcium in the soil solution. If the granules are so stages the rate of dissolution is independent of the soil buffer terms. But for typical rates and methods of application, neighbouring granules will influence each other, and the consequent interactions between the rate determining variables are complex. The extension of the model to describe the dissolution of carbonateapatites, and hence rock phosphates, is discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAbout {{one third}} of several hundred mining lakes in Eastern Germany are highly acidified, {{and there is a}} need to restore them to neutral {{conditions}} because they constitute an environmental hazard for water resources and downstream environments. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of three different acid pit lake water remediation treatments: dilution with alkaline (river) water, limestone treatment and biological neutralization by organic carbon-driven alkalinity generation. The efficiency is evaluated for the acidic mining lake Grünewalder Lauch by adjusting input values into a geochemical model and making future projections. Current approaches, such as flooding with neutral surface water or extensive liming, are not suitable for many lakes because of a limited supply of alkaline water or high <b>lime</b> immobilizing <b>potential</b> of Fe- and Al-rich water in acidic lakes, respectively. Further treatment methods are, therefore, designed to combine water supply and biological measures with the management of water quality by the application of in-lake microbial processes. These processes are focused on the metabolic response of aquatic ecosystems to nutrient enrichment (enhancement of primary production and thereby organic carbon supply) and the microbial decomposition of organic matter and their effects on the gain or loss of alkalinity. The results and comparisons of different neutralization measures will be generalized by the application of hydrogeochemical models for alkalinity production showinga) the long term efficiency of the measures, depending on carbon turnover at the sediment/water interface,b) the development of bicarbonate buffering capacity as a consequence of biological measures,c) the importance of pyrite formation instead of FeS...|$|R

In general, patchouli oil obtained from the hydrodistillation of patchouli leaves. Most industries are still using patchouli oil refiners made of ferrous metal. As this process takes place at high temperatures, water vapor will contain a lot of dissolved oxygen that is corrosive and causes iron to rust easily. The rust will dissolve in patchouli oil obtained and led to the resulting of dark oil and patchouli aroma becomes weaker. This situation led to a lower market price of patchouli oil. One method {{that can be used to}} purify is complexometry method with citric acid as the chelating agent. This certainly not familiar to farmers, therefore this study tried to simplify this process by finding a material that easily found by the common people. Orange juice contains citric acid which is enough to be used as a chelating agent, other than that lemon is a fruit that are easy to obtain in the community at abundant and the price is cheap. Therefore lemon juice was chosen as an alternative chelating material. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of operating temperature, concentration of the chelating agent and the stirring time in the chelating process and find out the extent to which lemon juice can be used as a chelating agent.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Lime {{treatment}} of soil is {{the practice of}} introducing lime to soil to improve subgrade conditions or to improve a soil's properties to meet construction aggregate qualifications. Lime treated soils commonly exhibit improvements in moisture-density, strength, and thaw performance. Although lime treatment has been practiced in many regions of the United States and Canada for several decades, it is not practiced in Alaska. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine potential of improving commonly encountered Alaskan soils with lime treatment. The two soils analyzed during this study were a silt from the Fairbanks area and a silty gravel from the Anchorage area. These soils were analyzed due to their similarity with soils encountered within regions of Alaska that are currently developed, and have potential for future development. Several laboratory tests were conducted to analyze the effect lime has on the engineering properties of both studied soils. The properties analyzed included moisture-density, strength, frost susceptibility, and thaw strength. The results of this study show <b>lime</b> treatment has <b>potential</b> to improve the engineering properties of commonly encountered Alaskan soils. The results of this study also show potential to improve Alaskan soil with low concentrations of lime during cool and short construction seasons...|$|R
40|$|In a {{laboratory}} study we investigated the contact and barrier efficacy of different natural substances (wood ash, sawdust, hydrated lime, and diatomaceous earth) against slugs {{of the genus}} Arion, an important agricultural pest. Natural substances were tested individually and in combination with each other. The experiment {{was carried out in}} plastic petri dishes and in glass insectaria. Moistened tampons and fresh leaves of lettuce were placed into both experimental arenas. The slugs were starved for 48 hours prior to the experiment. Six categories of behaviour were identified for slugs {{in the presence of the}} natural substances: (1) slug survived the experiment, (2) slug died during the experiment, (3) slug crossed the barrier, (4) slug did not cross the barrier, (5) slug fed on the lettuce, and (6) slug did not feed on the lettuce. The effect of different treatments (natural substances) was significant. The results of our study have shown that hydrated lime had the best contact efficacy on slugs (the mortality of slugs was 100 %), both individually and in combination with other substances. The treatments with hydrated lime also proved to be the most efficient barrier preventing slugs from feeding on lettuce. Hydrated <b>lime</b> shows great <b>potential</b> in Arion control in our investigation; however, further research is needed to investigate the practical value (how to avoid the problem when the substance becomes wet), safety and economics of hydrated lime used in this way...|$|R

A study {{was carried out}} to determine the potential reuse of desalination sludge as a brick making material. Desalination sludge was dried and grinded into a fine powder before being mixed with clay at different ratios corresponding to 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % dried desalination sludge content by weight. The optimum moisture content was determined for each mixture to ensure the bricks were made to their maximum density, thus maintaining sample consistency. Three bricks (10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) were made {{from each of the}} 0 %, 10 %, and 20 % mixtures to determine their compressive strength, whereas four brick samples were prepared from 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 % mixtures to determine initial rate of absorption (IRA), <b>lime</b> pitting and <b>potential</b> to efflorescence. It was found that the compressive strength decreased with increasing dried desalination sludge content in comparison with the control bricks (0 % sludge). The average compressive strength reduced from 8 MPa, to 3 MPa and 2 MPa for the 0 %, 10 % and 20 % sludge bricks respectively. The IRA tests show steadily increasing IRA values with increasing sludge content. Bricks that did not contain any sludge had an average IRA value of 8. 1 kg/m 2 min, whereas bricks containing 40 % dried desalination sludge had an average value of 14. 6 kg/m 2 min.
