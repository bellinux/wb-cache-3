40|$|Introduction Electroglottography (EGG) is {{a common}} method for {{providing}} noninvasive measurements of glottal activity. The object {{of this study was}} to characterise EGG based parameters, specifically the open quotient (OQ), during fricative production, and during the phones preceding and following the fricative in a carrier phrase. With the OQ measures we aim to quantitatively establish if the relatively weak voicing during the fricative production may be differentiated from the stronger voicing of the contextual vowel. Our long term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which voicing is initiated and maintained as a guide to improving strategies for initiating and maintaining voicing in patients with laryngeal impairment such as unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) (Pinho, Jesus, & Barney, 2009). Methods Data were collected from two adult female (JG and HV) and two adult male (LJ and RS) speakers of EP. None had reported speech, language or hearing disorders, and all had normal vocal qualities. They were assessed by an experienced Speech and Language Therapist using a standardised evaluation protocol (Jesus, et al., 2009). Speakers were recorded producing 51 utterances, including 9 isolated words containing the EP voiced fricatives /v, z, Z/, in initial, medial and final word position, and the same 9 words embedded in 51 different carrier sentences, that presented a variety of consonantal (taps, laterals, stops and nasals) and vocalic (close, open front and back vowels) contexts in real EP sentences (only vowel-fricative-vowel sequences were analysed). To analyse the EGG signal we built Matlab scripts based on the open source software “MOQ interface” (Henrich, Alessandro, Doval, & Castellengo, 2004; Henrich, Gendrot, Michaud, & Tuan, 2005). We used the method “DEGG DECOM”, reported as the one that presented the best results compared to OQ measurements derived from the inverse-filtered glottal flow (Henrich, et al., 2004). These functions, developed for the singing voice (Henrich, et al., 2004), assume a quasi-periodic signal and were therefore considered to be more suitable for voiced fricative analysis. To characterise the fricatives in terms of their production mechanisms, we analysed the OQ derived from the EGG signal during the steady state of the fricative and of the adjacent vowels. The strategy used to correlate and extract information from these different modes of speech production was based on average values calculated for the OQ within phone 1 (vowel), phone 2 (fricative) and phone 3 (vowel). Results We calculated for each phone (1, 2 and 3) the average of the OQ values derived from EGGDEGG. In cases where the peaks do not stand out clearly and the OQ cannot be calculated reliably, it does not make sense to talk of an OQ at all (Henrich, et al., 2005). Therefore, zero and nonsense OQ values (e. g., fundamental frequency derived from EGG, with values equal or greater than 400 Hz) were not included in subsequent analysis. For both female and male data, an increase in the OQ values during fricative production (phone 2) was observed when compared to OQ values from the adjacent vowels (phone 1 and phone 3), as shown in Table 1. Discussion There was a small increase in the OQ values during the fricative, relative to that of the adjacent vowels. We can hypothesise that a more physically efficient voice is related with a decrease of the OQ value during the production of vowels (Howard, 1995). Changes observed in the EGG waveform during fricative production, thought to result from the rise in the supraglottal pressure due to a supraglottal constriction (Rothenberg & Mahshie, 1988), may be useful in a definition of weak voicing (Pinho, Jesus, & Barney, 2009). Some differences in the OQ values were also observed for different places of articulation: alveolar (/z/) fricatives showed OQ values slightly lower (59 ± 9) than <b>labio-dentals</b> (/v/) and postalveolars (/Z/) (61 - 65 ± 9). Further work is needed to relate these results to vocal fold mechanics. In future work we plan to extract the OQ from the inverse-filtered glottal flow (a signal we simultaneously acquired during data collection) in order to extend our study of OQ to UVFP patients where EGG cannot be reliably collected. <br/...|$|R

5000|$|The segment /ʔ/ can be {{understood}} as a glottal stop and appears in all positions, for example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 7):The segments /bʷ/, /b/, /d/ and /g/ are voiced stops at the labio-velar, bilabial, alveolar and velar positions of articulation (Musgrave, 2007, p. 7). The labio-velar stop /bʷ/ can {{be understood}} as a prenasalised bilabial stop that is voiced, involving the rounding of lips and an audible labio-velar, semi-vowel offset (Musgrave, 2007, p. 7). It can be identified in initial as well as medial positions, for example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 7):The bilabial stop /b/ {{can be understood}} as a prenasalised stop that is voiced ᵐb found in initial and medial positions, for example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 7): The segment /d/ is an alveolar stop that differs from other prenasalised stops in that it can be found in all positions (initial, medial and final) (Musgrave, 2007, p. 7). In initial and medial positions, it appears as a prenasalised voiced stop ⁿd. Examples include (Musgrave, 2007, p. 7): The phonetic variations of ⁿd, ⁿt, ndɾ and nɾ can be found when /d/ occurs in final position (Musgrave, 2007, p. 7). Examples include (Musgrave, 2007, p. 7): Finally, the velar stop /g/ {{can be understood as}} a voiced homorganic prenasalised stop ᵑg which can be found in initial and medial positions, for example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 7-8): The following phonemes /mʷ/, /m/, /n/ and /ŋ/ are voiced nasals occurring at the labio-velar, bilabial, alveolar and velar positions of articulation (Musgrave, 2007, p. 8). The phoneme /mʷ/ appears in initial and medial positions, involving the rounding of lips and an audible labio-velar, semi-vowel offset. For example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 8): The segment /m/ can be understood as a voiced bilabial nasal in each position, for example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 8): The segment /n/ can be understood as a voiced alveolar nasal in each position, for example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 8): Finally, the segment /ŋ/ can be understood as a voiced velar nasal in each position, for example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 8): The phonemes /vʷ/, /v/, /s/, /x/ and /h/ can be understood as fricatives at the labio-velar, <b>labio-dental,</b> alveolar, velar and glottal positions of articulation (Musgrave, 2007, p. 8). The segment /vʷ/ is a labio-velar fricative involving the rounding of lips and an audible labio-velar, semi-vowel offset (Musgrave, 2007, p. 8). In initial position it is voiceless but can be optionally voiced intervocalically and does not appear in final position. For example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 8-9): The segment /v/ can be understood as a <b>labio-dental</b> fricative (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9). In initial and final positions it is voiceless however, it can be voiced intervocalically. In some cases such as in syllable-final positions before /m/ and /b/, /v/ can be understood as p while in other syllable-final positions, there is variation between f and p (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9). For example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9): The segment /s/ can be understood as a voiceless alveolar grooved fricative (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9). If /s/ follows /n/ it is understood as the affricate tʃ in initial and medial positions but is understood as s in final positions. For example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9):The segment /x/ can be understood as a velar fricative that is voiceless in initial and final positions but can be optionally voiced intervocalically. For example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9):The segment /h/ can be understood as a glottal fricative that is voiceless (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9). It is attested in final positions with the exception of /ahau/ (which means ‘no’ in answer to an affirmative question or ‘yes’ in answer to a negative question) (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9). It is attested in medial positions such as /eheʔ/ ‘no’ (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9). For example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9): The segment /l/ can be understood as an alveolar lateral that is voiced (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9). It can be identified in all positions, for example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 9-10): The segment /ɾ/ can be understood as an alveolar flap that is voiced (Musgrave, 2007, p. 10). It can be identified in all positions, for example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 10):The glides /w/ and /j/ can only be found in syllable-initial positions (Musgrave, 2007, p. 10). The segment /w/ is s a semi-vowel that can be understood as a labio-velar approximate w that is voiced (Musgrave, 2007, p. 10). For example (Musgrave, 2007, p. 10): The segment /j/ is a semi-vowel that can be understood as a palatal approximate that is voiced (Musgrave, 2007, p. 10).

The results of the perception tests showed that most of the respondents were able to differentiate English <b>labio-dental</b> fricative and dental fricatives from voiced bilabial stop and alveolar stops accurately. The identification test results showed that the respondents could identify English /v/, /θ/ and /ð/ quite easily as the accuracy of all the respondents is 90 %.

40|$|Acquiring {{the native}} {{language}} involves learning to perceive and produce sound structures (phonology) {{of the speech}} input. Speech to children often contains phonological modifications, and across languages the speech input to which children are exposed contains phonetic variation associated with linguistic and socioindexical information. Previous studies have investigated phonetic variation in infant-directed speech (e. g. Davis 2 ̆ 6 Lindblom, 2001; Fernald et al., 1989; Kuhl et al., 1997; Snow, 1977), and differences in phonological variation between child-directed and adultdirected speech (e. g. Bernstein-Ratner, 1984 a, 1984 b; Lee, Davis 2 ̆ 6 MacNeilage, 2008; Lee 2 ̆ 6 Davis, 2010). There are, however, few studies examining how and when phonetic variation in speech to children changes after infancy, as they get older. This thesis is a longitudinal investigation of phonetic variation in mothers’ speech to children (maternal speech) in two language varieties spoken in northern Australia, Gurindji Kriol and Australian English. Gurindji Kriol is an Australian Aboriginal mixed language that contains lexical forms and phonology from both the traditional language Gurindji and Kriol, an English-lexifier creole. There are no previous systematic quantitative studies on fricatives in Gurindji Kriol, or any Australian contact language, although impressionistically fricatives in Kriol-derived words are highly variable. Australian English also contains phonetic variation related to speech processes, such as consonant reduction in casual speech. There is, however, little prior research on phonetic variation that children are exposed to in Australian English. The purpose of this thesis was to provide quantitative analyses of fricative variation in maternal speech in Gurindji Kriol and northern Australian English as children aged from approximately 1; 6 to 2; 0 to 2; 6. A subsidiary aim was to examine methodological issues in phonetic transcription when the transcribers are non-native speakers of the language. This thesis contains three empirical research studies. In Study 1 we added phonetic transcription and analysis to a subsample of a corpus of naturalistic family interactions in Gurindji Kriol created by Felicity Meakins between 2003 and 2007 {{as part of the}} Aboriginal Child Language project (ACLA- 1, Simpson 2 ̆ 6 Wigglesworth, 2008). Speakers were three Gurindji Kriol speaking women recorded at three timepoints, when the focus children were approximately 1; 6, 2; 0 and 2; 6. We analysed stop-fricative variation in tokens of Kriol-derived words that could potentially be pronounced with a fricative, based on words that had fricatives in their English cognates. Results showed that words containing stop-fricative variation {{were more likely to be}} open-class than closed-class, with the variable segment most frequently word-initial and at <b>labio-dental</b> and alveolar places of articulation. Across all tokens with potential fricatives, the likelihood of fricatives in word-initial position significantly increased when children were 2; 6. In tokens of words found to contain stop-fricative variation, word-medial fricatives were significantly more likely in mothers’ speech at child age 2; 6. Analyses took into account phonological environments and interspeaker differences. Study 2 investigated fricative variation in the form of phonological reduction in northern Australian English maternal speech. A longitudinal audiovisual corpus of naturalistic family interactions was recorded and phonetically transcribed for this study. Speakers were five mothers who were native speakers of Australian English, and were recorded when their children were approximately 1; 6, 2; 0 and 2; 6. We analysed deletion in word-initial /h/ and word-final /v/, common processes in casual speech, in mothers’ speech at each timepoint. Results showed a non-linear change in overall deletion over time within a stable set of lexical items. Between child ages 1; 6 and 2; 0 deletion proportionately increased in mothers’ speech, while between 2; 0 and 2; 6 deletion proportionately decreased. Study 3 addressed a methodological issue of checking phonetic transcription with native speakers of Gurindji Kriol. Native speakers have implicit knowledge of Gurindji Kriol phonology that would be beneficial to understanding transcription ambiguities arising from perceptual bias, and for furthering our interpretation of phonetic variation in Gurindji Kriol. We used visual analogue scales to elicit native speaker perceptions on sound segments potentially pronounced as fricatives in Gurindji Kriol. Native speaker judgements on the scales were then compared to the IPA judgements made by non-native speaker phonetic transcribers. Results showed both agreements and discrepancies between native and non-native speakers for different types of judgements and segment word positions. Empirical findings in this thesis are discussed in terms of processes driving change in phonetic variation in mothers’ speech to children, such as fine-tuning to children’s own receptive and productive language development. Results have implications for theoretical models of children’s phonological acquisition, which must take into account variable phonetic detail in the input. Pedagogical implications are also discussed (in Chapter 7) in terms of how teachers can use information about Gurindji children’s home language to augment their language and literacy teaching...|$|E
