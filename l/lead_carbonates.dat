50|$|Mining in the Leadville area {{began in}} 1859 when prospectors {{working in the}} {{channels}} of the Arkansas River tributaries discovered gold {{at the mouth of}} California Gulch. In April 1860, one of the richest discoveries of placer gold in Colorado was discovered at California Gulch. By 1872, placer mining in California Gulch yielded more than $2,500,000, roughly equivalent to $47,674,478 today. In 1876, piles of sand once considered bothersome to placer gold miners, were discovered to contain <b>lead</b> <b>carbonates</b> and were traced back to California Gulch. This discovery propelled a rush of miners to the area. The town of Leadville was founded a year later by mine owners Horace Austin Warner Tabor and August Meyer. Mining, mineral processing, and smelting in and near Leadville produced gold, silver, lead, copper, manganese, and zinc for more than 130 years. Wastes generated during the mining and ore processing contained metals, such as cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc.|$|E
40|$|Five {{soil samples}} {{collected}} from shooting ranges in 1998 were stored under a closed condition for 5 years. In addition to SEM and XRD investigations, the {{total organic carbon}} content (TOC), inorganic carbon content (TIC), δ 13 C and δ 18 O of carbonates and δ 13 C of plant remains were analyzed. The concentrations of total carbon contents, the sum of TOC and TIC, remained the same within the 5 years storage, whereas the TOC and TIC contents decreased and increased, respectively. The TIC increase {{is associated with a}} decreased TOC, suggesting a conversion of organic carbon into inorganic carbon. Such a conversion is evidenced by the presence of primary <b>lead</b> <b>carbonates</b> and carbon isotopic composition of <b>lead</b> <b>carbonates.</b> It can be concluded that soil organic matters {{play an important role in}} the process of bullets weathering and controls migration of the elevated lead in the soil...|$|E

Sequential extraction was applied to estimate the chemical association of lead in the sediments of the Barje lake. Several lead fractions showed highly significant correlations with the corresponding substrate (step II: Mn-oxyhydroxides; step III: Fe-oxyhydroxides) suggesting that <b>lead</b> <b>carbonates</b> were incorporated with amorphous iron and manganese hydroxides. An explanation for this relation can be in the same anthropogenic source of these elements...|$|E

40|$|Although {{microbial}} {{treatments of}} heavy metal ions in wastewater have been studied, {{the removal of}} these metals through incorporation into carbonate minerals has rarely been reported. To investigate the removal of Fe 3 + and Pb 2 +, two representative metals in wastewater, through the precipitation of carbonate minerals by a microbial flocculant (MBF) produced by Bacillus mucilaginosus. MBF was added to synthetic wastewater containing different Fe 3 + and Pb 2 + concentrations, {{and the extent of}} flocculation was analyzed. CO 2 was bubbled into the mixture of MBF and Fe 3 +/Pb 2 + to initiate the reaction. The solid substrates were analyzed via X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results showed that the removal efficiency decreased and the MBF adsorption capacity for metals increased with increasing heavy metal concentration. In the system containing MBF, metals (Fe 3 + and Pb 2 +), and CO 2, the concentrated metals adsorbed onto the MBF combined with the dissolved CO 2, resulting in oversaturation of metal carbonate minerals to form iron carbonate and <b>lead</b> <b>carbonates.</b> These results may be used in designing a method in which microbes can be utilized to combine CO 2 with wastewater heavy metals to form carbonates, with the aim of mitigating environmental problems...|$|E

40|$|Destabilization of lead {{corrosion}} scales present in plumbing {{materials used in}} water distribution systems results in elevated lead concentrations in drinking water. Lead release caused by changes in water chemistry (e. g., redox conditions) is often due to the destabilization of lead carbonate and oxide solid phases. Although prior {{studies have examined the}} effects of varying water chemistry on the stability of β-PbO 2 (plattnerite), β-PbO 2 stability under depleting chlorine conditions is poorly understood. In addition little is known regarding the mechanisms by which Pb 3 O 4 (minium) dissolves under drinking water conditions. In this thesis, long-term batch dissolution experiments were performed for pure phase β-PbO 2 and Pb 3 O 4 under depleting chlorine conditions. Results indicate that the initial availability of free chlorine effectively depresses dissolved lead concentrations released from both solid phases. From the Pb 3 O 4 dissolution experiments, it was found that Pb 3 O 4 was first oxidized by free chlorine to form β-PbO 2. After chlorine was depleted, Pb 3 O 4 solvolytic disproportionation resulted in growth of β-PbO 2 and an increase in dissolved lead concentrations. The formation of <b>lead</b> <b>carbonates</b> controlled the final lead concentrations (~ 0. 1 mg/L) for Pb 3 O 4 dissolution. In contrast, for the β-PbO 2 dissolution experiments, the dissolved lead levels remained low (~ 0. 004 mg/L) even after free chlorine was depleted. Detailed characterization of solid samples collected during the β-PbO 2 experiments indicate that Pb 2 + impurities present in crystalline β-PbO 2 play a dominant role in the stability of this solid phase...|$|E
40|$|In 2010, M 39 decins Sans Fronti 38 res {{discovered}} a lead poisoning outbreak linked to artisanal gold processing in northwestern Nigeria. The outbreak has killed approximately 400 {{young children and}} affected thousands more. |Our aim was to undertake an interdisciplinary geological- and health-science assessment to clarify lead sources and exposure pathways, identify additional toxicants of concern and populations at risk, and examine potential for similar lead poisoning globally. |We applied diverse analytical methods to ore samples, soil and sweep samples from villages and family compounds, and plant foodstuff samples. |Natural weathering of lead-rich gold ores before mining formed abundant, highly gastric-bioaccessible <b>lead</b> <b>carbonates.</b> The same fingerprint of lead minerals found in all sample types confirms that ore processing caused extreme contamination, with up to 185, 000 ppm lead in soils/sweep samples and up to 145 ppm lead in plant foodstuffs. Incidental ingestion of soils via hand-to-mouth transmission and of dusts cleared from the respiratory tract is the dominant exposure pathway. Consumption of water and foodstuffs contaminated by the processing is likely lesser, but these are still significant exposure pathways. Although young children suffered the most immediate and severe consequences, results indicate that older children, adult workers, pregnant women, and breastfed infants are also at risk for lead poisoning. Mercury, arsenic, manganese, antimony, and crystalline silica exposures pose additional health threats. |Results inform ongoing efforts in Nigeria to assess lead contamination and poisoning, treat victims, mitigate exposures, and remediate contamination. Ore deposit geology, pre-mining weathering, and burgeoning artisanal mining may combine to cause similar lead poisoning disasters elsewhere globally...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe origin(s) and role(s) {{of metal}} soaps in paints are a {{worldwide}} concern today. These hybrid compounds, containing both fatty acid chains and metals {{associated with a}} carboxylate function, are increasingly identified in paints. As reviewed {{in the first part}} of this work, the presence of metal soaps in paints is differently interpreted in scientific publications: metal soaps are sometimes considered to play a positive role as anchor points, during paint drying processes; they can also be considered as responsible for many degradation processes (protrusions, efflorescences, darkening, etc.). Their origins are also interpreted in various ways. In some paintings (in particular from the twentieth century), they have sometimes introduced on purpose, as additives, to modify the physical properties of the painting materials. In older paintings, metal soaps are usually thought to result from an uncontrolled reaction of oil with lead-based pigments, in particular lead white, red lead, and lead tin yellow. In the second part of this work, the review of historical recipes of lead-based paint shows an important number of recipes based on controlled mixing of oil with lead driers. In the third part, the experimental reproduction of such traditional recipes using walnut oil and litharge (PbO) shows that lead soaps can be formed, both in about one hour at ∼ 100 °C, or in about one month at room temperature. It shows as well that after a few years, litharge is no longer detected in the paint medium, while different <b>lead</b> <b>carbonates</b> are. Finally, the micro-infrared spectroscopy and micro-X-ray diffraction re-analysis of protrusions from a nine-year model painting shows together with lead soaps, the presence of Pb 5 (CO 3) 3 (OH) 2 O (‘synthetic plumbonacrite’), an unusual phase recently observed in a protrusion from a painting by Vincent Van Gogh. This work highlights (i) the multiple origins and roles of metal soaps in paints and (ii) the importance of combining the analysis of fragments from historical paintings with the analysis and reproduction of historical recipes. In particular, we show that the components detected today in historical paintings may severely differ from those originally used or prepared by the painter, complicating the assessment of the painter's intentions. More than the presence of metal soaps, the key questions to be tackled should be about their origins and (re) mobilization...|$|E
50|$|Cerussite (also {{known as}} <b>lead</b> <b>carbonate</b> or white <b>lead</b> ore) is a mineral {{consisting}} of <b>lead</b> <b>carbonate</b> (PbCO3), {{and an important}} ore of lead. The name is from the Latin cerussa, white lead. Cerussa nativa was mentioned by Conrad Gessner in 1565, and in 1832 F. S.

40|$|International audienceThe {{prediction}} {{of the long}} term trace element transport in Technosols, defined as soils containing at least 20 % of human-made materials within the 100 cm upper soil horizon, would {{be a way to}} anticipate land management. These soils, usually abandoned for decades, contain pollutants resulting from industrial processes. The main objective {{of this study is to}} develop a model to predict the hydro-geochemical and mechanical evolutions in Technosols. In this study, the model developments have been made in order to consider the multi-component soil gas phase diffusion whereas the original COMSOL-Phreeqc coupling model [1] does not take it into account. Therefore, the coupling model is able to (i) take into account soil hydro-geochemical heterogeneity (such as permeability and porosity contrasts), (ii) manage multi-component gas diffusion, consumption and generation in unsaturated soil and (iii) take climatic variations, such as rain infiltration, into consideration. The COMSOL® and IPhreeqc procedures alternate for the calculation of liquid water flow, gas and solute transport and reactions using a non-iterative sequential split-operator approach. Data from the output of one procedure is passed back to the Matlab® workspace and reformatted for the following procedure. The gas phase mole numbers and volume are updated using IPhreeqc’s method GAS_PHASE_MODIFY. As for flow and transport calculations, a function is used to create valid initial conditions for gas transport calculations in COMSOL. The coupling developed model has been validated using CrunchFlow [2] in a 1 -D and fixed soil water saturation case. The coupling model was applied on a case study consisting in a Technosol developed on dredged sediments. The mineralogical compositions of two samples, from fractured oxidation crust and soil block center, were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction spectroscopy. The mineralogical assemblage of the block center sample is used as the composition of the initial sediment deposited 30 years ago. The model axisymmetric geometry consists of a heterogeneous soil profile with a fracture region (about 0. 5 m large, 1 m depth). The atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse permanently into the soil and fracture over the time at their respective diffusion coefficients. The modeling results over 30 years have shown that the Technosol weathering leads to dissolution of galena with consumption of the soil oxygen, as well as precipitation of <b>lead</b> <b>carbonates</b> and formation of ferrihydrite. These mineralogical transformations take place more in poorly saturated zones in the profile such as cracks and soil surface. The model can capture well the soil evolution trend at least for about 30 years...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} {{was to examine the}} {{potential}} of synthetic pyroaurite to remove lead(II) from contaminated water. This study was based upon column experiments run in duplicate at room temperature. Heavy metals, many being toxic and bio-accumulative in nature pose a major threat to soil water environment and human health. Lead(II) is among one of the environmental pollutant which is known to be toxic to human health if present in significant amount in waters. To remove such toxic metals from waters, many methods have been developed. The same problem has been addressed in this study. A low cost Mg and Fe based carbonate hydroxide i. e. pyroaurite was synthesized in the laboratory and the removal of Pb 2 + from Pb(NO 3) 2 solution by sorption was investigated. This was done by performing column experiments. The prepared synthetic material was characterized first using XRD and SEM to observe the composition and crystal structure of the material. Poorly crystallized material was formed in the laboratory while presence of a pyroaurite-like compound was confirmed by XRD analysis. The fine-grained synthesized material was mixed with a natural sand to improve the flow properties of the packed column. A solution of 5. 8 ppm Pb(NO 3) 2 was pumped through the column at a rate of 1. 25 ml/hr. The effluent was sampled with every 20 or 30 minutes. The two duplicate experiments were run respectively for 8 and 22 days. The concentration of Pb 2 + was analysed in the effluent using ICP-MS. Very low concentration of lead(II) was detected in the outlet samples as compared to the incoming Pb(II) concentration into the column, revealing that most of the lead(II) is captured inside the column. On the average 99 % of the injected Pb(II) was removed. The effluent concentration was well below recommended drinking water standard by World health organization (WHO). The reacted solid column material was analysed by XRD and SEM. The XRD examination did not reveal presence of a secondary Pb-phase in the reacted samples due to traceable amounts of Pb(II) inside the column material. On the other hand, SEM analysis revealed the presence of Pb(II) in few samples from reacted material. The appropriate mechanism of sorption by which lead(II) is taken up by pyroaurite-like material is not clear, though adsorption and precipitation are considered to be the major mechanisms. iv It is suspected that major part of lead(II) is precipitated on the synthetic pyroaurite material, as Pb(II) was found in the form of small particles in some of the samples examined. Some traces of lead(II) may also be scavenged by adsorption, but no desorption experiments were carried out to verify it. The results indicated that the precipitates were formed either as <b>lead</b> <b>carbonates</b> or lead oxides. Observations and calculations have showed that about 99 % of Pb(II) is taken up by pyroaurite-like material. The results suggested that synthetic pyroaurite has potential to remove Pb 2 + from aqueous solutions and therefore can be a good candidate for the purification of contaminated waters...|$|E
