40|$|This thesis aims to discover, understand, and {{evaluate}} the contemporary client and user involvement practices of landscape architects in the Greater Cleveland area. The research used narrative interviews with firms and their clients {{to answer the following}} questions: 1. 	Do landscape architects correctly interpret their clients? needs? 2. 	Are clients? needs incorporated into designs? 3. 	Are clients satisfied with <b>landscape</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>services?</b> 4. 	Do landscape architects involve users on a regular basis? 5. 	Is there a set of best practices to adopt when working with clients? The results showed that landscape architects focused on understanding the needs of their clients {{from the beginning of the}} design process through one-on-one communication with them. This input was incorporated into designs to the satisfaction of the clients. Landscape architects felt that part of their job was to educate clients about good design. This allows their practical and creative input to combine with the client?s producing a design that satisfies their needs and holds up over time. Clients appreciate the practical recommendations and high level of communication that the landscape architects offer. Users do not participate in the design process on a day-to-day basis, although most firms work with them sporadically. The methods for working with them are not well defined by the interviewees. Both client and user involvement is limited by budget constraints, project type, and client wishes...|$|E
40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningHoward HahnDisc golf {{is on the}} rise. Disc golf is a sport {{based on}} {{traditional}} golf but played with a flying disc instead of a ball and club. It was formalized in the 1970 s and has grown steadily ever since, particularly in the last decade. Landscape architecture has largely ignored this phenomenon, except for two MLA theses (Plansky, 2013 a; Hutzelman, 2012). This seems unusual, considering that landscape architecture {{has been called the}} most relevant degree to disc golf course design (DGCD, 2014). This study assesses the relationship between landscape architecture and disc golf. A general research question guides this study: what added benefit, if any, might landscape architects bring to disc golf course design and development? This guiding question is explored through three subquestions: 1) what services might landscape architects offer disc golf course development, 2) how might <b>landscape</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>services</b> be used by the current state of disc golf course development, and 3) how might future course development types take full advantage of the services provided by landscape architects? This project used literature synthesis, analysis of existing data, and three types of exploratory designs to answer the above questions. The results of these methods showed that landscape architects can add value to disc golf course design and development through their skillsets and process. Not every landscape architect necessarily possesses the skills and experience to design a disc golf course, but landscape architects as a whole can propose disc golf courses if they have a basic knowledge of course requirements. A closer relationship between landscape architects and disc golf would be beneficial for the growth of the profession and the sport. This report concludes with recommendations and an action plan to reach this goal...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 There is {{currently}} a dominant urban narrative in contemporary <b>landscape</b> <b>architectural</b> theory that tends to situate <b>landscape</b> <b>architectural</b> theory in a metropolitan context. Although individual practitioners are working on projects in all manner of places, <b>landscape</b> <b>architectural</b> theory remains silent in challenging the urban vs. rural stereotype and continues to align professional theory and discourse with metropolitan landscapes. This thesis examines and considers the value and role of "rural" in landscape architecture's written discourse, noting its relative lack of importance in the profession's contemporary theory. I argue that the discourse on physical development in the North American landscape is limited by concurrent phenomena; a design theory that disproportionately favors "urban" topics, case studies, and innovation; and U. S. census data that ultimately delimit landscapes as either "rural" or "urban. " In this thesis, I argue for an expanded landscape architecture theory that challenges the dominant urban discourse to addresses how rural communities can work with designers to set and reach mutual goals for livability and sustainability...|$|R

40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningMary C. Kingery-PageOver {{time the}} {{conventional}} design process has minimally evolved from Hideo Sasaki’s staged-design process, {{one of the}} original models of <b>landscape</b> <b>architectural</b> design process (Murphy 2005, 50; Sasaki 1950, 35). Different types of conventional design process, as it is called in this study, incorporate more stages, devoting more time to each; however, the stages are still completed in an exact order due to the focus on problem solving. The lack of encouragement for personal creative thinking through an individual creative process within the conventional design processes used today is apparent in both the profession and the education of landscape architects today. Because a creative process does not simply solve problems but encourages creative thinking throughout design, the profession would see greater generation of new ideas if landscape architects began to embrace a more creative process, as identified by Graham Wallas in the 1920 s (Lawson 2006, 149 - 150; Herrman 1995; Goswami and Goswami 1999, 43 - 44). Interviews with highly creative, or avant-garde, landscape architects, such as Thomas Balsley, Claude Cormier, Mikyoung Kim and Peter Walker, and assumedly creative artists helped to provide answers to primary research questions: How does the design process of avant-garde landscape architects compare to the assumedly creative process used by artists? And how can the conventional <b>landscape</b> <b>architectural</b> design process be reframed to incorporate more creative thinking in <b>landscape</b> <b>architectural</b> practice and <b>landscape</b> <b>architectural</b> education? Using a grounded theory approach, in-depth, open-ended interviews were completed with eight subjects. Initial coding themes were based upon broad categories from literature review. Substantial coding and analysis of interviews to find the creative and conventional design processes and characteristics of creativity for each subject resulted in emergent themes and sub-themes from the interviews. Analysis matrices were developed to document commonalities and discrepancies between initial themes from literature review and emergent themes from interviews. Conclusions on findings from initial and emergent themes include:highly creative landscape architects employ non-linear, creative processes throughout design, confidence in personal creativity is imperative to creative thinking, and <b>landscape</b> <b>architectural</b> programs should allow students flexibility and creative license for developing personal design processes...|$|R
