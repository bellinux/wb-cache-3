5|$|L.gigas is {{very often}} parasitized by protists of the phylum Apicomplexa, which are common mollusk parasites.

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{key issues}} of {{object-oriented}} modeling and design is inheritance. It allows for the definition of subclasses that inherit features of some superclass. Inheritance is well defined for static properties of classes such as attributes and methods. However, there is no general agreement {{on the meaning of}} inheritance when considering the dynamic behavior of objects, captured by their <b>life</b> <b>cycles.</b> This paper studies inheritance of behavior both in a simple process-algebraic setting and in a Petri-net framework. Process algebra is chosen, because it concentrates on behavior, while abstracting from the internal states of processes. The result of the algebraic study is a clear conceptual understanding of inheritance of behavior. It can be expressed in terms of blocking and hiding method calls. The results in the algebraic framework inspire the development of the concept of inheritance of behavior in the Petri-net framework. The Petri-net formalism allows for a graphical representation <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> objects with an explicit representation of object states. In the Petri-net framework, four inheritance rules are defined {{that can be used to}} construct <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> subclasses from the object <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> given (super-) classes. These inheritance rules can be used to structure a design process and they stimulate the reuse of life-cycle specifications. It turns out that the combination of blocking and hiding method calls captures a number of important operators for constructing <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> subclasses from <b>life</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> superclasses, namely choice, sequential composition, parallel composition, and iteration. A small case study validates our approach to inheritance of behavior...|$|R
5|$|Each volcano type {{produced}} by the Anahim hotspot has its own unique <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> growth and erosion. Volcanic cones have their origins from tephra accumulating around vents during Strombolian eruptions. They are composed of trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt, phonolite, basanite {{and to a lesser}} extent phonotephrite. In contrast, lava domes are formed mainly by viscous trachytic magma that erupted effusively onto the surface and then piled up thick around vents. Most of these features were formed by a single volcanic eruption and are therefore monogenetic. However, in some cases several eruptions occurred at a single locus to create larger, polygenetic centres (e.g. Satah Mountain, Baldface Mountain, Nazko Cone). Once activity has declined, erosion reduces them into volcanic remnants such as lava plugs.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E

A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
