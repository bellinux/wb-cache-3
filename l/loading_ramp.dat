5|$|The Tupolev Tu-75 was a {{military}} transport variant of the Tu-4 bomber, as was a similar airliner, the Tu-70, both using a new, purpose-designed fuselage. The first Soviet military machine of this class, it was equipped with a rear fuselage <b>loading</b> <b>ramp.</b> It was not placed into production because the VVS {{decided it would be}} cheaper to modify its existing Tu-4s for the transport mission and to use its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 transports.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev OKB {{began work}} in September 1946 on a {{military}} transport version of the Tupolev Tu-70 airliner and this was confirmed by the Council of Ministers on 11 March 1947 with state trials to begin in August 1948. To expedite the process, maximum use was made of components of the Tu-70. Its engines were the uprated Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN or TKNV fuel-injected version. A new, narrower fuselage was designed, which included a rear cargo hatch, a vehicle <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> and paratroop exit doors. Three gun turrets (dorsal, ventral and tail), were to be adapted from the Tu-4, although they were not fitted on the prototype. It had a crew of six (two pilots, three gunners, a radio operator, and a navigator).|$|E

25|$|During March 1942, the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment and 1st Airlanding Brigade {{commenced}} loading trials using {{several of}} the prototypes, but immediately ran into problems. While attempted to load a jeep into a prototype, Airspeed personnel present informed the evaluation staff that {{to do so would}} break the glider's <b>loading</b> <b>ramp,</b> as it had only been designed to hold a single motorbike. With this lesson learnt, 1st Airlanding Brigade subsequently began sending samples of all equipment required to go into Horsas to Airspeed, and a number of weeks were spent ascertaining the methods and modifications required to fit the equipment into a Horsa. Even so, the <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> continued to be considered to be fragile and prone to damage, which would ground the glider if sustained during loading.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport was}} located on Gressholmen, an island {{situated}} in the Oslofjord, close to downtown Oslo, only accessible by boat. It consisted of a hangar, a terminal building, a <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> and docks. The hangar and terminal buildings remain in use today for storage of pleasure boats and the docks are used as a marina.|$|E
25|$|In U.S. {{military}} service, the Short 330 {{was designated}} C-23A Sherpa. The C-23B Sherpa {{was similar to}} the C-23A, but with cabin windows. The C-23B+ Short 360 derivative was created by replacing the rear fuselage of Short 360s obtained on the second-hand market with the twin tail and rear <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> of the Short Sherpa.|$|E

25|$|The {{road vehicle}} <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> in Dereham yard is {{frequently}} used by mainline train operators to load damaged rolling stock onto road vehicles. Such rolling stock usually comes at night (via {{the connection with}} the mainline at Wymondham) at slow speed (sometimes on wheelskates) from Crown Point depot in Norwich (where no road-rail loading facilities are available) for onward road movement to specialist repair facilities around the country.|$|E
25|$|A single C-123B {{was tested}} as a {{possible}} replacement for the Candle aircraft, with its rear <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> removed and replaced with a large box with 28 large lights. The aircraft could continuously light a two-mile circle from an altitude of 12,000ft. This aircraft, under the provisional designation NC-123B was dropped because the lights, fixed to the aircraft, made it far easier for enemy gunners to track compared to the earlier flare ships.|$|E

50|$|There was a {{loading station}} to the {{municipal}} gasworks at the postal station. It had two <b>loading</b> <b>ramps.</b> A passenger tunnel connected the postal station with the platforms. There were service rooms for the railway staff {{on the upper}} floor of the two-storey building.|$|R
25|$|In {{a similar}} incident, on August 13, 1992, the same vessel {{pulled out of}} its berth at the Departure Bay {{terminal}} while vehicle loading ramps were still lowered and resting on the ship. Three people were killed, including two children, one was seriously injured, and two others received minor injuries when a van from Alberta containing 6 people fell 15 m (about 50ft) from the upper deck onto the lower car deck and finally into the sea below. The van had been stopped and instructed to wait on the <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> by terminal crew members. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that the accident {{was caused by the}} vessel not properly following departing procedures and secondarily due to poor communication between terminal and ship crew members.|$|E
25|$|The pilot's {{compartment}} had two side-by-side {{seats and}} dual controls, {{all of which}} being contained within a large Plexiglas nose section. Initially, the cockpit would be outfitted with internal telephone systems that allowed for communication between the pilots of the glider and tug aircraft while connected; however, this was replaced on later-built models by radio sets instead, which {{had the advantage of}} being able to maintain contact after detaching. Aft of the pilot's compartment was the freight loading door on the port side; the hinged door could also be used as a <b>loading</b> <b>ramp.</b> The main compartment could accommodate 15 troops on benches along the sides with another access door on the starboard side. Supply containers could also be fitted under the centre-section of the wing, three on each side.|$|E
25|$|The tree {{maintained}} its {{connection with the}} dairy industry through the mid-20th century, serving as a collection point for dairy farmers bringing cans of cream to be loaded and transported by road to Gladstone when the first motorised truck began carting cream from Miriam Vale to the Port Curtis Dairy Factory in 1952. By this year a ramp, facing Blomfield Street, had been built alongside {{the trunk of the}} Big Fig for the loading of cream and later milk cans onto the back of delivery vehicles. The place served as an easily accessible and shady location for farmers to assemble and wait for their produce to be loaded. During the 1960s, the original <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> was replaced with a new ramp, and an early fence and gates, reputedly constructed around the tree and cream/milk collection area by Queensland Railways, was demolished. The new ramp was built facing Station Street, and remained until at least 1977 when the last contract for the milk run to Gladstone was cancelled. Several small earth mounds {{to the north of the}} trunk of the Fig Tree are all that remain of the second ramp.|$|E
50|$|The EPF has {{a flight}} deck for {{helicopters}} and a <b>load</b> <b>ramp</b> {{that will allow}} vehicles to quickly drive {{on and off the}} ship. The ramp is suitable for the types of austere piers and quay walls common in developing countries. EPF has a shallow draft (under 15 ft).|$|R
50|$|Cölbe {{freight yard}} {{has not been}} used since the 1990s. Until then, the {{northern}} part of the station was used for loading the freight of local companies. Today, the only remains of the formerly extensive freight operations are the <b>loading</b> <b>ramps</b> and large open areas, which were formerly used for sidings.|$|R
50|$|Prototype {{vehicles}} 4401 and 4402 went undergoing {{almost a}} year of extensive testing in Toronto. That testing triggered a change {{to the design of}} the <b>loading</b> <b>ramps,</b> over which a wheelchair used to tilt. The vehicles would only become TTC property when their ramps are retrofitted to the new design.|$|R
25|$|In 1984, Charles D. Walker {{became the}} first non-government {{astronaut}} to fly, with his employer McDonnell Douglas paying $40,000 for his flight. NASA was also eager to prove its capability to Congressional sponsors. During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor Rockwell International studied a $200–300 million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttle's cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit {{for up to three}} days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own <b>loading</b> <b>ramp,</b> and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the National Space Society stated that although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 to 1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years 30,000 people a year would pay $25,000 each to fly in space on new spacecraft. The presentation also forecast flights to lunar orbit within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.|$|E
500|$|The Osprey can {{be armed}} with one 7.62×51mm NATO (.308in caliber) M240 machine gun or [...]50 in caliber (12.7mm) M2 machine {{gun on the}} <b>loading</b> <b>ramp,</b> that can be fired {{rearward}} when the ramp is lowered. A [...]50in GAU-19 three-barrel Gatling gun mounted below the nose was studied for future upgrade. BAE Systems developed a belly-mounted, remotely operated gun turret system for the V-22, named the Interim Defense Weapon System (IDWS). The IDWS is remotely operated by a gunner inside the aircraft, who acquires targets via a separate pod using color television and forward looking infrared imagery. The IDWS was installed on half of the first V-22s deployed to Afghanistan in 2009, but found limited use due to its [...] weight and restrictive rules of engagement.|$|E
500|$|The XCG-20, redesignated XG-20 in 1948 {{with the}} {{establishment}} of the USAF, was the largest glider ever constructed in the United States, and the last combat glider to be built for the U.S. military. It featured a high-mounted wing and retractable tricycle landing gear, with an auxiliary power unit supplied hydraulic power to the landing gear and flaps. The nose section was reinforced to provide optimal protection to the pilots {{in the event of a}} crash on landing, and to allow for the strongest possible towing connection. The cargo hold was [...] long and [...] wide; it featured an innovative configuration, the rear fuselage being upswept with an integrated <b>loading</b> <b>ramp.</b> This allowed vehicles to be driven directly on and off of the aircraft, speeding loading and unloading times.|$|E

2500|$|The {{defensive}} armament {{system for}} the USAF's H-3E helicopters is described as standard to the HH-3E, and capable of being fitted as required to the CH-3E. [...] The basic system comprises three M60 machine guns, one each at the forward door, the opposite emergency window, and the rear <b>loading</b> <b>ramp.</b> The forward two positions comprise pintle mounts on skate rails, while the rear <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> station comprises a pedestal mount on an armored floor plate. The floor plate slides on two tracks, forward and back, to and from its firing position {{at the edge of}} the ramp. Either the standard infantry M60 can be used, with standard 200-round ammunition boxes attached, or the M60D variant, feeding via flexible ammunition chutes from 750-round boxes fixed to the floor (or to the armored floor plate for the rear <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> position).|$|E
