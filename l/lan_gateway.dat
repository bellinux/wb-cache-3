They are tightly dependent on telephone lines if wired communication was used; transferring speed is limited when using wireless technology like GPRS; Proprietary interfaces {{make it hard to}} reuse software design and new information island may be formed. So a new architecture for Modbus remote monitoring application was presented by this paper to solve the problems. 3 G Gateway provides Modbus network with Internet accessing capability. Process data can be sent to <b>LAN</b> <b>Gateway</b> through 3 G Gateway. <b>LAN</b> <b>Gateway</b> gets the process data and forward to OPC server. Then remote monitoring applications can read/write data from Ito OPC server easily using standard OPC interfaces. A prototype system was implemented in laboratory. The system is in initial phase now, but it proved the technique feasibility of the architecture. Keywords-Modubs; remote monitoring system; 3 G; ope I...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{implementation}} and experimentation {{of a new}} IP rate control protocol proposed to alleviate congestion in the gateway of a LAN connected to external networks. Congestion is avoided by using explicit rate notification to LAN hosts via new ICMP control messages. In addition to avoiding congestion, the protocol also allows for greater fairness and priority in network traffic, while having no impact on traffic outside the local network. The implementation of the IP rate control protocol in a Linux platform is described followed by the experiments conducted at the network laboratory of Monash University. Experimental results show that IP rate control can be very effective in controlling congestion at the <b>LAN</b> <b>gateway</b> by controlling host transmission rates. IP rate control reduces queueing delay and packet loss rate at the <b>LAN</b> <b>gateway.</b> 1 Introduction With the current growth of the IP-based corporate LANs, performance of IP networks increasingly becomes an important factor.

As a result, computationally intensive applications cannot run appropriately or cause the device {{to run out of}} battery too early. Additionally, Internet-based service providers targeting these mobile devices lack information to estimate the remaining battery autonomy and have no view on the availability of idle resources in the neighborhood of the handheld device. These battery-related issues create an opportunity for Internet providers to broaden their role and start managing energy aspects of battery-driven mobile devices inside the home. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware resource-sharing framework that enables Internet access providers to delegate (a part of) a client application from a handheld device to idle resources in the LAN, in a transparent way for the end-user. The key component is the resource sharing service, hosted on the <b>LAN</b> <b>gateway,</b> which can be remotely queried and managed by the Internet access provider. The service includes a battery model to predict the remaining battery lifetime. We describe the concept of resource-sharing-as-a-service that allows users of handheld devices to subscribe to the resource sharing service. In a proof-of-concept, we evaluate the delay to offload a client application to an idle computer and study the impact on battery autonomy {{as a function of the}} CPU cycles that can be offloaded...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{internet}} and web applications rely on interactions among remote host computers connected by heterogeneous networks (different <b>LANs,</b> <b>gateways,</b> WANs, MANs, etc.). Simulation modelling such networks is of great importance to the web application designer to predict, at design time, performance metrics such as the end-to-end delay between hosts, which is dramatically increased by the various mechanisms necessary to deal with heterogeneity (protocol conversion, packet fragmentation and re-assembly, flow control, etc.). On the other hand, producing a simulation model of web interactions is a non-trivial task because of the great importance of the software aspects. It is thus necessary to provide general model production guidelines which can be then tailored and applied to specific simulation languages or packages.

The performance of these protocols is, however, not easy to characterize or to analyze. This research determines probability density functions for the latency to message delivery for the Totem multicast protocols, which provide reliable totally ordered delivery of multicast messages across single and multiple local-area networks (LANs). Totem uses a logical token-passing ring on each <b>LAN</b> with <b>gateways</b> that forward messages selectively between LANs. Comparing the performance of single-ring, two-ring and four-ring networks shows that, with message filtering in the gateways, multiple-ring networks can achieve lower mean latency, less variability in the latency, and shorter tails of the latency distribution than an equivalent single-ring network. 1 Introduction Distributed systems replicate not only processing but also information.

We identify two critical parameters, coding degree and coding distance for the coding scheme. As a case-study we implement our approach over Snoop and evaluate its performance for a WLAN. Using simulations in ns- 2, we observe that when the size of the retransmission buffer on the gateway is less than 16 packets per TCP flow, the throughput can be enhanced by up to 30 % for random losses and up to 20 % for burst losses.

This characteristic prevents MANET from operating in scenarios prepared for one-hop Wireless <b>LAN</b> where a <b>Gateway</b> is not pre-existing or configured. One possible solution to suppress this restriction is described in the mobile multi-gateway support that transfers the gateway functionalities to a MANET component that is directly connected to the edge router.

Their options cover a full spectrum that includes the utilities providing the ``last mile`` access to its customers for both generic internet access required for empowering the users as well as supporting the necessary utility applications. In one scenario the Energy utilities provide high speed NII access to both residences and industry over utility owned infrastructure in order to obtain the level off reliability they need as well as providing the infrastructure necessary to support real time energy supply and consumption management. In a second scenario, the energy utilities make use of a combination of their own infrastructure and that of existing service providers, such as cable and telecommunications companies to satisfy the same set of requirements. Either scenario can greatly increase the number of active nodes on the National Information Infrastructure (NII) and the Global Information Infrastructure (GII); and therefore have a large impact on the network.

Traditional methods of evaluating local area network performance generally refer to the network’s throughput, time delays, data rate (BIPS), or media access protocol efficiency. These measures are quite acceptable when determining point-to-point benchmark network performance but do {{not take into account}} the more global man-machine performance issues associated with people using network systems to perform tasks and execute functions concurrently within a ‘qotal systems ” context. This paper experimentally compares differences in human productivity/efficiency while using: 1) an existing data gathering system consisting of several geographically distributed, unconnected, and disparate mainframes; and 2) a prototype Intelligent Gateway (Local Area Network) connecting mainframes and offering the user less complexity in procedure execution and an easy to use interface.

The following paper will present the problem of multi-network broadcasting and our motivation for solving this problem which is in the context of developing a distributed operating system. We discuss different solutions to extending a broadcast domain and why we chose the one that has been implemented. In addition, there is information on the implementation itself and some notes on its performance. It is hoped that the ideas presented here will help people in the Internet who have applications which make use of broadcasting and have come up against the limitation of only being able to broadcast within a single network. The information presented here is accurate as of the date of publication but specific details, particularly those regarding our implementation, may change in the future. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. 2. The Problem Communication between hosts on separate networks has been addressed largely through the use of Internet protocols and gateways. One aspect of internetwork communication that hasn’t been solved in the Internet is extending broadcasting to encompass two or more networks. Broadcasting is an efficient way to send information to many hosts while only having to transmit a single packet. Many of the current local area network (LAN) architectures directly support a broadcast mechanism. Unfortunately, this broadcast mechanism has a shortcoming when it is used in networking environments which include multiple <b>LANs</b> connected by <b>gateways</b> such as in the DARPA Internet. This shortcoming is that broadcasted packets are only received by hosts on the physical network on which the packet was broadcast. As a result, any application which takes advantage of LAN broadcasting can only broadcast to those hosts on its physical network. We took advantage of broadcasting in developing the Cronus Distributed Operating System [1].
