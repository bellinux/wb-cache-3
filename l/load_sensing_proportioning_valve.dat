50|$|During the {{production}} {{life of the}} Comanche, six different transmissions were offered, manufactured by Aisin, Chrysler, and Peugeot. Aisin provided the AX-4 (four-speed), AX-5 and AX-15 (five-speed overdrive) manual transmissions, along with the AW-4 four-speed automatic that was used beginning in 1987. This is the same Warner transmission used in early- to mid-1990s Toyota 4Runners with the 3.0 and some 22re 4wd. The AX-15 was phased in to replace the Peugeot BA-10/5 five-speed {{that had been used}} from 1987 until mid-1989 behind the 4.0 L I6 engine. The Comanche came equipped with a weight <b>sensing</b> rear brake <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{variable}} displacement axial piston pump with Pressure compensator and <b>Load</b> <b>Sensing</b> control is coupled to a diesel engine. The pump {{is in an}} open circuit topology for load control in a typical excavator, skid-steer or front loader circuit. The active torque generated by the engine is subject to overloads, due to uncontrolled priority and sum of torque requests from hydrostatic transmission, implements and upper-structure control. In order to avoid engine overload a third 2 ways proportional valve {{is added to the}} control circuit. The valve controls the delivery pressure on the <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> valve port, and the pressure is managed by an electronic system. This circuit architecture allow the designer to use the valve as a variable <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> system, modifying the <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> differential pressure depending on working conditions. The control must be in real time and a feed forward control based on the valve characteristic map is useful and helpful but a feedback control is needed to correct the steady state error; a PID and a Sliding mode are superimposed, in order to react to high dynamic transient.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{some aspects}} of an ongoing research on a commercial compact excavator. The interest {{is focused on the}} analysis and modelling of the whole hydraulic circuit that, beside a <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> variable displacement pump, features a stack of nine proportional directional control valves modules of which seven are of the <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> type. <b>Loads</b> being <b>sensed</b> are the boom swing, boom, stick and bucket, right and left track motors and work tools; instead, the blade and the turret swing users do not contribute to the <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> signal. Of specific interest are the peculiarities that were observed in the stack. In fact, to develop an accurate AMESim modelling, the stack was dismantled and all modules analysed and represented in a CAD environment as 3 D parts. The <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> flow generation unit was replaced on the vehicle by another one whose analysis and modelling have been developed using available design and experimental data. Although both the Hydraulic Component Design library as well as the Planar Mechanical library were used extensively in the process of modelling the entire circuit, some simplifications became necessary and are detailed in the paper. As the modelling phase was developing, a number of field experiments on the vehicle were also performed: these served the purpose of providing reference data to the end of progressing with the validation phase of the AMESim model. Regarding predictive simulation results, these are appropriately consistent with gathered experimental outcomes. The AMESim model will be instrumental for upcoming analyses that foresee the substitution of the original stack with other <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> post-compensated modules so to assess with reasonable confidence the effects on potential energy savings...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{innovative}} working hydraulic systems for mobile machines. Flow control systems are studied {{as an alternative}} to <b>load</b> <b>sensing.</b> The fundamental difference is that the pump is controlled based on the operator‚Äôs command signals rather than feedback signals from the loads. This control approach enables higher energy efficiency and there is no load pressure feedback causing stability issues. Experimental results show a reduced pump pressure margin and energy saving potential for a wheel loader application. The damping contribution from the inlet and outlet orifice in directional valves is studied. Design rules are developed and verified by experiments. A novel system architecture is proposed where flow control, <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> and open-centre are merged into a generalized system description. The proposed system is configurable and the operator can realize the characteristics of any of the standard systems without compromising energy efficiency. This can be done non-discretely on-the-fly.
