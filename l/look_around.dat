5|$|Tauranac, an {{engineer}} at heart, {{started to feel}} his Formula One budget of around £100,000 was a gamble he {{could not afford to}} take on his own and began to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> for an experienced business partner. He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman Bernie Ecclestone, Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the Connaught team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining idle to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive cursor. The cursor changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, {{and can be used}} to talk to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, <b>look</b> <b>around</b> the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking {{on the edge of the}} screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.|$|E

5|$|Ward helps Quatermass and Fowler gain {{entry to}} the plant and they find that Dillon has been {{discharged}} from the infirmary and has left. They then <b>look</b> <b>around</b> and discover that gases are pumped to the giant pressure domes from the pilot plant: ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen and methane, as opposed to oxygen as in Quatermass' moonbase pressure dome idea. Meanwhile, the guards intimidate and then murder a family who were having a picnic nearby. Back at the plant, Ward slips away to look inside a dome, and Quatermass and Fowler find him stumbling out of it dying and covered in black slime, which before his death Ward reveals was inside the dome instead of food. Fowler and Quatermass escape back to the Rocket Group and analyse Ward's tie with Leo and Paula, finding that the slime is a corrosive, poisonous substance, fatal to all forms of life on Earth. Meanwhile, the asteroid is approaching its near point.|$|E
5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a <b>look</b> <b>around</b> before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end up doing so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E

25|$|Some salticid {{species are}} {{continually}} on the move, stopping periodically to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> for prey, which they then stalk immediately. Others {{spend more time}} scanning their surroundings from one position, actively stalking any prey they detect. Members of the genus Phaeacius take that strategy to extremes; they sit on a tree trunk, facing downwards and rarely do any stalking, but simply lunge down on any prey items that pass close before them.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the German commanders were {{finalising}} {{their plans}} for Operation Grünpfeil (Green Arrows) to invade the islands with assault troops, a German Dornier Do 17 pilot decided to land on 30 June at Guernsey airport and have a <b>look</b> <b>around.</b> He returned to France and notified his superiors that the island appeared to be undefended. More aircraft were sent over. A Junkers Ju 52 landed, and the Germans were given a note {{by the head of}} the police confirming the islands were not defended. The next day, aircraft brought German troops to both islands: the occupation had begun.|$|E

25|$|The head tracker {{registers}} {{the translation}} and {{rotation of the}} user's head. Pointman uses these inputs to map {{the movements of the}} user's head and torso one-for-one to those of his avatar. The virtual view changes as the user turns his head to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> or leans his torso in any direction. When the weapon is raised into an aim position its sights remain centered in the field of view, so that turning the head also adjusts the aim. The user can aim as precisely as he can hold his head on target. Hunching the head down by flexing the spine is also registered by the head's translation, and the avatar adopts a matching posture. Leaning forward and hunching are used to duck behind cover. Rising up and leaning to the side are used to look out and shoot from behind cover.|$|E
25|$|The game uses a basic point-and-click {{interface}} to {{move the}} player around and manipulate the game world. Within each screen, the player is free to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> 360 degrees. As the player moves the cursor around the screen it can change into different styles depending on the situation; neutral cursor (no interaction is possible), an arrow (the player can move in the direction indicated), a mouth (the player can speak to the character over whom the option appears), an eye (an area or object can be examined in more detail), a magnifying glass (an object contains important information which needs closer examination), a hand (the player can take the object), a cog (the player must use an inventory item to initiate interaction with the object), a cog with red line (the player is attempting to use the wrong inventory item to initiate interaction), a left-right horizontal arrow (the object can be moved left and right), an up-down vertical arrow (the object can be moved up and down), a circular arrow (the object can be rotated).|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} {{different}} outcomes has been proposed, and new theories {{continue to be}} put forward. Most views have the two carrying two cylinders of oxygen each, reaching and climbing either the First or Second Step, where they are seen by Odell. At this point {{there are two main}} alternatives: either Mallory takes Irvine's oxygen and goes on alone (and may or may not reach the summit); or both go on together until they turn back (having used up their oxygen, or realising that they will do so before the summit). In either case Mallory slips and falls to his death while descending, perhaps caught in the fierce snow squall that sent Odell to take shelter in their tent. Irvine either falls with him or, in the first scenario, dies alone of exhaustion and hypothermia high up on the ridge. The theory advanced by Tom Holzel in February 2008 is that Odell sighted Mallory and Irvine climbing the First Step for a final <b>look</b> <b>around</b> while they were descending from a failed summit bid.|$|E

25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. <b>Look</b> <b>around</b> you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E
