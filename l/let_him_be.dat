Aoto explains that his men found the incense burner in the river, and intend to return it to its rightful owners. Relieved, Daemon resolves to ask to be arrested, but Aoto generously offers to instead <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>be</b> {{at least until the}} end of the memorial service of the late shogun; Daemon promises to turn himself in later in the day, and leaves.|$|E
25|$|The AWA was {{no longer}} the top {{promotion}} after the WWWF rejoined the NWA. The AWA reached new heights, however, after powerhouse wrestler Hulk Hogan gained nationwide attention from starring in Rocky III, and became a solid fan favorite. Despite Hogan being the AWA's top draw, Gagne would not <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>be</b> champion, believing technical wrestlers, like him and Nick Bockwinkel, should be the focus of a wrestling company. Since founding the AWA, Gagne had built the company off of technical wrestling. Hogan left in 1983, irreparably damaging the AWA.|$|E
25|$|Msiri's capital Bunkeya and {{surrounding}} villages had a population estimated at 60,000–80,000 in 1891. A year after Msiri's death, it was 10,000–20,000. In {{that part of}} Africa people disperse into the bush when threatened. For instance, David Livingstone reported twenty years earlier that Mwata Kazembe VIII Chinkonkole Kafuti so tyrannised his people that many had moved away, and he could muster scarcely 1000 men. Continuing the contrast with Msiri, when the assassins sent by Msiri and Tippu Tib advanced on his boma, Chinkonkole Kafuti’s people did not warn him, but <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>be</b> taken by surprise.|$|E

25|$|The Socialist Party, however, {{refused to}} condemn the McNamara brothers, arguing that their actions were {{justified}} {{in view of the}} supposed employer- and state-sponsored terror their union had faced for the last 25 years. Haywood and Debs echoed that sentiment. Wrote Debs:It is easy enough for a gentleman of education and refinement to sit at his typewriter and point out the crimes of the workers. But <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>be</b> one of them himself, reared in hard poverty, denied education, thrown into the brute struggle for existence from childhood, oppressed, exploited, forced to strike, clubbed by the police, jailed while his family is evicted, and his wife and children are hungry, and he will hesitate {{to condemn the}}se as criminals who fight against the crimes of which they are the victims of such savage methods as have been forced upon them by their masters.|$|E
25|$|Born in Kanagawa Prefecture in September of {{the first}} year of Bunkyū (1861), Sōjirō is an illegitimate child who was badly mistreated by his father's family {{to the point of being}} beaten for faltering in his tasks. To build a {{tolerance}} to the beatings, Sōjirō put on a smiling face as his tormenters decide to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>be.</b> One night, at age eight, Sōjirō witnessed the recently scarred Makoto Shishio killing two police officers and was spared due to the criminal seeing the boy's smile. While secretly feeding Shishio and providing him with bandages, Sōjirō takes the man's ideals to heart while receiving a wakizashi. When his family learned that he is harboring Shishio and decide to murder the child and pin the blame on the fugitive, Sōjirō uses the wakizashi Shishio gave him to slaughter his family. Soon after, once Shishio's wounds are healed, Sōjirō travels with him as his right hand and member of the Jupongatana.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>be</b> informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{reported}} cases may be myths, or wandering stories. The 1326 Hennegau case, for example, deviates from the others in that the Jew was not a thief, but was suspected (even {{though he was a}} convert to Christianity) of having struck an al fresco painting of Virgin Mary, so that blood had begun to seep down the wall from the painting. Even under all degrees of judicial torture, the Jew denied performing this sacrilegious act, and was therefore exonerated. Then a brawny smith demanded from him a trial by combat, because, supposedly, in a dream the Virgin herself had besought the smith to do so. The court accepted the smith's challenge, he easily won the combat against the Jew, who was duly hanged up by the feet between two dogs. To add to the injury, one <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>be</b> slowly roasted as well as hanged. This is a very similar story to one told in France, in which a young Jew threw a lance {{at the head of a}} statue of the Virgin, so that blood spurted out of it. There was inadequate evidence for a normal trial, but a frail old man asked for trial by combat, and bested the young Jew. The Jew confessed his crime, and was hanged by his feet between two mastiffs.|$|E

[...] Duchovny had previously acted alongside another real-life girlfriend, Maggie Wheeler, in the first season episode [...] "Born Again". Gillian Anderson is absent from the episode as she was on leave to give birth to her daughter Piper at the time. This episode was the first in which Scully did not appear.|$|E

500|$|Victoria was {{exceedingly}} {{protective of}} her son Vladimir, upon whom her {{hopes for the future}} rested. She would not let him attend school because she was worried about his safety, and because she wanted him to be brought up as Romanov grand dukes were prior to the revolution. Instead, she hired a tutor for him. She also refused to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>be</b> educated for a future career. In return for her devotion, Vladimir loved and respected his mother. [...] "We adored our parents and their love for us was infinite," [...] Vladimir wrote after their deaths.

500|$|The {{first known}} mention {{of this disease}} is from a 1700 BC Egyptian papyrus, which advises: “... Thou shouldest give a recipe, an {{ointment}} of great protection; acacia leaves, ground, titurated and cooked together. Smear a strip of fine linen there-with {{and place in the}} anus, that he recovers immediately." [...] In 460 BC, the Hippocratic corpus discusses a treatment similar to modern rubber band ligation: [...] "And hemorrhoids in like manner you may treat by transfixing them with a needle and tying them with very thick and woolen thread, for application, and do not foment until they drop off, and always leave one behind; and when the patient recovers, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>be</b> put on a course of Hellebore." [...] Hemorrhoids may have been described in the Bible, with earlier English translations using the now-obsolete spelling [...] "emerods".|$|E
500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>be</b> a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E
