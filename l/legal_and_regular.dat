6000|$|But {{there was}} another great reason which should have induced him to do this. One great lawyer, known to many of your Lordships, Mr. Sayer, a very honest, {{intelligent}} man, who had long served the Company and well knew their affairs, had given an opinion concerning Mr. Hastings's conduct in stopping these prosecutions. There was an abstract question put to Mr. Sayer, and other great lawyers, separated {{from many of the}} circumstances of this business, concerning a point which incidentally arose; and this was, whether Mr. Hastings, as Governor-General, had a power so to dissolve the Council, that, if he declared it dissolved, they could not sit and do any <b>legal</b> <b>and</b> <b>regular</b> act. It was a great question with the lawyers at the time, and there was a difference of opinion on it. Mr. Sayer {{was one of those who}} were inclined to be of opinion that the Governor-General had a power of dissolving the Council, and that the Council could not legally sit after such dissolution. But what was his remark upon Mr. Hastings's conduct?--and you must suppose his remark of more weight, because, upon the abstract question, he had given his opinion in favor of Mr. Hastings's judgment. [...] "The meeting of the Council depends on the pleasure of the Governor; and I think the duration of it must do so, too. But it was as great a crime to dissolve the Council upon base and sinister motives as it would be to assume the power of dissolving, if he had it not. I believe he is the first Governor that ever dissolved a Council inquiring into his behavior, when he was innocent. Before he could summon three Councils and dissolve them, he had time fully to consider what would be the result of such conduct, to convince everybody, beyond a doubt, of his conscious guilt." ...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the rebirth}} of -calculus in the late sixties, three major {{theoretical}} investigations of fi-reduction were undertaken: 1) L'evy's analysis of families of redexes (and the associated concept of labeled reductions); 2) Lamping's graph-reduction algorithm; 3) Girard 's geometry of interaction.

Now, these three different notions stand in no obvious relation at first sight. In this paper we prove they are equivalent. 1 Introduction Let us first survey the three different notions of paths which we want to prove are equivalent. L'evy took hold in [12] of the difficult notion of two redexes being created in the "same" way during a reduction (in which case they were said to belong to the same "family"). Then he labeled terms and made beta reductions act on labels so that two redexes were in the same family iff they had the same [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Esta pesquisa tem o objetivo de avaliar o grau de convergência entre as normas contábeis emitidas pela China e as normas internacionais do IASB (International Accounting Standard Board). Para que fosse concebida, foi necessário identificar e descrever as divisões importantes no processo de reforma econômica da República Popular da China; analisar o ambiente legal e regulamentar, bem como a evolução da educação e da profissão contábil e sua influência na edição de normas contábeis; identificar os principais órgãos normatizadores da contabilidade e suas principais funções exercidas e comparar os padrões locais e os internacionais, com a finalidade de verificar a harmonia dos resultados sob as normas contábeis da China e as internacionais editadas pelo IASB. Para efetuar a comparação, foram utilizadas as reconciliações do lucro líquido divulgado pelas empresas que tem ações do tipo B negociadas na Bolsa de Valores de Shenzhen, sendo obtidas as reconciliações em conformidade com os padrões internacionais de contabilidade editados pelo IASB. Assim, utilizou-se um indicador de conservadorismo” que serviu de parâmetro para comparabilidade dos resultados obtidos pelos padrões locais e internacionais. Conforme verificado na comparação de padrões, as normas chinesas apresentam divergências quando comparadas aos padrões do IASB. Entretanto, para confirmar estas divergências, o indicador de “conservadorismo” ratificou ou não a aderência da convergência às normas internacionais. Este indicador mostrou que a amostra das empresas pesquisadas, quando utilizam as normas chinesas, resulta em um lucro mais conservador em relação ao resultado reconciliado com os padrões internacionais editados pelo IASB. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis {{research}} has as objective to evaluate degree of convergence between the accounting standards emitted by China and the International IASB's standards International Standard Accounting Board). For {{this to be}} conceived, {{it was necessary to}} identify and to describe the striking divisions that were important in the process of economic reform of Popular Republic of China; it was also necessary to analyze the <b>legal</b> <b>and</b> <b>regular</b> atmosphere, as well as the evolution of education and of the accounting profession and its influence in the edition of accounting standards; besides, it was necessary to identify the main normative accounting bodies and its main exercised functions; and was necessary to compare the local and international patterns with the purpose of verifying the harmony of the results under the China's accounting standards and the international ones published by IASB. The reconciliations of the net profit disclosed by companies that have type B stocks traded in the Shenzhen's stock exchange were used to make the comparison. The reconciliations in conformity with the international standards of accounting published by IASB were then obtained. Thus, it was used an indicator of "conservatism" that served as parameter for the comparability of the results obtained by the local and international patterns. As verified in the comparison of standards, the Chinese one present divergences when compared with IASB's patterns. However, to confirm these divergences, the indicator of "conservatism" ratified, or not, the adherence of the convergence to the international standards. This indicator showed that the sample of the researched companies, when adopted the Chinese norms, result in a more conservative profit in relation to the result reconciled with the international standards published by IASB...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Challenges to {{recruitment}} of Latinos in health research may include language, cultural and communication barriers, trust issues, heterogeneity of <b>legal</b> status, <b>and</b> a high percent of uninsured {{when compared to}} the US population. This paper highlights the community-based participatory research (CBPR) process and expands on the applicability of these principles to Latino communities. METHODS: We review steps taken and describe lessons learned in using a participatory approach to broadly assess and address the health of urban-dwelling Latinos in Baltimore, Maryland, through the adaptation of CBPR principles. FINDINGS: We identified health priorities, access barriers, and community resources (eg, Latin American trained nurses who were not currently working in the health field, immigrant networks) using a participatory approach. Suggestions for improving trust, research participation, and access to care ranged from not collecting data on <b>legal</b> status, <b>and</b> <b>regular</b> attendance <b>and</b> presentations of ongoing research at community provider meetings, to referral to free or low-cost health care services at screening events. CONCLUSION: Despite growing interest in CBPR, limited guidance exists on how to apply CBPR principles to conduct health research among Latinos. Incorporating a participatory process can help address Latino community concerns, enrich quality and relevance of research, and empower community members...|$|R

She allows Rhage to be with his human because Mary will never hold [...] "flesh of her own flesh" [...] and thinks that this is sacrifice enough.
