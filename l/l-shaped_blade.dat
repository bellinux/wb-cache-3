50|$|The powered {{rotary hoe}} {{was invented by}} Arthur Clifford Howard who, in 1912, began experimenting with rotary tillage on his father's farm at Gilgandra, New South Wales, Australia. Initially using his father's steam tractor engine as a power source, he found that ground could be {{mechanically}} tilled without soil-packing occurring, {{as was the case}} with normal ploughing. His earliest designs threw the tilled soil sideways, until he improved his invention by designing an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>blade</b> mounted on widely spaced flanges fixed to a small-diameter rotor. With fellow apprentice Everard McCleary, he established a company to make his machine, but plans were interrupted by World War I. In 1919 Howard returned to Australia and resumed his design work, patenting a design with 5 rotary hoe cultivator blades and an internal combustion engine in 1920.|$|E
5000|$|The crack weeder is a {{relative}} of the Cape Cod Weeder. It is designed to scrape out weeds growing in crevices, stone walls and other deep and narrow places. The plane of the <b>L-shaped</b> scraping <b>blade</b> includes the handle; {{the bottom of the}} [...] "L" [...] is parallel to it.|$|R
25|$|All NEMA 14 devices offer two hots, a neutral, and a ground, {{allowing}} for both 120 and 240V when supplied by split-phase power, or 120 and 208V if the supply is three-phase. The 14-30 has {{a rating of}} 30A, and an <b>L-shaped</b> neutral <b>blade.</b> The 14-50 has a rating of 50A, and a straight neutral blade sized {{so that it does}} not mate with 14-30 connectors.|$|R
25|$|A 30A, 4-wire {{single-phase}} grounding socket {{is often}} used for electric clothes dryers. 240 volts from the split phase system {{is used for the}} heating elements, and the motor and controls run on 120 volts. These plugs have blades that are rather larger than NEMA 5-20, are more widely spaced, and are angled so as to prevent using the wrong plug in the wrong circuit. These plugs have <b>L-shaped</b> neutral <b>blades</b> that will not fit in a NEMA 14-50 receptacle.|$|R
2500|$|Compared to the 5-15P plug, the 5-20P plug has {{the neutral}} blade rotated 90° and shifted so its inner edge is {{approximately}} [...] {{from the hot}} blade. The 5-20R receptacle has a T-shaped neutral hole, to accept both 5-15P and 5-20P plugs. An acceptable alternative version of the 5-20R receptacle has a rectangular slot that will only accept 5-20P plugs. The 5-30 and 5-50 are physically larger, with [...] between power pins; 5-30 also has an <b>L-shaped</b> neutral <b>blade.</b> These larger sizes are uncommon, as twist-locking plugs are generally used for high-current applications.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} element of the army is the chariot, of which four types were found. In battle the fighting chariots formed pairs {{at the head of}} a unit of infantry. The principal weapon of the charioteers was the ge or dagger-axe, an <b>L-shaped</b> bronze <b>blade</b> mounted on a long shaft and used for sweeping and hooking at the enemy. Infantrymen also carried ge on shorter shafts, ji or halberds and spears and lances. For close fighting and defence, both charioteers and infantrymen carried double-edged straight swords. The archers carried crossbows, with sophisticated trigger mechanisms, capable of shooting arrows farther than 800 m.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop an}} analytical model {{that is capable of}} predicting the torque requirements of a rotavator fitted with commercially available <b>L-shaped</b> <b>blades.</b> An analytical approach based on the limit equilibrium analysis was used to develop the proposed model. The proposed model was verified by comparing the model and measured torque requirements at predetermined rotavator blade angular positions from the horizontal for a down-cut rotavator. The study findings indicated that there was an optimum set tillage depth for each rotavator configuration and operational conditions at which the resultant horizontal thrust generated was greatest. This unique depth was influenced by the bite length. The validation of the proposed model showed that the predicted and measured torque requirements, at different angular blade positions from the horizontal, correlated reasonably well for all the set tillage depths. As the depth of tillage increased, however, the curve for the measured torque requirements exhibited a cyclic behaviour after the peak torque requirements value had been recorded. The cyclic behaviour was probably due to the re-tilling and the instability of the tool-frame carrier, which increased with the set tillage depth. The knowledge contributed by this research will afford the designers of active tillage tools {{a better understanding of the}} operations of the rotavator, particularly in deep tillage. The modelling approach, and instrumentation technique used in this research, can be extended to analyze the performance of rotavators fitted with other types of commercial blades.

40|$|Introduction Recently, {{employment}} of rotary tillers has been expanded in gardens and small farms, {{especially in the}} northern of Iran. However using the <b>L-shaped</b> <b>blades</b> in the conventional rotary tillers have some problems such as severe vibration problems, weeds stucking around the blades, forming the plow pan and lower performance due to the less powers of such small rototillers. Therefore in order to overcome the above mentioned problems, a rototiller with new ridged blades was designed, fabricated and tested in this research. Materials and Methods Experiments were carried out {{in one of the}} citrus orchards in Mazandaran, Sari. The experimental design was split plots based on randomized complete block design with three replications. The soil moisture as main plot varied in two levels of 13. 5 - 21. 9 and 21. 9 - 30. 3 percent based on dry weight and the rotational speed of blades as subplots varied in three levels of 140 - 170, 170 - 200 and 200 - 230 rpm. The measured parameters consist of soil particle mean weight diameter, soil bulk density, soil crumbling percentage, specific fuel consumption and machine efficiency. The diameter of soil particles was measured using a set of standard sieves with diameter ranging from 0. 5 to 8 mm. Then a laboratory shaker was used to sift the samples. Each sample was shaken in 30 sec. The fuel consumption during the experiments was determined by the filled fuel tank method. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean comparisons and interaction between the parameters were performed using the SPSS 16 software. Results and Discussion The results indicated that the soil particle mean weight diameter reduced by increasing blades rotational speed in both examined soil moisture contents. Results indicated that the soil crumbling percent increases with increasing the rotational speed. The main reason for this effect could be due to the more energy transferring to the soil at higher rotational speeds, which result in further crumbling of the soil slices. Regarding the results obtained in this study, the specific fuel consumption increased at first in a light slope, then in a steep rise with increasing the blades rotational speed. The reason can be the higher crumbling percent of the soil at higher rotational speeds and higher soil moisture contents (at the range of 21. 9 - 30. 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{tetrapod}} Caerorhachis bairdi, {{probably from}} the Pendleian Limestone Coal Group in the Scottish Midland Valley, is redi agnosed and redescribed, and its affinities are discussed. Caerorachis was originally {{interpreted as a}} temnospondyl amphibian, based on characters that are now regarded as primitive for tetrapods, or of uncertain polarity. Several features of Caerorhachis (e. g. gastrocentrous vertebrae, curved trunk ribs, reduced dorsal iliac <b>blade,</b> <b>L-shaped</b> tarsal intermedium) are observed in certain primitive amniotes. In particular, Caerorhachis resembles ‘anthracosaurs’, {{generally considered to be}} among the most primitive of stem-group amniotes. The phylogenetic position of Caerorhachis is considered in the light of recently published cladistic analyses of Palaeozoic tetrapods. Most analyses place Caerorhachis at the base of, or within, ‘anthra- cosaurs’. When multiple, equally parsimonious solutions are found, its ‘anthracosaur’ affinities are shown in at least some trees, and are supported by several informative and, generally, highly consistent characters. Alternative phylogenetic placements (e. g. sister taxon to temnospondyls) are usually less well corroborated. If the fundamental evolutionary split of most early tetrapods into stem-group lissamphibians (e. g. temnospondyl s) and stem-group amniotes (e. g. ‘anthracosaurs’) is accepted, then the revised interpretation of Caerorhachi s sheds light on near-ancestral conditions for Amniota...|$|R
