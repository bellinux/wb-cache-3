5000|$|In Mac OS System 7 and later, an alias {{is a small}} {{file that}} {{represents}} another object in a <b>local,</b> <b>remote,</b> or removable file system and provides a dynamic link to it; the target object may be moved or renamed, and the alias will still link to it (unless the original file is recreated; such an alias is ambiguous {{and how it is}} resolved depends on the version of macOS).

50|$|Depending {{upon the}} application, the alarm output may be <b>local,</b> <b>remote</b> or a combination. Local alarms {{do not include}} monitoring, though may include indoor and/or outdoor {{sounders}} (e.g. motorized bell or electronic siren) and lights (e.g. strobe light) which may be useful for signaling an evacuation notice for people during fire alarms, or where one hopes to scare off an amateur burglar quickly. However, with {{the widespread use of}} alarm systems (especially in cars), false alarms are very frequent and many urbanites tend to ignore alarms rather than investigating, let alone contacting the necessary authorities. In short, there may be no response at all. In rural areas where nobody may hear the fire bell or burglar siren, lights or sounds may not make much difference, as the nearest emergency responders may arrive too late to avoid losses.|$|E

E xponential advances in sensors, storage systems, and computers are producing data of unprecedented quantity and quality. Multi-terabyte and even petabyte (1, 000 TB) data sets are emerging as major assets. For example, the climate science community has access to hundreds of terabytes of observational data from NASA’s Earth-observing system and simulation data from high-performance climate models; these data sources can yield new insights into global change. The World-Wide Telescope linking hundreds of digital sky surveys is revolutionizing astronomy [11].

40|$|International audienceThe article {{discusses}} uniform transparent {{access to}} objects, be they <b>local,</b> <b>remote,</b> persistent, or mobile. In this way, the authors facilitate distributed programming and persistence management. An object (the target) is accessed through a reference. A reference retains its meaning {{as it is}} copied, stored, passed in messages, and as the target migrates. A reference is used to invoke a procedure (or method) of the target object. References support standard single-space targets, as well as fragmented objects. The cost of using {{a reference to a}} local object is comparable to the cost of accessing the object through a pointer. In the implementation, a reference is a chain of links. Each link embodies a small piece of functionality. A chain may be composed of an arbitrary number of link...|$|E
40|$|Existing Grid {{workflow}} tools {{assume that}} individual components either communicate by passing files from one application to another, or are explicitly linked using interprocess communication pipes. When files are used {{it is usually}} difficult to overlap reader and write execution. On the other hand, interprocess communication primitives are invasive and require substantial modification to existing code. We have built a library, called GriddLeS, that combines the advantages of both approaches without any changes to the application code. GriddLeS overloads conventional file IO operations, and supports either <b>local,</b> <b>remote</b> or replicated file access, or direct communication over pipes. In this paper we discuss how GriddLeS can be combined with workflow packages and show how flexible and powerful virtual applications can be constructed rapidly. A large atmospheric science case study is discussed. ...|$|E
