40|$|ABSTRACT Resting {{metabolic}} rate (RMR) {{was measured in}} male DeKalb 231 X Cornell White <b>Leghorns</b> and Ross X Arbor Acre broiler chicks 0 — 8 weeks-of-age in a modified Haldane apparatus. Chicks were fed a broiler starter diet containing 22 % protein and 3234 kcal/kg metabolizable energy (ME). All determinations were conducted between 0800 and 1200 hr. Feed and water were available ad libitum and lighting was continuous. Metabolic rate (kcal/bird per day) was plotted against body weight for the entire 8 -week period and results were analyzed using analysis of covariance. RMR in both broilers and <b>Leghorns</b> was best described by the equation Y = 137. 87 W- 77 where Y equals kcal/bird-day and W equals weight in kg. RMR of <b>Leghorns</b> was 23 % higher over the entire 8 -week period. The RMR of broilers was 30 % higher than their BMR for week 1 and averaged 18 % higher over the entire 8 -week period. Body composition and gut content were determined on broilers and <b>Leghorns</b> at weekly intervals for 8 weeks. Body weight of birds used to determine RMR were then corrected for percent fat, moisture, ash, protein, and gut content. Corrected body weights were plotted against RMR to determine which body component was {{the best predictor of}} {{metabolic rate}}. As the body weight was reduced by correcting for the various components, the slope changed little, while the constant of proportionality increased.

40|$|WHEN {{artificial}} selection is sus-pended in a selection program {{the mean of}} the population may shift depend-ing upon the relationship of the observed trait with fitness and the effectiveness of natural selection in changing components of fitness such as egg production, fertility, hatchability, and viability. Lerner (1950) has discussed possible reasons for the decline of the population mean of previously selected traits when selection is relaxed. When selection for chicken shank length was suspended, hatchability increased but when selection was resumed, hatchability declined (Lerner, 1958). Moultrie et al. (1956) studied relaxed selection for three genera-tions in a strain of disease-resistant White <b>Leghorns.</b> They observed a rise in leukosis mortality in the first generation which was sustained in the two succeeding gen-erations. Shoffner and Grant (1960) re-laxed the selection of <b>Leghorns</b> developed for egg production and found little if any decrease in egg production, hen housed viability, hatchability and eight-week body weight.

5|$|Modeste and Impérieuse were {{high-quality}} modern {{ships and}} were both immediately recommissioned into the Royal Navy, Modeste {{with the same}} name and Impérieuse as HMS Unite as there was already a ship with a similar name in service. The repercussions of this operation were severe however. Gell, acting on instructions from Hood, had violated Genoese neutrality in a deliberate attempt to intimidate the pro-Republican faction in the city, but their actions were readily seized upon by French propagandists such as Nicolas Ozanne, who portrayed the raid as a massacre of unarmed sailors in print form. The Genoese government broke off diplomatic relations with Britain, permitting only French ships to enter the harbour. The British instituted a blockade, {{and as a result}} the 5,000 Austrian reinforcements destined for Toulon were unable to embark. Drake and all British inhabitants of Genoa were expelled, and Gell initiated a blockade of the city, seizing neutral merchant shipping destined for the port. Three ships were stationed at <b>Leghorn</b> to watch the more quiescent Tuscan government, including the Royalist Scipion. On 26 November, Scipion, which was carrying 150 prisoners taken in the raid on Genoa, caught fire, possibly the result of arson, and was destroyed, although other accounts suggest that a barrel of brandy was ignited accidentally by a candle. The blaze killed 390 of the Royalist crew, many of whom were classed as unfit for duty.|$|E

On 27 December 1796 he resumed command of the Mantua siege corps, replacing Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine who had also become ill. The corps consisted of 10,000 men in two divisions under Thomas-Alexandre Dumas and Claude Dallemagne. On 14–15 January 1797 Bonaparte defeated József Alvinczi in the Battle of Rivoli, inflicting terrible losses on the Austrians. Meanwhile, a relief column under Giovanni Marchese di Provera reached the north side of Mantua and on 16 January there was a battle. The Mantua garrison launched a sortie led by Karl Philipp Sebottendorf that made progress at first but was beaten back by reinforcements under Claude Perrin Victor. At the same time, Sérurier and 1,500 troops at La Favorita Palace blocked Provera from joining the garrison. By noon Provera was hemmed in by French reinforcements and at 2:00 pm he surrendered to Sérurier with 7,000 men, 22 field guns, a pontoon train and a food convoy. Afterward, Sérurier got into a dispute with Dumas, who had commanded armies but was now a mere division commander. Angry that his contributions were not recognized, Dumas sent an abusive note to the army chief of staff Louis-Alexandre Berthier and was demoted by Bonaparte. On 30 January, Wurmser began negotiations with Sérurier for the capitulation of Mantua; this was signed on 2 February 1797 by the two generals. The articles permitted Wurmser, his staff, his generals, 700 soldiers and six artillery pieces to go free, but 16,324 men of the garrison became prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|In May 1793, Nelson sailed {{as part of}} a {{division}} under the command of Vice Admiral William Hotham, joined later in the month by the rest of Lord Hood's fleet. The force initially sailed to Gibraltar and, with the intention of establishing naval superiority in the Mediterranean, made their way to Toulon, anchoring off the port in July. Toulon was largely under the control of moderate republicans and royalists, but was threatened by the forces of the National Convention, which were marching on the city. Short of supplies and doubting their ability to defend themselves, the city authorities requested that Hood take it under his protection. Hood readily acquiesced and sent Nelson to carry dispatches to Sardinia and Naples requesting reinforcements. After delivering the dispatches to Sardinia, Agamemnon arrived at Naples in early September. There Nelson met Ferdinand IV, King of Naples, followed by the British ambassador to the kingdom, William Hamilton. At some point during the negotiations for reinforcements, Nelson was introduced to Hamilton's new wife, Emma Hamilton. The negotiations were successful, and 2,000 men and several ships were mustered by mid-September. Nelson put to sea in pursuit of a French frigate, but on failing to catch her, sailed for <b>Leghorn,</b> and then to Corsica. He arrived at Toulon on 5 October, where he found that a large French army had occupied the hills surrounding the city and was bombarding it. Hood still hoped the city could be held if more reinforcements arrived, and sent Nelson to join a squadron operating off Cagliari.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the author (1929 a) presented data show-ing that as close inbreeding is continued in chickens hatcha-bility decreases. The kind of inbreeding practised was full-brother-and-sister and half-brother-and-sister matings. It was observed that hatchability results are affected {{to a greater}} ex-tent {{in the first year}} of such close inbreeding than in successive years, though there is a general decline in hatchability each year that such close inbreeding is continued. Similar results were secured in Barred Plymouth Rocks and "White <b>Leghorns.</b> In another paper, the author (1929 b) determined that hatcha-bility decreases as the coefficients of inbreeding increase. Since the intercrossing of highly inbred strains of corn pro-duces a remarkable state of rejuvenation, as demonstrated by Bast and Jones (1919), it was decided to determine the effect of intercrossing the inbred strains of Barred Plymouth Rocks and White <b>Leghorns.</b> Originally four pens each of the two breeds mentioned were started in the inbreeding project but in two years two pens of Barred Plymouth Rocks had practically exterminated them-selves through decreased hatchability. Two more pens of fnll-brother-and-sister and half-brother-and-sister matings, however, were started to replace the two depleted pens. In 1928 two pens of Barred Plymouth Rocks had been in-bred for three generations so that their progeny represented the fourth year of progressive full-brother-and-sister and half-brother-and-sister matings; two pens of Barred Plymouth Rocks have been likewise inbred for one generation and four pens of "White <b>Leghorns</b> had been similarly inbred hj using full-brother-and-sister and half-brother-and-sister matings for three succes-sive years.
