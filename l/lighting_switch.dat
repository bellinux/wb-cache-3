[...] By early 1942 a new large rear carrier was fitted to hold universal WD steel pannier-frames and bags. This meant repositioning the long prop stand to forward of the nearside rear wheel spindle nut. In 1943 further modifications were made including redesign of the crankcase sump shield and fitting of the Vokes high capacity air cleaner, which was a box shaped canister on top of the fuel tank and was intended to assist operations in dusty environments. [...] In early 1945 a push-button switch was introduced for the headlight and the main <b>lighting</b> <b>switch</b> relocated to a bracket beneath the offside of the saddle.|$|E

The scene breaks up and ignoring the protests of the director and Betty's mother, Bing explains that he hasn't had any letters from Betty except the one returning his ring. Betty points out that she has not received any letters from Bing either and they then realise that her mother has been withholding their letters.|$|E

2500|$|A toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is a switch, most {{commonly}} used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. The toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "click" [...] noise when a person's finger manually flips the toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> into the on/off position. The design for the toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook, New York.|$|R

To change between sets while the song was sung and create a seamless transition, instead of using a curtain, a shot of a stagehand was shown, throwing a sparking electric <b>lighting</b> <b>switch</b> which darkens one scene out and fades in another. The basic storyline was modified and reused in later Warner Bros. films such as Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933) and Painting the Clouds with Sunshine (1951).|$|E

Formajority of people, making part of traditional appliances smartand adding some of services which were not exist in traditionalhome is enough. It is called hybrid smart home. In this paper,issues on constructing a hybrid smart home in which smartelements are coexist with traditional elements are discussed andspecial attention is on electrical wirings. On constructing a newsmart home or renewing a traditional building to smart one, thewiring approach is different from traditional one. Severalconcepts for wiring about this issue are proposed anddemonstrated in this paper. First concept introduces a lightingswitch called bypass used upon malfunction of smart system toguarantee availability of lighting. Second concept discusses typeand installation of <b>lighting</b> <b>switch,</b> so that it can coexist withtraditional switch and would not cause ambiguity to inhabitants. The experience learnt from the pilot test which was conductedat an actual smart home was discussed...|$|E

5000|$|The {{switches}} may be {{single or}} multiple, designed for indoor or outdoor use. Optional extras may include dimmer-controls, environmental protection, weather and security protection. In residential and light commercial lighting systems, the <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> directly controls the circuit feeding the lamps. In larger lighting systems, for example warehouses or outdoor lighting systems, the required current {{may be too}} high for a manual switch. In these systems <b>light</b> <b>switches</b> control <b>lighting</b> contactors, a relay that allows the manual <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> to operate on a lower voltage or with smaller wiring than would be required in the main lighting circuit.|$|R
