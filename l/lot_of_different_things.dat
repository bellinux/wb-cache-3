That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things,</b> but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be.

500|$|The {{development}} {{team for}} Mega Man consisted of only six people. Inafune (credited as [...] "Inafuking") designed and illustrated {{nearly all of}} the game's characters and enemies, as well as the Japanese Rockman logo, box art, and instruction manual. He was also responsible for rendering these designs into graphical sprite form. [...] "We didn’t have [...] people, so after drawing character designs, I was actually doing the dotting (pixelation) for the Nintendo," [...] Inafune stated. [...] "Back then, people weren’t specialized and we had to do a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> because there was so few people, so I really ended up doing all the characters." [...] Inafune was influenced by the eponymous protagonist of Osamu Tezuka's manga Astro Boy in his Mega Man designs. Mega Man is colored blue due to the NES console's technical limitations: the color has the most shades in the console's limited 56-color palette, and the expanded selection was used to enhance Mega Man's detail. Although he is often credited for designing the character, Inafune insists that he [...] "only did half of the job in creating him", as his mentor developed the basic character concept before Inafune's arrival. The basic sprites for Roll and Dr. Light were created before Inafune joined the project, and the designs for Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Guts Man were in process. Aside from normal enemies, Inafune's first character was Elec Man, inspired by American comic book characters. The artist has commented that Elec Man has always been his favorite design. The designs for Dr. Light and Dr. Wily were based on Santa Claus and Albert Einstein, respectively; the latter character was meant to represent an archetypal [...] "mad scientist".|$|E

He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that have that many options with their voice. He could do a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice.

40|$|Researchers {{committed}} to the public interest work hard to avoid being ‘merely academic’. Commitment is necessary but not sufficient for making a difference, however. Any discussion of how researchers {{can make a difference}} requires a broader assessment of whether the campaigns they work on are having an impact. From a research point of view, it turns out that assessing whether and how public interest campaigns are indeed having an impact is one of the hardest challenges. After all, most of the time, progress in dealing with powerful ´elite institutions inherently takes place through partial and uneven changes. Even more problematic, advocacy impact often needs to be assessed in terms of the terrible things that actually did not happen or were avoided—damage control—and this leads one onto the slippery terrain of the ‘counter-factual’. For example, is the World Bank doing more nasty things now than it did almost two decades ago, when what {{came to be known as}} the Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) campaign first took off? If so, what would that tell us about the efficacy of the many civil society efforts to challenge the Bank’s actions? Is the World Bank doing more decent things nowadays, having adopted a very enlightened-sounding series of official policies, public discourses, and NGO partners? Could both propositions be true at the same time, because the Bank is a contradictory institution that does <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> at once, some much worse than others...|$|R

40|$|Can virtue {{be taught}} by the many? Socrates insists that the {{perfection}} of our souls is of supreme importance (Ap. 29 d- 30 a, Cr. 47 d- 48 a, Gorg. 477 e), he defines virtue as that which will make our souls good {{if it comes to}} be present (Gorg. 506 d, cf. Rep. 353 b), and he claims that, if we do not already possess virtue, then we should seek some teacher of it (La. 200 d- 201 a, Euthd. 282 a-b). We shall assume that he is basically right: that if our ultimate aim is to live well, if this requires us to know how to do so, and if we are unsure whether we already possess this know-how, then we should in the first instance seek some teacher in good living. 1 Who should it be? Not the many, according to Socrates. 2 As a general rule, and especially on matters of virtue, he asserts that we should be guided by the one with expert knowledge (assuming he exists) rather than the many, who lack such knowledge (Ap. 25 b, Cr. 47 b-d, La. 184 d- 5 a, Gorg. 459 a). Unlike other interlocutors in other dialogues, Alcibiades disagrees. Having suggested that he has learnt justice from people in general, he meets Socrates' stock assertion that '[w]hen you give the credit to "people in general", you're falling back on teachers who are no good' (Ale. 110 e 2 - 3), and he responds with the thought that the many can teach <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> If we aim to live well, this issue is of vital importance. Together with the Great Speech in the Protagoras, the ensuing discussion in the Alcibiades is the most extensive treatment in the Socratic dialogues of the competence (or otherwise) of the general public to teach virtue. Accordingly, we shall approach the issue of whether the general public can teach virtue by examining Socrates' arguments, in particular, that the Greek public did not teach Alcibiades justice...|$|R
