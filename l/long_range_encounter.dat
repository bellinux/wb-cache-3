40|$|We present exact {{results for}} various {{frustrated}} Ising models in two dimensions with periodic interactions. None of them {{gives rise to}} what could be regarded as spin glass order. The only <b>long</b> <b>range</b> orders <b>encountered</b> are of ferro- or antiferromagnetic type but the effect of frustration manifests itself at low temperature (entropy, susceptibilities). The analysis of these results provides some indications concerning {{a necessary condition for}} ordering in such systems and the possible nature of the spin glass order...|$|R
40|$|The LHC dynamic {{aperture}} in collision is constrained {{mainly by}} the beam-beam encounters, {{and by the}} field errors in the low-beta triplet quadrupoles. The nominal field errors were used and have been corrected with a local corrector scheme at each IP. The correction algorithm is explained, and the resulting dynamic aperture is shown. In the calculations, {{the effect of the}} crossing angle geometry, the beta-function, the bunch intensity and the pacman bunches on the dynamic aperture are studied. It is, however, also necessary to study how the unavoidable <b>long</b> <b>range</b> beam-beam <b>encounters</b> influence the dynamic aperture...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} main {{advantages}} {{and limitations of}} the kinetic exospheric and fluid models of the solar wind (SW). We discuss the hydrostatic model imagined by Chapman, the first supersonic hydrodynamic models published by Parker and the first generation subsonic kinetic model proposed by Chamberlain. It is shown that a correct estimation of the electric field as in the second generation kinetic exospheric models developed by Lemaire and Scherer, provides a supersonic expansion of the corona, reconciling the hydrodynamic and the kinetic approach. The third generation kinetic exospheric models considers kappa velocity distribution function (VDF) instead of a Maxwellian at the exobase and in addition they treat a non-monotonic variation of the electric potential with the radial distance; the fourth generation exospheric models include Coulomb collisions based on the Fokker [...] Planck collision term. Multi-fluid models of the solar wind provide a coarse grained description and reproduce with success the spatio-temporal variation of SW macroscopic properties (density, bulk velocity). The main categories of multi-fluid SW models are reviewed: the 5 -moment, or Euler, models, originally proposed by Parker to describe the supersonic SW expansion; the 8 -moment and 16 -moment fluid models, the gyrotropic approach with improved collision terms {{as well as the}} gyrotropic models based on observed VDFs. The outstanding problem of collisions, including the <b>long</b> <b>range</b> Coulomb <b>encounters,</b> is also discussed, both in the kinetic and multi-fluid context. Although for decades the two approaches have been seen as opposed, in this paper we emphasize their complementary. The review of the kinetic and fluid models of the solar wind contributes also to a better evaluation of the open questions still existent in SW modeling and suggests possible future developments...|$|R

40|$|Antiferromagnetic Hamiltonians with short-range, non-frustrating {{interactions}} are well-known to exhibit <b>long</b> <b>range</b> magnetic order in dimensions, d≥ 2 but exhibit only quasi <b>long</b> <b>range</b> order, with power law decay of correlations, in d= 1 (for half-integer spin). On the other hand, non-frustrating <b>long</b> <b>range</b> interactions can induce <b>long</b> <b>range</b> order in d= 1. We study Hamiltonians {{in which the}} <b>long</b> <b>range</b> interactions have an adjustable amplitude lambda, {{as well as an}} adjustable power-law 1 /|x|^α, using a combination of quantum Monte Carlo and analytic methods: spin-wave, large-N non-linear sigma model, and renormalization group methods.

40|$|<b>Long</b> <b>range</b> {{corrections}} {{are routinely}} applied to simulations of bulk ¯uids by {{assuming that the}} radial distribution function is unity beyond a certain cuto radius for pairwise interactions. Similar <b>long</b> <b>range</b> corrections for gas±solid interactions in adsorption frequently are ignored because of the anisotropic structure of the solid. However, the error associated with assuming isotropy beyond the cuto radius is small compared with {{the magnitude of the}} <b>long</b> <b>range</b> correction. The <b>long</b> <b>range</b> correction to the Henry constant for a cuto radius of 13 AÊ is 14 % for CH 4 and 70 % for SF 6 for adsorption in silicalite at 298 K.
