She {{closed her eyes}} and saw the little dining room in all the dignity of Sunday dinner, the big silver soup tureen {{catching}} the sun, the flowered china with the gilt edges, and even a glimpse of <b>lace</b> <b>paper</b> when the closet door opened; Aunt Mary and Uncle Tom, with Peter between them. And these, strangely, were the only tangible things and immutable.|$|E
60|$|Sutcliffe! No {{need to tell}} Honora what Sutcliffe was--her cousins {{had talked}} of little else during the past winter; and shown, if the truth be told, just a little commiseration for Honora. Sutcliffe {{was not only a}} famous girls' school, Sutcliffe was the world--that world which, since her {{earliest}} remembrances, she had been longing to see and know. In a desperate attempt to realize what had happened to her, she found herself staring hard at the open china closet, at Aunt Mary's best gold dinner set resting on the pink <b>lace</b> <b>paper</b> that had been changed only last week. That dinner set, somehow, was always an augury of festival--when, on the rare occasions Aunt Mary entertained, the little dining room was transformed by it and the Leffingwell silver into a glorified and altogether unrecognizable state, in which any miracle seemed possible.|$|E

The first week brought Ben a newspaper, with a crinkly line drawn round the marriages to attract {{attention}} to that spot, and one was marked by a black frame with a large hand pointing {{at it from the}} margin. Thorny sent that; but the next week came a parcel for Mrs. Moss, and in it was discovered a box of wedding cake for every member of the family, including Sancho, who ate his at one gulp, and chewed up the <b>lace</b> <b>paper</b> which covered it. This was the third week; and, as if there could not be happiness enough crowded into it for Ben, the letter he read on his way home told him that his dear mistress was coming back on the following Saturday. One passage particularly pleased him,-- ...|$|E

5000|$|... "These are {{prepared}} by putting ices {{of various kinds}} and colors into a mold known as a Neapolitan ice box, which, when set and turned out, is cut into slices suitable for serving. However small the pieces, the block should be cut so that each person gets some of each kind. They are generally laid on a <b>lace</b> <b>paper</b> on an ice plate. Four or five kinds are usually put in the mold, though three sorts will do. The following {{will serve as a}} guide in arranging: First, vanilla cream, then raspberry or cherry or currant water; coffee or chocolate in the middle; the strawberry cream, with lemon or orange or pineapple water to finish. A cream ice flavored with any liqueur, a brown bread cream flavored with brandy, with a couple of bright-colored water ices, form another agreeable mixture. Tea cream may be introduced into almost any combination unless coffee were used. Banana cream, pistachio, or almond cream with cherry water and damson or strawberry water are other options.|$|E

5000|$|On March 25, 2009 {{during a}} show in Montreal on Fleetwood Mac's Unleashed Tour, Stevie Nicks gave a short history of the {{inspiration}} behind Gypsy. She explained it was written sometime in 1978-79, when the band had become [...] "very famous, very fast," [...] {{and it was a}} song that brought her back to an earlier time, to an apartment in San Francisco where she had taken the mattress off her bed {{and put it on the}} floor. To contextualize, she voiced the lyrics: [...] "So I'm back, to the velvet underground. Back to the floor, that I love. To a room with some <b>lace</b> and <b>paper</b> flowers. Back to the gypsy that I was." [...] Those are the words: 'So I'm back to the velvet underground'—which is a clothing store in downtown San Francisco, where Janis Joplin got her clothes, and Grace Slick from Jefferson Airplane. It was this little hole in the wall, amazing, beautiful stuff—'back to the floor that I love, to a room with some <b>lace</b> and <b>paper</b> flowers, back to the gypsy that I was.'" [...] The second, and most emotional, subject of this song is the message as a tribute to someone's passing. On October 5, 1982, Robin Snyder Anderson, Stevie's best friend, died of leukemia.|$|R
