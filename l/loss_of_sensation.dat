5|$|Most {{people with}} SCI have {{problems}} with the body's physical sexual arousal response. Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called primary sexual dysfunction. The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, or complete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation.</b> Neuropathic pain, in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain {{in the absence of}} any noxious stimulus, is common after SCI and interferes with sex.|$|E
5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation,</b> and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation,</b> and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E

25|$|First {{reports on}} an {{association}} of spinal cord and optic nerve disorders appeared in the early 19th century. However, only an 1870 report by Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt created sustained interest of neurologists and ophthalmologists in this rare syndrome. In 1894, Eugène Devic and his PhD student Fernand Gault described 16 patients who had lost vision in one or both eyes and within weeks developed severe spastic weakness of the limbs, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation</b> and often bladder control. They recognized these symptoms {{were the result of}} inflammation of the optic nerve and spinal cord, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Wallenberg {{syndrome}} (lateral medullary syndrome) is {{a clinical}} {{demonstration of the}} anatomy of the trigeminal nerve, summarizing how it processes sensory information. A stroke usually affects only {{one side of the}} body; <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation</b> due to a stroke will be lateralized to the right or {{the left side of the}} body. The only exceptions to this rule are certain spinal-cord lesions and the medullary syndromes, of which Wallenberg syndrome is the best-known example. In this syndrome, a stroke causes a loss of pain-temperature sensation from one side of the face and the other side of the body.|$|E

40|$|Neuropathy is {{a problem}} often {{suffered}} by patients with diabetes mellitus. Types of neuropathy that occur are peripheral neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy. This cross sectional {{study was conducted to}} determine the association between duration <b>of</b> diabetes and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> protective <b>sensation</b> and the association between imbalance and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> protective <b>sensation</b> among Malay women with diabetes mellitus. Eighty one Malay women with diabetes mellitus, aged 20 to 60 years from three clinics in Hulu Langat District participated in this study. Socio-demographic information were obtained from respondent using a questionnaire. Foot sensory evaluation was conducted using Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament grade 5. 07. Assessment of balance was done using Timed One-leg Stance. Chi-squared test was used to determine the association between the two variables. Result showed that 56. 8 % <b>of</b> respondent had <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> protective <b>sensation</b> on at least one foot. While, 17. 3 % had imbalance while eyes were open and 60. 5 % experienced imbalance while eyes were closed. However, there was no significant correlation (p< 0. 05) between imbalance while eyes opened [χ 2 = 3. 27, p= 0. 07] and while eyes close [χ 2 = 0. 29, p= 0. 59]) with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> protective <b>sensation</b> in at least one foot. Similar result were obtained between duration of diabetes and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> protective <b>sensation.</b> (χ 2 = 3. 27, p= 0. 20). Although there was no association between these factors, a screening program should start early to ensure early problems are identified before more severe complications occur...|$|R
5000|$|Anterior spinal artery {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} [...] "anterior spinal cord syndrome") {{is a medical}} condition where the anterior spinal artery, the primary blood supply to the anterior portion of the spinal cord, is interrupted, causing ischemia or infarction of the spinal cord in the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata. It is characterized by <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> motor function below the level <b>of</b> injury, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensations</b> carried by the anterior columns of the spinal cord (pain and temperature), and preservation <b>of</b> <b>sensations</b> carried by the posterior columns (fine touch, vibration and proprioception).

25|$|The B mastopexy (breast lift) is a {{variation}} of the circumvertical approach that features an inverted, upper-case letter-B incision, which, when performed with simultaneous breast augmentation via submuscular or subglandular implantation of the breast prosthesis, restores the natural contour and appearance of the breasts. Moreover, the B mastopexy technique can procedurally include the simultaneous microliposuction to reduce the lateral parenchymal and adipose tissues in order to achieve the correct size, volume, and contour of the corrected breasts. The B mastopexy can correct several types of breast deformity, every form of breast ptosis, and breast hypertrophy; it usually has low incidence rates of hypertrophic scarring, and of <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation</b> in the nipple-areola complex; furthermore, the B mastopexy technique also applies to reduction mammoplasty, the correction of oversized breasts.|$|E
25|$|The Kumamoto University Research Group {{was formed}} on August 24, 1956. Researchers from the School of Medicine began visiting Minamata {{regularly}} and admitted patients {{to the university}} hospital for detailed examinations. A more complete picture of the symptoms exhibited by patients was gradually uncovered. The disease developed without any prior warning, with patients complaining of a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation</b> and numbness in their hands and feet. They became unable to grasp small objects or fasten buttons. They could not run or walk without stumbling, their voices changed in pitch, and many patients complained of difficulties seeing, hearing, and swallowing. In general, these symptoms deteriorated and were followed by severe convulsions, coma, and eventually death. By October 1956, 40 patients had been discovered, 14 of whom had died, an alarming mortality rate of 35%.|$|E
500|$|A {{section of}} skin innervated through a {{specific}} {{part of the}} spine is called a dermatome, and injury {{to that part of}} the spine can cause pain, numbness, or a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation</b> in the related areas. Paraesthesia, a tingling or burning sensation in affected areas of the skin, is another symptom. A person with a lowered level of consciousness may show a response to a painful stimulus above a certain point but not below it.|$|E
50|$|Syringobulbia {{may cause}} vertigo, nystagmus, {{unilateral}} or bilateral <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> facial <b>sensation,</b> lingual atrophy and weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, hoarseness, and sometimes peripheral sensory or motor deficits due to medullary compression.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the foot sensory status of Malay women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to determine its relation with: demographic factors, glycated haemoglobin level in plasma, and body mass index. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 71 Malay women with type 2 diabetes mellitus who attend three health clinics in Hulu Langat District, Selangor. Foot sensation was assessed using the Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament 5. 07 in nine locations on the plantar and dorsal <b>of</b> the feet. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> protective <b>sensation</b> was defined as inability to sense the monofilament {{in one or more}} sites of either foot. This study found that 56. 3 % <b>of</b> women had <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> protective <b>sensation,</b> with common sites being the heel, fifth metatarsal head, lateral mid-foot and little toe. Duration of diabetes mellitus were significantly related to foot sensation. The age, HbA 1 C level and body mass index did not show any significant correlation. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> protective <b>sensation</b> may lead to serious foot complication and therefore early screening involving multidisciplinary team is essential for prevention...|$|R
50|$|Dachshund (longhaired) disease usually occurs between 8 and 12 {{weeks of}} age, and causes urinary incontinence, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> pain <b>sensation</b> {{all over the}} body, and penis mutilation. It is {{probably}} inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.|$|R
500|$|Another {{consideration}} is <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation,</b> [...] which puts {{people at risk}} for wounds such as pressure sores and injuries that could become worse before being noticed. Friction from sexual activity may damage the skin, so it is necessary after sex to inspect areas {{that could have been}} hurt, particularly the buttocks and genital area. People who already have pressure sores must take care not to make the wounds worse. Irritation to the genitals increases risk for vaginal infections, which get worse if they go unnoticed. Women who do not get sufficient vaginal lubrication on their own can use a commercially available personal lubricant to decrease friction.|$|E
500|$|In {{reduction}} clitoroplasty, {{a common}} intersex operation, the glans is preserved {{and parts of}} the erectile bodies are excised. Problems with this technique include <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation,</b> sexual function, and sloughing of the glans. One way to preserve the clitoris with its innervations and function is to imbricate and bury the clitoral glans; however, Şenaylı et al. state that [...] "pain during stimulus because of trapped tissue under the scarring is nearly routine. In another method, 50percent of the ventral clitoris is removed through the level base of the clitoral shaft, and it is reported that good sensation and clitoral function are observed in follow up"; additionally, it has [...] "been reported that the complications are from the same as those in the older procedures for this method".|$|E
500|$|Central cord syndrome, {{almost always}} {{resulting}} from {{damage to the}} cervical spinal cord, is characterized by weakness in the arms with relative sparing of the legs, and spared sensation in regions served by the sacral segments. There is <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation</b> of pain, temperature, light touch, and pressure {{below the level of}} injury. [...] The spinal tracts that serve the arms are more affected due to their central location in the spinal cord, while the corticospinal fibers destined for the legs are spared due to their more external location. The most common of the incomplete SCI syndromes, central cord syndrome usually results from neck hyperextension in older people with spinal stenosis. [...] In younger people, it most commonly results from neck flexion. [...] The most common causes are falls and vehicle accidents; however other possible causes include spinal stenosis and impingement on the spinal cord by a tumor or vertebral disk.|$|E

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} about rare genetic neurological disorders is fairly limited, which translates into poor treatment options for them.

500|$|A {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that causes changes in its function, either {{temporary}} or permanent. These changes translate into loss of muscle function, sensation, or autonomic function {{in parts of the}} body served by the spinal cord below the level of the lesion. Injuries can occur at any level of the spinal cord and can be classified as complete injury, a total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation</b> and muscle function, or incomplete, meaning some nervous signals are able to travel past the injured area of the cord. [...] Depending on the location and severity of damage along the spinal cord, the symptoms can vary widely, from pain or numbness to paralysis to incontinence. [...] The prognosis also ranges widely, from full recovery in rare cases to permanent tetraplegia (also called quadriplegia) in [...] injuries {{at the level of the}} neck, and paraplegia in lower injuries. Complications that can occur in the short and long term after injury include muscle atrophy, pressure sores, infections, and respiratory problems.|$|E
500|$|Cauda equina {{syndrome}} (CES) {{results from}} a lesion below {{the level at which}} the spinal cord splits into the cauda equina, at levels L2–S5 below the conus medullaris. Thus it is not a true spinal cord syndrome since it is nerve roots that are damaged and not the cord itself; however it is common for several of these nerves to be damaged at the same time due to their proximity. CES can occur by itself or alongside conus medullaris syndrome. It can cause low back pain, weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation,</b> bowel and bladder dysfunction, and loss of reflexes. Unlike in conus medullaris syndrome, symptoms often occur on only one side of the body. The cause is often compression, e.g. by a ruptured intervertebral disk or tumor. [...] Since the nerves damaged in CES are actually peripheral nerves because they have already branched off from the spinal cord, the injury has better prognosis for recovery of function: the peripheral nervous system has a greater capacity for healing than the central nervous system.|$|E
500|$|SCI {{can also}} be of a nontraumatic origin. Nontraumatic lesions cause {{anywhere}} from 30 to 80% of all SCI; the percentage varies by locale, influenced by efforts to prevent trauma. Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries. [...] In developed countries, {{the most common cause}} of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases, followed by tumors; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as HIV and tuberculosis. SCI may occur in intervertebral disc disease, and spinal cord vascular disease. Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord, and intervertebral disks can herniate. Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels, as in arteriovenous malformation, or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord. When systemic blood pressure drops, blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced, potentially causing a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensation</b> and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord. Congenital conditions and tumors that compress the cord can also cause SCI, as can vertebral spondylosis and ischemia. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the spinal cord, as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, herpes zoster or herpes simplex, meningitis, myelitis, and syphilis.|$|E
25|$|The dry {{gangrene}} is {{a result}} of vasoconstriction induced by the ergotamine-ergocristine alkaloids of the fungus.

Vasoconstriction is treated with vasodilators.|$|R
