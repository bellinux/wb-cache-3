40|$|A {{major concern}} for {{convenience}} store managers is lost sales due to balking. Convenience stores customers pay high margins expecting fast service. If waiting lines are {{too long for}} their tolerance level at their arrival, they balk and the sale is lost as a result. In order to reduce lost sales, {{the length of the}} waiting line is usually controlled by opening additional checkout registers when the number of customers standing in the line exceeds a specified number and maintaining them open until they are no longer needed. This paper presents an applied approach to model the probability that customers actually enter the store and define the optimal opening level (-policy) of the second checkout register based on several factors including the particular waiting line <b>length</b> <b>tolerance</b> level of usual customers, the average hourly arrival rate of customers to the store and the average gain per customer transaction.

Objectives The effect of Pb treatment on the root <b>length,</b> <b>tolerance</b> index, photosynthetic pigments, photosynthetic activity, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme was studied in a greenhouse pot experiment. Results The results showed that root lengths and tolerance index decreased with increase of Pb concentration, but tolerance index of cuttings was always {{lower than those of}} the seedlings. For cuttings, Pb treatment had a stimulating effect on chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity at low concentration and an inhibitory effect at higher concentration. For seedlings, SOD activity increased with increasing Pb concentration. In both seedlings and cuttings, Pb caused inhibition of leaf growth and photosynthesis, and induced the membrane damage which was more obvious in the cuttings. In comparison with the control, the dynamic tendency of catalase and perxidase activities in the leaves of Pb-stressed plants all ascended, and then declined. Discussion The increase in enzyme activities demonstrated that seedlings were more tolerant to Pb stress than cuttings. These results also indicate that the antioxidant system may {{play an important role in}} eliminating or alleviating the toxicity of Pb in J. curcas seedlings and cuttings. The accumulation of Pb increased in a concentration-dependent manner; however, its translocation from root to shoot was low. The cuttings accumulated significantly higher Pb in roots than seedlings...|$|E
40|$|The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a {{potential}} next-generation particle collider, in which electrons and positrons collide at a center-of-mass energy of up to 3 TeV. In order to reach a high accelerating gradient and reduce {{the length of the}} machine, CLIC uses a novel two-beam scheme. Here, the acceleration energy for the main beam is provided by energy extraction from a secondary electron drive beam, by the use of Power Extraction and Transfer Structures (PETS). This Ph. D. thesis describes deceleration measurements from the CLIC Test Facility 3 at CERN, from a beam that had up to 37 % of its kinetic energy converted into 12 GHz rf power. The results are part of the feasibility demonstration of the CLIC scheme. The measured difference in beam energy of the decelerated beam is correlated with particle tracking simulations and with predictions based on analytical formulae, and a very good agreement is demonstrated. The evolution of the transverse emittance was also studied, since it is critical to contain the large drive beam within the limited available aperture. The emittance was not found to increase from other effects than adiabatic undamping. In order to reach consistency between measurements, theory and simulations, it is important to take the bunch phase into account, which affects the rf field produced in the PETS. New formulae have been derived to take this effect into account. Also longitudinal space charge in the CLIC decelerator has been studied. It has been a concern that, despite the high energy of the CLIC drive beam, longitudinal space charge may lead to a violation of the strict bunch <b>length</b> <b>tolerance.</b> However, it is shown that the space charge effect is still negligible. For this a new Particle-in-Cell written in Octave was developed, and is described in the thesis...|$|E

The method uses seed germination and early seedling growth of these plants in the presence of various levels (10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 mg/L) of Cadmium (Cd), Iron (Fe) and Zinc (Zn). The inhibition caused by these metals was depending on the concentration used, the metal itself and the plant species. The species had reduced seed germination, root and shoot <b>lengths,</b> <b>tolerance</b> index and percentphyto-toxicity with increasing concentrations of metals. Cadmium was determined to be the most inhibitory metal on these parameters. This metal affected significantly the germination, root and shoot length of the species tested, as well as the tolerance index and percentphytotoxicity starting from 50 mg Cd/l. Under the Iron stress, in general, the inhibition of germination and root length of wheat was reduced from 500 mg Fe/l. The results showed also that the inhibitory effect of increase of Zn levels was seen in root, shoot and tolerance indices.

In addition, to decide the proper time to refer selected patients to bowel transplantation remains difficult. A noninvasive biomarker developed to evaluate functional enterocyte mass {{and the extent of}} intestinal adaptation is plasma citrulline level.

To better understand plant Se toxicity and resistance mechanisms, we compared the physiological and molecular responses of two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions, Columbia (Col) - 0 and Wassilewskija (Ws) - 2, to selenite treatment. Measurement of root <b>length</b> Se <b>tolerance</b> index demonstrated a clear difference between selenite-resistant Col- 0 and selenite-sensitive Ws- 2. Macroarray analysis showed more pronounced selenite-induced increases in mRNA levels of ethylene- or jasmonic acid (JA) -biosynthesis and -inducible genes in Col- 0 than in Ws- 2. Indeed, Col- 0 exhibited higher levels of ethylene and JA. The selenite-sensitive phenotype of Ws- 2 was attenuated by treatment with ethylene precursor or methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Conversely, the selenite resistance of Col- 0 was reduced in mutants impaired in ethylene or JA biosynthesis or signaling. Genes encoding sulfur (S) transporters and S assimilation enzymes were up-regulated by selenite in Col- 0 but not Ws- 2. Accordingly, Col- 0 contained higher levels of total S and Se and of nonprotein thiols than Ws- 2. Glutathione redox status was reduced by selenite in Ws- 2 but not in Col- 0. Furthermore, the generation of reactive oxygen species by selenite was higher in Col- 0 than in Ws- 2.

The cultivars chosen were: Acala Maxxa, grown primarily in California; Stoneville 4892 BR, grown primarily in the Mississippi River Delta; Tamcot Sphinx, from the plains of Texas; and FiberMax 966, with a genetic makeup from Australia. The cultivars were grown for 10 days in six temperature regimes: 15 / 20 °C, 15 / 25 °C, 15 / 30 °C, 15 / 35 °C, 15 / 40 °C, and 15 / 45 °C (night/day).

Which products are appropriate for the production in the robot cell?   As a method to come to a conclusion, an analysis has been made over the manufactured products. And also interviews with machine operators and the production management. Our work has also been based on literature studies,   because the production moment has been compared with models from Lean Production theories.       The analysis shows that there are some limitations in the robot cell, which means that there are several demands that have to be fulfilled. From the investigated material our conclusion is that many products don't keep up with following demands: <b>length,</b> surface, <b>tolerance</b> dimensions, and shape. As a result of this, there are some products that can´t be manufactured in the robot cell, and therefore has to be produced in the ordinary CNC machine group.   Interviews have declared that there doesn't exist any documentation from the production in the robot cell, which causes stop in the production. The data collection shows that an inner setting in the robot cell varies a lot, because the article supply is vast. Therefore it's hard to estimate average time for inner settings. The total time for inner settings could be reduced by shorten time for cleaning the CNC machine, pre-programming the robot and using fixtures which can be attached easily. This should increase the ability to run more articles in the robot cell.   The conclusion is that the company could improve the production, by upgrading and investing in equipment for the robot cell. Improvements can also be achieved by reduce the time for inner settings, and also by collect statistics from the production in the robot cell. This should make it easier to find reasons that keep the utilization rate low. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of training participants' attention towards or away from painful faces versus pain-related words on pain outcomes on an acute experimental pain paradigm. Methods: Participants were randomized to receive either training towards or away from painful faces or words. Following training, participants completed the cold pressor task. Results: The results confirm that attention bias modification produced the predicted changes in attentional biases. Clear training effects were observed for words and faces, such that attentional biases changed in the predicted direction on the stimuli presented during the training. However, for those trained on words, training effects also generalized to face stimuli. As predicted, those who received training away from painful stimuli took longer to report pain (higher pain threshold) during the cold pressor task, and this effect was more pronounced for those trained on words. Contrary to expectations, those trained on faces (regardless of training direction) reported less pain than those trained on words. There were no differences between the groups for pain <b>tolerance</b> (<b>length</b> of time participants were able to keep their arms in the cold pressor). Conclusions: These findings confirm that attentional biases are modifiable, and impact (in the expected manner) how quickly participants perceive pain.

There were no influence of rising temperature on the total length of newly hatched larvae (TL = 4. 23 – 4. 67 mm), in contrast to negative correlation with developmental stage (9 – 18 °C: stage 37; 21 – 24 °C: stage  36), i. e. the length might determine the age at hatching, rather than the age at hatching determines the hatching <b>length.</b> The thermal <b>tolerance</b> range in term of survival lies between 9 and 24 °C (the thermal optimum 15 – 24  °C, i. e. weatherfish is a warm-mesothermic species). Temperatures above 24  °C (in our study 27 – 36 °C) are considered the lethal temperatures already during embryonic period. It is highly recommended to distinguish an impact of suboptimal temperatures 9 – 12 °C on development during explored interval only, in contrast to possible other effect of these lower temperatures in context of the whole early ontogeny...|$|R
40|$|Water-limited {{conditions}} in early growth stages negatively affect germination and seedling growth, often leading to suboptimal plant population and poor stand establishment. Germination and seedling growth of ten local wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes {{in response to}} induced water stress conditions and supplemental foliar fertilisation with macronutrients (NPK) were investigated. In two laboratory experiments, the observed germination parameters and calculated stress indices were used as screening criteria for drought tolerance. In one glasshouse experiment, the dose and combinations of N, P, and K for foliar spray were optimised. Germination parameters viz. germination percentage, germination index, promptness index, and germination stress tolerance index declined {{in response to the}} increasing polyethylene glycol induced stress levels. Water stress conditions imposed by withholding irrigation at seedling stage reduced plant height stress tolerance index and dry matter stress tolerance index but increased root <b>length</b> stress <b>tolerance</b> index and root to shoot ratio. Based on the results of germination attributes and stress indices, Bhakkar- 02 was the most drought tolerant genotype and Shafaq- 06 was the most drought sensitive genotype among all tested genotypes. Supplemental foliar fertilisation of macronutrients (N, P, and K), alone or in different combinations improved the water relations, gas exchange characteristics and nutrient contents in both contrasting genotypes, Bhakkar- 02 and Shafaq- 06. Foliar spray NPK in combination was the most effective treatment in improving plant growth under both wellwatered and water-deficit conditions. Subsequently, the best combination of foliar NPK was tested in wire house and field conditions to evaluate the most appropriate growth stage for supplemental fertilisation. In wire house experiment foliar application of NPK spray improved the water relations, gas exchange characteristics (i. e. through accumulation of soluble sugars), total free amino acid, and proline. The antioxidant activity was also improved with foliar NPK spray at anthesis stage. In field experiments foliar application of NPK in combination improved the number of grains per spikelet and 1000 -grain weight, which ultimately increased the grain yield at anthesis stage in normally irrigated plants as well as under water stress conditions at anthesis stage in both wheat genotypes. The water shortage at anthesis stage decreased the yield and its components more severely as compared to tillering stage. The drought tolerant Bhakkar- 02 performed well under water stress. So, foliar application of NPK at anthesis stage under water stress conditions gave better results as compared to tillering stage...|$|R
