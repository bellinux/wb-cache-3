500|$|Despite these {{positive}} reactions from the elite, Austen's novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime: two for Sense and Sensibility, three for Pride and Prejudice, none for Mansfield Park, and seven for Emma. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. [...] They most often {{focused on the}} moral lessons of the novels. Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on Austen's reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, [...] "their job was merely to provide brief notices, extended with quotations, {{for the benefit of}} women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> for its story, its characters and moral". This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in Austen's day.|$|E

Ament said, [...] "We tried really hard, to make it <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>book,</b> kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways." [...] The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.|$|E

500|$|Kevin Lyon observes, [...] "The plot {{revolves}} around the audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer (about whom we learn very little, itself unusual for Argento) to the eminently likeable hero, surely the film's boldest stroke." [...] While noting that the device is [...] "striking", McDonagh comments that this transmission of guilt occurs between two dark doubles who are severely [...] "warped" [...] individuals. She suggests that [...] "Neal and Berti... act as mirrors to one another, each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other." [...] Berti's obsession with Neal's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the writer, while Neal {{seems to think that}} his own violent acts are simply part of some kind of [...] "elaborate fiction".

500|$|Diptychs {{were widely}} popular in {{northern}} Europe from the mid-15th {{to the early}} 16th century. They consisted of two equally sized panels joined by hinges (or, less often, a fixed frame); the panels were usually linked thematically. Hinged panels could be opened and closed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>book,</b> allowing both an interior and exterior view, while the ability to close the wings allowed protection of the inner images. Originating from conventions in Books of Hours, diptychs typically functioned as less expensive and more portable altarpieces. Diptychs are distinct from pendants {{in that they are}} physically connected wings and not merely two paintings hung side by side. They were usually near-miniature in scale, and some emulated medieval [...] "treasury art" [...] -small pieces made of gold or ivory. The tracery seen in works such as van der Weyden's Virgin and Child reflects ivory carving of the period. The format was adapted by van Eyck and van der Weyden on commission from members of the House of Valois-Burgundy, and refined by Hugo van der Goes, Hans Memling and later Jan van Scorel.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick met author Michael Herr through {{mutual friend}} David Cornwell (novelist John le Carré) in 1980, and became {{interested}} in his book Dispatches, about the Vietnam War. Herr had recently written Martin Sheen's narration for Apocalypse Now (1979). Kubrick was also intrigued by Gustav Hasford's Vietnam War novel The Short-Timers. With the vision in mind to shoot what would become Full Metal Jacket (1987), Kubrick began working with both Herr and Hasford separately on a script. He eventually found Hasford's novel to be [...] "brutally honest" [...] and decided to shoot a film which closely follows the novel. All of the film was shot {{at a cost of}} $17 million within a 30-mile radius of his house between August 1985 and September 1986, later than scheduled as Kubrick shut down production for five months following a near-fatal accident with a jeep involving Lee Ermey. A derelict gasworks in Beckton in the London Docklands area posed as the ruined city of Huế, which makes the film visually very different from other Vietnam War films. Around 200 palm trees were imported via 40-foot trailers by road from North Africa, at a cost of £1000 a tree, and thousands of plastic plants were ordered from Hong Kong to provide foliage for the film. Kubrick explained he made the film look realistic by using natural light, and achieved a [...] "newsreel effect" [...] by making the Steadicam shots less steady, [...] which reviewers and commentators thought contributed to the bleakness and seriousness of the film. According to critic Michel Ciment, the film contained some of Kubrick's trademark characteristics, such as his selection of ironic music, portrayals of men being dehumanized, and attention to extreme detail to achieve realism. In a later scene where United States Marines patrol the ruins of an abandoned and totally destroyed city, the theme song to the Mickey Mouse Club is heard as a sardonic counterpoint. The film opened strongly in June 1987, taking over $30 million in the first 50 days alone, but critically it was [...] overshadowed by the success of Oliver Stone's Platoon, released a year earlier. According to one review, notes co-star Matthew Modine, [...] "The first half of FMJ is brilliant. Then the film degenerates into a masterpiece." [...] Roger Ebert was not particularly impressed with it, awarding it a mediocre 2.5 out of 4. He concluded: [...] "Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> of short stories than a novel", a [...] "strangely shapeless film from the man whose work usually imposes a ferociously consistent vision on his material".|$|E
