The result of the study indicates that RDE technique is applicable in detecting the abrupt changes that exist in fatigue time series data by isolating the high and low amplitude event into different segmentation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) {{is a broad}} {{class of}} time series models, {{and it has been}} {{achieved}} using the statistical differencing approach. It is normally being performed using the computational method. Thus, it is useful to choose the suitable model from a possibly large selection of the available ARIMA formulations. The ARIMA approach was then analysed with the presence of stationary behaviour in a nonstationary data. For the purpose of the random data analysis, a nonstationary data that exhibiting a random behaviour was used. This random data was measured in the unit of microstrain on the <b>lower</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> or a car travelling on a country road surface. With this engineering unit, hence, the data is known as a variable amplitude fatigue loading. Experimentally, the data was collected for 225 seconds at the sampling rate of 200 Hz, which gave 45, 000 discrete data points. Using the computational analysis by means of statistical software package, the ARIMA parameters were estimated by the application of the data smoothing technique {{in order to reduce the}} random variation of the fatigue data. Therefore, the significant ARIMA parameters were established and being applied in the study of the variation in nonstationary data. For this paper, finally, it is suggested that the ARIMA method provided a good platform to analyse fatigue random data, especially in the scope of the durability research...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Under {{the study}} {{discussed}} in the paper, a geometric model of a car’s <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> was prepared and subsequently imported into the MSC. Adams environment dedicated to studying dynamics of multi-body systems and then broken down into finite elements. Modal frequencies were established for the said model. The superior {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the loads affecting an arm operating in a complete car’s suspension system for the road-induced input functions simulated in the Adams/Car module. Design/methodology/approach: Under the study in question, a geometric model of a car <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> was developed based on CAD software. The model was imported into the Adams/View environment and its body changed from rigid into a flexible one. Materials were defined and modal frequencies were established for the model prepared. Findings: The study outcome is an FEM-based <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> model and the modal frequencies established. The <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> model in question is to be applied in further numerical experiments related to studying dynamics of automotive vehicle suspension systems. Research limitations/implications: The numerical experiment results {{discussed in the}} paper require that the model should be adjusted to a real element. This, in turn, requires modal analysis of the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> and comparison of the vectors describing the forms of free vibrations. Originality/value: The model developed will be applied as a flexible element in a complex suspension system of a complete car and used to determine its dynamic loads...|$|R
