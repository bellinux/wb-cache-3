5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} and <b>logistical</b> <b>support</b> and was hampered {{by a lack}} of cohesion due to its disparate command structure and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable <b>logistical</b> <b>support</b> base that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match.|$|E

5|$|After {{the scale}} of the damage became clear, the {{government}} of Yemen requested for assistance from the international community. The hardest hit areas had poor infrastructure, which caused difficulties in communications as relief goods were distributed. Nations in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sent money and supplies to help rebuild the damaged infrastructure and houses. Agencies under the United Nations provided food and <b>logistical</b> <b>support.</b> Relief efforts continued to make progress until 2011 due to a political uprising in Yemen.|$|E
5|$|As {{nuclear weapons}} {{development}} proceeded, the weapons became mass-produced, smaller, lighter, {{and easier to}} store, handle and maintain. They also required less effort to assemble. The AFSWP gradually shifted its emphasis away from training assembly teams, and became more involved in stockpile management and providing administrative, technical and <b>logistical</b> <b>support.</b> It supported nuclear weapons testing, although after Operation Sandstone in 1948, this was increasingly in a planning and training capacity rather than a field role. In 1958, the AFSWP became the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), a field agency of the Department of Defense.|$|E

The ADF also took part in the intervention in remote Northern Territory Indigenous communities between June 2007 and October 2008. During this operation ADF personnel provided <b>logistical</b> <b>support</b> to the Northern Territory Emergency Response Task Force and helped conduct child health checks.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered {{the viability of the}} Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the <b>logistical</b> <b>support</b> of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
