The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, and who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much bad feelings on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E

Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may be a sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we develop {{semantics}} for {{key aspects of}} the ARMv 8 multiprocessor architecture: the concurrency model {{and much of the}} 64 -bit application-level instruction set (ISA). Our goal is to clarify what the range of architecturally allowable behaviour is, and thereby to support future work on formal verification, analysis, and testing of concurrent ARM software and hardware. Establishing such models with high confidence is intrinsically difficult: it involves capturing the vendor's architectural intent, aspects of which (especially for concurrency) have not previously been precisely defined. We therefore first develop a concurrency model with a microarchitectural flavour, abstracting from many hardware implementation concerns but still close to hardware-designer intuition. This means it can be discussed in detail with ARM architects. We then develop a more abstract model, better suited for use as an architectural specification, which we prove sound w. r. t. the first. The instruction semantics involves further difficulties, handling the mass of detail and the subtle intensional information required to interface to the concurrency model. We have a novel ISA description language, with a lightweight dependent type system, letting us do both with a rather direct representation of the ARM reference manual instruction descriptions. We build a tool from the combined semantics that lets one explore, either interactively or exhaustively, the full range of architecturally allowed behaviour, for <b>litmus</b> <b>tests</b> and (small) ELF ex-ecutables.

40|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} simplicity of sequential consistency (SC), the semantics of SC atomic operations and fences in the C 11 and OpenCL memory models is subtle, leading to convoluted prose descriptions that translate to complex axiomatic formalisations. We conduct {{an overhaul of}} SC atomics in C 11, reducing the associated axioms in both number and complexity. A consequence of our simplification is that the SC operations in an execution {{no longer need to}} be totally ordered. This relaxation enables, for the first time, efficient and exhaustive simulation of <b>litmus</b> <b>tests</b> that use SC atomics. We extend our improved C 11 model to obtain the first rigorous memory model formalisation for OpenCL (which extends C 11 with support for heterogeneous many-core programming). In the OpenCL setting, we refine the SC axioms still further to give a sensible semantics to SC operations that employ a ‘memory scope’ to restrict their visibility to specific threads. Our overhaul requires slight strengthenings of both the C 11 and the OpenCL memory models, causing some behaviours to become disallowed. We argue that these strengthenings are natural, and that all of the formalised C 11 and OpenCL compilation schemes of which we are aware (Power and x 86 CPUs for C 11, AMD GPUs for OpenCL) remain valid in our revised models. Using the HERD memory model simulator, we show that our overhaul leads to an exponential improvement in simulation time for C 11 <b>litmus</b> <b>tests</b> compared with the original model, making *exhaustive* simulation competitive, time-wise, with the *non-exhaustive* CDSChecker tool...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a program logic for weak memory (also known as relaxed memory). The logic {{is based on}} Hoare logic within a thread, and rely/guarantee between threads. It is presented via examples, giving proofs of many weak-memory <b>litmus</b> <b>tests.</b> It extends to coherence but not yet to synchronised assignment (compare-and-swap, load-logical/store-conditional). It deals with conditionals and loops but not yet arrays or heap. The logic uses a version of Hoare logic within threads, and a version of rely/guarantee between threads, with five stability rules to handle various kinds of parallelism (external, internal, propagation-free and two kinds of in-flight parallelism). There are B and U modalities to regulate propagation, and temporal modalities since, Sofar and Ouat to deal with global coherence (SC per location). The logic is presented by example. Proofs and unproofs of about thirty weak-memory examples, including many <b>litmus</b> <b>tests</b> in various guises, are dealt with in detail. There is a proof of {{a version of the}} token ring. In version 2 : The correspondence with Herding Cats has been clarified. The stability rules have been simplified: in particular the sat and x= x tests have been eliminated from external stability checks. The embedding is simplified and has a more transparent relation to the mechanisms of the logic. Definitions of U, Sofar and Ouat have been considerably altered. The description of modalities and the treatment of termination has been reworked. Many proofs are reconstructed. A comprehensive summary of the logic is an appendix.
