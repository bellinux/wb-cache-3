50|$|The <b>lettered</b> <b>aracari</b> {{is found}} in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical swamps, and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} home to species endemic to the Amazon basin such as the Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) and tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), and to the white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus) and white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus), {{primates}} whose presence in the Tapajós basin was not certain until their presence {{was reported in the}} forest.

50|$|Toucans {{range in}} size from the <b>lettered</b> <b>aracari</b> (Pteroglossus inscriptus), at 130 g (4.6 oz) and 29 cm (11.5 inches), to the toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), at 680 g (1.5 lb) and 63 cm (29 inches). Their bodies are short (of {{comparable}} size to a crow's) and compact. The tail is rounded and varies in length, from half the length to the whole length of the body. The neck is short and thick. The wings are small, as they are forest-dwelling birds who only need to travel short distances, and are often of about the same span as the bill-tip-to-tail-tip measurements of the bird.|$|E
