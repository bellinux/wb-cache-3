Amazingly, Science rejected this Technical Comment {{based on its}} <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> <b>novelty.</b> Then why would Science continue to publish iPS cell research suffering the same old problems? Close examination of two reports- submitted on significantly different dates, but simultaneously printed- on iPS cells made by using “non-integrating ” virus or without virus revealed some interesting aspects. Questions have been raised regarding the validity of some conclusions claimed in these new studies. Strong arguments are now presented to support the conclusion that iPS cells receiving and expressing oncogenes are incorrectly programmed stem (iPS) cells. These cells, similar to previously reported alike cells, are hard to be rendered cancer-free and may pose heavy risks in their therapeutic use for regenerative medicine...|$|R
500|$|Shuffle! the anime {{television}} series received mixed reviews from critics. Theron Martin of Anime News Network described the anime as although [...] "genuinely enjoyable", often [...] "alternating between brazen stupidity, lame jokes, and disgusting sweetness" [...] criticizing {{it as being}} a typical harem anime that offered little new content. Helen Ellingwood of Active Anime disagreed stating that Shuffle! contained what she described {{as the most important}} ingredient, which sets it apart from other harem anime: [...] "heart". Anime News Network's Carlo Santos agreed with Martin's assessment, agreeing with the show's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>novelty</b> and stating that the highlight of the anime is its comedy, but that its romance is [...] "slowly running the series into the ground." [...] However, D. F. Smith of IGN stated that it actually does well against other harem anime as it [...] "may be ridiculous, exploitative, a simultaneous affront to good sense and good taste, but at least it's good for a chuckle or two". Smith criticized the ending for lacking [...] "intensity"; however, Ellingwood praised it for showing the consequences of avoiding which heroine the protagonist would choose to love, unlike harem anime she had prior.|$|E

The Communist Party's grip onto power is unlikely to waver for another period of time. Domestically, however, Hu's ideology is a novel addition to the current ideologies of the CPC, adding more of a populist focus, although the political rhetoric in the report was apparent. Hu stressed inner-party democracy, and repeated the word [...] "democracy" [...] 60 times in the speech according to Xinhua. In addition, Hu received applause a total of over 40 times, well over Jiang's record of 16 five years earlier.|$|E

A 1943 New York Times {{editorial}} stated that [...] "The {{time has come to}} discard [...] for something that represents the continents and directions less deceptively ... Although its usage ... has diminished ... it is still highly popular as a wall map apparently in part because, as a rectangular map, it fills a rectangular wall space with more map, and clearly because its familiarity breeds more popularity." [...] Because of the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>novelty</b> both in the projection Peters devised and in the rhetoric surrounding its promotion, the cartographic community had no reason to think Peters would succeed any more than Edwards or his predecessors had.|$|E
25|$|Adaptational comics {{are still}} the source of controversies and debates. Although {{in most cases the}} art was beautiful, the panels were heavily packed with {{narrative}} texts – a trademark of Tibor Cs. Horváth. By the early sixties this comics type fell into a trap from which it could not escape until recent times. On one hand intellectuals criticized these works for the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> originality, <b>novelty</b> and artistry, while another major accusation was that comics in general restrict reading habits. However, adaptational comics provided a safe relationship with the cultural-political leadership, and were still popular, comic book import was close to zero, so nothing forced comic artists to move on further.|$|R
40|$|Background Novelty sweets {{resemble}} {{or can be}} used as toys, are brightly coloured, with striking imagery, {{and sold}} at pocket money prices. They encourage regular consumption as packaging can be resealed, leading to prolonged exposure of these high-sugar and low pH products to the oral tissues, risk factors for dental caries and erosion, respectively. Aim To determine how children conceptualise novelty sweets and their motivations for buying and consuming them. Design Focus groups conducted using a brief schedule of open-ended questions, supported by novelty sweets used as prompts in the latter stages. Participants were school children (aged 9 – 10) from purposively selected state primary schools in Cardiff, UK. Results Key findings related to the routine nature of sweet eating; familiarity with and availability <b>of</b> <b>novelty</b> sweets; parental awareness and control; <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> awareness of health consequences; and the overall appeal <b>of</b> <b>novelty</b> sweets. Conclusions Parents reported vagueness regarding consumption habits and permissiveness about any limits they set may have diluted the concept of treats. Flexible permissiveness to sweet buying applied to sweets of all kinds. Parents' reported <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> familiarity with <b>novelty</b> sweets combined with their low cost, easy availability, high sugar content, and acidity give cause for concern...|$|R

2500|$|Beyond the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>novelty</b> in the {{projection}} itself, the claims Peters made about {{the projection}} were also familiar to cartographers. Just {{as in the case}} of Peters, earlier projections generally were promoted as alternatives to the Mercator. Inappropriate use of the Mercator projection in world maps and the size disparities figuring prominently in Peters's arguments against the Mercator projection had been remarked upon for centuries and quite commonly in the 20th century. As early as 1943, Stewart notes this phenomenon and compares the quest for the perfect projection to [...] "squaring the circle or making pi come out even" [...] because the mathematics that governs map projections just does not permit development of a map projection that is objectively significantly better than the hundreds already devised. Even Peters's politicized interpretation of the common use of Mercator was nothing new, with Kelloway's 1946 text mentioning a similar controversy.|$|E

40|$|Growth factor Neuregulin 1 (NRG 1) {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in development and organization of the cerebral cortex. NRG 1 and its receptors, ERBB 3 and ERBB 4, have been implicated in genetic susceptibility for schizophrenia. Disease symptoms include asociality and altered social interaction. To investigate the role of NRG 1 -ERBB signaling in social behavior, mice heterozygous for an Nrg 1 null allele (Nrg 1 +/−), and mice with conditional ablation of Erbb 3 or Erbb 4 in the central nervous system, were evaluated for sociability and social novelty preference in a three-chambered choice task. Results showed that deficiencies in NRG 1 or ERBB 3 significantly enhanced sociability. All of the mutant groups demonstrated a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> social <b>novelty</b> preference, in contrast to their respective wild-type controls. Effects of NRG 1, ERBB 3, or ERBB 4 deficiency on social behavior could not be attributed to general changes in anxiety-like behavior, activity, or loss of olfactory ability. Nrg 1 +/− pups did not exhibit changes in isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations, a measure of emotional reactivity. Overall, these findings provide evidence that social behavior is mediated by NRG 1 -ERBB signaling...|$|R

40|$|Current Latvian {{research}} in the area of social work is not characteristic of a creative and innovative methodological approach. The methodological conservatism derived from general sociology is particularly affecting students in doctoral studies. This proposes a question: should, in the name <b>of</b> scientific <b>novelty,</b> we support {{research in}} which the PhD student aims to get rid of his personality behind the shield of authority, sometimes even general sociology textbook truths? Or should we encourage bold challenges to methodological schematism, in which the researcher takes a pose of truly creative research and avoids becoming a representative <b>of</b> scientific marginality <b>lacking</b> one’s personality? The subject of creative activity[*]–[*]the researcher in social work[*]–[*]can best express oneself in the level of philosophic wisdom, identifying only the main guidelines of his creative processes and allowing a large headspace for one’s creative quests. A scientist, also one interested in the problems of social work, can ascertain his/her uniqueness by relying on the concept that any researcher has embarked on an individual journey, circulating on different orbits around one central idea. If the distance between such central idea and the researcher’s activities is increasing, this signifies of either a creatively productive reevaluation of the researcher’s position, or the death of the research process in having lost the original idea. On the other hand, continuous approach towards the central idea either means that the researcher is consistent and determined in his creative research, or there is complete <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> scientific <b>novelty</b> in cases when borrowed foreign ideas are worshipped...|$|R

30|$|Firm type D is {{the least}} {{challenging}} entrepreneurial firm. Firm D scores low on entrepreneurial growth intensions and also on innovation novelty. As such, firm D innovates by introducing new combinations of already regionally known knowledge. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> both innovation <b>novelty</b> and entrepreneurial growth intentions leads to a process of knowledge recycling {{which is expected to}} have relatively limited impact outside the firm. Firm D thereby contributes to industrial path extension, a situation which, if not renewed, will gradually reduce into a stable state situation resulting in industrial path exhaustion. Entrepreneurs who introduce type D firms {{are to be found in}} all regions, also regions hosting an organisational thin RIS. Actually, thin RISs are dominated by this type of firms as they provide poor conditions for innovation (Isaksen, 2014). Entrepreneurs behind firms of type D are not ambitious and mainly focused on being self-sufficient. Examples of these types of entrepreneurs are most family-owned microbusinesses, farms, craftsmen’s and single-person consultancy firms.|$|R

50|$|Added {{evidence}} of the way Ansteys social comedy and adoption of the epistolary style had captured the general imagination is given by {{the large number of}} imitations that followed its publication. The following year saw the appearance of the complimentary Poetical Epistles to the author of the New Bath Guide (London 1767) and the Tunbridge Epistles from Lady Margaret to the Countess of B, featuring Baths rival spa. Another close imitation was The Register of Folly, or characters and incidents at Bath, containing twelve poetical epistles by an invalid (London 1773). Others in the same vein included the fourteen letters of John Williams A Postscript to the New Bath Guide by Anthony Pasquin (London 1790) and The Seaside, by Simkin Slenderwit (1797), featuring Ramsgate and the new fad of sea-bathing that was replacing the hot springs at Bath. Although the majority <b>of</b> these <b>lacked</b> the charm <b>of</b> <b>novelty,</b> and often attracted scornful reviews, George Dallas at least made his name with an exotic adaptation.

40|$|S 100 beta, a calcium-binding brain protein, {{has been}} implicated in brain {{development}} and hippocampal neurophysiology including long-term potentiation.

S 100 beta levels are elevated in both Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, human neurodegenerative diseases associated with mental retardation and dementia. To investigate whether or not elevated S 100 beta levels can cause brain dysfunctioning in mammals, transgenic mice carrying multiple copies of the human S 100 beta gene were generated. Several independent lines of transgenic mice were compared to age-matched normal control mice of identical genetic background (CD 1) by measuring their exploratory behaviors in novel situations.

40|$|The {{activity}} of midbrain dopamine neurons is strikingly {{similar to the}} reward prediction error of TD reinforcement learning models. Experimental evidence and simulation studies suggest that dopamine neuron activity serves as an effective reinforcement signal for learning of sensorimotor associations in striatal matrisomes. In the current study, we simulate dopamine neuron activity with the Extended TD model (Suri and Schultz, submitted) and examine the influence of this signal on medium spiny neurons in striatal matrisomes. This model includes transient membrane effects of dopamine, dopamine-dependent long-term adaptations of corticostriatal transmission, and rhythmic fluctuations of the membrane potential between an elevated “up-state ” and a hyperpolarized “down-state. ” The most dominant activity in the striatal matrisomes elicits behaviors via projections from the basal ganglia to the thalamus and the cortex. This “standard model ” performs successfully when tested for sensorimotor learning and goal-directed behavior (planning). To investigate the contributions of these model assumptions to learning and planning, we test the performance of several model variants that <b>lack</b> one <b>of</b> these mechanisms. These simulations show that the adaptation of the dopamine-like signal is necessary for planning and for sensorimotor learning. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> dopamine-like <b>novelty</b> responses decreases the number of exploratory acts, which deteriorates planning capabilities. Sensorimotor learning requires dopamine-dependent long-term adaptation of corticostriatal transmission. The model loses its planning capabilities if the dopamine-like signal is simulated with the original TD model. The capability for planning is improved by transient dopamine membrane effects, dopamine-dependent long-term effects on corticostriatal transmission, dopamine- and input-dependent influences on the durations of membrane potential fluctuations, and manipulations that prolong the reaction time of the model. These simulation results suggest that striatal dopamine is important for sensorimotor learning, exploration, and planning...|$|R
