40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} problem of {{distributed}} control of a large network of double-integrator agents to maintain a rigid formation. A few <b>lead</b> <b>vehicles</b> are given information on the desired trajectory of the formation; while every other vehicle uses linear controller which only depends on relative position and velocity from a few other vehicles, which are called its neighbors. A predetermined information graph defines the neighbor relationships. We limit our attention to information graphs that are D-dimensional lattices, and examine the sta-bility margin of the closed loop, which {{is measured by the}} real part of the least stable eigenvalue of the state matrix. The stability margin is shown to decay to 0 as O(1 /N 2 /D) when the graph is “square”, where N is the number of agents. Therefore, increasing the dimension of the information graph can improve the stability margin by a significant amount. For a non-square information graph, the stability margin can be made independent of N by choosing the “aspect ratio ” appropriately. An information graph with large D may require nodes that are physically apart to exchange information. Similarly, choosing an aspect ratio to improve stability margin may entail {{an increase in the number}} of <b>lead</b> <b>vehicles.</b> These results are useful to the designer in making trade-offs between performance and cost in designing information exchange architectures for decentralized control.

40|$|Abstract- Visual cues {{that are}} {{relevant}} to safe car driving are generally not supported by redundant non-visual cues, resulting in increased accident risk when visual attention is misallocated. Haptic gas pedal feedback, also referred to as longitudinal impedance, may assist drivers in proper and timely reallocation of their visual attention.

Car driving simulations, that include a RADAR-like sensor model and a human driver model, were performed for several highway maneuvers. The simulations indicated that the calculated gas pedal feedback force is a weighted mix of hazard-defining variables depending on the positions of the <b>lead</b> <b>vehicles</b> in front of the own vehicle...|$|R

500|$|Initially the Australians {{had used}} their APCs {{to secure the}} landing zone at the jungle's edge, however with the {{infantry}} in trouble they were subsequently dispatched as a relief force. Three M113s from 2 Troop under Sergeant Frank Graham entered the rainforest shortly after 17:15; however, lacking clear directions to B Company's position [...] away, they fumbled around in the dense vegetation before locating A Company instead. Instructed by Mackay {{to head for the}} white smoke of the bush fire, in error the APCs then set out towards the most obvious smoke further to the south-east of B Company. A Viet Cong 75mm recoilless rifle subsequently engaged the <b>lead</b> <b>vehicle</b> twice at close range, though both rounds missed, exploding in the trees nearby. Still unsure of B Company's location, Graham was unwilling to engage the Viet Cong position with heavy machine-guns for fear of hitting his own men, and the cavalry subsequently withdrew. Later it was discovered that the cavalry had likely been engaged by elements defending the Viet Cong headquarters. Meanwhile, due to the threat posed by the Viet Cong anti-tank weapons the remainder of 2 Troop then arrived under the command Second Lieutenant David Watts to provide added protection; in total 12 vehicles. A further attempt to reach B Company by the cavalry also failed however, after the A Company guide became disorientated in the thick vegetation. Mackay then threw coloured smoke, while Sioux helicopters arrived overhead to guide the vehicles to their position. B Company's casualties now amounted to seven men killed and 19 wounded.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Modern driver {{assistance}} {{systems such as}} collision avoidance or intersection assistance need reliable information on the current environment. Extracting such information from camera-based systems is a complex and challenging task for inner city traffic scenarios. This paper presents an approach for object detection utilizing sparse scene flow. For consecutive stereo images taken from a moving vehicle, corresponding interest points are extracted. Thus, for every interest point, disparity and optical flow values are known and consequently, scene flow can be calculated. Adjacent interest points describing a similar scene flow are considered to belong to one rigid object. The proposed method does not rely on object classes and allows for a robust detection of dynamic objects in traffic scenes. <b>Leading</b> <b>vehicles</b> are continuously detected for several frames. Oncoming objects are detected within five frames after their appearance. I...|$|R

In fact, microscopic car following models capture the tactical maneuvering decisions of drivers, in order to maintain a safe distance and avoid collision with the <b>lead</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Furthermore, the chapter describes how vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) wireless communication networks can be used in preventing rear-end collisions.

Simulator results also show that participants drove with greater safety margins to <b>lead</b> <b>vehicles</b> and maintained better lateral positioning when driving with the interface, indicating that integrated multiple-staged warnings can {{have a positive effect on}} driver behaviour if correctly designed...|$|R
