5|$|Early on the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, March1, at 1:08pm CST (19:08 UTC), a destructive tornado first developed near the Enterprise Municipal Airport. The tornado lifted off the ground briefly before returning to the ground as an even stronger storm. It quickly slammed into Enterprise, Alabama, at 1:12pm CST (19:12 UTC). The tornado left severe damage throughout a large section of the city. The most severe damage took place at Enterprise High School, where a section of the school was destroyed {{during the middle of the}} school day. Eight students were killed at the school and 50 other people were taken to local hospitals. Some early reports suggested that there had been as many as 15 deaths at Enterprise High School and 18 deaths statewide, which was found to be an over-estimation. It was the first killer tornado at a US school since the Grand Isle, Louisiana tornado in 1993, and the deadliest tornado-related school disaster since one in Belvidere, Illinois in 1967. One other death was reported in Enterprise at a nearby private residence when a woman's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>window</b> was shattered by the tornado.|$|E
500|$|Ryan White {{attended}} Western Middle School for {{eighth grade}} {{for the entire}} 1986–87 school year, but was deeply unhappy and had few friends. The school required him to eat with disposable utensils, use separate bathrooms, and waived his requirement to enroll in a gym class. Threats continued. When a bullet was fired through the White's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>window</b> (no one was home at the time), the family decided to leave Kokomo. After finishing the school year, {{his family moved to}} Cicero, Indiana, where the school district required him to enroll at Hamilton Heights High School, located in Arcadia, Indiana. On August 31, 1987, a [...] "very nervous" [...] Ryan White was greeted by school principal Tony Cook, school system superintendent Bob G. Carnal, and a handful of students who had been educated about AIDS and were unafraid to shake Ryan's hand.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Post Mortem", {{an elderly}} woman named Penny Garden was found dead, lying through her <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>window.</b> It was {{revealed}} that she was dying from cancer, and was heavily medicated. Her medication wasn’t found at the scene, leading Grissom’s team to assume that stealing the medication was the motive of the murder. This led to the suspicion that Penny’s reformed-junkie of a nephew was the murderer. However, this theory was put aside when the nephew brought forward a miniature model depicting the murder scene, which was apparently delivered shortly after the CSIs left the scene.|$|E
2500|$|The remodel brought ample {{exterior}} {{space to}} the house. [...] Matching porches extended into {{the front and rear}} yard {{on either side of the}} north-facing, vertical entry and stair tower. Both porches were terminated in a broad stair between elongated planting piers. Aside from additional planters below the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>window</b> and outside the stairway window, the yard was simply landscaped. A low concrete wall topped by a similarly short wrought iron fence was incorporated sometime after construction to enclose the yard along the south and east lot lines. [...] This fence continued along the eastern edge of Nathan Moore's property to the corner of Forest Avenue and Superior Street. The sidewalk at the front entrance was demarcated by Roman brick piers topped by glass-globed light fixtures. The yard additionally featured an original ticket booth from the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition which Moore had purchased and relocated to the site.|$|E

Each vivid lightning flash, and bellowing of booming thunder brought responsive cries of rage and terror from their hideous lips. It was Number Twelve who first spied the dim light showing through the bungalow's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>window.</b> With a low guttural to his companions he started toward the building. Up the low steps to the verandah they crept. Number Twelve peered through the window. He saw no one within, but there was warmth and dryness.|$|E

50|$|The {{dining room}} {{itself is a}} double-square in plan, and the triple-square of the service block is centred on it; the {{formality}} is entirely appropriate to the activity of dining and entertaining and can be interpreted, as Klaus Herdeg, an architect and author, has argued, as an architectural embodiment of the social traditions of the bourgeois family. Harry Gullichsen, {{as head of the}} household, occupied {{the head of the table}} facing towards the entrance. From there he could see along the axis to the entrance and beyond into the pine forest through the clerestory windows above the vestibule, and also diagonally through the entire <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Mrs. Gullichsen would occupy the seat at the opposite end of the table, conveniently close to the servery and kitchen, from where, as Herdeg writes, she ‘can contemplate her husband silhouetted against the dining room’s asymmetrical fireplace, while through the window she can see the sauna, the pool, the garden court, and the pine forest - things natural or traditional. Most of these views the father would only see reflected in an artifice, the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
25|$|New {{digital signal}} {{processing}} functionalities such as Room Correction, Bass Management, Loudness Equalization and Speaker Fill have been introduced. Speaker Fill mixes 2-channel content to use all available speakers {{in a manner similar}} to Creative's CMSS. Bass Management can be used to redirect the subwoofer signal to the main speakers. If a channel is missing, a feature called Channel Phantoming allows the best use of the speakers that are there, by redirecting the sound of the missing channels through these speakers. Whether you have a multi-channel or stereo sound system in your home theater or <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>Windows</b> Vista also includes the ability to calibrate your speakers for your room. By placing a microphone where you plan to sit and then running a wizard that measures the <b>room</b> response, <b>Windows</b> Vista can automatically set the levels, delay and frequency balance for each channel accordingly for this position. For PCs equipped with stereo headphones, Vista adds the ability to have surround sound using a new feature called Headphone Virtualization, which uses technology based upon a Head-related transfer function.|$|R

When Marge, Bart and Lisa claim there's nothing wrong with them, he decides to prove to them that there is something wrong. He takes them {{on a tour of the}} neighborhood, peeking through <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>windows</b> to observe how happy families spend time together. The rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homer's sudden rash behavior along with unnecessarily spying on their neighbors and retreat quickly back to the safety of their own home. Depressed by the outing, he stops by Moe's Tavern for a drink. After getting into a fight with Barney, Homer later sees a commercial for Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center.

40|$|Large scale noise {{exposure}} modelling {{is used in}} epidemiological research projects {{as well as for}} noise mapping and strategic action planning. Such calculations should always be accompanied by an assessment of uncertainty, on the one hand to check for systematic deviations {{and on the other hand}} to investigate the sources of uncertainty to address them in future studies. Within the SiRENE (Short and Long Term Effects of Transportation Noise Exposure) project, a large scale nationwide assessment of Switzerland’s road, railway, and aircraft {{noise exposure}} was conducted for the year 2011. In the present follow-up study, we equipped 180 sleeping and/or <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>windows</b> with sound level meters for one week. The resulting dataset was used to validate noise exposure modelling within SiRENE. For the noise metric LDEN the comparison revealed a difference of 1. 6 ± 5 dB(A) when taking all measurements into account. After removing measurement sites with noise mitigation measures not considered in the modelling, the difference to the calculation was reduced to 0. 5 ± 4 dB(A). As major sources of uncertainty, the position accuracy and topicality of infrastructure and building geometries, the traffic modelling as well as the acoustic source and propagation models were identified...|$|R

The street front façade has three wide horizontal bands set out from the main wall surface that emphasize the design’s horizontal orientation.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} {{in residential}} dwellings {{is very important}} for occupants' health and comfort. Previous studies by the authors have concluded that natural ventilation performance in dwellings can be enhanced by positioning the two groups of window openings (bedroom <b>windows</b> and <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>windows)</b> in opposite directions or perpendicular to each other; and/or the use of side-hung windows. However, the buildings selected for those studies were located in an isolated site, for the purpose of focused evaluation of the influence of various configuration parameters and window types. However, in Hong Kong, buildings are tightly packed. In this study, the influence of urban environment was thoroughly considered. A residential estate was identified to represent typical characteristics of the urban environment in Hong Kong for CFD modelling and simulations. Bi-variate correlations and K-means cluster analyses were adopted to identify a set of probable local wind conditions, which took into account the combined influence of prevailing wind conditions, urban environment and building levels. Through side-by-side comparison of results obtained with and without considering the influence of surrounding buildings, it was found that surrounding buildings lower the wind power available in the vicinity of buildings by 2. 5 % to 86. 8 %, increase the angular spread of prevailing winds and adversely affect natural ventilation in residential dwellings. The increase in the mean age of air (MAA) is 0. 6 times to 1. 5 times. In respect of influence of openings configurations and window types, the conclusion drawn in this study was found to be in agreement with previous studies.

40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} {{performance of}} a residential dwelling is affected {{by a combination of}} internal and external factors. External factors are often subject to constraints beyond the control of site planners and architects. Internal factors include the openings configuration, which site planners and architects are free to design the way they deem proper. However, little information is available in this regard. In this study, a case study was conducted by tracer-gas measurements at a carefully selected residential unit for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model validation. A hypothetical residential unit was formulated to represent the characteristics of typical residential units in Hong Kong. CFD simulations were performed based on the hypothetical unit to evaluate the influence of different openings configurations on natural ventilation performance using the mean age of air. Openings configuration is defined by many parameters. Among the three studied parameters, evaluation results indicate that natural ventilation performance of residential units was most affected by the relative position of the two window openings groups (i. e. bedroom <b>windows</b> and <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>windows),</b> followed by building orientation and doors positions. It was found that better natural ventilation performance could be achieved when the two openings groups were positioned in opposite directions or perpendicular to each other. The combined effect of the three parameters was evaluated. It was found that varying two parameters at the same time offered positive improvements in natural ventilation performance, but varying all three parameters did not result in any improvement because of the counter-effects of changes in doors positions.
