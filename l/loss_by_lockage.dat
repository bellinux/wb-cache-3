30|$|Results Mean age was 57 (± 18) years, APACHE II score 27 (± 6); Nutrition was enteral in 6 patients, {{parenteral}} in 1; 1 patient did {{not receive}} nutrition (shock). Total AA loss (mg/h), AA <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> ultrafiltration (mg/h), and AA <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> adsorption (mg/h) at 1 -h, 8 -h, 24 -h after start of CVVH, are shown in Fig.  133. Patient nr 8, with acute ischemic liver failure, had the greatest loss of amino acids. The total amino acid loss (p[*]=[*] 0.276), <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> ultrafiltration (p[*]=[*] 0.876) and <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> adsorption (p[*]=[*] 0.368) did not change {{during the course of}} CVVH.

40|$|The silty soils of the intensively used {{agricultural}} {{landscape of the}} Saxon loess province, eastern Germany, are very prone to soil erosion, mainly caused by water erosion. Rainfall simulations, and also increasingly structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, are used as methods in soil erosion research not only to assess soil erosion by water, but also to quantify soil loss. This study aims to validate SfM photogrammetry determined soil loss estimations with rainfall simulations measurements. Rainfall simulations were performed at three agricultural sites in central Saxony. Besides the measured data runoff and soil <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> sampling (in mm), terrestrial images {{were taken from the}} plots with digital cameras before and after the rainfall simulation. Subsequently, SfM photogrammetry was used to reconstruct soil surface changes due to soil erosion in terms of high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) for the pre- and post-event (resolution 1 × 1 mm). By multi-temporal change detection, the digital elevation model of difference (DoD) and an averaged soil loss (in mm) is received, which was compared to the soil <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> sampling. Soil <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> DoD was higher than soil <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> sampling. The method of SfM photogrammetry-determined soil loss estimations also include a comparison of three different ground control point (GCP) approaches, revealing that the most complex one delivers the most reliable soil <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> DoD. Additionally, soil bulk density changes and splash erosion beyond the plot were measured during the rainfall simulation experiments in order to separate these processes and associated surface changes from the soil <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> DoD. Furthermore, splash was negligibly small, whereas higher soil densities after the rainfall simulations indicated soil compaction. By means of calculated soil surface changes due to soil compaction, the soil <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> DoD achieved approximately the same value as the soil <b>loss</b> <b>by</b> rainfall simulation...|$|R
