30|$|The {{deformed}} mesh on {{the right}} in Fig. 6 was computed with a mesh of 16 × 16 × 8 elements which lead to a total number of 59058 degrees of freedoms. The deformation at the final configuration clearly depicts the twist in the deformed shape due to the anisotopic constraint at large deformations. The solution was computed with several <b>load</b> <b>steps.</b> In total eight <b>load</b> <b>steps</b> were applied for all discretizations reported in Fig. 7. The convergence behaviour was robust, six iterations per <b>load</b> <b>step</b> were needed for all discretizations to obtain convergence.

40|$|We {{consider}} a fiber bundle {{model with a}} equal load sharing and uniformly distributed breakdown thresholds. A unified probability-theoretic approach was used to describe bundle under continuous and discrete load increase. It was shown that the ratio of distribution D(d) of avalanches of sizes d {{to the number of}} bundle load steps exactly corresponds to burst probability of size d. Evolution of s - power law distribution exponent of D(d) was studied as a function of <b>loading</b> <b>step</b> and bundle size. It was shown that s does not depend on bundle size. In the numerical experiment, dependence s on <b>loading</b> <b>step</b> was obtained with fiber bundle size up to N= 10 ^ 10. The regions of s values constancy and the transition region were found.

40|$|In this paper, {{the use of}} {{incremental}} displacement collocation method (IDCM) {{for the evaluation of}} the tension softening curve of quasi-brittle materials is presented. By varying the residual tensile stress on the tension softening curve (TSC) for each <b>loading</b> <b>step,</b> the measured displacements are matched with the computed displacements at selected locations. By gradually increasing the <b>loading</b> <b>step,</b> the complete TSC can be determined in a step-by-step manner. As distinct global and local deformation responses are employed in the IDCM, the ill-posed problem commonly encountered in other inverse analyses is avoided. The effectiveness of the IDCM is demonstrated by obtaining TSCs of quasi-brittle materials, such as mortar, concrete and graphite, in the forms of bilinear, tri-linear and exponential curves. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} {{criterion}} for crack opening in FCC single crystals based on analyses of lattice orientation and interface energy of two adjacent crystals in a crystal plasticity – {{finite element model}} (CPFEM). It also demonstrates {{the implementation of the}} criterion in Abaqus/Standard to simulate crack initiation and propagation in single-edged notch single crystal aluminium samples. Elements in the FEM mesh that have crystalline structures satisfying the crack opening criterion are removed from the mesh {{at the end of every}} <b>loading</b> <b>step</b> and FEM analyses are restarted on the new mesh in the next <b>loading</b> <b>step.</b> Removed elements effectively act as voids in the material due to crack nucleation. Similarly, the coalescence of newly removed elements at the end of a <b>loading</b> <b>step</b> with the existent ones simulates crack growth in the material. Two advantages of this approach are noted. Firstly, crack nucleation and its subsequent growth in the material is simulated solely based on lattice evolution history in the material without any presumptions of crack paths or regions where cracks are likely to occur. Secondly, as the criterion for crack nucleation is evaluated based on, and thus changes with, the lattice evolution during loading, a predefined energy criterion for crack opening, which could be erroneous, is avoided. Preliminary results of void nucleation and void growth around the notch tip in Cube and Brass oriented samples using CPFEM modelling appear to agree with molecular dynamics simulations of void growth in FCC single crystals...|$|E

30|$|It can be grasped {{that the}} rapid {{increase}} of cumulative time in Fig.  10 for both formulation appears at <b>loading</b> <b>steps</b> {{related to the}} peak points 2 and 4. Also, regardless of the formulation, the computational time per step in Fig.  11 at these points is significantly higher (by almost two orders of magnitude, to be more precise) than at the pre-peak <b>loading</b> <b>steps.</b> These observations correlate with the convergence results from Fig.  9.|$|R

30|$|The results {{exposed in}} Figure 4 {{confirms}} {{the hypothesis that}} lower polyelectrolyte concentrations results in less host sites (carboxylic functional groups) for the Ag+ cations during the <b>loading</b> <b>step,</b> and after the reduction with DMAB, the amount of silver nanoparticles is significantly lower.

30|$|As {{one can see}} in Figs.  5 and 6, maximum {{deflection}} corresponds to the first <b>loading</b> <b>step</b> at the rubbery material state, because the elastic modulus is very low at this temperature.

30|$|Kawashima et al. (2006) {{studied the}} effect of {{bilateral}} excitation on the seismic performance of RC bridge columns with 1.35 m tall and 400 × 400 mm cross-section, using cyclic and hybrid loading tests. In the cyclic loading test, the columns were loaded unilaterally or bilaterally using diagonal, square, circular and elliptic displacement paths. For the hybrid loading cases, the ground accelerations of the Kobe and Northridge earthquakes were used. In the cyclic tests, the loading and unloading hysteresis curves are round near the peak displacements under the bilateral loading, which results from the interaction of restoring forces in two directions. Only the hysteresis at the first excursions, in each <b>loading</b> <b>step,</b> has a feature similar to that under the unilateral loading. This is because, under the circular-path loading, the column was first loaded only in the N direction in the first excursions at each <b>loading</b> <b>step.</b> Comparing {{to the strength of}} the column under bilateral hybrid loading, the strength of the column under bilateral cyclic loading is 14 % to 23 % and 15 % to 35 % smaller in NS and EW directions, respectively. Furthermore, the deterioration of the lateral restoring force is significant after 3 % of drift, while deterioration did not occur until 6.3 % peak drift under the bilateral hybrid loading. Flexural strength and ductility capacity of RC bridge columns with a square section significantly deteriorate under the bilateral excitation in comparison with unilateral excitation in both cyclic and hybrid loading tests. Failure of the columns under the cyclic loading test, for which the loading displacement was increased stepwise with three loading excursions at each <b>loading</b> <b>step,</b> is more extensive than the failure developed in the hybrid loading test. In fact, loading protocol is important, {{and it has to be}} carefully determined in the cyclic loading tests.|$|E

After unloading in glassy state the deflection decreases by a small value, because the glassy elastic modulus significantly exceeds the rubbery one.

40|$|Static {{stability}} of thin-walled structures is significantly influenced by random imperfection in their geometric form. The problem {{should be considered}} {{on the level of}} stochastic approach. Consequently, stochastic version of the FEM should be taken into account. Subsequent solution methods presented in literature are limited as a rule to the first approximation only. It leads to results being more or less in a contradistinction with the energy equilibrium law and with the fact, that the PDF of the response is non-Gaussian and non-symmetric. It seems in general that solution methods based on principles of decomposition into stochastic moments, cumulants and other series are not convenient to solve this problem. The stochastic simulation reveals also non-realistic when taking into account a number of unknown components of the displacement vector. A compromising procedure being based on an application of the Bayes Theorem seems to be promising. Various versions of this approach related with incremental method, arc length method, etc. can be set up. The basic form being based on the incremental method driven by the Bayes algorithm is presented in this paper. Using incremental method combined with Bayes formula, the PDF of node displacements in each <b>loading</b> <b>step</b> can be computed with prescribed accuracy comparing prior and posterior PDF of the response in a particular <b>loading</b> <b>step.</b> Because the posterio...|$|E
40|$|The displacement-like {{finite element}} {{formulation}} for finite-step J 2 elastoplasticity is revisited in this paper. The classical computational strategy, according to which, plastic loading is tested at the Gauss points of each element {{and an independent}} return mapping algorithm is performed for given incremental displacements, is consistently derived from a suitably discretized version of a min-max variational principle. The sequence of solution phases to be performed within each <b>load</b> <b>step</b> adopting a full Newton's method is illustrated in detail {{and the importance of}} a correct update of the plastic strains is emphasized. It is further shown that, in order to increase the rate of convergence and the stability properties of the Newton's method, the consistent elastoplastic tangent operator must be exploited even at the first iteration of each <b>load</b> <b>step</b> subsequent to the first yielding of the structural model. This is in contrast with the traditional implementation according to which the elastic operator is used at the first iteration of each <b>load</b> <b>step.</b> The effectiveness of the present approach is shown by a set of numerical examples referred to plane strain problems...|$|R
40|$|This study explores key {{computational}} {{issues that}} aect analyses employing the computational cell methodology to predict crack growth in ductile metals caused by void growth and coalescence. These issues — computational <b>load</b> <b>step</b> size, procedures to remove cells with high porosity from the analysis, and the porosity for cell deletion — can adversely aect predicted crack growth resistance (R) curves and/or hinder convergence of both local constitutive and global iterative computations. Strain increments generated by large computational <b>load</b> <b>steps</b> introduce {{errors in the}} predicted peak stress of computational cells and prevent convergence of stress updates for the Gurson–Tvergaard constitutive model. An adaptive load control algorithm, which limits the maximum porosity over a <b>load</b> <b>step,</b> eliminates this problem. The delayed release of remaining forces in newly deleted cells elements elevates the stress triaxiality and thus artificially accelerates the rate of crack extension. The release of cell forces using a traction-separation model minimizes this eect while maintaining good numerical convergence of the solutions. Crack growth analyses for a moderate strength steel demonstrate that critical porosity values 8 ̆ 5 fE between 0. 1 and 0. 2 show almost no eect on predicted R-curves, while both larger and smaller values lead to low J–Da curves. Finally, a parametric study indicates that specimens of low-hardening materials and specimens with high crack-front constraint show a stronger influence of large computational <b>load</b> <b>steps</b> and the delayed release of cell forces.
