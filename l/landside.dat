5|$|The {{natives of}} the Sula valley, led by their cacique Sicumba, put up fierce {{resistance}} against Alvarado's forces. Alvarado {{marched to the}} lower reaches of the Ulúa valley {{to put an end}} to Sicumba's resistance once and for all. Sicumba was confident in the strength of a fortress he had built on the banks of the Ulúa River, and in the abilities of his warriors, reinforced by the Maya warriors brought by Gonzalo Guerrero to assist him. These Maya allies were probably from Chetumal, in Yucatán, where Guerrero had settled. Alvarado launched a dual assault by land and water against the fortress, supported by indigenous Guatemalan auxiliaries and by artillery. The fighting took place both around the walls of the fortress, and on canoes in the river. Attempts to storm the <b>landside</b> wall failed, and Alvarado's assault succeeded by the use of canoe-mounted artillery attacking from the river.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that the slope bodies are rigid, the dynamic model of the <b>landsiding</b> (forward model) was put forward. According to the dynamic model, the system equations of Kalman filter were constituted. The mechanical status of a slope was hence combined with the monitoring data by Kalman filter. The model uncertainties or model errors could also be considered through some fictitious observation equations. Different from existed methods, the presented method can make use for not only the statistic information contained in the data but also the information provided by the mechanical and geological aspect of slopes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to make clear the {{characteristics}} of microforms developed on the first-order vally side slope. The study area, covered with natural forest, is located in the northern part of Osaka Prefecture, West Japan. The results obtained are summarized by the following. Microforms developed on the slope are devided into two types. One is a small love which has been formed by miniature earth flows. The other is micro cliff or step-like form which has been produced by minute <b>landsides.</b> These microforms appear at about 3 meter intervals along the slope profiles. Especially, the middle and lower parts of the slope are most favorable for an intensive development of the microforms in question. The segment at which the microforms develop most frequently is a transitional one from thick part to shallow in regolith thickness. This suggests that rising water table in the transition zone at the time of rainfall may trigger generation of numerous mass wastings to produce a number of the microforms...|$|R

Landslides are frequent and widespread geomorphological phenomena the world over (Guzzetti, 1999; Dai et al. 2002; Das et al. 2010). Several {{people were killed and}} many more trapped when landslides were triggered by a heavy downpour in October 14 th 2013 in the tourist town of Obudu that hosts thousands of foreign visitors annually. Helicopters rescued foreign and local people who were stranded inside this popular amusement and strategic arena. While early rains {{at the beginning of the}} wet season are usually the cause of most landslides in some parts of southeastern Nigeria, heavy rains during the peak season induced mass movements on the mountains of Obudu. There had been no sign of rain on the fateful day as tourist scanned the scenery.

40|$|BGS {{capabilities}} in geomorphological mapping and slope monitoring have been significantly improved by {{the acquisition of}} a high-accuracy global positioning system (GPS) and terrestrially based LIght Distance And Ranging system (LIDAR). This equipment was originally purchased and developed by the BGS CliffScan project, (Project leader Peter Hobbs), part of the Coastal Geoscience and Global Change Programme. The aim of this project is to carry out sequential surveying and modelling of the changing profiles of various sites around the coast of England. Cliff sections provided a good basis for the scanning process, providing the user with good vertical and horizontal sections, constantly changing profiles and stable targets for back-sites (at most locations). The cliff sections also provided definitive breaks of slope i. e. the cliff junction with beach deposits and the top cliff line, which could also be recorded with the GPS. The development programme, undertaken as part of CliffScan has enabled BGS to gain experience in mapping and scanning coastal features. (Hobbs et al 2002, Gibson et al 2003 and Jones 2003). This experience has been applied and further developed by the Landslides Project {{for the application of}} these techniques to inland <b>landsides...</b>|$|R

In Costa Rica, some areas near the border with Nicaragua observed over a month's worth of rainfall; three-day accumulations exceeded 8 in in many areas. The highest recorded total was 12.11 in at the Miravalles Volcano. The National Meteorological Institute of Costa Rica reported that Otto killed at least ten people in the country, mostly from flash flooding and <b>landsides,</b> including six in Upala, three in Bagaces, and one in Guayabo. Costa Rican president Luis Guillermo Solis described the situation as [...] "chaotic and unprecedented," [...] with the worst effects in Upala canton. Authorities calculated at least ₡106 billion colónes (US$190 million) in damages across the country, including US$68 million in Upala canton, and another US$34 million in Bagaces. The hurricane damaged 14 water systems. The president declared three days of national mourning {{in the wake of}} the hurricane. Officials opened 38 shelters that housed 3,370 people, mostly in Upala. About 10,000 people required humanitarian assistance following the storm.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to carry out a {{detailed}} soil survey to determine soil types and their influence on landslide occurrence in Bududa District in eastern Uganda. Four transects were chosen following zones with and without <b>landsides.</b> Soil profile description and classification was done using FAO methods. Infiltration rates were measured as described by Landon in 1991. Results show that the soil types are those conditioned by topography and tropical climate namely Nitisols, Cambisols, Lixisols, Ferralsols, Leptosols, Gleysols, and Acrisols. Soil type was not significant in landslide occurrences. However soil texture in the horizons was significant in some of the landslides especially in the western zone. One factor that was common to all soils sampled in the western side was the same soil texture of clay down the profile and the subsequent absence of landslides in the surroundings of the profiles. In the eastern zone soil profile horizon is significant in some of the landslides but in the shallow landslides the slope and the shallow depth which creates a discontinuity between the saprolite and the rock causing water stagnation is the main influence. The clay minerals present are high plasticity clays; Kaolinite and Illite. The infiltration rate of the top soils is generally rapid in the top soils, allowing fast flow of water into the deeper horizons. status: publishe...|$|R
