40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master of Science Thesis was {{to develop}} an MS Excel-based {{calculation}} tool for cooling and heating capacities in Halton Group´s new product, the Fan Coil Unit. The Fan Coil Unit is commonly used in passenger cabins of cruisers to cool or heat the cabin air. The number of customer orders of the Fan Coil Unit has been increasing, therefore, Halton Group’s subdivision Marine had a need to get this tool to save time, which had earlier gone to calculations for each unit order separately. Cooling demand consists of two kinds of heat loads: latent and sensible heat load. The part of the heat load which is caused by evaporation, is called the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>load.</b> The <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> comes from for example the cabin, when the passenger's skin is sweating and from the shower facilities when water vapor is released into the cabin air.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two research problems in the air conditioning (A/C) area. For the first problem, {{the aim is to}} model and simulate a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioning system. The coefficient of performance (COP) for refrigeration or heat pump system is one of the critical parameters for designing an air conditioning system. The modeling of the system components for a VRF cycle under different cooling conditions using R- 134 a and R- 22 as refrigerants was carried out. Calculations were performed by varying different parameters such as condenser and evaporator temperatures, and refrigerant type. The R- 134 a refrigerant shows a better performance when multiple evaporators are present. Part load performance evaluation was also done for both refrigerants. The simulation results compared reasonably well with available experimental data. In the second problem, the objective is to develop a mathematical model that covers the mass, energy, entropy, and exergy balances of a typical air conditioning system. The model examines how the exergy efficiency of an air conditioning system can be used to measure its performance, bypass configuration, and additional significant environmental factors that affect an A/C system 2 ̆ 7 s design.

Sensible cooling load is estimated via a proportional integral controller-based input estimator, whereas a lumped parameters model was developed aiming at estimating {{air handling units}} (AHUs) <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> removal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose {{strategies}} of reducing energy consumption for cooling in residences under hot and humid climate such as Indonesia. Based on the results of field survey, a simulation of the indoor thermal environment considering the operation of an air-conditioner was carried out, in order to evaluate energy consumption by the air-conditioner. This simulation program takes into account both heat and moisture transports in the walls. The effects of air tightness and thermal insulation were examined. The results show that an increase in insulation on ceilings or roofs is essential to reduce the heat flow caused by the strong solar radiation. This is also true for the houses without air-conditioners. Increase in air tightness of only the air-conditioned room can effectively reduce electricity consumption, mainly due to the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>load.</b> Since energy consumption for cooling is expected to increase rapidly in hot and humid areas such as Southeast Asia, an introduction of high insulation and air tightness suitable to the local area will be required for energy saving. 1...|$|E
40|$|Polycrystalline NiTi Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) {{have been}} {{experimentally}} shown to exhibit some important features and effects under pure tension {{and more complex}} loading. These features are either rate dependent or connected to moving interface between austenite and marten site phases. They include observed peak and valley in stress during loading and unloading respectively, propagation stress plateaus, inhomogeneous deformation (transformation localization and front propagation) during transformation, stress relaxation, etc. It has also been experimentally observed that polycrystalline NiTi wires, strips, and tubes develop transformation strain via nucleation and growth of macroscopic martensitic domains under mechanical loading. Associated with these responses during transformation evolution are complex interactions between mechanical work, <b>heat</b> production, and <b>loading</b> rates. These interactions will affect the performance of SMAs when deployed as active components. Modeling effort is, therefore, needed to better understand this behavior. This study is a worthwhile contribution towards modeling these experimentally observed features and their effect so as to aid SMA design and applications. A 3 D thermodynamically consistent, thermomechanical, macroscopic phase field model capable of modeling kinetics of phase transition and hysteretic response of SMAs is presented.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dehumidification is {{the process}} of {{removing}} the moisture from air by chemical or physical methods. For a comfortable and healthy environment the two essential requirements are: adequate ventilation and good humidity control. But in very humid climates, which include much of the densely populated regions of the world, it is difficult to meet both these requirements without using a lot of electricity. One of the most common methods of dehumidification is the vapor compression system. The main disadvantage associated with vapor compression system is that it is an insufficient thermodynamic process. It requires the air to be cooled below its dew point, which lowers the temperature than needed to meet the sensible heat load. Thus, some source of additional energy is required to reheat the air to the desired delivery temperature. But liquid desiccant dehumidification technology removes the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> directly from the air. The liquid desiccant is then regenerated, again by using low grade heating source like solar energy. In addition to dehumidification, an added benefit of some desiccants is their ability to absorb inorganic and organic contaminants in the air. The effect of various inlet parameters is analysed in this paper...|$|E

Particle Image Velocimetry was used to examine idealized air curtains of various Reynolds and Richardson numbers. The air curtain entrainment was seen to be dominated by eddies that engulfed ambient air into the air curtain.

At low air velocities (Re= 1500), the curtain was found to detach, leading to extremely high entrainment rates. Variations in Richardson number of the curtain affected the flow at the curtain inlet most dramatically, where the acceleration of gravity caused the curtain to neck inwards. The overall thermal entrainment was shown to reduce with reducing Reynolds number, implying that a reduction in air curtain entrainment could be achieved by reducing the air velocity of the curtain, as long as air curtain integrity is maintained.

Basically they are substances capable of storing or releasing thermal energy as <b>latent</b> <b>heat.</b> Because the amount of <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> absorbed or released is {{much larger than the}} sensible heat, the application of PCMs in buildings has significant potential to reduce energy consumption.

40|$|The {{extended}} {{degree day}} method {{is a simple}} and prevailing calculation procedure of term <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> for buildings. Nevertheless, it has some unresolved problems; the estimation of <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> caused by rainfall at wall surfaces is one of them. The new extended degree day method is developed from the extended degree day method to estimate the effect of water evaporation at outdoor wall surfaces including glass windows. In this paper, the basic equations to transform the extended degree day method are shown introducing heat balance equations concepts of equivalent temperature and {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} at wetted wall surfaces...|$|R
50|$|When a body {{is heated}} at {{constant}} temperature by thermal radiation {{in a microwave}} field for example, it may expand by an amount described by its <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> with respect to volume or <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> of expansion, or increase its pressure by an amount described by its <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> with respect to pressure.Latent heat is energy released or absorbed, by a body or a thermodynamic system, during a constant-temperature process.Two common forms of <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> are <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> of fusion (melting) and <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> of vaporization (boiling). These names describe the direction of energy flow when changing from one phase to the next: from solid to liquid, and liquid to gas.|$|R
