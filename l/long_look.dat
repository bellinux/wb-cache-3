5|$|After what {{is later}} {{believed}} to have been at least three months, Daniel is finally able to reconstruct the planet's history with the finished translations: the Ancients had attempted to escape a mysterious plague by building a time machine but never got it to work properly. Upon returning to the planet, SG-1 learn of the death of Malikai's wife, whom Malikai wants to visit in the past {{with the help of the}} time machine. O'Neill's experience of his son's death convinces Malikai to shut down the device before yet another new loop can start. Back at the SGC, O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel have their first breakfast after the loops, and O'Neill answers Daniel's question about unusual activities in the loops with a <b>long</b> <b>look</b> at Carter.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} morning, Granger teaches Montag and {{the others}} about the legendary phoenix and its endless cycle of long life, death in flames, and rebirth. He adds that the phoenix must have some relationship to mankind, which constantly repeats its mistakes. Granger explains that man has something the phoenix does not: mankind can remember its mistakes and try never to repeat them. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built, so that way people can take a <b>long</b> <b>look</b> at themselves and reflect on their lives. When the meal is over, the exiles return {{to the city to}} rebuild society.|$|E
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a <b>long</b> <b>look</b> at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

The DVD+CD containing the documentary and a live album of highlights from the show was also released in May 2006.

500|$|... "The Beginning" [...] was {{the first}} episode to be filmed in Los Angeles, California. The move was instigated by David Duchovny, who portrayed Mulder, in order to {{increase}} his opportunity to find movie work as well as to {{give him a chance to}} be nearer to his wife, Téa Leoni. Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move, but Fox network officials eventually made the decision to film in California. Indeed, the very first shot of the episode—a <b>long</b> <b>look</b> into the sun—was intended by Carter to [...] "boldly announce the show's arrival in Southern California". As a result of the move, the episode featured a largely new group of crew members, hired by Carter, Frank Spotnitz and new co-executive producer Michael Watkins. The show's crew had to spend five weeks unpacking and cataloging material from the Vancouver film crew. Although the move was unpopular with some members of the cast and crew, both series director Kim Manners and Gillian Anderson supported the move, although less vocally than Duchovny.|$|E
500|$|In New York City, Carl {{presents}} [...] "Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World" [...] on Broadway, starring Baxter and an imprisoned Kong. Ann {{is played}} by an anonymous chorus girl, and Kong becomes enraged after realizing that the girl on stage is not Ann. After breaking free from his chrome-steel chains, he wrecks the theater and chases Jack. Kong knocks Jack out by stopping his car and flipping it, then encounters Ann again. Kong and Ann share a moment on a frozen pond in Central Park until the army attacks. Kong climbs with Ann onto {{the top of the}} Empire State Building, where he fights off six F8C-5 Helldiver Navy planes, downing three. At the end of the confrontation, Kong is mortally wounded by the gunfire and gazes at Ann for the last time before falling from the building to his death. As Ann is reunited with Jack, civilians, photographers, police and soldiers gather around Kong's corpse. Carl makes his way through the crowd, takes one last <b>long</b> <b>look</b> at Kong and says, [...] "It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast." ...|$|E
500|$|For the CGI used {{throughout}} the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed {{different parts of the}} film. R focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that [...] "This is the first time where we had to do a whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where {{you were going to get}} a really <b>long</b> <b>look</b> at the water and what it was doing." [...] The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.|$|E

500|$|After {{five seasons}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, {{production}} of The X-Files moved to Los Angeles. [...] "The Beginning" [...] {{was the first}} episode to be filmed in the new location. The move was instigated by David Duchovny, who portrayed Mulder, in order to ease his opportunity to find movie {{work as well as}} to {{give him a chance to}} be nearer to his wife, Téa Leoni.

Although the move was unpopular with some members of the cast and crew, both series director Kim Manners and actress Gillian Anderson supported the move, although less vocally than Duchovny. Many fans accused the show of [...] "Hollywood-izing" [...] by adding notable guests stars as well as making the plots simpler and more enjoyable for mass audiences. In addition, Space.com reported that many fans of show loved [...] "the moody ambiance filming around Vancouver lent the series [...] ", which the sixth season reportedly lacked.|$|E

In her 80s, she published Beyond the Sunset, laughing at the sequence as at a pleasant joke that life had played upon her. Almost half the poems in that last little volume were written within {{a year and a half}} of her 85th birthday, but she did not stop with them.

2500|$|Entering the 1973 season, Stewart {{had decided}} to retire. He {{nevertheless}} won at South Africa, Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands, and Austria. His last and then record-setting 27th victory came at the Nürburgring with a 1–2 for Tyrrell. [...] "Nothing gave me more satisfaction than to win at the Nürburgring and yet, I was always afraid." [...] Stewart later said. [...] "When I left home for the German Grand Prix I always used to pause {{at the end of}} the driveway and take a <b>long</b> <b>look</b> back. I was never sure I'd come home again." [...] After the fatal crash of his teammate François Cevert in practice for the 1973 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Stewart retired one race earlier than intended and missed what would have been his 100th Grand Prix. Stewart had already won the Drivers' Championship at the Italian Grand Prix two races previously; this was a race where Stewart had to come into the pits to change a flat tyre, and he drove from 20th to finish 4th.|$|E
