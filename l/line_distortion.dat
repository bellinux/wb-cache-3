Often attributed to microlensing differential magnification, <b>line</b> profile <b>distortions</b> can provide information on the geometry and kinematics of the broad emission line region (BLR) in quasars. We investigate the effect of gravitational microlensing on quasar broad emission line profiles and their underlying continuum, combining the emission from simple representative BLR models with generic microlensing magnification maps. Specifically, we considered Keplerian disk, polar, and equatorial wind BLR models of various sizes. The effect of microlensing has been quantified with four observables: μ[SUP]BLR[/SUP], the total magnification of the broad emission line; μ[SUP]cont[/SUP], the magnification of the underlying continuum; as well as red/blue, RBI and wings/core, WCI, indices that characterize the <b>line</b> profile <b>distortions.</b> The simulations showed that <b>distortions</b> of <b>line</b> profiles, such as those recently observed in lensed quasars, can indeed be reproduced and attributed to the differential effect of microlensing on spatially separated regions of the BLR. While the magnification of the emission line μ[SUP]BLR[/SUP] sets an upper limit on the BLR size and, similarly, the magnification of the continuum μ[SUP]cont[/SUP] sets an upper limit {{on the size of the}} continuum source, the <b>line</b> profile <b>distortions</b> mainly depend on the BLR geometry and kinematics. We thus built (WCI,RBI) diagrams that can serve as diagnostic diagrams to discriminate between the various BLR models on the basis of quantitative measurements. It appears that a strong microlensing effect puts important constraints on the size of the BLR and on its distance to the high-magnification caustic. In that case, BLR models with different geometries and kinematics are more prone to produce distinctive <b>line</b> profile <b>distortions</b> for a limited number of caustic configurations, which facilitates their discrimination. When the microlensing effect is weak, there is a larger overlap between the characteristics of the <b>line</b> profile <b>distortions</b> produced by the different models, and constraints can only be derived on a statistical basis.

The time series spectra of both objects reveal numerous <b>line</b> profile <b>distortions</b> over the rotation period of each star which we interpret as starspots.

For GJ 791. 2 A, the radial velocities induced by the starspot features yield an rms velocity variability of 138 m/s, which can be reduced by a factor of 1. 9 using our reconstructed surface brightness distributions.

Our results show that while the mass term actively suppresses the intrinsic quantum entanglement of bilayer eigenstates, the bias voltage term spreads the entanglement in the Brillouin zone around the Dirac points.

However, to accurately model such lightcurves the observations need {{to cover the}} entire transit, especially ingress and egress, {{as well as an}} out-of-transit baseline. Such observations can be challenging for long period planets, where the transits may last for over a day. Planetary rings will also impact the shape of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, as the planet and rings cover different parts of the rotating star (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect). These line-profile distortions depend on the size, structure, opacity, obliquity and sky projected angle of the ring system. For slow rotating stars, this mainly impacts the amplitude of the induced velocity shift, however, for fast rotating stars the large velocity gradient across the star allows the <b>line</b> <b>distortion</b> to be resolved, enabling direct determination of the ring parameters. We demonstrate that by modeling these distortions we can recover ring system parameters (sky-projected angle, obliquity and size) using {{only a small part of}} the transit. Substructure in the rings, e. g. gaps, can be recovered if the width of the features (δ W) relative to the size of the star is similar to the intrinsic velocity resolution (set by the width of the local stellar profile, γ) relative to the stellar rotation velocity (v sini, i. e. δ W / R_* ≳ vsini/γ).

Despite significant efforts to capture the behavior of a droplet on these surfaces over the past few decades, modeling of the complex dynamics at the three-phase contact line is needed. In this work, we demonstrate that contact <b>line</b> <b>distortion</b> on heterogeneous and superhydrophobic surfaces is the key aspect that needs to be accounted for in the dynamic droplet models. Contact line distortions were visualized and modeled using a thermodynamic approach to develop a unified model for contact angle hysteresis on chemically heterogeneous and superhydrophobic surfaces. On a surface comprised of discrete wetting defects on an interconnected less wetting area, the advancing contact angle was determined to be independent of the defects, while the relative fraction of the distorted contact line with respect to the baseline surface was shown to govern the receding contact angle. This behavior reversed when the relative wettability of the discrete defects and interconnected area was inverted. The developed model showed good agreement with the experimental advancing and receding contact angles, both at low and high solid fractions. The thermodynamic model was further extended to demonstrate its capability to capture droplet shape evolution during liquid addition and removal in our experiments and those in literature.

These difficulties are circumvented {{by the use of}} an Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) accessory. However, when protein solutions are studied, ATR spectroscopy suffers from several drawbacks, the most severe being nonproportionality of the observed absorbance with the protein concentration and spectral distortions that vary from protein to protein and from sample to sample. In this study, we show (1) that the nonproportionality is due to adsorption of the protein on the ATR crystal surface; (2) that the contribution of the crystal-adsorbed protein can easily be taken into account, rendering the corrected absorbance proportional to the protein concentration; (3) that the observed variable base <b>line</b> <b>distortions,</b> likely due to changes in the penetration depth of the light beam in solutions with the refractive index that depends on the protein concentration, can be easily eliminated; and (4) that ATR IR spectra thus corrected for protein adsorption and light penetration can be used to properly analyze the secondary structure of proteins in solution...|$|R
