Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot.

5000|$|At {{the age of}} 14 {{an article}} {{entitled}} [...] "My Hobby has Wings" [...] about Noyes appeared in his local newspaper, the Pontypridd Observer; this 1963 article highlighted Noyes' interest in entomology at an early age. In 1967 he began studying for a degree in zoology and applied entomology at Imperial College, London where he completed his doctoral thesis on the biology of the <b>leek</b> <b>moth</b> (Acrolepiopsis assectella). In 1974 he was appointed as a researcher in the Chalcidoidea at the British Museum Natural History. He was seconded to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in New Zealand where he conducted {{a survey of the}} Chalcidoidea of New Zealand in 1980 and 1981. He travelled widely {{in the course of his}} research into the Chalcidoidea and has published over 80 papers, with some major monographs, and described one new family, 88 new genera and 644 new species of Chalcidoidea. When he retired he was reviewing the Costa Rican fauna of the Encyrtidae.|$|E
40|$|<b>Leek</b> <b>moth,</b> Acrolepiopsis assectella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Acrolepiidae), is an {{invasive}} {{alien species}} in eastern Canada, the larvae of which mine the green tissues of Allium spp. This {{study was designed to}} construct and analyse life tables for <b>leek</b> <b>moth</b> within its native range. Stage-specific mortality rates were estimated for the third <b>leek</b> <b>moth</b> generation at three sites in Switzerland from 2004 to 2006 to identify some of the principle factors that inhibit <b>leek</b> <b>moth</b> population growth in areas of low pest density. The contribution of natural enemies to <b>leek</b> <b>moth</b> mortality was measured by comparing mortality on caged and uncaged leeks. Total pre-imaginal mortality on uncaged plants was 99. 6 %, 99. 1 % and 96. 4 % in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Variation in mortality was greater among years than among sites. Total larval mortality was greater than that in the eggs and pupae. This was due largely to the high mortality (up to 83. 3 %) of neonates during the brief period between egg hatch and establishment of the feeding mine. <b>Leek</b> <b>moth</b> pupal mortality was significantly greater on uncaged than on caged leeks, indicating an impact by natural enemies, and this pattern was consistent over all three years of study. In contrast, the other life stages did not show consistently higher mortality rates on uncaged plants. This observation suggests that the pupal stage may be particularly vulnerable to natural enemies and, therefore, may be the best target for classical biological control in Canad...|$|E
40|$|Diadromus pulchellus Wesmael (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) is a pupal {{parasitoid}} {{under consideration}} for introduction into Canada {{for the control}} of the invasive <b>leek</b> <b>moth,</b> Acrolepiopsis assectella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Acrolepiidae). Since study of the parasitoid outside of quarantine was not permitted in Canada {{at the time of this}} project, we assessed its efficacy via field trials in its native range in central Europe. This was done by simulating introductory releases that would eventually take place in Canada when a permit for release is obtained. In 2007 and 2008, experimental leek plots were artificially infested with pest larvae to mimic the higher pest densities common in Canada. Based on a preliminary experiment showing that <b>leek</b> <b>moth</b> pupae were suitable for parasitism up to 5 - 6 days after pupation, D. pulchellus adults were mass-released into the field plots when the first host cocoons were observed. The laboratory-reared agents reproduced successfully in all trials and radically reduced <b>leek</b> <b>moth</b> survival. Taking into account background parasitism caused by naturally occurring D. pulchellus, the released agents parasitized at least 15. 8 %, 43. 9 %, 48. 1 % and 58. 8 % of the available hosts in the four release trials. When this significant contribution to <b>leek</b> <b>moth</b> mortality is added to previously published life tables, in which pupal parasitism was absent, the total pupal mortality increases from 60. 1 % to 76. 7 %. This study demonstrates how field trials involving environmental manipulation in an agent's native range can yield predictions of the agent's field efficacy once introduced into a novel are...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To defend {{themselves}} against herbivory, plants {{use a variety of}} direct and indirect strategies involving induced increases in secondary substances. Species of the Allium genus (Alliaceae), such as the leek Allium porrum (L.), produce nonprotein sulfur amino acids derived from cysteine, i. e., alk(en) yl-cysteine sulfoxides that are precursors of volatile thiosulfinates and disulfides. These defend most species including the specialist <b>leek</b> <b>moth,</b> Acrolepiopsis assectella. We determined by measuring the increase in the sulfur precursor propyl-cysteine sulfoxide (PCSO) if production of this precursor is induced in response to moth attack and mechanical wounding. The concentration of PCSO was determined by HPLC in 2 - or 6 -mo-old leeks after attacks of various intensity either by the specialist <b>leek</b> <b>moth</b> or by a generalist moth, Agrotis ipsilon. Injury-induced release of sulfur volatiles was measured by GC/MS after the attacks. Results showed an increase in the production of sulfur compounds in both the precursor and volatile form, occurring only in association with intensive attacks by leek moths. The increase in sulfur precursors also led to an increase in the release of sulfur volatiles. This induced response may provide an effective defense strategy against the plant’s main natural enemy, both directly and indirectly by attracting entomophagous insects.
