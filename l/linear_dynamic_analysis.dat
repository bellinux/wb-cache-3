Following the General Services Administration guidelines (GSA, 2003) three dimensional (3 D) models of building were developed to analyze and compare the progressive collapse response by commercially available computer program, STADD PRO. The objective of this work is to study the two different analysis procedures for evaluating their effectiveness in modeling progressive collapse scenarios; linear static and linear dynamic procedures. Analysis is carried out for (G+ 4) RC earth quake resistant buildings for different analysis procedures to compare DCR values. It was observed that dynamic amplification factor of 2 used in linear static equation is a good estimate for static analysis procedure since linear static and <b>linear</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>analysis</b> procedure yield approximately the same maximum moment.

40|$|Rooted in {{structural}} dynamics theory, three approximate procedures for estimating seismic demands for bridges crossing fault-rupture zones and deforming into their inelastic range are presented: modal pushover analysis (MPA), <b>linear</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>analysis,</b> and linear static analysis. These procedures estimate the total seismic demand by superposing peak values of quasi-static and dynamic parts. The peak quasi-static demand {{in all three}} procedures is computed by nonlinear static analysis of the bridge subjected to peak values of all support displacements applied simultaneously. In the MPA and the <b>linear</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>analysis</b> procedures, the peak dynamic demand is estimated by nonlinear static (or pushover) analysis and linear static analysis, respectively, for forces corresponding to the most-dominant mode. In the linear static analysis procedure, the peak dynamic demand is estimated by linear static analysis of the bridge due to lateral forces appropriate for bridges crossing fault-rupture zones. The three approximate procedures are shown to provide estimates of seismic demands that are accurate enough to be useful for practical applications. The linear static analysis procedure, which is much simpler {{than the other two}} approximate procedures, is recommended for practical analysis of “ordinary” bridges because it eliminates the need for mode shapes and vibration periods of the bridge...|$|E
