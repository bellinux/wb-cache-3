500|$|Though {{many critics}} and fans saw Revenge of the Sith as the strongest {{of the three}} prequels, some saw it as more or less on par with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. Much of the {{criticism}} for the film was directed towards the dialogue, particularly the film's romantic scenes, and for Hayden Christensen's performance (which won him his second Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor). Critics and fans alike were quick to jump on such lines as [...] "Hold me, Ani. Hold me, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> by the lake on Naboo...where {{there was nothing but}} our love..." [...] Critics have claimed this demonstrated Lucas's weakness as a writer of dialogue, a subject with which Lucas openly agreed when receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.|$|E
500|$|... "The Man Who Never Lied" [...] is a pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 25 seconds. It is written in the key of D major, in common time, with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Levine's vocal range spans from the low note of A4 to the high note of B5. Lyrically, the song finds the protagonist in a {{relationship}} trouble where he is playing a role of a good person: [...] "I {{was the man who}} never lied... but I couldn't break your heart <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> yesterday." [...] According to Nate Chinen of The New York Times, in [...] "The Man Who Never Lied", Levine sings [...] "about spoiling his perfect record of honesty to spare a quarreling lover some hurtful feelings." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone concluded that in the song, the singer confesses that the honesty is the worst policy. According to the reviewer, that's a [...] "dubious motto for real life – but it's always a promising one for a pop sharpie." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers were {{in favor}} of Storm of Zehirs focus on {{exploration}} and the ability to postpone or ignore the game's main storyline, and they compared the gameplay to older role-playing video games such as Icewind Dale II and Fallout. GameZone's reviewer said [...] "This is a game that harkens back to the good old days of adventure D video-gaming", and IGN said [...] "this feels like an homage to the old school D games of the past". [...] The ability to handcraft an entire party instead of just the main character was welcomed, with GameSpot's reviewer noting [...] "Rather than playing as a solo hero chosen for some great destiny, you roll up a party of four average joes just <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> way back when in D classics like the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale franchises," [...] (It should be noted that Baldur's Gate did not actually contain the ability to create the entire party in single player mode; however, in multiplayer, this was possible) [...] and IGN saying [...] "There's a strange kind of nerd joy when it comes to creating a D party". [...] Reviewers also appreciated the [...] "Party Conversation System", which allows typically underutilized social skills to be used by the entire party during conversation. [...] GameSpy said [...] "It's a terrific convention in which the game responds not to one but to every member of an adventuring party. [...] have the option to interject some special comment into a conversation that might open up otherwise unavailable avenues". [...] Reviewers were grateful that the time-based, [...] "spirit-eating" [...] gameplay mechanic of Mask of the Betrayer was not included.|$|E

You may talk about his muscular {{development}} as much as you please, but you can't have the smallest notion of what it's really equal to till you try it.

Come along, Blyth! Get opposite to him--give him hold of your hand--stand on the toe part of his right foot--don't wriggle about--stiffen your hand and aim, and--there!--what do you say to his muscular development now?" [...] concluded Zack, with an air of supreme triumph, as Mat slowly lifted from the ground the foot on which Mr. Blyth was standing, and, steadying himself on his left leg, raised the astonished painter with his right nearly two feet high in the air.|$|E

And {{he told me that}} he had a sweetheart back home and that she was coming out to him. I wasn't more'n half pleased, ornery young lump of selfishness that I was; I thought he wouldn't be as much my friend after she came. But I'd enough decency not to let him see it. He told me all about her. Her name was Persis Leigh, and she would have come out with him if it hadn't been for her old uncle. He was sick, and he'd looked after her when her parents died and she wouldn't leave him. And now he was dead and she was coming out to marry John Selwyn. 'Twasn't no easy journey for a woman in them days. There weren't no steamers, you must ricollect.|$|E
