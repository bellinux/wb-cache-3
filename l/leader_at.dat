5|$|After Høybråten {{announced}} that he would not seek reelection as party leader of KrF, Hareide quickly emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Høybråten, after the two other apparent candidates, Dagrun Eriksen and Hans Olav Syversen, announced they would not run.

Hareide supported the efforts to eliminate the rule which requires Christian Democratic party representatives to declare a Christian faith, and a vote gave a clear majority to abolish that rule two years later.

5|$|Burton and Roosevelt had a {{complicated}} history. Burton, as a <b>leader</b> <b>at</b> the 1900 Republican National Convention, was perhaps instrumental in Roosevelt's securing his party's nomination.

5|$|Dunderdale {{announced}} her candidacy for the PC Party leadership on December 30, 2010, and {{was endorsed by}} her entire caucus. While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she {{decided to run for}} the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale said she will only step down if someone challenges her for the leadership.

With Cabana being ineligible to run Dunderdale was officially named the leader-designate, she was sworn in as <b>leader</b> <b>at</b> the party's convention on April 2, 2011.|$|E
