For this scheme we obtain achievable rates and compare with {{the state of the art}} available in the literature.

Computer simulation results show that most of the gains obtained with the full antenna system can be extracted with the proposed reduced complexity approach. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Three-dimensional Finite-Difference in Time-Domain {{method is}} applied to {{simulate}} Low Frequency antennas {{in the presence of}} natural environments. All antennas are made up of wires set down on a square shaped ground plane and their dimensions depend on the wavelength of the source. Both monopole and inverted L antennas are considered in this paper. The antenna systems are computed in the presence of two examples of natural elements: a large forest and then {{on the top of a}} hill. The main aim of this paper is to show the effects of these environments on the properties of the antennas and on the efficiency of the ground wave excitation. The outcome of these investigations shows a power ratio enhancement of several decibels when the two kinds of antenna described in this paper are located on the top of a hill. On the other hand, the effects of a large forest depend on the geometry of the antenna. It doesn’t affect the radiation of a quarter-wave monopole antenna, on the contrary losses disrupt radiation when an inverted <b>L</b> <b>antenna</b> is built in the middle of a large forest. 1...|$|E
40|$|Two L- and T-shaped strip dipole on-chip antennas are {{designed}} and manufactured back-to-back {{in a single}} chip for 77 GHz operation. The antennas are measured for their reflection coefficients and radiation patterns at W band. It has been observed that measurements are highly influenced by the antenna placements and the ACP 110 -A-GSG- 100 probe. To model the effect of air coplanar probe (ACP probe), a software calibration is performed similar to a network analyzer calibration, and then the antenna reflection coefficient is calculated using the modeled probe-fed antenna. The technique employs obtaining the probe ABCD matrix and then de-embedding from the simulation results to compare with measurements. The probe-fed simulated and measured reflection coefficients agree well for manufactured L and T antennas, which resonate at 86 and 81 GHz, respectively. There are resonance frequency shifts attributed to the ACP probe effect, and simulations show that antennas will operate at 79 GHz (<b>L</b> <b>antenna)</b> and 77 GHz (T antenna) {{in the absence of}} ACP probe.

Compared to (11), the ST-GLRT (9) provides improved detection performance since it uses temporal correlation as an additional source of information. However, in the case when M < N L, the ST-GLRT may completely collapse due to the ill-conditioned sample covariance matrix [17]. In order to circumvent this limitation, in the following sections, we propose some modifications in the ST-GLRT by exploiting the presence of some inherent structures in the space-time correlation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} broadcast channels with <b>L</b> <b>antennas</b> at {{the base}} station and m single-antenna users, where L and m are typically of the same order. We assume that only partial channel state information is available {{at the base}} station through a finite rate feedback. Our key observation is that the optimal number of on-users (users turned on), say s, is a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and feedback rate. In support of this, an asymptotic analysis is employed where L, m and the feedback rate approach infinity linearly. We derive the asymptotic optimal feedback strategy as well as a realistic criterion to decide which users should be turned on. The corresponding asymptotic throughput per antenna, which we define as the spatial efficiency, {{turns out to be a}} function of the number of on-users s, and therefore s must be chosen appropriately. Based on the asymptotics, a scheme is developed for systems with finite many antennas and users. Compared with other studies in which s is presumed constant, our scheme achieves a significant gain. Furthermore, our analysis and scheme are valid for heterogeneous systems where different users may have different path loss coefficients and feedback rates. I...|$|R
