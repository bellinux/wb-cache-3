A new field {{in which they are}} also applied is evolvable hardware, which refers to a self-configurable electronic system. However, evolvable hardware is not widely recognized as a tool for solving real-world applications, because of the scalability problem, which limits the size of the system that may be evolved. In this paper a new genetic algorithm, particularly designed for evolving <b>logic</b> <b>circuits,</b> is presented and tested for its scalability. The proposed algorithm designs and optimizes <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> based on a Programmable Logic Array (PLA) structure. Furthermore it allows the evolution of large <b>logic</b> <b>circuits,</b> without the use of any decomposition techniques. The experimental results, based on the evolution of several <b>logic</b> <b>circuits</b> taken from three different benchmarks, prove that the proposed algorithm is very fast, as only a few generations are required to fully evolve the <b>logic</b> <b>circuits.</b> In addition it optimizes the evolved circuits better than the optimization offered by other evolutionary algorithms based on a PLA and FPGA structures.
