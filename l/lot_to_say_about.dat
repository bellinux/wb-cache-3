Hearing the way he describes his close emotional friendship with William S. Burroughs is worth the price of admission on its own. Sure, there are numerous bits about Mr. Mould and Mr. Norton too, and they're mostly told with fondness for the fruit before it became poisoned. Hart's slow and deliberate retellings of his past convey an inner strength that hints at why Bechard wanted to spend so much time with him. Capping the tale with the beginnings of Hart's epic interpretation of John Milton's Paradise Lost, The Argument -- Chris Strouth has a <b>lot</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the album here -- the story rests itself in the near-present at a high point in Hart's storied career.

40|$|Emergy {{accounting}} {{is one of}} {{the methods}} in the sustainability assessment toolbox. In its use of stocks and flows of energy and matter it has similarities with Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Substance Flow Analysis (SFA), and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), but Emergy accounting also includes stocks and flows of money and information. In its methodological approach of relating to a global baseline of renewable flows Emergy accounting is similar to Ecological footprints in that it is not just revealing which of two alternatives is using more or less of different stocks or flows but also comparing the use to available renewable flows on a global annual basis. This paper address the contribution of three different aspects of emergy accounting (emergy analysis, emergy synthesis) to the overarching goal of sustainable development. The discussed aspects were: 1) the Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI), 2) emergy as a normalizing measure, and 3) emergy as a network measure. It was concluded that the Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI) is an interesting measure but does not catch the full range of the sustainability concept. The emergy accounting approach, with the ESI as part of it, has a <b>lot</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> sustainability than just what is captured by the ESI. An interesting outcome is that the traditional triple-bottom-line of environmental, economic and social sustainability emerges very easily from the emergy assessment conceptual diagram approach. Emergy accounting holds a promise of clarifying the fuzziness often connected to how to classify economic, social, and socio-economic domains of sustainability. These are in practice often difficult to distinguish between, as are their connections to the ecological/environmental sustainability. The reason why the ESI captures {{only a small part of}} what is interesting from a sustainability point of view in the full emergy assessment may be that it has the focus on the traditional load and yield components. Many of the interesting parts from emergy evaluation in the sustainability context may instead come from the capability of emergy accounting to capture network properties...|$|R
