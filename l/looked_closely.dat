25|$|Since {{the primary}} goal of the TeX {{language}} is high-quality typesetting for publishers of books, Knuth gave {{a lot of attention to}} the spacing rules for mathematical formulae. He took three bodies of work that he considered to be standards of excellence for mathematical typography: the books typeset by Addison-Wesley Publishing's house (the publisher of The Art of Computer Programming), in particular the work of Hans Wolf and Joseph Louis Lagrange (thermodynamics innovation, +1856); editions of the mathematical journal Acta Mathematica dating from around 1910; and a copy of Indagationes Mathematicae, a Dutch mathematics journal. Knuth <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at these printed papers to sort out and look for a set of rules for spacing. While TeX provides some basic rules and the tools needed to specify proper spacing, the exact parameters depend on the font used to typeset the formula. For example, the spacing for Knuth's Computer Modern fonts has been precisely fine-tuned over the years and is now set; but when other fonts, such as AMS Euler, were used by Knuth for the first time, new spacing parameters had to be defined.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{developer}} blog, the localization process for Izuna 2 was [...] "surprisingly uncomplicated" [...] {{and the original}} run through took less than a month. Success, the Japanese developer, provided Atlus, the North American developers, with well-organized files, which helped make the translation and editing quick and easy. However, the quality assurance and debugging process was a [...] "nightmare" [...] {{due to the nature}} of the game and the randomized spawning of creatures. Additionally, the team <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at the bugs found by Japanese players and attempted to replicate every reported bug. This effort was marred by the lack of a debug menu, though debuggers were able to use both a one-hit kill option and a floor-skipping option. Unfortunately, the one-hit kill option did not apply to the bosses, so debuggers still had to grind to gain enough levels to defeat the bosses. In total, six official testers found 104 system-type bugs and 259 text bugs.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the switch}} from direct-to-video to feature film, the Toy Story 2 crew had been on its own, placed in a new {{building}} that was well-separated {{from the rest of}} the company by railroad tracks. [...] "We were just the small film and we were off playing in our sandbox," [...] co-producer Karen Jackson said. Lasseter <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout. [...] The film reused digital elements from Toy Story but, true to the company's [...] "prevailing culture of perfectionism, [...] it reused less of Toy Story than might be expected". Character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements. [...] The team freely borrowed models from other productions, such as Geri from Pixar's 1997 short Geri's Game, who became the Cleaner in Toy Story 2. Supervising animator Glenn McQueen inspired the animators to do spectacular work in the short amount of time given, assigning different shots to suit each animators' strengths.|$|E

2500|$|Vichy was {{dismissed}} {{as the work}} of a few senile Fascists. No one <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at what had happened during the Occupation, perhaps because very few intellectuals of any political stripe could claim to have had a [...] "good" [...] war, as Albert Camus did. No one stood up to cry [...] "J'accuse!" [...] at high functionaries, as Émile Zola did during the Dreyfus affair. When Simone de Beauvoir, Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida entered the public arena, it usually involved a crisis far away—in Madagascar, Vietnam or Cambodia. Even today, politically engaged writers call for action in Bosnia but intervene only sporadically in debates about the French past." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{a hundred}} extras from Shreveport, Louisiana were {{included}} in The Mist. Unlike conventional application of extras {{in the background of}} a film, sixty of the hundred extras were interwoven with the film's ensemble cast. Additional elements giving the film a local flavor include the prominence of local Louisiana brands such as Zapp's potato chips. Exterior shots of the house at the beginning were in Shreveport. [...] Exterior shots of the supermarket were in Vivian, Louisiana. Also, if <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at, the shields {{on the side of the}} passing firetrucks early in the film identify them as part of the Caddo Parish fire department. This is possibly a mistake as the film is allegedly set in Maine.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Kaiser Permanente {{abandoned}} {{its attempt to}} build its own clinical information system with IBM, writing-off some $452 million in software assets. This information technology failure led to {{major changes in the}} organization's approach to digital records. Under George Halvorson's direction, Kaiser <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at two medical software vendors, Cerner and Epic Systems, ultimately selecting Epic as the primary vendor for a new system, branded KP HealthConnect. Although Kaiser's approach shifted to [...] "buy, not build," [...] the project was unprecedented for a civilian system in size and scope. Deployed across all eight regions over six years and at a cost of more than $6 billion, by 2010, it was the largest civilian electronic medical record system, serving more than 8.6 million Kaiser Permanente members, implemented at a cost exceeding a half million dollars per physician.|$|E

2500|$|According to the TV Guide, Allison DuBois {{spent four}} years {{participating}} in various tests at the University of Arizona to assist with their studies of mediums and psychic phenomena. Gary Schwartz, Director of The VERITAS Research Project, claims that DuBois has psychic abilities, arguing in the March 6, 2005 TV Guide, [...] "Anyone who's <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at the evidence can't help but {{come to the conclusion}} that there is something very real going on here." [...] At their first meeting, Schwartz says DuBois accurately described a friend of Schwartz's who had just died. Impressed, Schwartz conducted a series of interviews, including one in which DuBois stated she contacted the late husband of a woman in England, knowing only the woman's name. The woman, after reading a transcript of the session, affirmed that 80% of what DuBois said was accurate. Schwartz published his research in a book titled The Truth About Medium. According to a statement by DuBois, she does not endorse the book or Schwartz.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2014 study {{conducted}} {{by researchers at the}} University of Rochester Medical Center, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, it was discovered that early exposure to air pollution causes the same damaging changes in the brain as autism and schizophrenia. The study also shows that air pollution also affected short-term memory, learning ability, and impulsivity. Lead researcher Professor Deborah Cory-Slechta said that [...] "When we <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at the ventricles, we could see that the white matter that normally surrounds them hadn't fully developed. It appears that inflammation had damaged those brain cells and prevented that region of the brain from developing, and the ventricles simply expanded to fill the space. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that air pollution {{may play a role in}} autism, as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders." [...] Air pollution has a more significant negative effect on males than on females.|$|E
2500|$|During the Russian–Japanese talks, the Japanese {{historian}} Hirono Yoshihiko {{noted that}} [...] "once negotiations commenced between Japan and Russia, Russia scaled back it demands and claims regarding Korea bit by bit, making {{a series of}} concessions that Japan regarded as serious compromises on Russia's part". The might have been avoided had not the issues of Korea and Manchuria became linked. The Korean and Manchurian issues had become linked as the Prime Minister Katsura Tarō decided if war did come, that Japan {{was more likely to}} have the support of the United States and Great Britain if the war could be presented as a struggle for free trade against the highly protectionist Russian empire, in which case, Manchuria which was the larger market than Korea, was more likely to engage Anglo–American sympathies. Throughout the war, a recurring theme of Japanese propaganda was Japan was a [...] "civilized" [...] power that supported free trade and would implicitly [...] allow foreign businesses into the resource-rich region of Manchuria vs. Russia the [...] "uncivilized" [...] power that was protectionist and wanted to keep the riches of Manchuria all to itself. Emperor Gojong of Korea came to believe that the issue dividing Japan and Russia was Manchuria, and chose to pursue a policy of neutrality as the best way of preserving Korean independence as the crisis mounted. Hu Weide, the Chinese minister in St. Petersburg in a series of reports to Beijing <b>looked</b> <b>closely</b> at whatever a Russian or a Japanese victory would be favorable to China, and argued that the latter was more preferable, as he maintained a Japanese victory presented the better chance for China to regain sovereignty over Manchuria. In December 1903, China decided to remain neutral if war came, because though Japan was the only power capable of evicting Russia from Manchuria, the extent of Japanese ambitions in Manchuria was not clear in Beijing.|$|E
