40|$|This project {{consists}} {{of developing a}} Location Allocation model that focuses on determining the locations of relief supply Points of Distribution (PODs) after a natural disaster and how to assign demand points to them. According to FEMA, PODs are â€œcentralized locations where the public picks up life sustaining commodities following a disaster or emergencyâ€ [1]. After each disaster, decisions {{have to be made}} to ensure a good delivery of resources in a timely manner. The road infrastructure may be damaged due to the disaster. Some roads might become inoperable, and some bridges are expected to fail. The model studied in this research makes decisions about the locations of PODs after knowing the real-time information about the road infrastructure and magnitude of demand {{at the beginning of each}} period of the planning horizon. A case study developed based on the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) is used to demonstrate the usefulness of our model. Our study area is limited to the nineteen counties in Arkansas that are most likely to be affected by the New Madrid earthquake. Many lives can be saved if a good <b>logistics</b> <b>plan</b> exists.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{dynamically}} evaluate {{the effects of}} changes in the world situation on the quality of a <b>logistics</b> <b>plan</b> is crucial for military commanders who have to decide if a plan is feasible in a given situation. Furthermore, when multiple courses of action are feasible, they have to decide on the best choice for execution in a situation. The decision makers involved in military logistics planning need tools that can quickly evaluate a <b>logistics</b> <b>plan</b> given uncertain and incomplete information about a situation. Previously, we have reported on the facility that we developed to generate and manage multiple courses of action in Cougaar−a hierarchical planning, execution monitoring, and replanning system developed to solve military logistics planning problems (Upal). Cougaar (Cognitive Agent Architecture) (BBN 2002) is a multiagent system developed under DARPA’s Advanced Logistics Project (ALP) and its successor Ultra*Log. This paper reports on the work that IET performed as part of Ultra*Log to add the ability to efficiently evaluate the effects of changes on the quality and feasibility of a course of action and choose the best course of action in an uncertain situation when multiple plans are available. Cougaar A Cougaar society closely mirrors the organizational structure of the military units engaged in real-world military logistics planning. Each Cougaar agent represents an organizational unit that can interact with other organizational units. Figure 1 shows the 4 -agent minitestconfig society. The agent interactions are governed by the roles that the interacting agents are playing at the time. For instance, a superior agent may pass requirements (tasks and Oplan policies) down to its subordinates and the subordinate agents may pass the status back up to their superior.

30|$|Within {{transport}} {{planning and}} sustainable cities, {{the focus has}} traditionally been on public transport and car-use, with little attention given to freight transport issues [2]. To improve urban freight planning, the European Commission [3] has emphasised that urban logistics planning {{should be one of}} the components of a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), one goal of which is to improve the accessibility of urban areas and provide high-quality, sustainable mobility and freight transport to, through and within the urban area [3]. Additionally, the EU has stated that urban freight plans should present measures to deal with the efficiency of urban logistics, including urban freight delivery, while also reducing the related externalities of greenhouse gas emissions and noise. Thus, the concept of a Sustainable Urban <b>Logistics</b> <b>Plan</b> (SULP) was launched to cover the logistics component of a SUMP [4]. Following this increased attention to SULPs in cities and the growing number of research initiatives, {{there is a need to}} identify the current state-of-the-practice of SULPs and freight-related SUMPs.|$|E

In this study, four reverse logistics methods-direct reuse, remanufacturing, recycling, and landfill-are considered to manage construction and demolition (C&D) waste. Two factors (economic and site-specific) with their 15 sub-factors affecting the decisions to implement the reverse logistics are examined. The hierarchy model of reverse logistics decisions, developed through the analytic hierarchy process, reveal {{the importance of the}} economic factor over the site-specific factor. It is suggested that the transportation cost, the processing cost, the specific sorting technology, and the limited project time must be first considered before making decisions on reverse logistics plans.

Integral to an effective, long-term <b>logistics</b> <b>plan</b> is the ability to accurately forecast future requirements to sustain materiel readiness. Total Life Cycle Management Assessment Tool (TLCM-AT) is a simulation tool combining operations, maintenance, and logistics. This exploratory analysis gives insight into the factors used by TLCM-AT beyond the tool s embedded analytical utilities. A Java program is developed to automate multiple changes to TLCM-AT s database, execute simulation runs and record output data. A scenario deploying LAV- 25 vehicles to a tropical region, with three courses of action, provides the basis for analysis. The research provides a description of the analysis available by TLCM-AT as a stand-alone tool, and concludes with how design of experiments (DOE) expands insights gained. This thesis provides a framework for using DOE with TLCM-AT, identifies a structured use of TLCM-AT for decision makers, and provides enhancements that enable more effective use of TLCM-AT.
