500|$|When {{performed}} properly, deep frying {{does not}} make food excessively greasy, because the moisture in the food repels the oil. The hot oil heats the water within the food, steaming it; oil cannot go against the direction of this powerful flow because (due to its high temperature) the water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface. As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not immersed in the oil for too <b>long,</b> <b>oil</b> penetration will be confined to the outer surface. Foods deep-fried at proper temperatures typically absorb [...] "no {{more than a couple}} of tablespoons per [...] cups of oil" [...] used. This oil absorption rate is around the same as occurs with shallow frying, such as in a pan.|$|E

25|$|Construction of the Interprovincial Pipeline {{system from}} Alberta to Central Canada began in 1949 with surveys and procurement. Field {{construction}} of the Edmonton/Regina/Superior (Wisconsin) leg began early in 1950 and concluded just 150 days later. The line began moving oil from Edmonton to the Great Lakes, a distance of 1,800 kilometres, {{before the end of}} the year. In 1953, the company extended the system to Sarnia, Ontario, in 1957 to Toronto. Other additions have extended the pipe to Montreal, Chicago and even Wood River in southern Illinois. The Interprovincial crude oil pipeline (now part of Enbridge Inc.) was the <b>longest</b> <b>oil</b> pipeline in the world when it was first constructed; the <b>longest</b> <b>oil</b> pipeline is now the Druzhba pipeline from Siberia. Until the completion of the TransCanada gas pipeline, it was also the longest pipeline in the world.|$|R
