50|$|Ceramic {{bearing balls}} can weigh up to 40% less than steel ones, {{depending}} on size and material. This reduces centrifugal <b>loading</b> and <b>skidding,</b> so hybrid ceramic bearings can operate 20% to 40% faster than conventional bearings. This {{means that the}} outer race groove exerts less force inward against the ball as the bearing spins. This reduction in force reduces the friction and rolling resistance. The lighter balls allow the bearing to spin faster, and uses less energy to maintain its speed.|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to find the limits of uphill skidding in relation to load size, log orientation and the slope. The trial was prepared on a test track of concave shape in the forest and with pre-designed loads of different sizes. The <b>loads</b> were <b>skidded</b> uphill once withbutt-end and then with top-end forward, until the tractor stopped because of the slope. The results show that butt-end forward skidding is more efficient. The difference between maximum loads at specific maximum slopes is almost constant (0. 53 t).

50|$|The six boats of {{this class}} were {{straight}} forward derivations {{of the later}} boats of the preceding Porpoise class. Although considered {{to be successful in}} most respects, valuable lessons had been learned from the Porpoises and operating experience showed the need to expand the operating envelope. The Salmons were longer, heavier, and faster versions with a better internal arrangement and a heavier armament. Two additional torpedo tubes were added to the aft torpedo room, for a total of four forward and four aft. The development of the Torpedo Data Computer, making broadside attacks practical, had made stern tubes more desirable. Some submariners wanted six tubes forward, but design philosophy and tactics of the day did not yet support this; additionally, for years the tonnage required to provide the extra tubes was over-estimated. However, in an effort {{to increase the number of}} torpedoes carried, four non-firing torpedo stowage tubes were installed in the superstructure below the main deck, stacked vertically, two each on either side of the conning tower. In order to access the weapons in these tubes, the boat had to surface and remove a portion of the decking on either side of the deck gun. Small boats stowed there for running sailors ashore for liberty were removed and set in the water. The weapons were extracted from the tubes one by one and winched up to the main deck. They were then placed on a raised <b>loading</b> <b>skid</b> and carefully lowered on an angle through a hatch into the forward torpedo room. This whole process took several hours to complete. The impracticality of spending several hours on the surface in enemy waters moving torpedoes below was lost on the designers. War experience led to the removal of these tubes during the boats' first wartime overhauls.|$|R
40|$|Forest {{harvesting}} {{with animals}} is a labor-intensive operation. It is expensive to use machines on smaller woodlots, which require frequent moves if mechanically logged. So, small logging systems using animals {{may be more}} cost effective. In this study, work sampling was used for five animal logging operations in Alabama to measure productive and non-productive time elements to determine utilization with respect to operators, functions (felling and processing of trees, <b>skidding,</b> <b>loading,</b> and forwarding of logs), animals, and machines. Cost of log production was calculated from the figures reported by owners and the crew members. Average utilization of crew was 58 percent, animals (horses and mules) were utilized only 22 percent and the machines were utilized from 5 to 74 percent of scheduled time. Average cost of log production per m 3 was $ 11. 28.

The research covered three types of treatment: late thinning, removal cutting in openings and clear cutting in openings. The average skidding distance was between 120 and 250 m. In the clear-cut stands, a mean duration of a skidding cycle accounted for 12 minutes, while in the thinned ones it was longer, lasting ca. 16 minutes. The investigators performed an estimate of parameters of multiple regression models, which revealed dependences between: Þ duration of skidding cycles and stand conditions, number of logs per <b>load</b> and <b>skidding</b> distance, and Þ productivity achieved in specific skidding cycles and the above-mentioned variables, as well as wood volume per load. The highest productivity within the productive work time of a skidder was recorded in the stand where removal cutting in openings was performed; it exceeded 14 m 3 ×h- 1. In other stands, the efficiency was lower, not greater than 9 m 3 ×h- 1. However, differences between the productivity achieved within the productive work time and that recorded for the work place time did not exceed 20 %, which indicated that skidding operations in the stands under scrutiny were organised properly...|$|R

We also evaluate the effect of time after logging (age) on these climber parameters. In 19 plots, 3 months to 17 years after logging we counted and measured climber individuals and shoots by species. <b>Skid</b> tracks and <b>loading</b> areas had similar abundance and size of climbers, only the densities of herbaceous species and of pioneer species were both higher in <b>loading</b> areas. <b>Skid</b> tracks had the same abundance and size of climbers as their adjacent border areas. Densities of long climbers (> 3 m length), woody species and non-pioneer species {{were higher in the}} border areas, and densities of herbaceous species and pioneer species were lower, compared to centre areas. With the exception of density of long climbers (higher in the border areas), climber abundance and size in loading areas were similar to those in their adjacent border areas. Climber species richness in skid tracks decreased with time after logging. All other climber parameters studied were not correlated with time after logging. We conclude that despite the mechanical damage in logging related areas most climbers were not much affected, and that time since logging only affects climber species richness in skid tracks.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{measuring}} maximum loads on different slopes when skidding uphill with WOO DY 110 cable skidder and adapted 4 WD agricultural tractor AGT 835 {{are described in}} the article. Both tractors are very different and were chosen {{for the purpose of}} finding the limits of uphill skidding. Besides the slope, the pre-designated loads of different sizes and log orientation (butt-end or top-end forward) have been main variables. The trial was conducted on two concave shaped test skid trails in the forest. On the lower altitudes, the skid trails had small inclination, which slowly increased to 42 % on the track where WOODY 110 was tested, and 27 % where AGT 835 was measured. First the <b>loads</b> were <b>skidded</b> uphill with butt-end and then with top-end forward. The purpose was to choose too heavy loads, as we wished to stop tractors due to overload, but on different slopes. The proper load formation (butt-end forward if possible) in uphill skidding is most important on steeper skid trails. The dependency between maximum load and slope is linear. The calculated theoretical maximum load on horizontal surface enables us to make similar assessment for any other tractor weighing between 2 and 7 tons. For this purpose, John Deere 6220 and LIMB 80 LUXS adapted agricultural tractors for forest use were chosen and compared. The ratio between the tractor load on different slopes and tractor weight was calculated for all four tractors included in our comparison. Apart from the weight, tractor's engine torque (power) has the decisive influence on the load size. Maximum loads on different slope categories were calculated according to different engine powers...|$|R

The X- 38 test {{program is the}} proving ground for the Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) a gliding parafoil-equipped vehicle designed to land at relatively low speeds. The skid-equipped landing gear is designed to attenuate the vertical landing energy of the vehicle at touchdown using crushable materials within the struts themselves. The vehicle then slides out as the vehicle horizontal energy is dissipated through the skids. A series of tests was conducted at Edwards Airforce Base (EAFB) {{in an attempt to}} quantify the drag force produced while "dragging" various X- 38 landing gear skids across lakebed regions of varying surface properties.

40|$|The {{logging system}} {{consists}} of five subsystems; namely, felling, bucking, <b>skidding,</b> <b>loading,</b> and hauling. Productivity of the felling and bucking subsystems depends largely upon {{the skill of}} the men doing the work and can be subjected to a minimum amount of analysis. Skidding represents a materials handling system that is being subjected to {{a great deal of}} technical analysis. Loading and hauling, however, stand in need of investigation. Both are materials handling systems that need analysis of the best equipment for a particular situation. This thesis presents a simulation model that investigates the many variable combinations existing in the loading and hauling subsystems. Development of the model required two steps: (1) identi- fication of the events and activities common to loading and hauling subsystems and (2) definition of owning and operating costs relevant to the two sub-systems. Calculation of relevant costs resulted in the criteria used to compare the numerous variable combinations. The criteria is a ratio of investment to output expressed in dollars per thousand board feet of merchantable timber. Identification of appropriate events and activities allowed use of the simulation language, GASP II, in testing various alternatives. The result of this investigation is a fully developed model capable of testing alternatives of the many logging situations in existence.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} on the strip road where longitudinal slopes were determined by the leveling method {{as well as individual}} distances of the strip road of uniform slope. Skidders were used for carrying out traction tests in downhill and uphill skidding of 9 different loads. Measurement of wheel loads, wheel torques and components of rope force was performed by tensiometric method and remote transferring of measurement signal. According to the results of research, by the increase of longitudinal slope, more tractive force is used for overcoming the terrain slope than for overcoming the traction resistance. In downhill skidding, the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) acts in the skidder travel direction and hence its value is higher than the traction resistance. Torque distribution depends on the skidder wheel vertical <b>load.</b> In uphill <b>skidding,</b> torques increase proportionally to the vertical component of rope forces and adhesive weight of the skidder. In downhill skidding, the skidder wheel torques are negative, because they are not used for achieving wheel tractive force and instead, the transmission of torque through the transmission system causes skidder’s braking performance. The skidder’s need for braking arises under influence of the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) that acts {{in the direction of the}} skidder travel and under its effect the traction resistances are overcome. It can be concluded that in case of downhill skidding we cannot speak of achieving real tractive force because the skidder pulls the load only by its weight, and the transmittion from engine to wheels is not used for achieving the tractive force...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} using a rubber-tired skidder to keep the landing clear by sorting and decking the logs along the road prior to loading by a self-loading truck. The evaluation was accomplished through detailed time studies conducted on a Koller K- 300 yarder, a Crown Super 3000 self-loader, and a John Deere 440 choker skidder, in a selective thinning of a Coast Range Douglas-fir stand with n average diameter range of eight to twelve inches. Production increases on the yarding cycle were observed when the skidder was used to keep the landing clear. A major factor for higher production rates was reduced landing delays. Comparisons of the loading operation from decks built by the yarder and by the skidder showed a significant time savings when loading from skidder decks. The portions of the loading cycle most affected were the sort and swing loaded elements. The analysis indicated that sorteddecks oriented at small angles to the road and decked as high as possible required the shortest <b>loading</b> time. The <b>skidding</b> cycle was evaluated frm a mechanical engineering approach and compared to regression analysis results. The results snowed that the skidder was capable of production rates in excess of 10 cunits per hour. The hooking and decking elements consumed the largest portion of the skidding cycle. An alternate method of hooking or investigation of a grapple attachment is suggested. Important factors influencing the harvesting of a unit were identified and a model was developed to aid in planning. The influence of landing geometry as related to log holding capabilities of a landing, log diameter, and stems removed per acre are explored. Despite an improvement in overall production, the skidder did not prove cost effective for the study when its full cost was charged to yarding production. There were indications, however, that the skidder or a loader may be a necessity for longer yarding distances, flat decking slopes, high stem removals, or larger diameter trees. The skidder cost benefit ratio may also be improved if the skidder or operator remain active in the overall harvest operation when not needed for swinging and sorting...|$|R

Šumarski list br. 3 – 4, CXXXIV (2010), 103 - 114 Harvesting phases of felling and processing were time-separated from skidding. Research was conducted using time and work study method. Time consumption of each work component was measured by snap-back chronometry method. Lenght of skid roads was gradually measured on uniform slope segments by GPS. Coordinates of points, where the longitudal slope changes, were recorded by GPS as well. Slope of each individual segment was calculated using the difference in altitude of slope change points and the related lenght. While skidding, the tractor was travelling exclusively by two skid roads (figure 4 and table 1). Average skid slope is expressed in percents, in the direction of loaded tractor travel. Average slope of recorded turns was calculated by weighting the related slope with the travel lenght. Average skidding distance was calculated as an average of recorded loaded trevel lenghts of each turn. Load records are shown in table 2. Significant difference in average <b>load</b> on <b>skid</b> trail 1 (5. 043 m 3) and on skid trail 2 (3. 715 m 3) is evident. By each turn difference in productivity of skidding on skid road 1 and skid road 2 increases by 1. 328 m 3. During the research 75. 650 m 3 of beech wood asortments, and 115. 994 m 3 of fir wood asortments were skidded on skid road 1. On skid road 2 18. 607 m 3 of beech wood asortments an 44. 549 m 3 of fir wood asortments were skidded. By multiplying achieved volumes with density of fresh beech wood (1, 07 t/m 3) and fresh fir wood (0, 98 t/m 3) average <b>load</b> masses on <b>skid</b> road 1 (5. 122 t) and on skid road 2 (3. 739 t) were calculated. Variable times (travel loaded and unloaded by skid roads and landing, line pulling and winching) were analysed by mathematical and statistical methods (figure 6, figure 7 and figure 8). All other effective times were regarded as fixed and calculated as averages of recorded time (figure 11). During the research average daily output of 36. 40 m 3 /day was achieved with average total time consuption of 404, 59 min/day. The said total time consumption makes 84. 59 % of legal working time (480 min). With full utilisatin of legal working time, at the same organization of work, the productivity would increase by 15. 41 %. During the research the tractor accomplished 76. 46 % of total time as efective time with delay time of 23. 54 %. In effective time per turn, for skidding distance of 500 m, fixed times take 17. 36 min and variable times take 18. 97 min. Effective time per turn, for skidding distance of 500 m, is 36. 34 min. With determined allowance time factor of 1, 22 total time is 44. 42 min. Average travel speed on skid roads is 3. 56 km/h for unloaded tractor and 3. 50 km/h for loaded tractor. Average travel speed on landing is 4. 65 km/h for unloaded tractor and 4. 93 km/h for loaded tractor, on average distance of 65 m. Average speed of line pulling is 0. 97 km/h and average speed of winching is 0. 86 km/h. Standard time of skidding on skid road 1 ranges from 5. 32 min/m 3 (100 m) to 13. 17 min/m 3 (1000 m) with average load of 5. 04 m 3. For skkiding on skid road 2 standard time ranges from 7. 22 min/m 3 (100 m) to 17. 88 min/m 3 (1000 m) with average load of 3. 72 m 3. Daily output ranges from 90. 27 m 3 /day for skkidnig distance of 100 m to 36. 45 m 3 /day for skidding distance of 1000 m, when skkiding on skid road 1, and from 66. 50 m 3 /day to 26. 85 m 3 /day when skidding on skid road 2 for the same distances. For skidding distances from 100 m to 1000 m skidding cost ranges from 31. 83 kn/m 3 to 78. 83 kn/m 3, for skid road 1 and from 43. 20 kn/m 3 to 107. 01 kn/m 3 for skid road 2. Timberjack 240 C tractor belongs to a group of highly-efficient special forest timber skidding machines. The principle of load size effect, as one of the key factors of timber skidding, on skidding productivity in different skidding distances has been proven by this detailed research. Hence, by increasing the load volume the productivity of this tractor is significantly increased, thus lowering the cost per unit, in this case by 26. 34 %. Considerably lower timber skidding cost when skidding down the slope should be {{regarded as one of the}} capital elements in planning and construction of secondary forest network...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the assessment of}} environmental viability of timber extraction by two vehicles – forwarder and tractor assembly of 1 -m wood by two methods of mechanized forest residues management. In the first variant, the forwarder was first used for extracting industrial roundwood, and then for all the remaining parts of the tree as energy wood. The second method was the common practice, i. e. the forwarder was used for transporting industrial roundwood and large logs, {{and then in the}} second phase 1 -m firewood was processed from the remaining part of the tree, and it was extracted by the tractor assembly. In the third phase, the prepared (bunched) biomass was extracted by the forwarder. Environmental viability of the forwarder and tractor assembly for 1 -m firewood was analyzed based on CI*NGP– 1 ratio, i. e. index that represents the ratio between soil bearing strength, as the soil characteristics, and nominal wheel load, as the vehicle characteristics, so that it has a clear physical sense. This factor has been chosen because it consists of values that can be measured relatively easily or calculated with the use of semi-empirical models. The obtained values were compared with the recommended limit values from EcoWood project, which were based on the allowed 10 -cm depth of the wheel rut. The analysis showed that the reference wheel of the tractor assembly semitrailer was the most unfavorable and that no environmentally viable wood extraction can be expected from such a vehicle, but only economic mobility. This is why the use of a non-drive bogie axle is recommended for them. The wheels of the farming tractor have the most favorable indicators of environmental viability, and particularly so the front wheels, whose load gets considerably lower with the increase of the semitrailer load. The indicators of the forwarder are considerably better, and however in this case, too, for achieving an environmentally acceptable maneuverability, according to EcoWood classification, the soil must be very strong with the cone index between 700 kPa for ~ 50 % load and up to 900 kPa for the nominal load value. During measurement and analysis of results, great dispersion was observed of the measuring data of the soil cone index obtained by cone penetrometer, sampled on a relatively non-homogenous forest soil. Searching for an acceptable measurement procedure by cone penetrometer or the application of any other measuring method for the assessment of the soil bearing strength is a significant task of scientific research. The assessment of the skidder environmental viability will be a still greater challenge, because they are characterized by a considerably more complex travel dynamics than moving on slopes, dynamic redistribution of axle loads, achievement of tractive force, etc. This is also the opinion of Horvat et al. (2007) with the emphasis on the fact that with skidders it is also necessary to analyze the impact of the winched and <b>skidded</b> <b>load</b> on the soil...|$|R

U drugoj se metodi radilo na uobičajen način, tj. prvo se forvarderom transportirala tehnička oblovina i višemetarsko drvo, zatim je od preostaloga dijela stabala izrađeno jednometarsko ogrjevno drvo koje je izvoženo traktorskom ekipažom, a u trećoj je fazi pripremljenu (uhrpanu) biomasu izvozio forvarder. Okolišna pogodnost kretanja tih šumskih vozila po šumskom bespuću ocjenjivana je na temelju prepuruka projekta EcoWood pomoću kvocijenta CI*NGP– 1. Raščlamba je pokazala da je okolišno daleko najnepovoljnija šumska poluprikolica te da njezinu osovinu treba graditi kao bogi. Okolišni pokazatelji forvardera povoljniji su od poluprikolice traktorske ekipaže, no njegovo kretanje po šumskom bespuću zahtijeva tlo visoke čvrstoće. U uvjetima nizinskih šuma, koje odlikuje česta ograničena nosivost tla, to je teško postići. This paper {{describes}} {{the assessment of}} environmental viability of timber extraction by two vehicles – forwarder and tractor assembly of 1 -m wood by two methods of mechanized forest residues management. In the first variant, the forwarder was first used for extracting industrial roundwood, and then for all the remaining parts of the tree as energy wood. The second method was the common practice, i. e. the forwarder was used for transporting industrial roundwood and large logs, {{and then in the}} second phase 1 -m firewood was processed from the remaining part of the tree, and it was extracted by the tractor assembly. In the third phase, the prepared (bunched) biomass was extracted by the forwarder. Environmental viability of the forwarder and tractor assembly for 1 -m firewood was analyzed based on CI*NGP– 1 ratio, i. e. index that represents the ratio between soil bearing strength, as the soil characteristics, and nominal wheel load, as the vehicle characteristics, so that it has a clear physical sense. This factor has been chosen because it consists of values that can be measured relatively easily or calculated with the use of semi-empirical models. The obtained values were compared with the recommended limit values from EcoWood project, which were based on the allowed 10 -cm depth of the wheel rut. The analysis showed that the reference wheel of the tractor assembly semitrailer was the most unfavorable and that no environmentally viable wood extraction can be expected from such a vehicle, but only economic mobility. This is why the use of a non-drive bogie axle is recommended for them. The wheels of the farming tractor have the most favorable indicators of environmental viability, and particularly so the front wheels, whose load gets considerably lower with the increase of the semitrailer load. The indicators of the forwarder are considerably better, and however in this case, too, for achieving an environmentally acceptable maneuverability, according to EcoWood classification, the soil must be very strong with the cone index between 700 kPa for ~ 50 % load and up to 900 kPa for the nominal load value. During measurement and analysis of results, great dispersion was observed of the measuring data of the soil cone index obtained by cone penetrometer, sampled on a relatively non-homogenous forest soil. Searching for an acceptable measurement procedure by cone penetrometer or the application of any other measuring method for the assessment of the soil bearing strength is a significant task of scientific research. The assessment of the skidder environmental viability will be a still greater challenge, because they are characterized by a considerably more complex travel dynamics than moving on slopes, dynamic redistribution of axle loads, achievement of tractive force, etc. This is also the opinion of Horvat et al. (2007) with the emphasis on the fact that with skidders it is also necessary to analyze the impact of the winched and <b>skidded</b> <b>load</b> on the soil...|$|R
