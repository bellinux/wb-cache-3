40|$|This {{creative}} {{project is}} a study of cultural awareness in architecture. The hypothesis states that architecture {{is one of many}} cultural manifestations in a society. One seeking contemporary architecture in a society should explore the idea of contemporary culture in that society. This study aims to point out the relationship of living patterns and <b>living</b> <b>spaces</b> (culture and architecture). Living patterns are influenced by their own cultures and, at the same time, the characteristics of <b>living</b> <b>spaces</b> reflect the aspects of living patterns. To explore contemporary <b>living</b> <b>spaces,</b> cultural issues must be considered. However, culture is dynamic. It is changed by reasons of time, place and people. Even though the tradional cultures in a society continuingly permeate to the next generations, some of them disappear as time, place or people change. Therefore, to study the issue of culture in contemporary society, traditional and new cultures are reckoned with as contemporary families adapt both cultures into their lifestyles. While Thai society has maintained its own unique culture, recently globalization has brought influences of Western ideas into Thailand. These influences are effecting Thai culture and bearing on how housing responds to a changing society. The work is divided into two parts, research and design. To explore the deeper meaning of contemporary <b>living</b> <b>spaces,</b> the research focuses on the importannce of culture to the characteristics of <b>living</b> <b>spaces.</b> It analyzes cultural and social changes that have influenced contemporary Thai families. This cultural analyses confirms that the meaning and design of contemporary <b>living</b> <b>spaces</b> are directly influenced by cultural adjustments. To support the hypothesis and research, a housing project for contemporary Thai families is proposed. It is a schematic design that incorporates the cultural analyses into the design process. The design is a model for organizing cultural information into the design of <b>living</b> <b>spaces.</b> Department of ArchitectureThesis (M. Arch. ...|$|R

5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, {{the primary}} goal of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (<b>living</b> <b>space)</b> in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary objective of this aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Paris today {{is lower than}} its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921. The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of <b>living</b> <b>space</b> into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss {{came to an end}} in the 21st century; the population estimate of July 2004 showed a population increase {{for the first time since}} 1954, and the population reached 2,234,000 by 2009.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{innovations}} {{have been documented}} by 170–160,000 {{years ago at the}} site of Pinnacle Point 13B on the southern Cape coast of South Africa. This includes the oldest confirmed evidence for the utilization of ochre and marine resources in the form of shellfish exploitation for food. Based on his analysis of the MSA bovid assemblage at Klasies, Milo reports MSA people were formidable hunters and that their social behavior patterns approached those of modern humans. Deacon maintains that the management of plant food resources through deliberate burning of the veld to encourage the growth of plants with corms or tubers in the southern Cape during the Howiesons Poort (c. 70–55 ka) is indicative of modern human behavior. A family basis to foraging groups, color symbolism and the reciprocal exchange of artifacts and the formal organization of <b>living</b> <b>space</b> are, he suggests, further evidence for modernity in the MSA.|$|E
