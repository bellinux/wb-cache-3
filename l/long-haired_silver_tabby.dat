5000|$|The bottom {{eighth of}} each hair is white or creamy-white, {{with the rest}} of the hair being a solid color. Genetically this color is a non-agouti cat with the {{dominant}} inhibitor gene; a non-agouti version of the <b>silver</b> <b>tabby.</b> Smoke cats will look solid colored until they move, when the white undercoat becomes apparent. It is mostly found in pedigreed cats (especially longhair breeds) but also present in some domestic long-haired cats.|$|R

50|$|The Ocicat is an all-domestic {{breed of}} cat which resembles a wild cat {{but has no}} wild DNA in its gene pool. The breed is unusual {{in that it is}} spotted like a wild cat but has the {{temperament}} of a domestic animal. It is named for its resemblance to the Ocelot. The breed was established from Siamese and Abyssinian stock; later, American Shorthairs (<b>silver</b> <b>tabbies)</b> were added to the mix and gave the breed their silver color, bone structure and distinct markings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inhibited}} pigment gene, I/i. The {{dominant allele}} (I) produces tipped hairs that are fully colored {{only at the}} tip and have a white base. This allele appears to interact with other genes to produce various degrees of tipping, ranging from deeply tipped <b>silver</b> <b>tabby</b> to lightly tipped shaded silver and chinchilla silver. The inhibitor gene interacts with the non-agouti genotype (I-aa) to produce the color known as smoke. The homozygous recessive genotype when combined with the agouti gene (iiA-), produces tabby coloration, which can vary along a spectrum ranging from a deeply patterned brown tabby, to a lighter [...] "golden tabby", to the very lightly colored shaded or chinchilla golden colors. Orange cats with the inhibitor gene (I-O-) are commonly called [...] "cameo".|$|R
50|$|Jill (29 January 1976 - 30 May 1983) was a <b>silver</b> spotted <b>tabby</b> and {{the sister}} of Jack. She often {{appeared}} with her brother, famously leaping out of presenter's laps whenever on screen. On 15 May 1980 Jill gave birth to two kittens who appeared with their mother on the show on 23 June. Jill died of heart failure in 1983 at 7 years old.|$|R

50|$|The International Cat Association (TICA) breed {{standard}} calls for brown-spotted tabby (cool to warm brown, tan or gold with black or dark brown spots), silver-spotted <b>tabby</b> (<b>silver</b> coat with black or dark grey spots), black (black with black spots), and black smoke (black-tipped silver with black spots) only.|$|R
2500|$|Minerva McGonagall is deputy Headmistress, head of Gryffindor House, Transfiguration professor, {{and later}} Headmistress at Hogwarts, where she began {{teaching}} in December 1956. She is first {{introduced in the}} opening chapter of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when she meets Dumbledore at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey (the home of Harry's aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley). McGonagall {{is described as a}} tall, rather severe-looking woman, with black hair typically drawn into a tight bun. She wears emerald green robes, a pointed hat, and always has a very prim expression. She speaks with a slight Scottish accent. She is, according to Rowling, a sprightly 70-year-old. McGonagall wears square spectacles that match the markings around the eyes of her Animagus form of a British Shorthair <b>silver</b> <b>tabby</b> cat; she has the distinction of being the first Animagus introduced in the series and being one of the few registered Animagi of the century, though she was rarely seen using the ability. Harry's immediate impression of her is of someone who is not to be crossed. She has a fondness for tartan, and her handkerchief, at least one hat, dressing gown, and dress robes are patterned with it. In the films, McGonagall often wears a Scottish brooch of a specific Scots style set with Cairngorm citrines and Scottish agate.|$|R
50|$|Jack (29 January 1976 - 20 April 1986) was a <b>silver</b> striped <b>tabby</b> and {{the brother}} of Jill who made his {{television}} debut with his sister just three weeks after they were born. Jack and Jill became known as Blue Peter's disappearing cats, for whenever they appeared on screen they tended to leap out of a presenter's lap. The production team put together a sequence of clips demonstrating this, featuring various moments when the cats leapt out of sight. It was set {{to the theme of}} the cartoon Top Cat, and was often requested by viewers as the clip they most wanted to see again. Jack died suddenly in 1986 at 10 years old.|$|R
5000|$|The International Cat Association (TICA) groups {{the breed}} into three coat-pattern {{divisions}} for judging at cat shows: traditional (with stable, rich colors), sepia ("paler and warmer {{than the traditional}} equivalents", and darkening a bit with age), and mink (much lighter than sepia, and developing noticeably with age on the face and extremities). If classified as the Himalayan sub-breed, full point coloration is required, the fourth TICA color division, with a [...] "pale and creamy colored" [...] body even lighter than mink, with intense coloration on the face an extremities. The four TICA categories are essentially a graduated scale of color distribution from evenly colored to mostly colored only at the points. Within each, the coloration may be further classified as solid, tortoiseshell (or [...] "tortie"), <b>tabby,</b> <b>silver</b> or smoke, solid-and-white, tortoiseshell-and-white, tabby-and-white, or silver/smoke-and-white, with various specific colors and modifiers (e.g. chocolate tortoiseshell point, or fawn shaded mink marbled tabby-torbie). TICA-recognized tabby patterns include classic, mackerel, marbled, spotted, and ticked (in two genetic forms), while other patterns include shaded, chinchilla, and two tabbie-tortie variations, golden, and grizzled. Basic colors include white, black, brown, ruddy, bronze, [...] "blue" [...] (grey), chocolate, cinnamon, lilac, fawn, red, cream, with a silver or shaded variant of most. Not counting bi-color (piebald) or parti-color coats, nor combinations that are genetically impossible, there are nearly 1,000 named coat pattern variations in the TICA system for which the Persian/Himalayan qualifies. The Exotic Shorthair sub-breed qualifies for every cat coat variation TICA recognizes.|$|R
