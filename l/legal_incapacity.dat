"NO RELIGIOUS TEST SHALL EVER BE REQUIRED A LANDHOLDER" [...] ELLSWORTH VIICONNECTICUT COURANT (HARTFORD), DECEMBER 17, 1787, TO THE LANDHOLDERS AND FARMERS.I {{have often}} admired {{the spirit of}} candour, liberality, and justice, with which the {{convention}} began and completed the important object of their mission. [...] "in all our deliberations on this subject," [...] say they, [...] "we kept steadily in our view, that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true American, the consolidation of our union, in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps our national existence. This important consideration, seriously and deeply impressed on our minds, led each state in the convention to be less rigid on points of inferior magnitude, than might otherwise have been expected; and thus the constitution which we now present, {{is the result of}} a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession, which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable."Let us, my fellow citizens, take up this constitution with the same spirit of candour and liberality; consider it in all its parts; consider the important advantages which may be derived from it, and the fatal consequences which will probably follow from rejecting it. If any objections are made against it, let us obtain full information on the subject, and then weigh these objections in the balance of cool impartial reason. Let us see if they be not wholly groundless; but if upon the whole they appear to have some weight, let us consider well, whether they be so important, that we ought on account of them to reject the whole constitution. Perfection is not the lot of human institutions; that which has the most excellencies and fewest faults, is the best that we can expect.Some very worthy persons, who have not had great advantages for information, have objected against that clause in the constitution, which provides, that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. They have been afraid that this clause is unfavourable to religion. But, my countrymen, the soul purpose and effect of it is to exclude persecution, and to secure to you the important right of religious liberty. We are almost the only people in the world, who have a full enjoyment of this important right of human nature. In our country every man has a right to worship god in that way which is most agreeable to his own conscience. If he be a good and peaceable citizen, he is liable to no penalties or incapacities on account of his religious sentiments; of in other words, he is not subject to persecution. But in other parts of the world, it has been, and still is, far different; systems of religious error have been adopted, in times of ignorance. It has been the interest of tyrannical kings, popes, and prelates, to maintain these errors. When the clouds of ignorance began to vanish, and the people grew more enlightened, there was no other way to keep them in error, but to prohibit their altering their religious opinions by severe persecuting laws. In this way persecution became general throughout Europe. It was the universal opinion that one religion must be established by laws; and that all, who differed in their religious opinions, must suffer the vengeance of persecution. In pursuance of this opinion, when popery was abolished in England, and the church of England was established in its stead, severe penalties were inflicted upon all who dissented from the established church. In the time of the civil wars, in the reign of Charles I, the Presbyterians got the upper hand, and inflicted legal penalties upon all who differed from them in their sentiments respecting religious doctrines and discipline. When Charles II was restored, the church of England was likewise restored, and the Presbyterians and other dissenters were laid under <b>legal</b> penalties and <b>incapacities.</b> It was in this reign, that a religious test was established as a qualification for office; that is a laws made requiring all officers civil and military (among other things) to receive the sacrament of the lord’s supper, according to the usage of the church of England, written six months after their admission to office, under the penalty of 500l and disability to hold the office. And by another statute of the same reign, no person was capable of being elected to any office relating to the government of any city or corporation, unless, within a twelvemonth before, he had received the sacrament according to the rites of the Church of England. The pretense for making these severe laws, by which all but churchmen were made incapable of any office civil or military, was to exclude the papists; but the real design was to exclude the Protestant dissenters. From this account of test-laws, there arises an unfavourable presumption against them. But if we consider the nature of them and the effects which they are calculated to produce, we shall find that they are useless, tyrannical, and peculiarly unfit for the people of this country.A religious test is an act to be done, or profession to be made, relation to religion (such as partaking of the sacrament according to certain rites and forms, or declaring one’s belief of certain doctrines,) for the purpose of determining, whether his religious opinions are such, that he is admissible to a public office. A test in favour of any one denomination of Christians would be to the last degree absurd in the United States. If it were in favour of either Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Baptists, or Quakers; it would incapacitate more than three fourths of the American citizens for any public office; and thus degrade them from the rank of freemen. There needs no argument to prove that the majority of our citizens would never submit to this indignity.If any test-act were to be made, perhaps the least exceptionable would be one, requiring all persons appointed to office, to declare, at the time of their admission, their belief in the being of a god, and in the divine authority of the scriptures. In favour of such a test, it may be said, that one who believes these great truths, will not be so likely to violate his obligations to his country, as one who disbelieves them; we may have greater confidence in his integrity. But I answer: his making a declaration of such a belief is no security at all. For suppose him to be an unprincipled man, who disbelieves neither the word not the being of a god; and to be governed merely by selfish motives; how easy it is for him to dissemble? How easy is it for him to make a public declaration of his belief in the creed which the law prescribes; and excuse himself by calling it a mere formality? This is the case with the test-laws and creeds in England. The most abandoned characters partake of the sacrament, in order to qualify themselves for public employments. The clergy are obliged by law to administer the ordinance unto them; and thus prostitute the most sacred office of religion; for it is a civil right in the party to receive the sacrament. In that country, subscribing to the thirty-nine articles is a test for admission into holy orders. And it is a fact, that many of the clergy do this; when at the same time, they totally disbelieve several of the doctrines contained in them. In short, test-laws are utterly ineffectual; they are no security at all; because men of loose principles will by external compliance, evade them. If they exclude any persons, it will be honest men, men of principle, who will rather suffer an injury, than act contrary of the dictates of their consciences. If we mean to have those appointed to public offices, who are sincere friends to religion; we the people who appoint them, must take care to choose such characters; and not rely upon such cob-web barriers as test-laws are.But to come to the true principle, by which this question ought to be determined: the business of civil government is to protect the citizen in his rights, to defend the community from hostile powers, and to promote the general welfare. Civil government has no business to meddle with the private opinions of the people. If I demean myself as a good citizen, I am accountable, not to man, but to god, for the religious opinions which I embrace, and the manner in which I worship the Supreme Being. If such had been the universal sentiments of mankind, and they had acted accordingly, persecution, the bane of truth and nurse of error, with her bloody axe and flaming hand, would never have turned so great a part of the world into a field of blood.But while I assert the right of religious liberty; I would not deny that the civil power has a right, in some cases, to interfere in matters of religion. It has a right to prohibit and punish gross immoralities and impieties; because the open practice of these is of evil example and public detriment. For this reason, I heartily approve of our laws against drunkenness, profane swearing, blasphemy, and professed atheism. But in this state, we have never thought it expedient to adopt a test-law; and yet I sincerely believe we have as great a proportion of religion and morality, as they have in England, where every person who holds a public office, must be either a saint by law, or a hypocrite by practice. A test-law is the parent of hypocrisy, and the offspring of error and the spirit of persecution. Legislatures have no right to set up an inquisition, and examine into the private opinions of men. Test-laws are useless and ineffectual, unjust and tyrannical; therefore the convention have done wisely in excluding this engine of persecution, and providing that no religious test shall ever be required.|$|R

5000|$|Dementia is {{an ancient}} term {{which has been in}} use since at least the time of Lucretius in 50 B.C.E. where it meant [...] "being out of one's mind".

This condition could be innate or acquired and the concept had no reference to a necessarily irreversible condition. It is the concept in this popular notion of psychosocial incapacity that forms the basis for the idea of <b>legal</b> <b>incapacity.</b> By the eighteenth century, at the period when the term entered into European medical discourse, clinical concepts were added to the vernacular understanding such that dementia was now associated with intellectual deficits arising from any cause and at any age. By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century the modern 'cognitive paradigm' of dementia was taking root. This holds that dementia is understood in terms of criteria relating to aetiology, age and course which excludes former members of the family of the demented such as adults with acquired head trauma or children with cognitive deficits. Moreover, it was now understood as an irreversible condition and a particular emphasis was placed on memory loss in regard to the deterioration of intellectual functions.|$|E
5000|$|In Quebec, women's rights within {{marriage}} and family law have advanced slower than {{in the rest of}} Canada. Quebec has been slow on giving civil rights to married women: until 1954, a married woman was legally listed as [...] "incapable of contracting", together with minors, [...] "interdicted persons", [...] "persons insane or suffering a temporary derangement of intellect ... or who by reason of weakeness of understanding are unable to give a valid consent", and [...] "persons who are affected by civil degradation." [...] The removal of the married woman from this list however, did little to improve her legal situation, due to marriage laws which restricted her rights and gave the husband legal authority over her: <b>legal</b> <b>incapacity</b> was still the general rule. A major change followed in 1964: Bill 16 (An Act respecting the legal capacity of married women) removed the obligation of the wife to obey her husband, and gave the married woman full legal capacity subject to restrictions that may result from the matrimonial regime. However, discriminatory provisions resulting from matrimonial regimes and from other legal regulations still remained. In July 1970, Bill 10 came into force, reforming matrimonial regimes, and improving the situation of married women. In 1977 another important change took place: the wife obtained equal rights with the husband with regard to legal authority over the children during marriage, abolishing the previous rule of 'paternal authority' which gave the husband more legal rights with regard to judicial matters concerning the children; the new law created the concept of parental authority shared equally between the wife and husband. A major change also happened in April 1981, when new family regulations based on gender equality came into force. Other reforms followed throughout the 1980s, including the introduction of the concept of family patrimony in 1989, in order to ensure financial equality between spouses when the marriage ends. On January 1, 1994 the new Civil Code of Quebec came into effect, replacing the old one. This new code contains the current family law of Quebec, and it is based on gender equality: article 392 reads: [...] "The spouses have the same rights and obligations in marriage." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{analyzes}} the social, economic, and legal position of Parisian widows {{in the second}} half of the sixteenth century. Three principal aspects of widowhood are discussed: the position of the widow in the break-up of the family’s economic community that occurred with the death of the head of the household, the continuing role of the widow in the management of family properties, and the situation of the widow who remarried. The author argues that sixteenth-century notions of feminine frailty and the <b>legal</b> <b>incapacity</b> of married women in sixteenth-century Paris must be understood within the context of a traditional concern for the protection of the family line and property, and that there is an ironic contrast between the presumed frailty of the female sex and the important responsibilities for the management of family affairs and property with which widows were in fact entrusted.

40|$|Australian law {{marks the}} {{transition}} from a protected state of childhood and <b>legal</b> <b>incapacity</b> to a state of liberated adulthood and legal responsibility in many facets of life. The law says at what age an individual acquires legal capacity to make contracts, have sexual intercourse, consent to medical procedures, marry, consume legal drugs, drive a motor vehicle, and participate in elections. These changes in legal personality are not catalysed by merit or personal characteristics, but by the expiry of a span of time from each individual’s date of birth. The ages at which law sets these capacities is informed by historical habits, changing perceptions of children, and by other factors such as social climate, realpolitik and economics. Yet, since individual human beings develop at different rates – physically, intellectually, psychologically and emotionally – {{it is clear that the}} law’s conferral of rights and imposition of responsibilities occurs at inappropriate times for many individuals. This discussion sets out the Australian law ascribing criminal responsibility to children. It recognises the problems inherent in the Australian laws, and then outlines some of their legal consequences. These consequences include the low age of criminal responsibility in Australia compared with other nations, and the bareness of the law’s inquiry into when a child is criminally responsible, in many cases deciding the issue simply by age, and at most only seeking to assess the offender’s cognitive state. These legal principles demand an examination of psychological and human rights issues.

But how should a court respond if a mentally ill petitioner who is competent to manage most personal affairs seeks to divorce a spouse for bizarre, very odd, or crazy-sounding reasons? Several recent social developments - better psychiatric treatment, wider acceptance of divorce, population trends, {{and the advent of}} “no-fault” and unilateral divorce laws - have made it more likely that mentally ill petitioners will seek divorces. Yet the question of whether to allow a divorce action that is motivated by a petitioner’s psychotic ideas about his spouse is addressed in just a few published cases, and then only indirectly. Largely unanswered are questions about whether domestic relations courts have the authority to stop such divorce actions, to investigate competence of mentally ill petitioners, or to order mental health examinations of petitioners.

In granting the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Supreme Court said: 2 ̆ 2 The administratrix plaintiff is an officer of a foreign court. It is syllogistically true that if the foreign court has no recognized power here she may not assert a right derived through her appointment therefrom. The Mexican government is not de facto here, since recognition alone can make it so. It may have all the attributes of a ruling faction, a colony, a district of people, or maintain any other form of suzerainty in its established domain, but its power as a government remains nil without our patent of recognition. As the parent of the court it cannot have notice, either judicial or administrative, and surely the creature cannot be possessed of a power not given its creator. The duty to declare the <b>legal</b> <b>incapacity</b> to sue is paramount to a consideration of the evils attendant upon the failure of justice resultant upon this policy of international relations. 2 ̆ 2 It was apparently immaterial, in the court 2 ̆ 7 s view, that in fact Mexico existed south of the Rio Grande and that in fact it possessed a more or less effective government which included courts and a system of law. Until the United States Department of State had admitted, by word or act, that Mexico possessed a government, the New York courts felt constrained to remain legally ignorant and legally incapable of being enlightened. Such an attitude on the part of courts toward an unrecognized government or state has certain significant consequences. It requires that courts ignore important facts until the executive has seen fit to recognize them as such. It makes important private rights depend almost entirely upon the executive pleasure. In situations like that presented in the Pelzer case, it admittedly results in a miscarriage of justice. Is such an attitude required by sound legal doctrine or the established precedents of the law...|$|E

Consequently people with mental disabilities too, are entitled to the enjoyment of the same human rights, in equal measure, as all other people. New international human rights treaties and documents are adopted in order to strengthen security and realisation {{of the rights of}} most vulnerable groups of people. UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (CRPD) is one of the newest UN’s legally binding instruments, adopted by UN General Assembley in 2006, with its purpose to “promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity”. The Convention bringing about a paradigm shift in attitudes of persons with disabilities as “subjects” of all human rights and basis for their protection. One of the most substantive areas that demonstrates major ‘paradigm shift’ of CRPD is provision of equality before the law to all the persons with disabilities. The right to recognition everywhere as persons before the law puts an end to various practices of the removal of rights of persons depending on their health, disability status. After the ratification of CRPD on 27 May, 2010, currently Lithuania has all legal obligations under CRPD, including the provisions on the equality before the law As in majority of other Eastern European region countries, both full guardianship and partial guardianship (curatorship) meant to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable people lacking capacity existed in Lithuania for decades. Recently reform of this legal institute in order to adhere to the international human rights standards and respect the principals of disabled people human rights protection and nondiscrimination. There is no one state up to now with the developed ideal and effective model of supported decision making. Nevertheless is it at the very moment that all the states are reforming their legislative framework and existing pactices to establish the best and most effectives support measures for independent decision making and securing rights of persons with disabilities. On 26 March 2015 there was Law on amendment of provisions of Civil code and Code of civil procedure adopted in Lithuania with the purpose to improve the existing legal institutes of <b>legal</b> <b>incapacity</b> and capacity restriction with regards to pesons with disabilities (intellectual and psychosocial), and to implement the requirements of art. 12 of the Convention on equality before the law and support in decision making for persons with disabilities. Within the new legal provisions there are number of essential safeguards trasnsposed from the art. 12 of the Convention, that should protect persons with disabilities from possible abuse, and secure realisation of their rights. Nevertheless there are major critical aspects with regards the whole legal capacity reform. There remains the term „legal incapacity“ and possibility to declare person as incapable in the new legislative framework. With such a declaration the person looses possibility to realise his/her rights indepedently, and the guardian takes over the decision making powers. Such construct and relationships are still regarded as substituted decision making and in general contradicts the privisions of art. 12 of the Convention.
