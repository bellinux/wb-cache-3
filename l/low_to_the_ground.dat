5|$|The red-capped robin {{typically}} perches in {{a prominent}} location <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> often flicking its wings and tail. It is very active {{and does not}} stay still for long. The female has been reported as being fairly tame, while the male is more wary of human contact.|$|E
5|$|Mammillaria species tend to grow <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{in solitary}} or grouped in clusters. The genus {{is marked by}} its dimorphic areoles: the spine bearing, or vegetative, areoles are located on {{the apex of the}} tubercle, and {{flowering}} areoles are located inside the axils of the tubercles. The stem is woolly and covered with bristles.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E

25|$|Adults fly <b>low,</b> close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> This {{species is}} often seen in forest glades and forest edges. The males {{frequent}} cow dung and damp patches for mud-puddling, but at least on Borneo and probably elsewhere too not generally carrion or old fruit.|$|R
60|$|Just as {{they reached}} the spot near which Poopy was concealed, the child, sank with a <b>low</b> wail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> unable <b>to</b> advance another step. Keona seized her in his arms, and, uttering a growl of anger as he threw her rudely over his shoulder, bore her swiftly away.|$|R
5|$|They have a white {{double coat}} which {{requires}} regular brushing {{with a wire}} comb {{in order to prevent}} matting. It has a dense undercoat, while the outer coat is wiry and weather resistant. Markings on the face can be in a variety of colours including lemon, black, brown, blue, and badger, which is a mix of brown and black. Heavy body markings or patches or excessive ticking on the coat are discouraged. Sealyhams are <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and in muddy weather their long coats can become quite dirty. Sealyham coats are groomed by hand stripping, {{in order to keep the}} coat from becoming too soft.|$|E
5|$|Gunports {{for early}} {{gunpowder}} artillery {{had begun to}} be installed in English castles during the 15th century. At Kirby Muxloe, six gunports were constructed in the ground floor walls of both the gatehouse and west tower; these were then temporarily filled with bricks, probably to prevent vermin and to limit the drafts. Several more gunports were built lower down in the gatehouse, presumably in error as they were ultimately below the waterline of the moat and permanently blocked up. The range of any guns at the castle would have been quite limited, as they were positioned relatively <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Historians are uncertain to what extent any guns at Kirby Muxloe would have been useful in a conflict. The gunports are of early design {{and may have been}} intended to be symbolic rather than practical; they were well positioned across the castle's defences, however, and might well have been intended to deter a serious attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E
25|$|Lightning strike {{protection}} minimizes {{damage to buildings}} during lightning terminations. This is usually accomplished by providing multiple interconnected pathways of <b>low</b> electrical impedance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tail: Long and narrow, tightly closed, being {{slightly}} {{longer than the}} flights. The tail must not be carried too <b>low</b> as <b>to</b> touch <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] cried Miss Panney, in a {{voice that}} made the driver pull up his horses with a jerk. In a moment she had stepped from <b>the</b> <b>low</b> {{carriage}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and with quick strides was walking back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Witton house. Dora turned in the seat, looked after her, and laughed. It was a sudden, bitter laugh, which the circumstances made derisive.|$|R
5|$|The Katangese Gendamerie {{conducted}} a disorganised withdrawal to two camps southeast of Kamina. Shortly after the 09:00 the Swedish battalion reached the city center. Patrols slowly mopped up resistance and took several prisoners. J-29 jets flew <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> to intimidate the remaining gendarmes and {{were hit by}} small arms fire in return. At 09:55 the Swedish troops attacked the nearest gendarmerie camp, encountering only sporadic resistance. At 13:00 they secured the second camp unopposed, as the remaining Katangese had fled. The Swedes commandeered it and began working with municipal authorities to stabilize the local situation. The Swedish battalion had sustained no casualties and had seized about 40 vehicles, two armoured cars, a Bofors 40 mm gun, a recoilless rifle, several heavy machine guns, tons of ammunition, and {{a large amount of}} supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} session held on Saturday {{afternoon was}} split into three parts. The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 18th or lower. The {{second part of}} qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to 17. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race, and as such started the race on the tyres that they set their quickest lap on. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Webber set the fastest time in the final part of the session, which clinched him his third successive pole position with a lap of 1:26.295. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Hamilton, who recorded a lap time 0.148 seconds slower. Vettel set the fastest times in the first two qualifying sessions, but made mistakes on his first two runs due to a roll-bar failure in the final session which prevented him from recording a faster lap. He dropped to third overall in the final part of qualifying. Button made an error in his car set-up which caused him to run too <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> through turn eight which restricted him to fourth place. Schumacher qualified in fifth and was happy with his starting position despite spinning at turn eight on his final qualifying lap. Rosberg qualified sixth and despite wanting to start higher up the field, he was confident about his race chances.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountain}} is partially dome-shaped, with its famously jagged ridges extending to the sides. Mount Whitney {{is above the}} tree line and has an alpine climate and ecology. Very few plants grow near the summit: {{one example is the}} Skypilot, a cushion plant that grows <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Tracks!" [...] exclaimed Lumley, in a <b>low</b> voice, {{pointing}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> where footmarks {{were clearly}} visible, [...] "and fresh," [...] he added, {{turning up the}} snow under the track with {{the butt of his}} gun.|$|R
60|$|Peterkin was <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> {{come up with}} her. He {{gradually}} but perseveringly ran her down. When he {{came within}} a few yards of her, the poor creature sank with a <b>low</b> wail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and turning half round, glanced at her pursuer with a timid, imploring, yet despairing expression. Alas! despair mingled with it, because she knew too well the terrible cruelty of savage men when their blood is up, and she knew nothing yet of the hearts of Christians.|$|R
50|$|Erigeron chrysopsidis is a {{very small}} {{perennial}} herb up to 15 cm (8 inches) tall, forming a taproot. Most of the leaves are <b>low</b> and close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Each stem produces only one flower head, with 20-60 yellow ray florets plus numerous yellow disc florets.|$|R
25|$|Pupation {{takes place}} <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The pupa is {{suspended}} by a silken body band {{and attached to}} the substrate by a black cremaster. Its entire body is bright leaf green. A continuous yellow runs from the cremaster to the head, the head ending in a snout. In the similar Catopsilia pyranthe the snout is short.|$|E
25|$|According to the Boston Public Health Commission, 264 {{civilians were}} treated at 27 local hospitals. Eleven days later, 29 {{remained}} hospitalized, one in critical condition. Many victims had lower leg injuries and shrapnel wounds, which {{indicated that the}} devices were <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> At least 16 civilians lost limbs, at the scene or by amputation in a hospital, and three lost more than one limb.|$|E
25|$|For Owen Shaw's Flip Car, Lin tasked the film's vehicle {{designer}} {{with developing}} a car capable of driving head first into moving vehicles and flipping {{them into the}} air. McCarthy and his team designed a fully functional, <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> formula racing car with a ramp on its front that allowed it to catapult other cars into the air while keeping the Flip Car driver safe.|$|E
40|$|The {{basis of}} {{engineering}} seismology is <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> quantify how a given structure will respond <b>to</b> complex <b>ground</b> motions. <b>The</b> structure’s response {{is determined by}} its mass and stiffness distributions. For example, stiff buildings will experience <b>low</b> accelerations relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Tall buildings ten...|$|R
5000|$|Erigeron consimilis [...] is a {{very small}} {{perennial}} herb up to 10 cm (4 inches) tall, forming a taproot. Most of the leaves are <b>low</b> and close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Each stem produces only one flower head, with 30-55 white or pink ray florets plus numerous yellow disc florets.|$|R
5000|$|Erigeron cavernensis [...] is a {{very small}} {{perennial}} herb up rarely more than 6 cm (2.4 inches) tall, forming clumps of many individuals close together. Most of the leaves are <b>low</b> and close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Each stem produces only one flower head, with 12-24 white, pink or lavender ray florets plus numerous yellow disc florets.|$|R
25|$|The German forces {{knew about}} the Soviet dogs from 1941 onwards, and so took {{measures}} to defend against them. An armored vehicle's top-mounted machine gun proved ineffective due to the relatively small size of the attackers as the dogs were too <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{and because of the}} dogs' speed and the difficulty in spotting them. Consequently, every German soldier received orders to shoot any dog in combat areas.|$|E
25|$|The bounce pass is {{executed}} by getting <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> holding {{the ball with}} one or two hands at hip height, and stepping forward while releasing the ball. The ball should be aimed low at the ground and released {{with a great deal of}} force. The purpose of the bounce pass is to move the ball around an opponent. It is used when a player is in a confined space, with limited passing options.|$|E
25|$|Design {{engineers}} {{decided to}} mount the nacelles directly to {{the underside of the}} wings to reduce the landing gear length and kept the engines <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> for easy ramp inspection and servicing. Many thickness variations for the engine attachment strut were tested in the wind tunnel and the most desirable shape for high speed was found to be one which was relatively thick, filling the narrow channels formed between the wing and the top of the nacelle, particularly on the outboard side.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no woman}} in this {{wilderness}} could leave such a print as that, but the dark-hair or her sister. We know that the first has been here, but where are {{the signs of the}} other? Let us push deeper on the trail, and if nothing offers, we must go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plain and strike another scent. Move on, Uncas, and keep your eyes on the dried leaves. I will watch the bushes, while your father shall run with a <b>low</b> nose <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Move on, friends; the sun is getting behind the hills." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} their {{attention}} {{was attracted to}} a woman who walked immediately behind the slavers. She was a young and, according to African ideas, a comely girl, but was apparently very weak--so weak that she panted and stumbled as she went along, a circumstance which was accounted for by the little infant tied to her back, which {{could not have been more}} than a couple of weeks old. Stumbling against the fallen branch of a tree, she fell at last with a <b>low</b> wail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and made no effort, as on previous occasions, to recover herself.|$|R
50|$|Persistent above-average {{rainfall}} {{began to}} affect most of Victoria apart from eastern Gippsland in April 1909 {{as a result}} of strong southern low-pressure systems interacting with moisture in the Indian Ocean. Although April and May were moist, June was exceptionally wet, seeing in many places (e.g. Melbourne) a record number of rainy days for any month. The heavy June falls had already made <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> throughout Victoria very moist, {{and despite the fact that}} July rainfall was only above normal in the north of the State was of relatively little significance as evaporation was too <b>low</b> <b>to</b> dry <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
25|$|B. lecheguana is a prey {{target for}} a number of {{different}} animals. The lizard Tupinambis teguixin is known to prey on this wasp, having easy access to its nests since they are <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and easily accessible. A number of birds are suspected to prey on B. lecheguana, although there are relatively few documentations of this in the literature. Also, the army ant Eciton dulcius is reported to prey on this wasp. Another source of predation is by asilids, or robber flies.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect is}} a {{consequence}} of sand hitting helicopter rotors in sandy environments. Abrasion strips on helicopter rotor blades are made of metal, often titanium or nickel, which are very hard, but less hard than sand. When a helicopter flies <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in desert environments, sand striking the rotor blade can cause erosion. At night, sand hitting the metal abrasion strip causes a visible corona or halo around the rotor blades. The effect is caused by the pyrophoric oxidation of eroded particles and is known as the Kopp-Etchells Effect.|$|E
25|$|In SkyDrift players pilot one {{of several}} {{airplanes}} in a fictional racing competition. Gameplay is similar to other airplane racing games such as Plane Crazy and the flight mode of Diddy Kong Racing. The game features 33 single player challenge stages as well as online multiplayer. While the primary focus is racing, dogfights play a large part in some of SkyDrifts game modes. Players are rewarded with boost, which provides a temporary burst of speed, by flying acrobatically, <b>low</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> or by taking down opponents. Planes and their separate liveries are unlocked as players progress and complete specified challenges. As players progress on a given course they are sometimes presented with progressing environment hazards such as falling rocks or an avalanche.|$|E
30|$|Also, it is {{seen that}} <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> peak {{corresponding}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> bonding state in the cone-like structure is more significantly separated from other excited states than in two other structures. It is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stronger confinement of the electron in the cone-like structure where the electron is mainly located nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> donor than in disk-like and lens-like structures.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of a sailplane for reconnaissance included its silence, its <b>low</b> speed relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> (allowing for higher-quality photography), and its potential ability to loiter above an area of interest. The project gave the DFS <b>the</b> opportunity <b>to</b> investigate two additional areas that it was interested in - the effects of wing sweep on sailplane design, and supersonic flight.|$|R
50|$|It is a bold insect and {{not easily}} disturbed. It usually {{flies in the}} shade among bushes and under trees keeping <b>low</b> and close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> From time <b>to</b> time, it takes short flights, and, occasionally, much longer {{excursions}} into the open clearings. Its flight is quick and the path is very erratic making {{it very difficult to}} track when in flight.|$|R
