5|$|Scientists do not {{yet know}} what these dinosaurs ate. Having very small, ridged teeth they could not have chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that pachycephalosaurs <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruits. The sharp, serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} from football, Gatski was a scout for the Boston Patriots {{for two years}} before becoming head football coach and athletic director at the West Virginia Industrial School for Boys, a correctional facility for young offenders in Pruntytown, West Virginia. He worked there until the school shut down in 1982. He hunted and fished in retirement, and was often difficult to reach. He <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mountain in West Virginia and did not have a telephone for many years.|$|E

5|$|In 1931 Berni {{returned}} to Rosario where he briefly <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm and was then {{hired as a}} municipal employee. The Argentina of the 1930s {{was very different from}} the Paris of the 1920s. He witnessed labor demonstrations and the miserable effects of unemployment and was shocked by the news of a military coup d'état in Buenos Aires (see Infamous Decade). Surrealism didn't convey the frustration or hopelessness of the Argentine people. Berni organized Mutualidad de Estudiantes y Artistas and {{became a member of the}} local Communist party.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E

5|$|During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 {{million years}} ago), small emus <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> number of {{offshore}} islands of mainland Australia. In {{addition to the}} King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D.n.baudinianus) and Tasmania (D.n.diemenensis), {{all of which are}} now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was confined to a small island situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King Island emu population possibly underwent a process of insular dwarfism.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 France was {{overrun by}} Nazi Germany {{and for a}} brief period of time Cochet fell into war captivity. After his release he wasn't allowed to leave the country. He {{launched}} his own sporting goods store in Paris and <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm in the outskirts. He gave tennis broadcasts, and accepted the Vichy government's offer to head its youth tennis program and after that to become a sports commissioner, who organized sport programmes for the deported French armament workers. In December 1940 the first open tennis tournament, combining amateur and professional players, was organized in Paris where Cochet lost to Paul Féret. In December 1941 he regained his amateur status granted by the French Tennis Association. This was in line with the sports policy of the Vichy regime which opposed professionalism. The policy was administered by Borotra who had been appointed General Commissioner for Education and Sports in August 1940.|$|E
5|$|In Edmonton he {{established}} the developing town's largest meat packing business, upon land atop {{the banks of}} the North Saskatchewan River, overlooking the river valley. He would also get involved with the city's local politics, sitting on the Edmonton Town Council in the 1890s and early 1900s. In 1896, after the incumbent mayor had resigned, the town council selected Gallagher to briefly be the interim mayor until an election was held later that year. He served one more aldermanic term, but retired after defeat in the 1903 and 1907 elections. In 1911, he would also retire from his meat business. In retirement, Gallagher <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lavish estate on land he owned atop the Edmonton River Valley until his death in 1932.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1909, Bryant moved to Portland, first sharing a {{downtown}} apartment {{with one of her}} college friends, Clara Wold, then renting her own apartment in the same building. Among her jobs, she designed a stained-glass window for the Povey Brothers, worked as a freelance reporter for The Oregonian, and became an illustrator and society editor for the Portland Spectator, a weekly news magazine. Meanwhile, she formed friendships with people—such as Cas Baer, drama editor for The Oregonian—who were interested in journalism and the arts. In late 1909, she met and married Paul Trullinger, a dentist who <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> houseboat on the Willamette River, collected art, and liked drinking parties that sometimes included invitations to his office to inhale ether.|$|E
5|$|Sedimentological {{data from}} the Mussentuchit Member {{indicates}} that Eolambia <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> poorly-drained floodplain, around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated {{between high and low}} water levels in Milankovitch cycles of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits. During dry periods, the exposed lakebed formed a broad beach devoid of plants. The cracked mud of the lakebed produced mud clasts, while organic debris and scavenged carcasses were scattered around the water's edge as the lake progressively retreated. Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded the floodplain, which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|The {{band members}} {{eventually}} {{dropped out of}} school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> food allowance of $2 each per day.|$|E

5|$|The {{lineages}} of rorquals {{and right}} whales split almost 20mya. It is unknown where this occurred, {{but it is}} generally believed that they, like their descendants, followed plankton migrations. These primitive mysticetes had lost their heterodont dentition in favor of baleen, and {{are believed to have}} <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> specialized benthic, plankton, or copepod diet like modern mysticetes. Mysticetes experienced their first radiation in the mid-Miocene. Balaenopterids grew bigger during this time, with species like Balaenoptera sibbaldina rivaling the blue whale in terms of size. It is thought this radiation was caused by global climate change and major tectonic activity when Antarctica and Australia separated from each other, creating the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.|$|E
