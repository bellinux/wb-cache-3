The purpose of this thesis has been to determine how big <b>learning</b> <b>costs</b> Norway will have to subsidize {{in order to promote}} a sustainable and profitable production of 2 -generation biofuels in Norway. This for the manufacturing process of Alcohol to Jet (ATJ). The thesis evaluates the potential cost reductions that will have most impact for the production costs related to biochemical production process for ethanol and the ATJ-process. It was then constructed two learning curves with a learning rate of 6 and 20 % for investigating how the effect of learning will affect manufacturing costs and cumulative production. The task is qualitative and it is collected date from among other public sources. There is then calculated the cumulative production which is necessary to bring the production of Jet A- 1 down to a competitive level. It is estimated the total global <b>learning</b> <b>costs</b> and the share of global <b>learning</b> <b>costs</b> that Norway should subsidize. The analysis carried out shows that there would be major differences between a learning rate of 6 and 20 %.

We design a crowdsourcing system- PlanIt, where non-expert users label segments of the robot’s trajectory.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} an {{approach}} to <b>learn</b> <b>cost</b> maps for driving in complex urban environments from {{a very large number}} of demonstrations of driving behaviour by human experts. The <b>learned</b> <b>cost</b> maps are constructed directly from raw sensor measurements, bypassing the effort of manually designing cost maps as well as features. When deploying the <b>learned</b> <b>cost</b> maps, the trajectories generated not only replicate human-like driving behaviour but are also demonstrably robust against systematic errors in putative robot configuration. To achieve this we deploy a Maximum Entropy based, non-linear IRL framework which uses Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) to represent the cost model underlying expert driving behaviour. Using a deep, parametric approach enables us to scale efficiently to large datasets and complex behaviours by being run-time independent of dataset extent during deployment. We demonstrate the scalability and the performance of the proposed approach on an ambitious dataset collected over the course of one year including more than 25 k demonstration trajectories extracted from over 120 km of driving around pedestrianised areas in the city of Milton Keynes, UK. We evaluate the resulting cost representations by showing the advantages over a carefully manually designed cost map and, in addition, demonstrate its robustness to systematic errors by learning precise cost-maps even in the presence of system calibration perturbations.
