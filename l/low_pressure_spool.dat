40|$|The Geared Turbofan {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most promising engine configurations to significantly reduce the specific fuel consumption. In this architecture, a power epicyclical gearbox is interposed between the fan and the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>spool.</b> Thanks to the gearbox, fan and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>spool</b> can turn at different speed, leading to higher engine bypass ratio. Therefore the gearbox efficiency becomes a key parameter for such technology. Further improvement of efficiency can be achieved developing a physical understanding of fluid dynamic losses within the transmission system. These losses are mainly related to viscous effects and they are directly connected to the lubrication method. In this work, the oil injection losses have been studied by means of CFD simulations. A numerical study of a single oil jet impinging on a single high speed gear has been carried out using the VOF method. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the resistant torque due to the oil jet lubrication, correlating the torque data with the oil-gear interaction phases. URANS calculations have been performed using an adaptive meshing approach, as a way of significantly reducing the simulation costs. A global sensitivity analysis of adopted models has been carried out and a numerical setup has been defined...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGas {{turbine engines}} {{are widely used}} in both Military and Civil Aircrafts. The power {{generated}} at the turbine is transmitted to compressor through Engine main shafts. These shafts are classified as Class-I critical components of the engine. During the flight operating conditions engine main shafts are subjected to complex loading conditions, such as Torsional, Centrifugal, Thermal, Gyroscopic etc… The combination of these loads lead to multimode failure mechanisms, such as Low cycle Fatigue (LCF), High cycle Fatigue (HCF) and Ductile overload failures in shafts. Designing of shafts for structural integrity is very critical in single engine aircrafts, as the failure of any one shaft may result in the failure of engine, which in turn {{may lead to the}} catastrophic failure of the entire aircraft. The complex geometry of the shafts calls for combination of design tools for stress and life estimation of these parts (both analytical and finite element method (FEM)) backed up by extensive material and component test programs. In the present paper structural analysis and life estimation is carried out on <b>Low</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>Spool</b> and Spline Coupling under various engine operating conditions. The design analysis cycle consists of several phases, such as Heat Transfer Analysis, Structural Analysis, Optimization and Fatigue Lifing. Detailed modeling and stress analysis carried out to evaluate the strength of the splines is also presented. This paper highlights the methodology of design subjected to clearance of stipulated MIL 5007 D/E specifications to ensure the structural integrity. Based on the stress analysis, a Stress Test Schedule is prepared to carry-out the testing at shaft fatigue rig facility. In the testing facility, mechanical testing of the shaft assembly is carried out to establish strength and fatigue life of the shafts. Brief results on the material tests carried out and fatigue life testing of full scale component are also presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{various aspects}} of the development of a multi-disciplinary aero engine conceptual design tool, TERA 2020 (Techno-economic, Environmental and Risk Assessment for 2020), based on an explicit algorithm that considers: engine performance, engine aerodynamic and mechanical design, aircraft design and performance, emissions prediction and environmental impact, engine and airframe noise, and production, maintenance and direct operating costs. As part of this research e ort, a newly-derived semi-empirical NOx correlation for modern rich-burn single-annular combustors is proposed. The development of a numerical methods library is also presented, including an improved gradientbased algorithm for solving non-linear equation systems. Common assumptions made in thermo- uid modelling for gas turbines and their e ect on caloric properties are investigated, while the impact of uncertainties on performance calculations and emissions predictions at aircraft system level is assessed. Furthermore, accuracy limitations in assessing novel engine core concepts as imposed by current practice in thermo- uid modelling are identi ed. The TERA 2020 tool is used for quantifying the potential bene ts from novel technologies for three <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>spool</b> turbofan architectures. The impact of failing to deliver speci c component technologies is quanti ed, in terms of power plant noise and CO 2 emissions. To address the need for higher engine thermal e ciency, TERA 2020 is again utilised; bene ts from the potential introduction of heat-exchanged cores in future aero engine designs are explored and a discussion on the main drivers that could support such initiatives is presented. Finally, an intercooled core and conventional core turbofan engine optimisation procedure using TERA 2020 is presented. A back-to-back comparison between the two engine con gurations is performed and fuel optimal designs for 2020 are proposed. Whilst the detailed publications and the work carried out by the author, in a collaborative e ort with other project partners, is presented in the main body of this thesis, {{it is important to note}} that this work is supported by 20 conference and journal papers...|$|E
