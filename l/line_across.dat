5|$|Liman von Sanders {{was forced}} to {{withdraw}} from Nazareth {{in the early morning}} when the 5th Cavalry Division unsuccessfully attacked the town. During his journey to Deraa, Liman von Sanders ordered the establishment of a rearguard line running from Deraa down the Yarmuk River Valley, across the Jordan River and west to Samakh, around the shore of the Sea of Galilee to Tiberias and northwards to Lake Huleh. If this <b>line,</b> <b>across</b> the two main roads and railway lines to Damascus could be held, time could be gained for the consolidation of the retreating columns into a strong defence of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian expedition, led by Commandant Louis-Napoléon Chaltin, {{reached the}} {{position}} after a month-long advance north-east towards the Mahdist stronghold. The rebels, numbering two-thousand, {{had established a}} two-mile <b>line</b> <b>across</b> a range of hills, giving their numerically superior forces a tactical advantage over Chaltin's eight-hundred men. After a failed flanking maneuver by the Mahdists, Chaltin's forces stormed the heights and dislodged the rebel defenders. The Congolese companies pursued the retreating Mahdists back towards the town of Rejaf, where a final defense was made and similarly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Victory at Thermopylae {{meant that}} all Boeotia fell to Xerxes; Attica was then open to invasion. The {{remaining}} population of Athens was evacuated, {{with the aid}} of the Allied fleet, to Salamis. The Peloponnesian Allies began to prepare a defensive <b>line</b> <b>across</b> the Isthmus of Corinth, building a wall, and demolishing the road from Megara, abandoning Athens to the Persians. Athens thus fell to the Persians; the small number of Athenians who had barricaded themselves on the Acropolis were eventually defeated, and Xerxes then ordered Athens to be razed.|$|E

5|$|Flint scrapers, {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated {{that there may have been}} a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive <b>line</b> <b>across</b> the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E
5|$|On the peninsula, an {{enclave of}} Japanese troops had {{established}} itself after withdrawing north following earlier engagements in {{the centre of}} the island throughout 1944–45. Coming up against heavy resistance along Tsimba Ridge, the Australians' advance was halted for three weeks as they fought to wrest control of the ridge from the defending Japanese from the 81st Infantry Regiment, whose strength was roughly equal to that of the Australians. The main Australian attack took place on 6 February, {{but it was not until}} 9 February that the Japanese completely withdrew from the position. Small-scale fighting in the surrounding area continued until 22 February. The next stage of the campaign saw the Australians take Ratsua as they sought to establish a defensive <b>line</b> <b>across</b> the base of the Bonis Peninsula between Ratsua and Ruri Bay.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{is capable}} of {{displaying}} three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical <b>line</b> <b>across</b> the screen, and one which adjusts {{the speed of the}} computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, for example to change the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Lines</b> <b>Across</b> Maps are a British math {{rock band}} based in Lincolnshire, England. Their music is {{characterized}} by a use of complex time signatures and heavy, guitar driven sounds. In December 2011, shortly after the release of their debut EP, Stuart Smith of This Town Needs Guns described the band as [...] "a lot like Colour (now defunct UK math rock band)". The name <b>Lines</b> <b>Across</b> Maps is taken from the This Town Needs Guns song [...] "It's Not True Rufus, Don't Listen To The Hat". <b>Lines</b> <b>Across</b> Maps cite bands such as Jocasta Sleeps, Reuben, Oceansize, Biffy Clyro, Twin Atlantic, Blakfish and Meet Me In St Louis as major influences.|$|R
5|$|The {{line was}} {{constructed}} in two main portions by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, a private operator. The first portion, north of 42nd Street, was opened between 1904 and 1908, and {{is part of the}} first subway line in the city. The line ran from City Hall, up the Lexington Avenue <b>Line,</b> <b>across</b> 42nd Street, and up Seventh Avenue and Broadway, before splitting into the Broadway Branch and the Lenox Avenue Line. The second portion of the line, that south of 42nd Street, was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts, which were signed between the IRT, the New York Municipal Railway (a subsidiary of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), and the City of New York. Among the various subway lines that were to be constructed as part of the contracts, the West Side Line was to be extended south along Seventh Avenue to serve Manhattan's West Side.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminus}} for {{the high-speed}} line in London is St Pancras railway station. During the 2000s, {{towards the end}} of the construction of the CTRL, the entire station complex was renovated, expanded and rebranded as StPancras International, with a new security-sealed terminal area for Eurostar trains to continental Europe. In addition, it retained traditional domestic connections to the north and south of England. The new extension doubled the length of the central platforms now used for Eurostar services; new platforms have been provided for existing domestic East Midlands Trains and the Southeastern high-speed services that run along High Speed 1 to Kent. New platforms on the Thameslink <b>line</b> <b>across</b> London were built beneath the western margins of the station, and the station at King's Cross Thameslink was closed.|$|E
5|$|Victory at Thermopylae {{meant that}} all Boeotia fell to Xerxes; {{the two cities}} that had {{resisted}} him, Thespiae and Plataea, were captured and razed. Attica was also left open to invasion, and the remaining population of Athens was thus evacuated, {{with the aid of}} the Allied fleet, to Salamis. The Peloponnesian Allies began to prepare a defensive <b>line</b> <b>across</b> the Isthmus of Corinth, building a wall, and demolishing the road from Megara, thereby abandoning Athens to the Persians. Athens thus fell; the small number of Athenians who had barricaded themselves on the Acropolis were eventually defeated, and Xerxes then ordered Athens to be torched.|$|E

5|$|Following the Capture of Jericho in February, the {{commander}} of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), General Edmund Allenby ordered the occupation of the Jordan Valley. In March–April and April–May 1918, the First and the Second Transjordan attacks took place, while the front <b>line</b> <b>across</b> the Judean Hills to the Mediterranean Sea was defended. During this time, three-quarters of the British infantry and yeomanry cavalry regiments were redeployed to the Western Front to counter Ludendorff's Spring Offensive. They were replaced by British India Army infantry and cavalry which required a reorganisation. These newly arrived soldiers carried out a series of attacks on sections of the Ottoman front line in the Judean Hills during the summer months, as part of their training. These attacks including the Battle of Tell 'Asur and Action of Berukin in March and April, were aimed at pushing the front line to more advantageous positions in preparation for a major attack, and to acclimatise the newly arrived infantry. This fighting continued during the summer months. By the middle of September the consolidated EEF was once again ready for large-scale offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Sharon fought between 19 and 25 September 1918, {{began the}} set piece Battle of Megiddo {{half a day}} before the Battle of Nablus, in which large {{formations}} engaged and responded to movements by the opposition, according to pre-existing plans, in {{the last months of}} the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I. The fighting took place over a wide area from the Mediterranean Sea east to the Rafat salient in the Judean Hills. Here the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) XXI Corps with the French brigade sized Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie attacked the Yildirim Army Group Eighth Army's XXII Corps and German Asia Corps. The Battle of Sharon extended well behind the Ottoman front lines when the Desert Mounted Corps rode through a gap in the front <b>line</b> <b>across</b> the Plain of Sharon to occupy the Esdraelon Plain. Meanwhile, during the Battle of Nablus the XX Corps attacked Nablus while Chaytor's Force held the right flank in the Jordan Valley before advancing to secure bridges and fords across the Jordan River, to continue the encirclement the defenders in the Judean Hills. Subsequently, Chaytor's Force advanced against the Fourth Army to capture Es Salt and Amman after the Second Battle of Amman.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long <b>line</b> <b>across</b> the page. Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|E

5|$|The two battalions of the 27th Infantry {{went into}} a {{perimeter}} defense {{just north of the}} village of Soi-ri. The 1st Battalion, on the left of the road, took a position with C Company on high ground in front, and with A Company on a ridge behind it. On their right, B Company was placed parallel to A Company, and carried the <b>line</b> <b>across</b> the stream and the narrow valley to the road. There the 2nd Battalion took up the defense line with E Company on the road and F Company on its right, while G Company held a ridge behind F Company. Thus, the two battalions presented a four-company front, with one company holding a refused flank position on either side. A platoon of tanks took positions on the front line, two tanks on the road and two in the stream bed, with four more tanks in reserve. The artillery went into firing positions behind the force. Six bazooka teams took up positions in front of the infantry positions along the road and in the stream bed. At the same time, the ROK 1st Division remained in control of the high ground {{on either side of the}} 27th Infantry positions.|$|E
