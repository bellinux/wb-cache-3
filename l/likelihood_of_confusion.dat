Following the public unveiling of the Apple iPhone at the 2007 Macworld Expo, Cisco {{filed a lawsuit against}} Apple in January 2007, alleging Apple's iPhone name infringed on Cisco's iPhone trademark. Cisco alleged that Apple created a front company subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way, while Apple countered {{that there would be no}} <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> between the two products, because Apple's iPhone product was the first cell phone with such a name, while Cisco's iPhone was a VoIP phone. Bloomberg reported Cisco's iPhone as a product marketed for less than $100 and part of the Linksys home routers, enabling internet-based calls through Skype and Yahoo! Messenger, and contrasted it with Apple's iPhone as a mobile phone which sold for around $600. In February 2007, Cisco and Apple announced an agreement under which both companies would be allowed to use the iPhone name worldwide.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of generating candidate corrections for the task of correcting errors in text. We focus {{on the task of}} correcting errors in preposition usage made by non-native English speakers, using discriminative classifiers. The standard approach to the problem assumes that the set of candidate corrections for a preposition consists of all preposition choices participating in the task. We determine likely preposition confusions using an annotated corpus of nonnative text and use this knowledge to produce smaller sets of candidates. We propose several methods of restricting candidate sets. These methods exclude candidate prepositions that are not observed as valid corrections in the annotated corpus and take into account the <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> each preposition <b>confusion</b> in the non-native text. We find that restricting candidates to those that are observed in the non-native data improves both the precision and the recall compared to the approach that views all prepositions as possible candidates. Furthermore, the approach that takes into account the <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> each preposition <b>confusion</b> is shown to be the most effective. ...|$|R

Also, Brennan explained that in some cases, the <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> jury <b>confusion</b> in dealing with separate legal theories of relief could militate in favor of separate trials for {{the state and federal}} claims.

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that there are "canonical" {{viewpoints}} from which objects are identified most readily. Object naming has been the primary objective measure used to assess view canonicality, but this task has not proven adequate in distinguishing the many explanations of this phenomenon that have been offered. We examine object naming (Experiment 1 a) and name verification (Experiments 1 b and 2) to better understand the origin and nature of canonical view effects in recognition. In the name verification experiments, observers read an object name and then viewed an image of an object and decided as quickly as possible whether the image matched the name. The stimuli were images of 3 D computer models of seven common objects. Each object was rendered from one canonical viewpoint 2 (determined in a separate experiment by Blanz, Tarr, Bülthoff, Vetter, 1996) and two noncanonical viewpoints. Observers named the objects faster in canonical views, but performance was not affected by viewpoint in either name verification experiment, even on the first presentation of each view. We interpret these results in terms of a view-based similarity model. Naming is slow for noncanonical views because they are similar to stored views of more than one object, leading to response competition. The name verification task reduces the space of relevant views in long-term memory that must be compared to an input view, which for the views studied here minimized the <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusions</b> and eliminated differences in response times for different views...|$|R

40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} {{objectives}} - Confusion between similar drug names can cause harmful medication errors. Similar drug names can be visually differentiated using a typographical technique known as Tall Man lettering. While international conventions exist to derive Tall Man representation for drug names, {{there has been}} no national standard developed in Australia. This paper describes the derivation of a risk-based, standardized approach for use of Tall Man lettering in Australia, and known as National Tall Man Lettering. Method - A three-stage approach was applied. An Australian list of similar drug names was systematically compiled from the literature and clinical error reports. Secondly, drug name pairs were prioritized using a risk matrix based on the <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> name <b>confusion</b> (a four-component score) vs. consensus ratings of the potential severity <b>of</b> the <b>confusion</b> by 31 expert reviewers. The mid-type Tall Man convention was then applied to derive the typography for the highest priority drug pair names. Results - Of 250 pairs of confusable Australian drug names, comprising 341 discrete names, 35 pairs were identified by the matrix as an ‘extreme’ risk if confused. The mid-type Tall Man convention was successfully applied to the majority of the prioritized drugs; some adaption of the convention was required. Conclusion - This systematic process for identification of confusable drug names and associated risk, followed by application of a convention for Tall Man lettering, has produced a standard now endorsed for use in clinical settings in Australia. Periodic updating is recommended to accommodate new drug names and error reports...|$|R
