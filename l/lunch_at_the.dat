5|$|On August 26, 1940, {{a preview}} of the highway was {{organized}} by commission chairman Jones. It began the previous night with a banquet at The Hotel Hershey and proceeded west along the turnpike, stopping at the Clear Ridge cut before <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Midway service plaza. The preview ended with dinner and entertainment at the Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh. That month, a military motorcade traveled portions of the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|A C Benson was {{a friend}} of Henry James, to whom Walpole wrote a fan letter late in 1908, with Benson's encouragement. A {{correspondence}} ensued and in February 1909 James invited Walpole to <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Reform Club in London. They developed a close friendship, described by James's biographer Leon Edel as resembling a father and son relationship in some, but not all, respects. James was greatly taken with the young Walpole, though clear-eyed about the deficiencies in the artistry and craftsmanship of his protégé's early efforts. According to Somerset Maugham, Walpole made a sexual proposition to James, who was too inhibited to respond. Nevertheless, in their correspondence the older man's devotion was couched in extravagant terms.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, Vanity Fair {{writers and}} Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting for <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Algonquin. Alexander Woollcott, acerbic critic and war correspondent, {{received}} a warm welcome from literary friends in 1919. They gathered in the Rose Room that afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange of ideas and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Edna Ferber were {{also a part of}} this August assembly; these individuals influenced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. They founded The New Yorker magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day.|$|E

5|$|Beshear {{graduated}} as valedictorian in a {{class of}} 28 at Dawson Springs High School in 1962.

5|$|During {{the term}} of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford {{received}} monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, visited the Fords' home frequently. Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001 and of the Continuity of Government Commission in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{being told}} by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British {{officers}} at <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would {{be dealt with by}} Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at Le Caillou had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.|$|E

5|$|A hunter named Robinson, whose {{cabin was}} at the lake's {{northern}} end about 1800, was the first recorded inhabitant. He gave the lake its earliest known name: Robinson's Lake. However, {{for most of the}} 19th century the lake was known as Long Pond, because of its elongated shape. From 1822 to 1827 the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which followed the lake's western shore, was built between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. Beginning in 1827 the northbound daily stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon. The stage operated until 1851; the road was the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike until 1908, when the modern Pennsylvania Route 487 was built. Route 487 follows the course of the turnpike as it approaches the lake from the south, then passes to the east of the lake instead.|$|E

5|$|Yet celebrities often held parties <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hotel, and the Rolling Stones were {{guests for}} many years.

25|$|The hotel became Carte's most {{successful}} venture. Its bands, Savoy Orpheans and the Savoy Havana Band, became famous, and other entertainers (who were also often guests) included George Gershwin, Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne and Noël Coward.

Within hours, he was wearing a hidden body microphone in a sting operation, as he joined Garson for <b>lunch</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Archives Restaurant on Adams Street. He continued to wear the wire for weeks in meetings with Garson.|$|E
