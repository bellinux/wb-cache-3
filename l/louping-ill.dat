40|$|In {{some areas}} of Scotland, the {{prevalence}} of <b>louping-ill</b> virus has not decreased despite the vaccination of replacement ewes for over 30 years. The role of unvaccinated lambs in viral persistence was examined {{through a combination of}} an empirical study of infection rates of lambs and mathematical modelling. Serological sampling revealed that most lambs were protected by colostral immunity at turnout in May/June but were fully susceptible by the end of September. Between 8 and 83 % of lambs were infected over the first season, with seroconversion rates greater in late rather than early summer. The proportion of lambs that could have amplified the <b>louping-ill</b> virus was low, however, because high initial titres of colostral antibody on farms with a high force of infection gave protection for several months. A simple mathematical model suggested that the relationship between the force of infection and the percentage of lambs that became viraemic was not linear and that the maximum percentage of viraemic lambs occurred at moderately high infection rates. Examination of the conditions required for <b>louping-ill</b> persistence suggested that the virus could theoretically persist in a sheep flock with over 370 lambs, if the grazing season was longer than 130 days. In practice, however, lamb viraemia is not a general explanation for <b>louping-ill</b> virus persistence as these conditions are not met in most management systems and because the widespread use of acaracides in most tick-affected hill farming systems reduces the number of ticks feeding successfully...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were made}} to find {{evidence}} of <b>louping-ill</b> virus infection in free-living red grouse and relate this to their breeding success. In areas where ticks were abundant 61 (84 %) adult grouse had antibody to the virus compared with 1 (10 %) in areas where ticks were relatively scarce. Of 162 chicks tested 25 were shown to be viraemic. Infected chicks were of significantly less weight than comparably aged uninfected birds and the probability that they died was much {{greater than that of}} uninfected birds. It is concluded that the relatively poor breeding success in areas of high tick numbers was principally due to infection with <b>louping-ill</b> virus. The susceptibility of the red grouse to infection is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of short-tailed voles survived i. c. and footpad inoculations of <b>louping-ill</b> virus and many developed neutralizing antibodies. A short-lived viraemia developed after footpad inoculation, but the levels of virus were low and {{it seems unlikely that}} the vole could act as a principal reservoir host to the virus in infected areas...|$|E
40|$|The complex pathogen–host–vector {{system of}} the tick-borne <b>louping-ill</b> virus causes {{economic}} losses to sheep and red grouse in upland United Kingdom. This paper examines the spatial distribution, incidence and effect of control measures on <b>louping-ill</b> virus in the Bowland Fells of Lancashire. Seroprevalence in sheep {{at the beginning of}} the study varied within the area and was affected significantly by the frequency of acaricide treatment. There was a clear decrease over 5 years in the effective force of infection on farms implementing a vaccination programme, irrespective of acaricide treatment regime, however, only one third of farms apparently eliminated infection. On farms where vaccination did not occur or where vaccination was carried out intermittently, the estimated force of infection was variable or possibly increased. Thus, as befits a complex host–pathogen system, reductions in prevalence were not as dramatic as predicted; we discuss the potential explanations for these observations...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of colostrum-derived antibody to <b>louping-ill</b> virus {{on the course}} of experimental infection was investigated in lambs. Lambs that had high titres of antibody were refractory to infection. Lambs that had low titres of antibody did not develop a viraemia but either showed an antibody reaction or were sensitized as judged by the immune response, which was typical of an anamnestic response, after rechallenge. Animals that had no antibody 34 - 20 days before challenge had either no or very slight viraemia, but did develop an antibody response with titres as high as those of control lambs by day 21. Lambs that had been negative for longer periods responded {{in a similar fashion}} to controls. These findings are discussed in relation to the occurrence of disease in lambs kept in <b>louping-ill</b> endemic areas. It is concluded that in such areas infections of lambs are likely to be of minor importance as a cause of mortality and of little epidemiological significance...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{recognition}} that <b>louping-ill,</b> known for well over 100 years as an epizootic disease of sheep in Scotland, {{was caused by a}} virus transmitted by arthropods, many other arthropod-borne viruses capable of causing encephalitis in domestic animals or man have been discovered.

40|$|More than 150 arthropod-borne viruses are now recognized, {{and over}} 50 {{of these are}} known to produce human infections and disease.

40|$|The {{antigenic}} {{relationships between}} seven {{members of the}} tick-borne encephalitis complex of flaviviruses (group B arboviruses) were examined by raising a library of 16 monoclonal antibodies against {{one of them and}} examining their biological and antigenic properties. These clones reacted with only one of two intracellular, virus-specific polypeptides. One polypeptide [mol. wt. 58 × 103 (58 K) ] is related to the major envelope protein E, but the identity of the other is at present unknown, even though it is a major immunogen i experimental infections and vaccinations. Only those clones specific for the 58 K polypeptide contain either neutralizing or haemagglutinin-inhibiting activity, but these epitopes are not identical. In general, epitopes on the 51 K polypeptide were more heavily conserved than those on the 58 K polypeptide, although both conserved and variant epitopes were found on both polypeptides. One epitope was present on the 51 K polypeptide which was conserved on all seven isolates tudied and another epitope on the same polypeptide was specific for all the western isolates including one isolate of <b>louping-ill</b> virus. Using the monoclonal antibodies rai ed in the study, it was shown that <b>louping-ill</b> virus was closely related antigenically to isolates of the Western subtype of tick-borne ncephalitis virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of tick-borne disease agents {{and in particular}} the mechanisms which influence their persistence are examined with reference to the flavivirus that causes <b>louping-ill</b> in red grouse and sheep. Pockets of infection cause heavy mortality and the infection probably persists as a consequence of immigration of susceptible hosts. Seroprevalence is positively associated with temporal variations in vectors per host, although variation between areas is associated with the abundance of mountain hares. The presence of alternative tick hosts, particularly large mammals, provides additional hosts for increasing tick abundance. Grouse alone can not support the vectors and the pathogen but both can persist when a non-viraemic mammalian host supports the tick population and a sufficiently high number of nymphs bite grouse. These alternative hosts may also amplify virus through non-viraemic transmission by the process of co- feeding, although the relative significance of this has yet to be determined. Another possible route of infection is through the ingestion of vectors when feeding or preening. Trans-ovarial transmission is a potentially important mechanism for virus persistence but has not been recorded with <b>louping-ill</b> and ixodes ricinus. The influence of non-viraemic hosts, both in the multiplication of vectors and the amplification of virus through non-viraemic transmission are considered significant for virus persistence...|$|E
40|$|Ticks are {{of global}} {{interest}} as the pathogens they spread can cause diseases {{that are of}} importance to both human health and economies. In Scotland, the most populous tick species is the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus, which is the vector of pathogens causing diseases such as Lyme borreliosis and <b>Louping-ill.</b> Recently, both the density and spread of I. ricinus ticks have grown across much of Europe, including Scotland, increasing disease risk. Due {{to the nature of}} the tick lifecycle they are particularly dependent on environmental factors, including temperature and habitat type. Because of this, the recent increase in tick-borne disease risk is believed to be linked to climate change. Many mathematical models have been used to explore the interactions between ticks and factors within their environments; this thesis begins by presenting a thorough review of previous modelling of tick and tick-borne pathogen dynamics, identifying current knowledge gaps. The main body of this thesis introduces an original mathematical modelling framework with the aim to further our understanding of the impact of climate change on tick-borne disease risk. This modelling framework takes into account how key environmental factors influence the I. ricinus lifecycle, and is used to create predictions of how I. ricinus density and disease risk will change across Scotland under future climate warming scenarios. These predictions are mapped using Geographical Information System software to give a clear spatial representation of the model predictions. It was found that as temperatures increase, so to do I. ricinus densities, as well as <b>Louping-ill</b> and Lyme borreliosis risk. These results give a strong indication of the disease risk implications of any changes to the Scottish environment, and so have the potential to inform policy-making. Additionally, the models identify areas of possible future research...|$|E
40|$|The {{course of}} <b>louping-ill</b> virus {{infection}} in mice chronically infected with Trypanosoma brucei was investigated. The mean survival time of mice infected with virus alone was 10. 2 days, compared to 12. 8 days in mice infected with T. brucei 14 days before virus challenge, and the cumulative mortality {{in the two}} groups was 62. 5 and 90 %, respectively. Virus was only inconsistently detected in the blood of mice given virus alone but was regularly present at high titers for up to 12 days in the blood of mice previously infected with T. brucei. Titers of virus in brains were also higher in dually infected mice, and encephalitis was of greater severity. These results indicate that the immunosuppressive effect of chronic trypanosomiasis may markedly increase susceptibility to acute virus infection. In addition, it is concluded that vector-vertebrate relationships of arthropod-transmitted viruses may be altered by concurrent trypanosome infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} passage in HeLa cells to {{attenuate}} flaviviruses was investigated for three different {{strains of the}} mosquito-borne West Nile (WN) virus and two tick-borne viruses, <b>louping-ill</b> and Langat. One strain of WN virus, Sarawak, was attenuated 4000 -fold for adult mice by intraperitoneal or intranasal challenge after six HeLa passages. The HeLa-passaged virus was also found to be antigenically different a d tempera-ture-sensitive in its growth characteristics ompared with the parent. After six HeLa cell passages the Egypt 101 and Smithburn strains of WN virus lost their ability to infect monkey kidney cells and no longer killed adult mice, although inoculated animals became sick for several days. In contrast, two tick-borne flaviviruses remained as virulent for mice after six HeLa passages as the parent non-HeLa-passaged virus. Neither of the tick-borne viruses exhibited characteris-tics associated with temperature sensitivity. The re-sults, therefore, indicate that the mosquito-borne, but not tick-borne, flaviviruses can be attenuated by very few passages in HeLa cells. This observation may provide a model system with which to analyse the molecular basis of attenuation and/or virulence of mosquito-borne flaviviruses...|$|E
40|$|Rhesus, patas and vervet monkeys were {{infected}} i. c. or i. n. with three viruses of the tick-borne encephalitis complex (TBE) as follows: Turkish tick-borne encephalitis virus (TTE), <b>Louping-ill</b> virus and Central European tick-borne encephalitis virus (CETE).

TTE proved to be more pathogenic for monkeys than the other two members of the complex, whilst CETE was the least pathogenic. Injections of specific antiserum soon after infection tended to increase both the incidence of clinical signs and the moratlity. A proportion of animals with inapparent infections and a number of monkeys that recovered from the acute phase of the disease developed degenerative lesions in the cerebellum, often superimposed on the involuting inflammatory changes.

40|$|Cloned cDNA and {{synthetic}} deoxyoligonucleotides, complementary to {{various parts of}} the genomic RNA of tick-borne ncephalitis virus (TBEV), strain Sol]in, were used to distinguish between strains of TBEV and other flaviviruses. The cDNA probe hybridized with strains of TBEV and related flaviviruses of the TBE complex except for Powassan virus, and it did not react with flaviviruses of the Japanese encephalitis and dengue subgroups. Viruses of the TBE complex and some strains of TBEV were differentiated from TBEV strain Sol]in by the thermal stability of RNA-DNA hybrids. Negishi and <b>louping-ill</b> viruses were the most closely related to TBEV strain Sol]in, among viruses of the TBE complex. Eight strains of TBEV isolated in different geographical areas from different sources were tested by dot-hybridization with 11 deoxyoligonu-cleotide probes. The probes revealed genetic variations among strains of TBEV. The pattern of hybridization correlated with the source of virus strains: TBEV strains isolated from TBE patients reacted with more probes than strains isolated from ticks.

40|$|The {{importance}} of tick-borne diseases is increasing {{all over the}} world, including Turkey. Global warming, environmental and ecological changes {{and the existence of}} suitable habitats increase the impact of ticks and result in frequent emergence or re-emergence of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) with zoonotic characteristics. In Turkey, almost 19 TBDs have been reported in animals and men, involving four protozoa (babesiosis, theileriosis, cytauxzoonosis, hepatozoonosis), one filarial nematode (acanthocheilonemasis), ten bacterial agents (anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, aegyptianellosis, tick-borne typhus, Candidatus Rickettsia vini, Lyme borreliosis, tick-borne relapsing fever [TBRF], tularaemia, bartonellosis, and hemoplasmosis), and four viral infections (tick-borne encephalitis [TBE], Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever [CCHF], <b>louping-ill</b> [LI], and lumpy skin disease [LSD]). The growing number of TBD cases, in particular the fatal viral epidemics in humans, have led to increased public awareness and concern against TBDs in recent years. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a new political concept, called the "One Health" initiative, which is especially relevant for developing strategies against tick infestations and TBD control in humans and animals. It would be beneficial for Turkey to adopt this new strategy and establish specific research and control programs in coordination with international organizations like WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to combat TBDs based on the "One Health Initiative" concept.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 While historiography and {{interest}} in Tudor England at both the popular and specialist levels presents few signs of diminishing, there may nonetheless exist {{a sense that we}} have little left to learn about this period and its culture. A notable gap in our knowledge, however, remains regarding the mysterious disease known only as “sweating sickness” or sudor anglicus. This dissertation addresses and evaluates this disease {{from the perspective of the}} history of science, and in doing so, it makes three key arguments. First, this project examines how the early modern science and medicine known and practiced by Tudor subjects influenced their perceptions of this new disease, leaving them in a mostly helpless position from which to combat it and indeed often wondering if the unknown illness might represent a divine judgment, especially in the form of questioning a dubious claim to monarchy made by the first Tudor ruler, Henry VII. Second, the dissertation offers a detailed and layered thesis concluding that the disease was ultimately caused by an earlier version of the <b>louping-ill</b> virus, or LIV, a virus and accompanying illness which continued to affect parts of Western Europe, with its own unique strain still extant within Britain. The third argument will return to the opening statement of this abstract, and reveal how this more thorough and unique treatment of Tudor historiography does much to further our understanding of the Tudors and their citizens, all the more relevant since the “Sweat” even now is typically either mentioned in passing, or not at all, but those who write about this period of history...|$|E
40|$|Landscape {{heterogeneity}} can be {{instrumental in}} determining local disease risk, pathogen persistence and spread. This is because different landscape {{features such as}} habitat type determine the abundance and spatial distributions of hosts and pathogen vectors. Therefore, disease prevalence and distribution are intrinsically linked to the hosts and vectors that utilise the different habitats. Here, we develop a simplified reaction diffusion model of the <b>louping-ill</b> virus and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) system to investigate the occurrence of a tick-borne pathogen {{and the effect of}} host movement and landscape structure. Ticks (Ixodes ricinus), the virus-vector, are dispersed by a virally incompetent tick host, red deer (Cervus elephus), between different habitats, whilst the virus infects only red grouse. We investigated how deer movement between different habitats (forest and moorland) affected tick distribution and hence prevalence of infected ticks and grouse and hence, the effect of habitat size ratio and fragmentation on infection. When habitat type has a role in the survival of the pathogen vector, we demonstrated that habitat fragmentation can have a considerable effect on infection. These results highlight the importance of landscape heterogeneity and the proximity and size of adjacent habitats when predicting disease risk in a particular location. In addition, this model could be useful for other pathogen systems with generalist vectors and may inform policy on possible disease management strategies that incorporate host movements.

40|$|Ticks {{and their}} {{pathogens}} cause significant disease and economic loss in many animal populations. Despite this, experiments that test {{the impact of}} ticks and tickborne diseases on wild animal populations are rare. Here, we report on an experiment assessing the effect of ticks on red grouse productivity and chick growth {{in relation to other}} causes of poor recruitment at two sites in the Scottish uplands during 2005. Treated hens received two leg bands impregnated with the acaricide permethrin, while controls hens were untreated. Chicks were captured at c. 2 weeks of age and fitted with a metal patagial tag, and chicks from treated hens also received a permethrinimpregnated strip. Mean tick burdens in treated chicks were close to zero compared with a mean of around 12 in the control group. Although treatment reduced tick infestations, it did not increase brood size. Growth rates in chicks from control and treated hens were similar during the first 10 days and comparable with chicks fed an ad-lib invertebrate-based diet. These results suggest that in this case, neither ticks (and the tick transmitted <b>louping-ill</b> virus) nor food shortages was the main cause of chick mortality. However, mortality in the adult hens was around 35 %, and predation accounted for 62 % of these losses before broods fledged. Our results indicate that on our study sites, predation may have a more important impact on grouse population dynamics than ticks and tick-borne disease. We suggest that it may be more cost effective to determine the causes of poor grouse population performance before implementing popular but expensive tick control measures such as the culling of alternative hosts and running acaracide treated sheep ‘tick-mop’ flocks.

40|$|In {{the monkey}} (M. mulatto) the virus of pseudorabies, pantropic in the rabbit, behaves as a strict neurotrope. Infection, usually fatal, readily follows {{intracerebral}} and intracisternal inoculation of rabbit virus, and often intrasciatic inoculation; the symptomatology of the ensuing disease is described. In {{a limited number}} of experiments no infection resulted from intradermal, intramuscular or intravenous inoculation. Nerve and glial cells are primarily attacked by the virus, but no cytological or other evidence of susceptibility of non-nervous tissue or of growth of virus outside the nervous system was obtained. Certain cortical areas, of which the principal are the pyriform area, cornu Ammonis, island of Reil, lower lip of the Sylvian fissure and basal surface of the frontal lobe, are affected far more severely than are other parts of the nervous axis; the reasons for this elective distribution of the most severe lesions, seen alike after intracerebral and intrasciatic inoculation and analogous perhaps to that in poliomyelitis and <b>louping-ill,</b> are not obvious. Other areas of the nervous system are relatively insusceptible to the action of the virus. Cases showing clinically only a febrile reaction without definite nervous symptoms may later exhibit marked residual lesions at the sites of election. The blood and cerebrospinal fluid play no apparent rôle in disseminating the virus, which, after intrasciatic inoculation, spreads upwards by the nervous path. Some suggestion was received from the experiments that in monkeys possessed of immunity to B virus (Sabin and Wright, 1934) pseudorabic infection is less likely to prove fatal than in animals not so immune, but the observations made were insufficiently numerous to be of statistical value. The sera of 6 out of 26 monkeys were found to contain antibodies neutralising B virus; these 6 monkeys were all included in one batch of 7 received at one time from the dealer...|$|E
40|$|Populations of {{wild birds}} and mammals are often {{harvested}} for sport, subsistence or commerce. Sustainable exploitation is {{an important aspect of}} environmental management and is critical to human wellbeing. However, our inability to sustainably harvest even well studied populations is often due to poor demographic data and a lack of understanding of critical biological processes. A key component of sustainable harvesting is the density-dependant feedback between vital rates (births, deaths, immigration and emigration) and population density, as this mechanism provides populations with the capacity to compensate for harvest mortality. The aims of this thesis are to investigate density-dependence, compensation and sustainable harvesting in a traditional Scottish quarry species, the mountain hare, Lepus timidus scoticus, using a combination of replicated field experiments, cross-sectional studies and modelling. The mountain hare has been traditionally harvested for centuries and continues to be an important source of revenue for some land owners. Over the past decade the motive for killing hares has switched from predominantly sport shooting, to culling to reduce ticks and the tick-borne disease <b>Louping-ill</b> virus (LIV). <b>Louping-ill</b> virus causes high mortality, and can supress harvest, in economically important red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus. Sustainable management of the mountain hare is further complicated by cyclic, or unstable, population dynamics shown throughout their circumpolar distribution. The thesis begins with a review of the evidence that culling mountain hares can lead to a reduction in ticks and LIV prevalence, resulting in increased red grouse harvest. The empirical studies follow with the aim of providing evidence for compensatory survival and dispersal, and density-dependent reproduction. Two field study approaches were adopted; the first was a live-capture and radio-telemetry study which compared birth dates, survival probabilities and dispersal distances and rates of different age and sex classes between two populations under different harvesting regimes (harvested and non-harvested). The second empirical study used a cross-sectional design whereby population density of ten independent populations were estimated using Distance sampling, which preceded hare harvesting. Tissue samples of killed hares were collected, enabling the effects of population density on female fecundity and juvenile recruitment to be assessed. Finally, an age-structure, female-only matrix population model was parameterised using data from the empirical studies. Sustainable harvest rates were determined as the maximum harvest that produced a positive population growth rate and an extinction probability of less than 5 %. By manipulating age-specific harvest and initial population size, the effects of age-biased harvest and changing population size on population viability could be investigated. Results of the cross-sectional study revealed evidence for negative density-dependent juvenile recruitment. However, this finding was not translated into compensatory survival in either juveniles or adults, although birth date of leverets was significantly later in the harvested population. Overall, dispersal distances and rates were low. Dispersal distance was greater in the harvested population, although when distance was scaled to account for differences in observation time, to give a dispersal rate, no difference was found. Projections from the matrix model suggest that 40 % annual harvest rate is sustainable, although extinction probability increases with decreasing population size and as harvesting becomes increasingly yearling biased. Overall, no evidence for compensatory survival or dispersal was found, although density-dependent juvenile recruitment was identified and may be important in population persistence under exploitation. Survival and timing of breeding may be influenced by behavioural and physiological effects of harvesting, or environmental variation, which may have implications for unstable dynamics of mountain hare. I identify and discuss key areas for future research aimed at increasing our understanding of the effects of harvesting on mountain hare population dynamics and demography. In conclusion, we found little evidence that culling mountain hares can increase red grouse harvest, and therefore, cannot justify culling mountain hares for tick and LIV control. The low dispersal rates and distances, combined with limited evidence for compensatory mechanisms, imply that local blanket culls may succeed in reducing hare numbers with unknown implications for mountain hare population persistence and the wider biodiversity of the Scottish uplands.
