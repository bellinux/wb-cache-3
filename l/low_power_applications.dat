In those used in IMAX projectors, the {{electrode}} bodies are made from solid Invar and tipped with thoriated tungsten. An O-ring seals off the tube, so that the naked electrodes do not contact the water. In <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>applications</b> the electrodes are too cold for efficient electron emission and are not cooled; in high power applications an additional water cooling circuit for each electrode is necessary. To save costs, the water circuits are often not separated and the water needs to be deionized to make it electrically non-conductive, which, in turn, lets the quartz or some laser media dissolve into the water.|$|E
2500|$|Capacitive {{coupling}} {{has only}} been used practically in a few <b>low</b> <b>power</b> <b>applications,</b> because the very high voltages on the electrodes required to transmit significant power can be hazardous, and can cause unpleasant side effects such as noxious ozone production. In addition, in contrast to magnetic fields, electric fields interact strongly with most materials, including the human body, due to dielectric polarization. [...] Intervening materials between or near the electrodes can absorb the energy, {{in the case of}} humans possibly causing excessive electromagnetic field exposure. [...] However capacitive coupling has a few advantages over inductive coupling. [...] The field is largely confined between the capacitor plates, reducing interference, which in inductive coupling requires heavy ferrite [...] "flux confinement" [...] cores. [...] Also, alignment requirements between the transmitter and receiver are less critical. Capacitive coupling has recently been applied to charging battery powered portable devices. and is being considered as a means of transferring power between substrate layers in integrated circuits.|$|E
