40|$|Abstract. A long-standing {{problem in}} {{structural}} description theories of object recognition {{has been the}} lack of concrete proposals for parts, methods of dividing objects into parts, and relations between parts. Biederman's RBC theory and Hummel and Biederman's JIM model are seminal works because they present {{one of the first}} concrete solutions to this very difficult problem: RBC/JIM in turn {{played a major role in}} turning object recognition into a burgeoning research area. Here, a review of RBC/JIM as the state-of-the-art structural description theory of recogni-tion is presented. A main conclusion is that there are strong <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> the <b>scope</b> of objects which RBC/JIM can represent, and hence recognize, because mechanisms for dividing objects into parts and representing parts are not general purpose. Nevertheless, RBC/JIM has promise as a model of geometric object recognition, and there are other directions that may be pursued in the interest of developing a more general-purpose theory. ...|$|R

There are very strong empirical reasons for thinking that an image of the world as comprising self-sufficient national states is no longer valid. Others acknowledge this point and go on to claim there’s an important practical reason for this limitation: although liberalism argues that all persons have equal moral status, the level of social unity needed to make egalitarian justice feasible requires a bounded political community.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this essay is to analyze the {{emergence}} of a barter economy, and the rise of centralized merchants and a barter redistribution system out of a primitive barter system. The environment is a spatial general equilibrium model where exchange is costly. Since exchange becomes more complicated as the scope of the economy increases, it was proved that, after the economy reaches a critical size, the cost of trade expansion surpasses its benefits. This imposes <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> the <b>scope</b> of the economy and the production level. To overcome these limitations, rational individuals can develop a more advanced barter system leading to the appearance of centralized merchants. This more sophisticated system is the redistribution system. Under some circumstances, in the presence of transaction costs it may be optimal for individuals to keep using barter instead of adopting a monetary system. This result explains why some primitive economies, like the Incas in Peru and ancient Egypt, did not evolve to a monetary system, and kept barter as their main exchange system.
