5000|$|After Santoro {{graduated}} from Brock University with a Master of Accountancy in 2010, {{he became an}} accountant. He also started making videos on YouTube that year, mostly skits. In 2012 he got laid off from his accounting job. He described that experience in a vlog titled [...] "I <b>Lost</b> <b>My</b> <b>Job</b> Today". He then started focusing on his YouTube career and thus began posting videos weekly. Also during this time, he recalls in an interview, that he noticed that his educational videos, such as his top ten lists and [...] "50 Amazing Facts" [...] series, were viewed more than his other videos. That made him begin uploading those types of videos more frequently.

50|$|In {{the first}} year of democracy, Stevanović, like other people holding the same attitudes as his, couldnot find {{publishers}} for his works. It happened in the same year that I <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> and couldn’t have my works published, so I was unable to support my family. Nobody noticed this in the city which was caught up in war fever and nationalistic fanaticism. We had to leave. After a physical assault in the street, he fled to Greece with his wife and sons, and going through the experiences described in his writing, started the trilogy The Snow and the Dogs. His first book, The Snow in Athens, was published in Greek, and later on, in Serbian.With help from PEN and his French friends he managed to get to France to promote his book and, following an invitation from the publisher, decided to stay in France. Stevanović gave a number of interviews, appeared in many TV programs, participated in public debates and visited French towns; in all places severely criticizing the regime of Slobodan Milosevic. He joined Ivan Djuric, also an asylum seeker, and his Movement of Democratic Forces. They tried to convince the European public and politicians of how necessary it was to stop the war in the former Yugoslavia. They also tried to help Sarajevo, the city being bombed at the time. After the Dayton Agreement, the two of them criticized the delayed halt of war, the division of Bosnia and the nationalism of the politicians leading the three constitutive nations.|$|E
5000|$|Jack C. Mancino {{was born}} in Hungary 1968. He {{grew up in the}} {{riverside}} industrial small town called Leninvaros (Tiszaujvaros) (east region of Hungary).He was ten when he started to study art painting, graphical portrait, graphical landscapes drawing. At the beginning of his study he liked to copying art paintings using oil and acrylic paint that helped him to get the very important basic techniques. In 1980 at age of 12 he moved to (Halle Neustadt) Germany with his family. That short period of time he made improvement in the study of graphical drawing and acrylic painting due to copying comic book themes to sketch books and posters.When the family moved back to Hungary he felt that he wanted to make major improvement in art but there insufficient support by the local art teachers. Until 17 he lived in Hungary studying in an Industrial engineering school learning drafting in mechanical drawing. In 1986 he moved back to north Germany. He worked in a nuclear power plant on the north sea side region where he got a big impact of the different land and seascapes. He remembered: [...] "I was watching the sea all day long and I almost <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> because of it". At that time due to the great amount of working hours he was unable to focus on artistic activity. He spent a year in Germany when he moved to Canada (Toronto). He learned that the art themes on canvas was totally different in the western world compared to the art that was promoted in the communist era. Later he stated: [...] "There was a style what was so free with its own system rules". He started to learn more about abstract and surrealism. The modern art gave him a new tunnel of viewpoints and of color usage.(Kandinsky,Picasso,Rothko).|$|E

40|$|Gilbert Konango, of the Communauté des exploitants agricoles (CEA) farmers {{association}} In the small {{office of the}} {{farmers association}} Communauté des exploitants agricoles (CEA), 14 km east of Douala, Engonga Prétextat is engrossed in {{the latest issue of}} Spore. Asked about his interest in the magazine, he raises his head and, after thinking for a few moments, admits, I <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> as assistant accountant in 1988. It s thanks to Spore that I had the idea of turning to farming. Since then, I ve read every issue. Off the top of his head, he cites some of the nuggets of information he has found in the magazine, on the palmyra palm, the plantain banana and other food crops. That has been a great help to me in my job as a planter. I ve also learned a lot of tips, for example, how to collect rainwater. In the issue he is reading now, an article on cassava has caught his eye. The Groupe d'initiative commune (GIC), of which he is a delegate, has launched an initiative to promote cultivation of this crop. The office of Gilbert Konango, who is head of CEA, serves as the library, reception and reading room. Of the dozen or so people who have come to do some reading at the documentation centre on this particular day, three or four have chosen to stay indoors. The others have opted to sit on a bench in the courtyard. All of them are busy reading the few agricultural publications available, among them Spore and several books from CTA. Everyone who comes here reads it, observes Gilbert Konango. They learn about innovations, copy what others are doing and seek technical advice. The association has been a subscriber since 1992. Through the years, Spore has proved an indispensable teaching tool for Mr Konango. He uses it to prepare training seminars for farmers. We look through the back copies to find technical material for the chosen theme, he explains. The magazine is also a rich source of information for the various reviews published by the association. Among them is the bimonthly Le manioc (Cassava), of which there are a few copies on the table. A useful way of spreading information among the 1200 or so farmers who are members of CEA.
