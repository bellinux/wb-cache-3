25|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León on 13 May 2012, authorities discovered 49 decapitated bodies dumped on a highway. Official reports alleged that a <b>local</b> <b>cell</b> of Los Zetas had tortured, mutilated and decapitated their victims {{to send a message}} to their rivals. Morales however, had ordered the henchmen and the local boss of the Zeta cell to toss the bodies in the town's square and not outside the city limits, which supports the hypothesis that members in Los Zetas were disobeying their superiors.|$|E

30|$|The {{determining}} of {{the level}} of cell expanding is in fact to determine the region of cells in which the local nearest neighbors search should be carried out; see three levels of cell expanding in Fig.  2. In kNN search, the number of nearest neighbors, k, is typically pre-specified; and obviously, the number of data points locating in the <b>local</b> <b>cells</b> must be larger than the number k. Thus, the level of cell expanding can be iteratively determined by comparing the number of currently found data points with the number k. For example, when the k is specified as 15, and within the first level of <b>local</b> <b>cells</b> there are only ten data points, and thus the level 1 needs to expand to level 2. Similarly, if only 14 data points can be found within the second level of <b>local</b> <b>cells,</b> the level needs to be further expanded to 3. This procedure is iteratively repeated until enough data points have been found.|$|R

25|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) are of stromal origin and may {{differentiate}} into {{a variety of}} tissues. MSCs have been isolated from placenta, adipose tissue, lung, bone marrow and blood, Wharton's jelly from the umbilical cord, and teeth (perivascular niche of dental pulp and periodontal ligament). MSCs are attractive for clinical therapy due to their ability to differentiate, provide trophic support, and modulate innate immune response. These cells have the ability to differentiate into various cell types such as osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, neuroectodermal cells, and hepatocytes. Bioactive mediators that favor <b>local</b> <b>cell</b> growth are also secreted by MSCs. Anti-inflammatory effects on the local microenvironment, which promote tissue healing, are also observed. The inflammatory response can be modulated by adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) including mesenchymal stem cells and regulatory T-lymphocytes. The mesenchymal stem cells thus alter the outcome of the immune response by changing the cytokine secretion of dendritic and T-cell subsets. This results in a shift from a pro-inflammatory environment to an anti-inflammatory or tolerant cell environment.|$|E

This was a non-political organisation which was formed out of the seventeen strongest societies throughout England. It took until 1907 before the first branch of the NUWSS was formed in Wales. This occurred during a meeting at the Llandudno Cocoa House which saw Mrs. Walton-Evans become the president of the <b>local</b> <b>cell.</b> Other branches soon began forming across Wales, with the creation of the Cardiff and District branch in 1908 followed by Rhyl, Conwy and Bangor in 1909.|$|E
500|$|The five provinces act as {{intermediaries}} {{between the}} national government and their constituent districts to ensure that national policies are implemented at the district level. The [...] "Rwanda Decentralisation Strategic Framework" [...] developed by the Ministry of Local Government assigns to provinces the responsibility for [...] "coordinating governance issues in the Province, as well as monitoring and evaluation". Each province is headed by a governor, appointed by the President {{and approved by the}} Senate. The districts are responsible for coordinating public service delivery and economic development. They are divided into sectors, which are responsible for the delivery of public services as mandated by the districts. Districts and sectors have directly elected councils, and are run by an executive committee selected by that council. The cells and villages are the smallest political units, providing a link between the people and the sectors. All adult resident citizens are members of their <b>local</b> <b>cell</b> council, from which an executive committee is elected.

30|$|The kNN {{search in}} the <b>local</b> <b>cells</b> is, in fact, to further find exact nearest neighbors by {{filtering}} some undesired points. We first allocate an array {{with the size}} of k for storing distances, and initiate all distances to 0. Then for each of those data points locating in the <b>local</b> <b>cells,</b> we calculate the distance dist, and compare the dist with the kth distance; and if dist is smaller than the kth distance, then replace the kth distance with the dist; after that, we iteratively compare and swap the neighboring two distances from the kth distance to the first distance until all the k distances are newly sorted in ascending order; see Mei et al. (2015) for more details.|$|R

Note that currently those data points locating in the determined <b>local</b> <b>cells</b> are the Approximate nearest neighbors of the interpolated points. After that, we further find the Exact nearest neighbors by filtering those approximate nearest neighbors by inserting and swapping; see lines 31 – 58 in Fig.  5.

Many algorithms use interval analysis to approximate this curve, and to handle the topology of thefinal reconstruction.

The polygonal approximation contains fewsegments, and the Reebgraph permits to sum up efficiently the shape and the topology of the curve. Furthermore, we propose two algorithms to process <b>local</b> <b>cells</b> refinement and <b>local</b> <b>cells</b> groupingschemes.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a wireless communication {{environment in which}} {{a large number of}} <b>local</b> area <b>cells</b> are deployed within the coverage of wide area cells. In this environment, a scanning operation to detect a suitable <b>local</b> area <b>cell</b> for handoff can degrade the performance of a mobile station, because repeated scanning trials are likely to cause disruption of service and re-quire considerable consumption of power. Therefore, we propose and analyze a hierarchical scanning algorithm that is capable of providing MS-specific neighbor cell information. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the number of scanning trials required to detect a suitable <b>local</b> area <b>cell</b> for handoff.
