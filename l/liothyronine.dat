50|$|Low-dose <b>liothyronine</b> {{has been}} shown to improve {{depression}} symptoms in patients with normal thyroid function who do not have adequate relief from their depression after trying several different antidepressants. When added to existing medications, <b>liothyronine</b> helped achieve remission in 24% of patients participating in a subset of the large STAR*D depression trial. According to a 2001 meta-analysis that analyzed the effectiveness of adding <b>Liothyronine</b> to tricyclic antidepressants, women in particular may benefit from <b>Liothyronine.</b> The average effective dose for depression was 45 mcg of <b>Liothyronine</b> daily, which is lower than the doses used for treating hypothyroidism. About 9% of patients stopped taking <b>liothyronine</b> due to side effects. The difference in gender response may be due to differences in metabolism of thyroid precursors.|$|E
50|$|Per the <b>liothyronine</b> product insert, the {{starting}} dose may start at 5 mcg daily and increase by 5 mcg every two weeks. However, {{it should be}} noted that <b>liothyronine</b> should be taken with levothyroxine when <b>liothyronine</b> is taken long-term to avoid potential heart rate and rhythm abnormalities. Taking both levothyhroxine and <b>liothyronine</b> separately allows for optimizing of reverse T3 and resolution of potential conversion problems of T4 to T3. Peripheral conversion problems are common when there is physiological stress (this will be felt as increased fatigue).|$|E
50|$|Physicians may use <b>liothyronine</b> {{instead of}} or in {{addition}} to levothyroxine (T4) for patients undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal. When a patient has thyroid cancer or Graves' disease, ablation therapy with radioactive iodine (131I) {{can be used to}} remove trace thyroid tissue that may remain after thyroidectomy (surgical excision of the gland). For 131I therapy to be effective, the trace thyroid tissue must be avid to iodine, which is achieved by elevating the patient's TSH levels. For patients taking levothyroxine, TSH may be boosted by discontinuing levothyroxine for 3-6 weeks. This long period of hormone withdrawal is required because of levothyroxine's relatively long biological half-life, and may result in symptoms of hypothyroidism in the patient. The shorter half-life of <b>liothyronine</b> permits a withdrawal period of two weeks, which may minimize hypothyroidism symptoms. One protocol is to discontinue levothyroxine, then prescribe <b>liothyronine</b> while the T4 levels are falling, and finally stop the <b>liothyronine</b> two weeks before the radioactive iodine treatment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Liothyronine</b> is {{the most}} potent form of thyroid hormone. As a salt of {{triiodothyronine}} (T3), it is chemically similar and pharmacologically equivalent to T3. As such, it acts on the body to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness. As monotherapy or in combination therapy with SSRIs, <b>liothyronine</b> may also enhance generation of new neurons in the central nervous system. The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. These hormones also regulate protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, affecting how human cells use energetic compounds.|$|E
50|$|Any {{person with}} a {{hypersensitivity}} to <b>liothyronine</b> sodium or any active ingredient of the formulation should not be on this medication. If there is uncorrected adrenal insufficiency or thyrotoxicosis, {{a different approach to}} therapy must be considered.|$|E

50|$|Desiccated thyroid {{products}} have both T4 (levothyroxine) and T3 (<b>liothyronine)</b> in one tablet in {{a ratio of}} 4 to 1 (T4 to T3). If the body does not metabolize thyroid hormones in this ratio (which is possible due to a thyroid problem) symptoms may worsen. This may be a reason to take levothyroxine and <b>liothyronine</b> separately and target for upper range for fT3 and fT4, with rT3 in the bottom quartile. This is one therapeutic approach for patients who feel worse (HR>100bpm or profound fatigue or increased anxiety) after they start either levothyroxine or a desiccated thyroid product. These patients may benefit more from a customized ratio of T3/T4 such as reducing the ratio from 4:1 to 3:1 to 2:1 and so on until both symptomatic improvement and labs in ideal range as explained above. Patients who still have complications after obtaining normal labs may benefit from a slow-release formulation from a compounded pharmacy (no slow-release thyroid product is currently manufactured {{so it must be}} compounded).|$|E

5000|$|Today most {{patients}} {{are treated with}} levothyroxine, or a similar synthetic thyroid hormone. [...] Different polymorphs of the compound have different solubilities and potencies. Additionally, natural thyroid hormone supplements from the dried thyroids of animals are still available. Levothyroxine contains T4 only and is therefore largely ineffective for patients unable to convert T4 to T3. These patients may choose to take natural thyroid hormone, as it contains a mixture of T4 and T3, or alternatively supplement with a synthetic T3 treatment. In these cases, synthetic <b>liothyronine</b> is preferred due to the potential differences between the natural thyroid products. Some {{studies show that the}} mixed therapy is beneficial to all patients, but the addition of lyothyronine contains additional side effects and the medication should be evaluated on an individual basis. Some natural thyroid hormone brands are FDA approved, but some are not. Thyroid hormones are generally well tolerated. [...] Thyroid hormones are usually not dangerous for pregnant women or nursing mothers, but should be given under a doctor's supervision. In fact, if a woman who is hypothyroid is left untreated, her baby is at a higher risk for birth defects. When pregnant, a woman with a low-functioning thyroid will also need to increase her dosage of thyroid hormone. One exception is that thyroid hormones may aggravate heart conditions, especially in older patients; therefore, doctors may start these patients on a lower dose and work up to a larger one to avoid risk of heart attack.|$|E

40|$|At present, {{the drug}} of choice for the {{treatment}} of hypothyroidism is levothyroxine sodium, even though the thyroid gland secretes both thyroxine and 30, 3, 5 -triiodothyronine; the latter is the more active of the two at the cellular level because of its higher affinity for the nuclear thyroid hormone receptors. To date, combined levothyroxine plus <b>liothyronine</b> treatment for hypothyroidism has been evaluated in 15 clinical trials in humans.

40|$|Introduction: Patients {{administered}} with {{a therapeutic}} dose of 131 I for thyroid cancer treatment are {{potential sources of}} unacceptably high radiation exposure to other individuals, particularly the patient's immediate family members. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate effects of early <b>liothyronine</b> consumption after radio-iodine therapy on accumulated dose and exposure rate in patients with thyroid carcinoma. This study was also undertaken to provide specific guidelines as to when 131 I treated thyroid cancer patients may be safe to resume close contact with their family members. "nMethods: Forty patients treated postoperatively by 131 I for the first time were studied. These patients were divided into two groups of twenty (group 1 with <b>liothyronine</b> and group 2 without <b>liothyronine).</b> The administered dose was 100 mCi for all patients. Thermoluminescent dosimeter chips were placed on the neck of the patients to measure thyroid dose. <b>Liothyronine</b> was administered 24 h after iodine therapy. Accumulated dose was measured at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after iodine therapy. Exposure rate was also measured at 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 meters from the patient's body axis with Geiger-Muller detectors at discharge time and one week later. "nResults: The findings indicated that <b>liothyronine</b> reduces accumulated dose of thyroid and stimulates rapid washout from the body after 48 h. The patient exposure rate was significantly higher in group 2 during or one week following discharge from the hospital. "nConclusion: This study shows that <b>liothyronine</b> consumption decreases the exposure rate of patients at discharge time to the levels lower than that recommended by regulatory organizations. &nbsp...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Objective. Despite the {{effectiveness}} of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in treating major depressive disorder (MDD), its cognitive side effects make it less popular. This study investigated the impact of <b>liothyronine</b> on ECT-induced memory deficit in patients with MDD. Methodology. This is a double-blind clinical trial, in which 60 patients with MDD who were referred for ECT were selected. The diagnosis {{was based on the}} criteria of DSM-IV-TR. Patients were divided randomly into two groups to receive either <b>liothyronine</b> (50 [*]mcg every morning) or placebo. After the assessment with Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) before first session of ECT, posttests were repeated again, two months after the completion of ECT. Findings. By controlling the pretest scores, the mean scores of the experimental group were higher than the control group in delayed recall, verbal memory, visual memory, general memory, and attention/concentration scales (P< 0. 05). Conclusion. <b>Liothyronine</b> may prevent ECT-induced memory impairment in patients with MDD. This study has been registered in IRCT under IRCT 201401122660 N 2...|$|E
40|$|Female rats {{treated with}} <b>liothyronine</b> or its solvent (control rats) {{were given an}} {{intravenous}} injection of [14 C]-L-histidine. The amount of [14 C]-histamine in various tissues was measured at 10 min, 60 min and 22 hr after the injection. In control rats the glandular stomach contained large amounts of [14 C]-histamine at 10 and 60 min, with a sharp decline at 22 hr. The skin contained small amounts at 10 and 60 min, with a slight rise at 22 hr. In rats treated with <b>liothyronine</b> there was more [14 C]-histamine in the stomach at 10 and 60 min, but not at 22 hr after the injection of [14 C]-L-histidine. The results support the following conclusions: (1) The glandular stomach in the intact rat forms more histamine than do other tissues; the gastric histamine is in a rapid state of turnover {{and is likely to}} contribute substantially to the urinary output of histamine. (2) After treatment with <b>liothyronine</b> the rat has an increased histamine formation in the stomach; this is probably the main cause of the raised urinary histamine excretion in such a rat...|$|E

40|$|A fully {{automated}} methodology {{was developed for}} {{the determination of the}} thyroid hormones levothyroxine (T 4) and <b>liothyronine</b> (T 3). The proposed method exploits the formation of highly coloured charge-transfer (CT) complexes between these compounds, acting as electron donors, and pi-acceptors such as chloranilic acid (CIA) and 2, 3 -dichloro- 5, 6 -dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ). For automation of the analytical procedure a simple, fast and versatile single interface flow system (SIFA) was implemented guaranteeing a simplified performance optimisation, low maintenance and a cost-effective operation. Moreover, the single reaction interface assured a convenient and straightforward approach for implementing job`s method of continuous variations used to establish the stoichiometry of the formed CT complexes. Linear calibration plots for levothyroxine and <b>liothyronine</b> concentrations ranging from 5. 0 x 10 (- 5) to 2. 5 x 10 (- 4) mol L(- 1) and 1. 0 x 10 (- 5) to 1. 0 x 10 (- 4) mol L(- 1), respectively, were obtained, with good precision (R. S. D. < 4. 6 % and < 3. 9 %) and with a determination frequency of 26 h(- 1) for both drugs. The results obtained for pharmaceutical formulations were statistically comparable to the declared hormone amount with relative deviations lower than 2. 1 %.
