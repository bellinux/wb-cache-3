25|$|Bouré's child recalls in {{some aspects}} the Apollo Sauroctonos ("Apollo the Lizard-Slayer"), an often-reproduced figure in {{classical}} antiquity of the pubescent god observing a lizard as it climbs up a tree. The original bronze was attributed to the Athenian sculptor Praxiteles. The Louvre acquired a white marble version in 1807. The sculpture received attention in French-language books on art published while Bouré was active, including Émile Gebhart's Praxitèle (1864) and Wilhelm Fröhner's Notice de la sculpture antique du Musée Impérial du Louvre (1878). If {{an image of the}} Sauroctonos is rotated and flipped horizontally, the compositional resemblances with Bouré's L'enfant au <b>lézard</b> become more evident. The Apollo's overall height of nearly 5 feet, which includes the tree trunk extending past the body, gives the figure a vertical proportion comparable to that of Bouré's 4-foot horizontal boy.|$|E
25|$|The {{train line}} {{referred}} to in the lyrics runs from Metlaoui in the north through the Selja Gorges in the Atlas Mountains to Tozeur on the border of the Sahara desert in the south, the frontier mentioned is subsequently the Tunisian-Algerian. The track was built in the early 1900s at an enormous cost of both state finances and human lives in order for the Bey of Tunis (the King of Tunisia) to travel in grand style to his winter palace in the oasis town of Tozeur and largely also to impress foreign dignitaries on visit. There was originally only one train set, built in Paris in 1910 and this was an official gift from the state of France to the Bey of Tunisia when the country was a French protectorate. With all five carriages painted deep-red it was colloquially named 'Le <b>Lézard</b> Rouge' (The Red Lizard) by the oppressed and empoverished Tunisian people and was seen as a symbol of both the emperor's power and extravagant Western-influenced life-style and the French imperialism.|$|E
500|$|In The Guardian, Nicholas <b>Lezard</b> {{praised the}} idea behind the concert: [...] "One can imagine {{no better way to}} get {{children}} interested in classical music than by plonking them down in front of an orchestra belting out music from Doctor Who." [...] <b>Lezard</b> noted that the non-Doctor Who music [...] "was received with baffled tolerance"; he said that the BBC Philharmonic played [...] "Montagues and Capulets" [...] "crisply and excitingly", but felt that [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] "tends to sound a little underpowered unless played by two orchestras at once". <b>Lezard</b> called Gold's work [...] "a little derivative" [...] but [...] "perfectly suited to the task"; however, he complained that Gold's orchestration of the Doctor Who theme [...] "drowned" [...] Delia Derbyshire's original arrangement. He wrote that [...] "the hundred-strong choir and soloist Melanie Pappenheim performed flawlessly," [...] and also praised the technical execution of the complex programme.|$|E

[...] Glover's colleague Nigel Andrew was not a fan of the adultery storyline and wanted the old Ruth back, saying she had [...] "been replaced by Ruth Mark 2, a helpless overgrown teenager, reduced to a puddle of lust by amorous cowman Sam." [...] Rachel Cooke of the New Statesman was not a fan of the character at all, writing [...] "Ruth bores me to sobs, so I didn't give a fig that this was out of character."

500|$|Despite being {{popular with}} many, the {{character}} of Ruth has also gained much criticism over the years. In 2007, Karen Price from the Western Mail called Ruth a [...] "much-loved character" [...] and The Scotsman's Fordyce Maxwell called Ruth [...] "the archetype of common sense and forward planning". Victoria Summerley from The Independent noted the character was [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] {{because she is a}} Geordie and bemoaned the fact [...] "poor inoffensive Ruth" [...] was disliked by some of the more hardcore fans because of this. Nicholas <b>Lezard</b> from the same publication disliked Ruth, branding her [...] "highly irritating". He later thought the scriptwriters had created in David and Ruth [...] "the only couple in the Western Hemisphere who are delighted that their parents are coming for Christmas." [...] Ruth and David were described by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as [...] "the series' golden couple — the future Phil and Jill". While The Herald's Anne Simpson said the couple were [...] "the standing stones of Ambridge: rooted, solid, weathered by storms but unbeaten, a reassuring constant in our national life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{other work}} for which Bouré is most noted shows a strikingly {{different}} {{side of the}} artist. The white marble Le <b>lézard</b> or L'enfant au <b>lezard,</b> not quite 4 feet long and about 2 feet high (overall 61.5 by 118.5 by 39cm), depicts a nude boy lying on his stomach, ankles crossed, resting on his left elbow {{with his right hand}} cocked inquisitively as he directs his absorbed gaze down at a small lizard. Bouré created this délicieux morceau during the period 1872–1874. It was praised for its fine modeling and lifelike expression, its charm and grace of attitude, and the [...] "rare suppleness of its lines." [...] Le <b>lézard</b> was not uniformly admired. One critic noted its [...] "poverty of imagination" [...] and thinness of execution, while admitting other qualities.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the subject}} matter seems out of keeping with Bouré's monumental and public works, his friend Rodin was also {{sculpting}} children during his time in Belgium in the 1870s, when Bouré was a visitor to his studio. Several years later, Rodin produced the bronze Les enfants au <b>lézard</b> (Children with a Lizard), depicting {{a little girl who}} retreats to her older sister's arms in fear of the small lizard below. Despite a similarity of subject matter, the work bears little resemblance to Bouré's sinuous reclining figure. Rodin's approach to representing children as [...] "well-fed babies" [...] has been related to his practice in drawing cupids (erotes) for various two-dimensional media.|$|E
2500|$|Levy's {{writing has}} earned him {{numerous}} awards, including the Emil Grunzweig Human Rights Award in 1996 by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, the Anna Lindh Foundation Journalism Award in 2008 for an article {{he wrote about}} Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces, and the Peace Through Media Award in 2012. He {{has been described as}} [...] "a powerful liberal voice" [...] by The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman and praised by Johann Hari of The Independent as [...] "the heroic Israeli journalist". Journalist and literary critic Nicholas <b>Lezard</b> in his review of Levy's book The Punishment of Gaza described him as [...] "an Israeli dedicated to saving his country's honour," [...] although [...] "there is much of the story he leaves out." [...] He has been profiled in Le Monde and [...] Der Spiegel. [...] "He has a global name. He may be [...] the most famous and the most invited journalists in Israel", wrote Israeli journalist Ben-Dror Yemini.|$|E
2500|$|There then {{followed}} two cantatas {{based on the}} poetry of René Char. Of Le Visage nuptial Griffiths observes that [...] "Char’s five poems speak in hard-edged surrealist imagery of an ecstatic sexual passion", which Boulez reflected in music [...] "on the borders of fevered hysteria". He explored modes of articulation between song and speech, as well as quarter-tones. [...] In its original version (1946–47) the piece was scored for small forces (soprano, contralto, two ondes Martenot, piano and percussion). Forty years later Boulez arrived at the definitive version for soprano, mezzo-soprano, chorus and orchestra (1985–89). Le Soleil des eaux (1948) originated in incidental music for a radio drama by Char. It went though three further versions before reaching its final form in 1965 as a piece for soprano, mixed chorus and orchestra. The first movement (Complainte du <b>lézard</b> amoureux) is a love song addressed by a lizard to a goldfinch {{in the heat of}} a summer day, in an atmosphere which Jameux characterises as [...] "fluid and nonchalant". By contrast the second movement (La Sorgue) is described by Griffiths as a violent and incantatory protest against the pollution of the river Sorgue, [...] "with shouting chorus and a bounding quaver rhythm".|$|E
50|$|Flowers {{returned}} to Paris in the mid-nineties {{to perform at}} the ‘Lucky Nugget Saloon’ at Disneyland Paris where she played the leading role of Miss Diamond Lil. ». In 1998 she started a career in voice-over and cartoon work. She is the english speaking ‘voice’ for Air France and Skyteam and has also taken over Jane Fonda’s voice for the L’Oreàl Age Reperfect Repair campaign in both English and in French. Her character voice work can be heard bringing Mimi and Miss Brigitte alive in the cartoon series « Eliot Kid » as well as Sissy in « Code Lyoko ».Parallel to this, she continued singing in Parisian Clubs (Sunside Jazz Club, Autour de Midi, Franc Pinot, 7 <b>Lézards,</b> Hot Brass) with her jazz trio composed of Jobic Le Masson, Peter Giron and John Betsch. In 2007, she collaborated on 2 songs as vocalist by the popular electro jazz/lounge group « Sofa Attitiude » for their debut album « Urban Love ». In 2009 she began recording her second album, ‘In A New Mood… a tribute to Oscar Brown Jr.’ at Sextan Recording Studio in Paris, France under the musical direction of Peter Giron.|$|R
