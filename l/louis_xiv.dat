5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> would drink only Champagne wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E

5|$|Federico Altieri began {{seeking to}} secure {{election}} to the papacy for himself.

5|$|George {{was active}} in {{directing}} British foreign policy during his early reign. In 1717 he contributed {{to the creation of}} the Triple Alliance, an anti-Spanish league composed of Great Britain, France and the United Provinces. In 1718 the Holy Roman Empire was added to the body which became known as the Quadruple Alliance. The subsequent War of the Quadruple Alliance involved the same issue as the War of the Spanish Succession. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) had recognised the grandson of King <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> of France, Philip, as the King of Spain on the condition that he gave up his rights to succeed to the French throne. Upon the death of <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> in 1715, however, Philip sought to overturn the treaty.|$|E

5|$|In November 1700, Charles II of Spain died childless. The {{dispute over}} who should succeed him– the Bourbon Prince Philip of Anjou, {{grandson}} of <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> of France, or the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria– soon plunged Europe {{into a major}} war. <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> supported Philip. England, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Savoy {{and some of the}} German states supported Charles, fearing that Philip's accession would result in French domination of Europe and the Americas. In accordance with Charles II's will, Philip was proclaimed king as Philip V of Spain and allied his new kingdom with France. The following February, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out when French forces arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and expelled the Dutch from the barrier towns. In May 1702, England's Queen Anne formally declared war on France.|$|E

5|$|With George of Hanover out of {{contention}} {{as a potential}} suitor for Anne, King Charles looked elsewhere for an eligible prince who would be welcomed as a groom by his Protestant subjects but also acceptable to his Catholic ally, <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> of France. The Danes were Protestant allies of the French, and <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> was keen on an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain {{the power of the}} Dutch. A marriage treaty between Anne and Prince George of Denmark, younger brother of King Christian V, and Anne's second cousin once removed, was negotiated by Anne's uncle Laurence Hyde, who had been made Earl of Rochester, and the English Secretary of State for the Northern Department, Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland. Anne's father consented to the marriage eagerly because it diminished the influence of his other son-in-law, William of Orange, who was naturally unhappy at the match.|$|E
5|$|A bone of contention, however, arose {{over the}} Queen's {{inheritance}} and dowry. Duke Rinaldo refused {{to release the}} former, and left the latter £15,000 in arrears. In 1700, five years later, the Duke finally paid the Queen her dowry; her inheritance, however, remained sequestered, and relations with Modena worsened again when Rinaldo allied himself with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. Leopold was an enemy of <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV,</b> James and Mary's patron.|$|E
5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes.

Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> in 1672.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{military}} {{victory of the}} absolutist city authorities was complete, the war had also shown them that they depended very much on their rural subjects. Soon after the war, the ruling aristocrats instituted a series of reforms and even lowered some taxes, thus fulfilling some of the peasants' original fiscal demands. In the long term, the peasant war of 1653 prevented Switzerland from an excessive implementation of absolutism as occurred in France {{during the reign of}} <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Mary II and William III & II had {{ascended the}} English and Scottish thrones, Mary of Modena {{ceased to be}} Queen of England on 11 December 1688 OS and of Scotland on 11 May 1689 OS. This was {{concurrent}} with her husband's formal deposition. James II, however, backed by <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> of France, still considered himself king by divine right and maintained it was not within parliament's prerogative to depose a monarch.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinando beseeched <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV</b> to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he sent the Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a solution to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and <b>Louis</b> <b>XIV.</b> She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
