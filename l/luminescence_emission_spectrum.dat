Far less {{is known about the}} visual capabilities of mesopelagic species with naupliar eyes, including the abundant and ecologically important copepods. Here we present data on both the structure and function of the visual system in the metridinid copepod Gaussia princeps. This species is a vertical migrator, typically residing in oxygen minimum zones during the day and ascending into shallower (and warmer) waters at night to feed. We used (1) light and electron microscopy to describe the tripartite naupliar eye, (2) electroretinography to characterize temporal and spectral aspects of vision, and (3) contrast ratio modeling to evaluate the tuning of its spectral sensitivity for bioluminescence detection. The G. princeps eye is highly sensitive to light with 10. 07 log photons cm- 2 s- 1 evoking half-maximum response amplitude in the VlogI curve. This sensitivity {{is due in part to}} slow photoreceptor dynamics; maximum critical flicker fusion frequencies are 7. 2 – 12. 0 Hz over the temperature range G. princeps experiences during its diel vertical migrations. Temporal resolution is moderately temperature sensitive (Q 10 = 2. 12 – 2. 55), but insensitive to light adaptation. The spectral sensitivity functions in dark- and chromatic-adapted G. princeps eyes predict a single visual pigment at 496 nm. Gaussia princeps spectral sensitivity was better fit to its own <b>luminescence</b> <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> than to the luminescence spectra of other representative mesopelagic species due to the presence of increased emission at wavelengths 3 ̆e 500 nm in the G. princeps luminescence spectra. A signal:noise model supported that the observed G. princeps spectral sensitivity, which is offset to longer wavelengths relative to downwelling light, would serve to increase spectral contrast when viewing its luminescence against background mesopelagic light.

Luminescence lifetime measurements showed that Ca-induced agglomeration reduces the hydration number which is the main cause for the change in r 1. Variable temperature 17 O NMR experiments evidenced high water exchange rates on GdL 1, GdL 2, and GdL 3 comparable to that of the aqua ion...|$|R
40|$|A facile solvothermal route {{has been}} {{developed}} for the preparation of tetragonal europium-doped yttrium orthovanadate nanoparticles (Eu:YVO 4) {{and is based on}} a homogeneous precipitation reaction at 120 °C from solutions of rare earth precursors (yttrium acetylacetonate and europium nitrate) and sodium orthovanadate in ethylene glycol or ethylene glycol/water mixtures. The nature of the solvent has a dramatic effect on the morphology and crystallinity of the resulting nanoparticles. Polycrystalline nanoellipsoids (130 ¿×¿ 60 nm) were obtained in pure ethylene glycol, whereas quasispherical nanoparticles (100 nm) with monocrystalline character precipitated in ethylene glycol/water (7 : 3 by volume) mixtures. To explain these different morphological and structural features, the mechanism of particles formation was investigated. The effects of the doping level on the <b>luminescence</b> properties (<b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> and <b>luminescence</b> lifetime) were also evaluated to find the optimum nanophosphors. Finally, it is shown that the luminescent efficiency of the quasispherical nanoparticles was higher than that of the nanoellipsoids; this can be related to differences in crystallinity and in impurity contentPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Zinc {{molybdate}} (ZnMoO 4) crystals are {{an excellent}} candidate material to fabricate scintillating bolometers {{for the study of}} neutrinoless double beta decay of 100 Mo, provided that the crystal quality meets strict optical, thermal and radiopurity requirements. This paper addresses the characterization of improved crystalline samples grown by the low-thermal-gradient Czochralski technique. Transmittance measurements confirm significant improvement of the material with respect to previously developed samples. <b>Luminescence</b> properties (<b>emission</b> <b>spectra,</b> dependence of intensity on temperature, thermally stimulated luminescence and phosphorescence) have been studied under X-ray excitation from liquid-helium to room temperature. The index of refraction was measured in the wavelength interval 406 - 655 nm. Samples of ZnMoO 4 crystals with masses of 5. 07 g and 23. 8 g were operated as scintillating bolometers at temperatures below 30 mK, with simultaneous detection of scintillation and heat signals, confirming an excellent alpha/beta rejection power. Background measurements allowed encouraging radiopurity level estimations. The light collection from ZnMoO 4 scintillators was Monte Carlo simulated, analysing different crystal size, shape and surface properties and different photodetector sizes...|$|R
30|$|The mean {{distance}} between the dopant ions at high concentrations (R = 0.62 /(N) 1 / 3, where N is the concentration of ions) was much shorter. Therefore, ions can interact through an electric multipolar process leading to energy migration. The dipole-dipole quenching process is inversely proportional to the sixth power of ion-ion separation and, thus, to {{the square of the}} dopant concentration [14, 15]. In Figures 4 a and 5 a, except for a decrease of the <b>luminescence</b> intensity, the <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> of Y 2 O 3 particles codoped with different Eu 3 + and Dy 3 + concentrations was similar due to the same f-f transitions within the specific RE ion. Therefore, the concentration of codoped RE ions plays an important role and should be strongly considered during the phosphor fabrication process.|$|R

Transparent Z-S/epoxy super-nanocomposites were then prepared by introducing calcined Z-S nanocomposite particles with a proper ratio of ZnO to SiO 2 into a transparent epoxy matrix {{in terms of}} the filler-matrix refractive index matching principle. It was shown that the epoxy super-nanocomposites displayed intense <b>luminescence</b> with broad <b>emission</b> <b>spectra.</b> Moreover, the epoxy super-nanocomposites showed the interesting afterglow phenomenon with a long phosphorescence lifetime that was not observed for ZnO-QDs/epoxy nanocomposites. Finally, the transparent and light-emitting Z-S/epoxy super-nanocomposites were successfully employed as encapsulating materials for synthesis of highly bright LED lamps.

40|$|The role {{of energy}} {{transfer}} from ${rm Gd 3 }^{+}$ to ${rm Ce}^{ 3 +}$ activator {{in the formation}} of the luminescence yield and kinetics of ${rm Lu}_{ 2 {rm x}} {rm Gd}_{ 2 - 2 {rm x}} {rm SiO}_{ 5 }:{rm Ce} ({rm LGSO}) $ mixed crystals has been studied by VUV spectroscopy including temperature dependent time-resolved measurements of <b>luminescence</b> excitation and <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> and <b>luminescence</b> kinetics in the excitation energy range 4 to 25 eV at the SUPERLUMI station of HASYLAB, DESY. Improved scintillation yield as well as suppressed afterglow that can be achieved by appropriate choice of Lu/Gd ratio as well as of Ce-concentration were suggested to result from an additional channel of energy relaxation via Gd-states, which appears in LGSO.

40|$|The quinacridone {{derivatives}} N,N&# 039;-dialkyl- 1, 3, 8, 10 - tetramethylquinacridone (CnTMQA, n = 6, 10, 14) {{were used}} as building blocks to assemble luminescent nano- and microscale wires. It was demonstrated that CnTMQA with different lengths of alkyl chains display obviously different wire formation properties. C 10 TMQA and C 14 TMQA showed a stronger tendency to form 1 -D nano- and microstructures compared with C 6 TMQA. The C 10 TMQA molecules could be employed to fabricate the wires with different diameters, which exhibited a size-dependent <b>luminescence</b> property. The <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the C 10 TMQA wires with diameters of 200 - 500 nm shows a broad emission band at 560 nm and a shoulder at around 535 nm, while the <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the C 10 TMQA wires with diameters of 2 - 3 µm reveals a narrower emission band at 563 nm.
