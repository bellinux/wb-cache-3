5|$|During the 1990s, the Department of Transportation <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{expansion}} of NY347 and NY454. The studies {{suggested that the}} state would add one additional traffic lane in each direction, giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge. The new lanes would also be capable of holding rapid-commute vehicles for the Long Island Rapid Commute. The interchange where Routes 347 and 454 fork in Hauppague is slated to go from an at-grade fork to a grade-separated interchange. The project, which will cost $359 million (2009 USD) {{was scheduled to be}} completed between 2012 and 2015.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Highland Airways <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{possibility}} of including Stroma {{in the hospital}} ambulance plane service that was then in operation. On 19 August 1937, Captain Fresson of Highland Airways landed a small aircraft in farmland adjoining the Mains of Stroma, and the following spring the islanders cleared an area of moorland {{on the west side}} of the island to create an airstrip. The first official flight landed in June 1938. However, the Second World War prevented any further developments and a regular service was not established. After the war, Highland Airways was taken over by British European Airways, which abandoned any interest in serving the island.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> intended, implemented, {{attained}} curriculum of East Side Middle School in Anderson Indiana. The main question that is being <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> during <b>the</b> research and construction of this paper is the question of why schools have such low test scores when the standards are given for each teacher to follow throughout the year. This examination is to include three parts: a <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> curriculum that East Side Middle School has in place, and what guidelines are given for the teachers to follow when teaching this curriculum, a <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> actual curriculum that is getting taught inside the classrooms by the two seventh grade teachers, and a final <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> curriculum that is being attained by the students in both classes.

5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of prognosis. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E
5|$|HSA {{formed an}} {{agreement}} with the German Focke-Wulf aircraft company to collaborate on a joint study that <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> issue of equipping the P.1150 with two additional lift engines. However, in October 1961, West Germany elected to entirely withdraw from participation in the programme. This was a blow that was directly felt not only by HSA and the development team, but by the British Air Ministry, who had been also seeking to collaborate with its West German counterparts on the matter of VTOL aircraft. Meanwhile, further studies served to confirmed fears that the P.1150 would be too small to meet customer specifications, and thus Camm initiated work on an enlarged derivative design. In conjunction with HSA's redesign, Bristol worked to enlarge the original PCB engine and raised the exhaust heat to increase thrust to 146.8kN (30,000lbf). It could have theoretically reach speeds of up to Mach1.7–2.|$|E
5|$|Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 – February 16, 1998) was an American {{toxicologist}} {{and public}} health researcher who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying {{the effects of the}} 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs. Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her being threatened, to her funding being pulled, and to her losing her job at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1953. Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard, and subsequently at MIT and New York University. Despite the early controversy related to her work, it was used in the creation of standards in air pollution, and towards {{the end of her life}} she received numerous awards and accolades.|$|E

5|$|Premier League chief {{executive}} Rick Parry and chairman Sir John Quinton were assigned {{the task of}} finding suitors. Parry initially favoured working with ITV, led by Greg Dyke, but wanted the network to pay in excess of £30 million for live football. In the meantime BSkyB – a company formed by the merger of Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television, and British Satellite Broadcasting – <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> possibility of obtaining live rights to the Premier League. BSkyB {{chief executive}} Sam Chisholm attempted to make a joint offer with ITV which did not come into fruition, so he formed an alliance with the BBC, aware the corporation wanted a highlights package. Although Chisholm was against Parry's idea of a football-only channel, he built a rapport with the Premier League and his company invited Parry to its facilities in Livingston, where he spoke to Murdoch in person.|$|E
5|$|Stiefel showed Heidemann {{the diary}} in Stuttgart in January 1980, telling {{him it was}} from a plane crash in East Germany, {{although}} he refused to tell the journalist {{the name of his}} source. The collector spoke to Kujau to see if he would meet Heidemann, but the forger repeatedly refused Heidemann's requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the Stern offices and spoke to his editor, but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. The only person who was interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> crash. Heidemann, who had read Baur's autobiography, knew of Gundlfinger's flight, and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 1980 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flight's crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a {{disaster}} for the Japanese. Out of 6,900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea, only about 1,200 made it to Lae. Another 2,700 were saved by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul. About 2,890 Japanese soldiers and sailors were killed. The Allies lost 13 aircrew, 10 of whom were lost in combat while three others died in an accident. There were also eight wounded. Aircraft losses were one B-17 and three P-38s in combat, and one B-25 and one Beaufighter in accidents. MacArthur issued a communiqué on 7 March claiming that 22 ships, including 12 transports, three cruisers and seven destroyers, had been sunk along with 12,792 troops. Army Air Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C. <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> matter in mid-1943 and concluded that there were only 16 ships involved, but GHQ SWPA elected to stick to its original story. After the war, Kenney would repeat the claim.|$|E

5|$|As a {{response}} to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. Smith released a letter to the fans reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership, and explaining that the reason he rallied them to voice their support before the show was officially cancelled, was that once that happens, there is no going back. He praised Netflix for their support while making the show, and thanked the fans for putting up a great fight to keep it alive. On June 10, 2017, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, explicitly commented the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Birmingham and Black Country urban areas were {{coalescing}} into a single extensive conurbation spanning the borders of three counties: Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire. Other similar urban areas in England, such as Lancashire, Tyneside, London and within Yorkshire West Riding, had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The Local Government Act 1958 appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a West Midlands Special Review Area, whose recommendations would ultimately form the West Midlands Order 1965 legislation. A second report known as the West Midlands General Review <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> administrative authorities within the wider region, including the remainder of Worcestershire.|$|E
