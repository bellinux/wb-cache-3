5|$|From 1893–1912, {{the team}} used area parks such as Brisbane Park, Ponce de Leon Park, and Piedmont Park {{as the home}} field. Georgia Tech took out a seven-year lease on {{what is now the}} {{southern}} end of Grant Field, although the land was not adequate for sports, due to its unleveled, rocky nature. In 1905, Heisman had 300 convict laborers clear rocks, remove tree stumps, and <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the field for play; Tech students then built a grandstand on the property. The land was purchased by 1913, and John W. Grant donated $15,000 towards the construction of the field's first permanent stands; the field was named Grant Field in honor of the donor's deceased son, Hugh Inman Grant.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane {{did not respond to}} his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to the}} left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll to the left and the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly <b>level</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} Mk. XIV {{was first}} tested in June 1941. It {{was the first}} modern bombsight that allowed for accurate bombing immediately after radical manoeuvring, with a settling time as little as 10 seconds. The fast settling time was invaluable during night bombing missions, as it allowed the bomber to fly a corkscrew (a helical path), climbing and turning and then <b>level</b> <b>out</b> immediately before the drop. Even slow turns {{made it difficult for}} night fighters to track the bombers within the limited view of their radar systems and continually changing altitude was an effective way to avoid anti-aircraft fire.|$|E

25|$|Primary {{batteries}} {{readily available}} to consumers range from tiny button cells used for electric watches, to the No. 6 cell used for signal circuits or other long duration applications. Secondary cells are made in very large sizes; very large batteries can power a submarine or stabilize an electrical grid and help <b>level</b> <b>out</b> peak loads.|$|E
25|$|I saw the Curtiss planes {{approximately}} 300 meters {{below us}} and falling away below. These aircraft were {{no threat to}} us whatsoever! Now I just wanted to <b>level</b> <b>out</b> of my turning bank, since my colleagues were already at a substantially higher altitude. Keppler (his wingman), overshot me. Once again, I saw the Curtiss planes 300 meters directly below me and counted eleven aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010 American Community Survey, median {{household}} income in the city was $25,787, and the median income for a family was $31,011. The per capita income for the city was $14,118. 32.3% of families had income at or below the federally defined poverty <b>level.</b> <b>Out</b> of the total population, 53.6% of those {{under the age of}} 18 and 19.8% of those 65 and older had income at or below the federally defined poverty line.|$|E
25|$|At {{the senior}} and under 18 age level, each state sends its select {{representative}} team. At under 15 level, a national tournament exists whereby member states send anywhere {{between one and}} three representative teams, {{in an effort to}} <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the competition between stronger and developing lacrosse regions. At present there are national carnivals at the senior, under 18 and under 15 levels for both men and women. Often a number of these events are held concurrently at the same venue.|$|E
25|$|Mitteldorf {{proposed}} a group {{benefit of a}} limited lifespan involving regulation of population dynamics. Populations in nature are subject to boom and bust cycles. Often overpopulation can be punished by famine or by epidemic. Either one could wipe out an entire population. Senescence is {{a means by which}} a species can 'take control' of its own death rate, and <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the boom-bust cycles. This story may be more plausible than the Weismann hypothesis as a mechanistic explanation, because it addresses the question of how group selection can be rapid enough to compete with individual selection.|$|E

25|$|Bosaso has a hot {{desert climate}} (Köppen climate {{classification}} BWh). It has a mean annual relative humidity of around 60%. The average daily mean temperature year-round is 30°C, {{with an average}} annual high of 35°C and an average annual low of 25°C. Average low temperatures are coolest {{during the winter months}} of December to February, when thermometer readings typically <b>level</b> <b>out</b> at 20°C. The weather slowly heats up in the spring, as the April rainy season begins. Average high temperatures later peak during the summer months of June to August, when they consistently exceed 40°C (104°F). Come September, cooler weather starts to set in again. Rainfall reaches a high over this period, with an average precipitation of 7mm (0.28 inches) in November. Total rainfall year-round is around 19mm (0.76 inches).|$|E
25|$|Features {{shown by}} the Viking orbiters in 1976 {{revealed}} two possible ancient shorelines near the pole, Arabia and Deuteronilus, each thousands of kilometers long. Several physical features in the present geography of Mars suggest the past existence of a primordial ocean. Networks of gullies that merge into larger channels imply erosion by a liquid flow and resemble ancient riverbeds on Earth. Enormous channels, 25km wide and several hundred meters deep, appear to have flowed directly from underground aquifers in the Southern uplands into the Northern plains. Much of the northern hemisphere of Mars is at a significantly lower elevation {{than the rest of}} the planet (the Martian dichotomy), and is unusually flat. The low elevation would cause water, if it existed, to gather there. An ocean would tend to <b>level</b> <b>out</b> the ground underneath it.|$|E
25|$|According to ICIMOD {{figures from}} 2010, forest is the {{dominant}} form of land cover in Nepal covering 57,538km2 with a contribution of 39.09% to the total geographical area of the country. Most of this forest cover is broadleaved closed and open forest, which covers 21,200km2 or 14.4% of the geographical area. Needleleaved open forest is the least common of the forest areas covering 8,267 km2 (5.62%). At national level 64.8% area is covered by core forests of > 500 ha size and 23.8% forests belong to patch and edge category forests. The patch forest constituted 748km2 at national <b>level,</b> <b>out</b> of which 494km2 of patch forests are present in hill regions. Middle mountains, Siwaliks and Terai regions have more than 70% of the forest area under core forest category > 500 ha size.

The calendars still had the same name, Shahenshahi (imperial), presumably because none were aware that the calendars were no longer the same.|$|E
2500|$|Turkish Airlines Flight 981, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, on 3 March 1974. Similar to American Airlines Flight 96, {{the flight}} {{experienced}} an explosive decompression, when {{flying over the}} town of Meaux, France, caused by a rear cargo door failure. The rear main cabin floor collapsed and severed all flight controls. While the plane went into a vertical dive, the captain called for [...] "Speed!"

2500|$|The weight {{distribution}} of the P-39 was supposedly the reason for its tendency to enter a dangerous flat spin, a characteristic Soviet test pilots were able to demonstrate to the skeptical manufacturer who {{had been unable to}} reproduce the effect. After extensive tests, it was determined the spin could only be induced if the aircraft was improperly loaded, with no ammunition in the front compartment. The flight manual noted a need to ballast the front ammunition compartment with the appropriate weight of shell casings to achieve a reasonable center of gravity. High-speed controls were light, consequently high-speed turns and pull-outs were possible. The P-39 had to be held in a dive since it tended to <b>level</b> <b>out,</b> reminiscent of the Spitfire.
