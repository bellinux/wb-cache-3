60|$|Murrey Yeovil {{got out of}} the boat-train at Victoria Station, {{and stood}} waiting, in an {{attitude}} something between listlessness and impatience, while a porter dragged his light travelling kit out of the railway carriage and went in search of his heavier baggage with a hand-truck. Yeovil was a grey-faced young man, with restless eyes, and a rather wistful mouth, and an air of lassitude that was evidently only a temporary characteristic. The hot dusty station, with its blended crowds of dawdling and scurrying people, its little streams of suburban passengers pouring out every now and then from this or that platform, like ants swarming across a garden path, made a wearisome climax to what had been a rather wearisome journey. Yeovil glanced quickly, almost furtively, around him in all directions, with the air of a man who is constrained by morbid curiosity to look for things that he would rather not see. The announcements placed in German alternatively with English over the booking office, <b>left-luggage</b> <b>office,</b> refreshment buffets, and so forth, the crowned eagle and monogram displayed on the post boxes, caught his eye in quick succession.|$|E

500|$|Brady {{admitted}} under police questioning {{that he and}} Evans had fought, but {{insisted that}} he and Smith had murdered Evans between them; Hindley, he said, had [...] "only done {{what she had been}} told". Smith told police that Brady had asked him to return anything incriminating, such as [...] "dodgy books", which Brady then packed into suitcases. Smith had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, but he mentioned in passing that Brady [...] "had a thing about railway stations". The police consequently requested a search of all Manchester's <b>left-luggage</b> <b>offices</b> for any suitcases belonging to Brady, and on 15 October British Transport Police found {{what they were looking for}} at Manchester Central railway station—the left-luggage ticket was found several days later in the back of Hindley's prayer book. Inside one of the suitcases were nine pornographic photographs taken of a young girl, naked and with a scarf tied across her mouth, and a 13-minute tape recording of her screaming and pleading for help. Ann Downey, Lesley Ann Downey's mother, later listened to the tape after police had discovered the body of her missing 10-year-old daughter, and confirmed that it was a recording of her daughter's voice.|$|R
50|$|In 1965, {{four years}} after the theft, Bunton {{contacted}} a newspaper, and through a <b>left-luggage</b> <b>office</b> at Birmingham New Street railway station, returned the painting voluntarily. Six weeks later, he also surrendered to the police, who initially discounted him as a suspect, considering the unlikeliness of a 61-year-old retiree, weighing 17 stone kg, executing the heist.|$|E

50|$|Rembrandt's small early {{portrait}} of Jacob de Gheyn III has been stolen and recovered four times, {{most recently in}} 1983, and is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the most frequently stolen artwork in the world. It has been recovered from a <b>left-luggage</b> <b>office</b> in West Germany in 1986; returned anonymously; found {{on the back of}} a bicycle; and discovered under a bench in a graveyard in Streatham. The painting is now guarded by an upgraded security system.|$|E
