5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{wide range}} of issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E

5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) {{are called}} to Lacey's (Mary Mouser) school when she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who died, after battling a {{terminal}} illness. When Megan <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they can look at her body, much to the horror of Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting sympathy from friends; however Lillian did not kill her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually working together with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will she was giving all her money to a fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} staples thesis, {{advocated by}} {{scholars such as}} S.A. Saunders, looks at the resource endowments of the Maritimes and argues {{that it was the}} decline of the traditional industries of shipbuilding and fishing that led to Maritime poverty, since these processes were rooted in geography, and thus all but inevitable. Kris Inwood has revived the staples approach and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> number of geographic weaknesses relative to Central Canada. He repeats Acheson's argument that the region lacks major urban centres, but adds that the Maritimes were also lacking the great rivers that led to the cheap and abundant hydro-electric power, key to Quebec and Ontario's urban and manufacturing development, that the extraction costs of Maritime resources were higher (particularly in the case of Cape Breton coal), and that the soils of the region were poorer and thus the agricultural sector weaker.|$|E

25|$|Neural {{synchronization}} can be modulated by task constraints, such as attention, and {{is thought}} {{to play a role}} in feature binding, neuronal communication, and motor coordination. Neuronal oscillations became a hot topic in neuroscience in the 1990s when the studies of the visual system of the brain by Gray, Singer and others appeared to support the neural binding hypothesis. According to this idea, synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles bind neurons representing different features of an object. For example, when a person <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> tree, visual cortex neurons representing the tree trunk and those representing the branches of the same tree would oscillate in synchrony to form a single representation of the tree. This phenomenon is best seen in local field potentials which reflect the synchronous activity of local groups of neurons, but has also been shown in EEG and MEG recordings providing increasing evidence for a close relation between synchronous oscillatory activity and a variety of cognitive functions such as perceptual grouping.|$|E
25|$|When Gaston {{arrived to}} the Pawn Shop, he aims {{at what he}} thought was Gold but discovers a {{mannequin}} instead. He is then confronted by Belle, who now knows he was willing to kill Rumple and believed he still had feelings for her, only to learn that the book was punishment and a constant reminder of why he died. He was also shocked to discover Belle is now Gold's wife, and leaves furious. Belle tells Gold and made him promise not to hurt Gaston, but when she tells Gold about what Hades told her he just couldn't accept what Belle wanted. At the docks, Gold uses magic to choke Gaston by the throat, ready to send him to the River of Lost Souls, when Belle pulls the dagger and commands him not to hurt Gaston, and he drops Gaston on the ground. However, Gaston is unable to let his vendetta against Gold go, and when he goes for his arrow, Belle accidentally knockes Gaston out into the River of Lost Souls. Unfortunately, Belle discovers that because she saved Gold but interfered, Hades arrives to tell the couple that the contract allowing him to take their baby was still in effect, as Belle was the one who knocked Gaston into the Acheron, not Gold. He then <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> withering daisy flower that he picks up, as a sign of hope fading away. The burned flower later shows up at Granny's Diner, as a gift to Zelena from Hades.|$|E
500|$|Jesus {{emphasized}} the need for pure thoughts as well as actions, and stated, [...] "Everyone who <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart" [...] (Matthew 5:28). The Catechism states that, {{with the help of}} God's grace, men and women are required to overcome lust and bodily desires [...] "for sinful relationships with another person's spouse." [...] In Theology of the Body, a series of lectures given by Pope John Paul II, Jesus' statement in Matthew 5:28 is interpreted that one can commit adultery in the heart not only with another's spouse, but also with his/her own spouse if one looks at him/her lustfully or treats him/her [...] "only as an object to satisfy instinct".|$|E

[...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for {{there is so much to}} do right where he is.|$|E
500|$|During {{the tenth}} season episode [...] "Inside Man", Bobby is {{relaxing}} in Heaven when Sam and Castiel contact {{him through a}} séance to help break Metatron out of Heaven's prison. Though he feels himself to be rusty, Bobby agrees and escapes his Heaven, releasing all the other Bobby Singer's to create a distraction. Bobby gets Castiel into Heaven and helps him free Metatron before returning to his own Heaven. He leaves a note with Castiel for Sam, telling him not to stop searching for a cure for the Mark of Cain but to stop lying to Dean about it. He also states that helping again was the most fun he had in Heaven and he will accept any punishment for his actions.

500|$|The {{relationships}} among the families of lemurs have been problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. [...] Two competing phylogenies exist based on genetic and molecular data. [...] One approach (Horvath etal.) <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> larger number of genes, but among fewer species. [...] This results in Lemuridae being a sister group to Lepilemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. [...] The other approach (Orlando etal.) looks at fewer genes, but more lemur species. [...] Using this analysis, Lepilemuridae becomes the sister group to Lemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. Both phylogenies agree that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic and that Daubentoniidae (the aye-aye) is basal to the lemuroid clade, having split off significantly earlier than the other families. [...] However, two problems create complications for both approaches. [...] First, the four most closely related living lemur families diverged within a narrow window of approximately 10million years, making it much harder to distinguish the splits with molecular evidence. [...] In addition, these families diverged from their last common ancestor approximately 42mya; such distant splits create a lot of noise for molecular techniques.|$|E

Sie werden ruhig sein! Sie werden nicht beleidigen Deutschland!", literally meaning [...] "You will sit down! You will be quiet! You will not insult Germany!" [...] while making the Nazi salute with his left hand. The last sentence is grammatically incorrect, as the proper German statement would be, [...] "Sie werden Deutschland nicht beleidigen!"

500|$|Although Treehouse of Horror episodes are Halloween-themed, {{for several}} years new episodes premiered in November {{following}} the holiday, due to Fox's coverage of Major League Baseball's World Series.

Gay novelist Brent Hartinger found the episode's inclusion of transphobic remarks from Peter and Lois Griffin — {{as well as a}} scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be Glenn Quagmire's father – to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared [...] "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" [...] about the episode. MacFarlane said he was [...] "surprised" [...] by the negative reaction to [...] "Quagmire's Dad", saying that [...] "it seemed that [...] were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, [...] "Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am.
