500|$|Three {{members of}} the cast {{had never been in}} a film before: Ed Sanders was cast as Toby, Jayne Wisener as Johanna, and Jamie Campbell Bower, who auditioned, and after four days got the part of Anthony said [...] "I think I weed myself. I was out {{shopping}} at the time and I got this call on my mobile. I was just like, 'OH MY GOD!' Honestly, I was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> running around this shop like oh-my-god-oh-my-god-oh-my-god." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the energy}} disturbance, Jackson's spirit takes over Ike's body, causing Ike to speak, {{sing and dance}} like Jackson himself. The boys find from online {{research}} {{that the only way}} to make Jackson accept his death is to make him experience the acceptance he sought in life, so they take him to a child beauty pageant for young girls. Dressed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> Ike/Jackson impresses two of the male judges by singing a tune sounding similar to Jackson's [...] "You Are Not Alone," [...] but they are promptly arrested for masturbating while watching the children, leaving a single, unimpressed female judge (much to the shock of the boys, who were unaware of the men's lewd acts and considered them the best judges). When Cartman notices the judge eating Chipotle, he bribes her with knowledge about the ChipotlAway product, and she declares Ike/Jackson the winner as a result. One of the other contestants is physically beaten by her mother for losing. Having found his acceptance, Jackson leaves Ike's body, and Ike is extremely surprised and disgusted to find himself dressed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b>|$|E
60|$|So I was fain {{to keep my}} peace; for though Aunt Emma was kind, she ruled {{me still}} in all things <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> as I was when I came to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{remarkable}} children mine are!" [...] thought she, smiling with a mother's pride; {{and smiling}} at herself, too, {{for being so}} proud of them. [...] "What other children could have made any thing so <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> figure out of snow, at the first trial? Well;--but now I must finish Peony's new frock, for his grandfather is coming to-morrow, and I want the little fellow to look handsome." ...|$|R
6000|$|She seized his arm, {{made him}} stop, stood {{looking up at}} him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> frightened <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> [...] "What's the matter, Godfrey?--what IS the matter?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But I do like it; only it amused {{me to be}} treated. <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> again, when I am nearly thirty, {{and feel}} seventy at least, life has been so hard to me lately." ...|$|E
6000|$|She put out {{her hand}} to him innocently <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> to a little boy, and he took it. [...] "I know it's just for the baby; and I feel to thank you, Nancy," [...] he said, and {{together}} {{they went into the}} cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Baas! {{it was no}} valour of mine; when I saw {{his eyes}} I was horribly afraid, only I thought how gladly you would have {{attacked}} him had you been there, and what a coward you would hold me, could you have seen me shivering <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> before a big lizard, and these thoughts gave me courage." ...|$|E

5000|$|Age 14. 2nd year {{of middle}} school. The new girl. She rides a hoverboard and carries a plush toy killer whale. She talks old-fashionably and behaves <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spoiled <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> She has <b>a</b> lot of toys in her room. She refers {{to herself as}} [...] "Emperor Sakura".|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's ride over," [...] Dick suggested. [...] "Mrs. Forrest'll have a gay handful in The Fop if she's ridden {{him into}} that bunch of younglings.--It's her territory, you know," [...] he elucidated to Graham. [...] "All the house horses and lighter stock is her affair. And she gets grand results. I can't {{understand}} it, myself. It's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> straying into an experimental laboratory of high explosives and mixing the stuff around any old way and getting more powerful combinations than the graybeard chemists." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not {{remember}} about the parting with Aunt Geoffrey; they managed that in the nursery, I believe, but I shall never forget the boys receiving her,--Fred and Geoffrey, I mean,--for Roger was at school. How they admired her like some strange curiosity, and played with her <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> with a new doll. There was no fear {{that they would be}} too rough with her, for they used to touch her as if she was made of glass. And what a turn out of old playthings there was in her service!" ...|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{would have}} thought it much more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> in a book to have done no lessons, but have sat thinking, and perhaps reading the Bible all day; but on the whole Elizabeth had hardly {{thoughts}} enough to last her so long; nor was she deep or serious enough to have done herself much good by keeping the Bible open before her. In fact she did lose her verse in merely reading the chapter for the day! So {{it was just as well}} that she had something to do that was not play, and that was a duty, and thus might give the desire to be good something to bear upon.|$|E
5000|$|Aunt Beatrice Day-Kemp: Mrs. Quimby's sister, {{favorite}} aunt of Beezus, marries Hobart Kemp. She is {{imaginative and}} carefree, {{and says she}} was remarkably <b>like</b> Ramona as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can it be me?" [...] she said. [...] "How horrid I am!" [...] And {{she could}} not spoil her nice white bed, but hopped into the bathtub and had a good scrubbing. Next she got a clean nightgown, and brushed her hair, and cut her long nails, and looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tidy <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> again.|$|R
5000|$|She looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sweet <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> but is {{actually}} half fox demon and half human. Her bushy tail is always {{sticking out from}} behind.

60|$|He {{handed her}} the letter. The {{solicitor}} stated that a widow-lady of position, who did not at present wish her name to be disclosed, had lately become a client of his while taking the waters, and had mentioned to him that she would <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> to bring up as her own, if she could be certain of finding one of good and pleasing disposition; and, the better to insure this, she would not wish the child to be too young for judging her qualities. He had remembered Sir Ashley's observation to him a long while ago, and therefore brought the matter before him. It would be an excellent home for the little girl--of that he was positive--if she had not already found such a home.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never know}} how to talk to you--you are so beastly clever,' he said. 'I can't treat you <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> in a pinafore--and yet of course you are only a young lady. You're so deuced good--that makes it worse,' he went on, {{stopping}} in front of her with {{his hands in his pockets}} and the air he himself had of being a good-natured but dissipated boy; with his small stature, his smooth, fat, suffused face, his round, watery, light-coloured eyes and his hair growing in curious infantile rings. He had lost one of his front teeth and always wore a stiff white scarf, with a pin representing some symbol of the turf or the chase. 'I don't see why she couldn't have been a little more like you. If I could have had a shot at you first!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘O, {{leave my}} friends alone,’ she interrupted. ‘My friends {{are of a}} {{different}} stamp. You have come to me here and made a parade of sentiment. When have I last seen you? I have governed your kingdom {{for you in the}} meanwhile, and there I got no help. At last, when I am weary with a man’s work, and you are weary of your playthings, you return to make me a scene of conjugal reproaches—the grocer and his wife! The positions are too much reversed; and you should understand, at least, that I cannot at the same time do your work of government and behave myself <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> Scandal is the atmosphere in which we live, we princes; it is what a prince should know. You play an odious part. Do you believe this rumour?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{suppose she}} and Solivet {{expected}} me to submit myself to my fate <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good <b>little</b> French <b>girl.</b> What I did was to turn round and exclaim: 'Eustace, you have not sold me for this?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Robinson and Temple became {{close friends}} {{as a result}} of his dance {{coaching}} and acting with her. Robinson carried pictures of Temple with him wherever he traveled, and Temple considered him a lifelong friend, saying in an interview [...] "Bill Robinson treated me as an equal, which was very important to me. He didn't talk down to me, <b>like</b> to <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> And I <b>liked</b> people like that. And Bill Robinson was the best of all." ...|$|R
60|$|She was hurried on from Dover to London {{almost before}} she could ask for breakfast, and--she was past any feeling of indignation now--was bidden curtly to wait in a hall {{at the foot of}} some lead-covered stairs while Torpenhow went up to make inquiries. Again the {{knowledge}} that she was being treated <b>like</b> <b>a</b> naughty <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> made her pale cheeks flame. It was all Dick's fault for being so stupid as to go blind.|$|R
60|$|She {{took off}} her hat and sat leaning against him on the couch, {{so that she could}} not see his face. And with his arm round her, she let herself go, deep into the waters of illusion; down-down, trying to forget there was a surface to which she must return; <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> she played that game of make-believe. 'He loves me-he loves me--he loves me!' To lose herself like that for, just an hour, only an hour; she felt that she would give {{the rest of the time}} vouchsafed to her; give it all and willingly. Her hand clasped his against her heart, she turned her face backward, up to his, closing her eyes so as still not to see his face; the scent of the {{gardenia}} in his coat hurt her, so sweet and strong it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, {{leave my}} friends alone," [...] she interrupted. [...] "My friends {{are of a}} {{different}} stamp. You have come to me here and made a parade of sentiment.

6000|$|... "Indeed, yes. I pitied {{him from}} the bottom of my heart. The contumely with which he was treated by all went to my heart even after I knew that he was misbehaving. I knew that he was misbehaving;--but how? It could only be by hiding the will, or by being {{conscious}} that it was hidden. Though he was a knave, he was not cunning. He failed utterly before the slightest cunning on the part of others. When I asked him whether he knew where it was hidden, he told a weak lie, but told the truth openly by the look of his eyes. He was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> who pauses and blushes and confesses all the truth before she half murmurs her naughty fib. Who can be really angry with the child who lies after that unwilling fashion? I had to be severe upon him till all was made clear; but I pitied {{him from the}} bottom of my heart." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{was not at}} all a young woman, {{and many}} things had come and gone in her life that ought to have {{fortified}} her against surprise; but she wanted to scream <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> frightened <b>girl</b> as Dan Mavering stepped out of the parlour door toward her. The habit of not screaming, however, prevailed, and she made a tolerably successful effort to treat him with decent composure. She gave him a rigid hand. [...] "Where in the world did you come from? Did you get my telegram?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Home!" [...] said Lise, defiantly, and laughed. [...] "What do {{you take}} me for? Why would I be going home when I've been trying to break away for two years?

60|$|Once, in {{the course}} of their play, the strange child placed herself between Violet and Peony, and taking a hand of each, skipped merrily forward, and they along with her. Almost immediately, however, Peony pulled away his little fist, and began to rub it as if the fingers were {{tingling}} with cold; while Violet also released herself, though with less abruptness, gravely remarking that it was better not to take hold of hands. The white-robed damsel said not a word, but danced about just as merrily as before. If Violet and Peony did not choose to play with her, she could make just as good a playmate of the brisk and cold west wind, which kept blowing her all about the garden, and took such liberties with her, that they seemed to have been friends for a long time. All this while, the mother stood on the threshold, wondering how a little girl could look so much like a flying snow-drift, or how a snow-drift could look so very <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Accordingly they hiked. But to [...] "hike" [...] along a deep-rutted, pebbly lane in frail, silver-hued {{slippers}} {{with high}} French heels, {{is not an}} exhilarating performance. Rilla managed to limp and totter along {{until they reached the}} harbour road; but she could go no farther in those detestable slippers. She took them and her dear silk stockings off and started barefoot. That was not pleasant either; her feet were very tender and the pebbles and ruts of the road hurt them. Her blistered heels smarted. But physical pain was almost forgotten in the sting of humiliation. This was a nice predicament! If Kenneth Ford could see her now, limping along <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> with a stone bruise! Oh, what a horrid way for her lovely party to end! She just had to cry--it was too terrible. Nobody cared for her--nobody bothered about her at all. Well, if she caught cold from walking home barefoot on a dew-wet road and went into a decline perhaps they would be sorry. She furtively wiped her tears away with her scarf--handkerchiefs seemed to have vanished like shoes!--but she could not help sniffling. Worse and worse! ...|$|E
60|$|For an instant, Jill {{could not}} have said whether the feeling that shot through her like the abrupt {{touching}} of a nerve was relief or disappointment. Then suddenly she {{realized that it was}} disappointment. It was absurd to her to feel disappointed, but at that moment she would have welcomed a different attitude in him. If only this problem of hers could be taken forcefully out of her hands, what a relief it would be. If only Wally, masterfully insistent, would batter down her hesitations and grab her, knock her on the head and carry her off like a caveman, care less about her happiness and concentrate on his own, what a solution it would be.... But then he wouldn't be Wally.... Nevertheless, Jill gave a little sigh. Her new life had changed her already. It had blunted the sharp edge of her independence. To-night she was feeling the need of some one to lean on--some one strong and cosy and sympathetic who would treat her <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> and shield her from all the roughness of life. The fighting spirit had gone out of her, and she was no longer the little warrior facing the world with a brave eye and a tilted chin. She wanted to cry and be petted.|$|E
60|$|Evidently she had entirely {{forgotten}} {{her surroundings}} and her present circumstances, {{for a single}} glance at the dark, swirling waters without sent her crumpled upon a low bench, where with her face buried in her arms she sobbed more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> very unhappy <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> than <b>a</b> proud and all-powerful goddess.|$|R
60|$|The pathos {{is about}} as good as the prose, and that is blank verse. Are the words in the former {{quotation}} in the least <b>like</b> anything that <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> would say? <b>A</b> German sentimentalist might have said them; Obermann might have murmured them in his weaker moments. Let us try a piece of domestic pathos by another hand. It is the dawn of Waterloo.|$|R
