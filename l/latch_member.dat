40|$|A {{device for}} connecting, {{rotating}} and locking together {{a pair of}} structural half columns is described. The device is composed of an identical pair of cylindrical hub assemblies connected at their inner faces by a spring loaded hinge; each hub assembly having a structural half column attached to its outer end. Each hub assembly has a spring loading locking ring member movably attached adjacent to its inner face and includes a <b>latch</b> <b>member</b> for holding the locking ring in a rotated position subject to the force of its spring. Each hub assembly also has a hammer member for releasing the latch on the opposing hub assembly when the hub assemblies are rotated together. The spring loaded hinge connecting the hub assemblies rotates the hub assemblies and attached structural half columns together bringing the inner faces of the opposing hub assemblies into contact with one another...|$|E
40|$|The {{space station}} {{configuration}} currently studied utilizes structures which require struts to be hinged {{in the middle}} in the stowed mode and locked into place in the deployed mode. Since {{there are hundreds of}} hinges involved, it is necessary that they have simple, positive locking features with a minimum of joint looseness or slack. This invention comprises two similar housings hinged together with a spring loaded locking member which assists in making as well as breaking the lock. This invention comprises a bracket hinge and bracket members with a spring biased and movable locking member. The locking or <b>latch</b> <b>member</b> has ear parts received in locking openings where wedging surfaces on the ear parts cooperate with complimentary surfaces on the bracket members for bringing the bracket members into a tight end-to-end alignment when the bracket members are in an extended position. When the locking member is moved to an unlocking position, pivoting of the hinge about a pivot pin automatically places the locking member to retain the locking member in an unlocked position. In pivoting the hinge from an extended position to a folded position, longitudinal spring members are placed under tension over annular rollers so that the spring tension in a folded position assists in return of the hinge from a folded to an extended position. Novelty lies {{in the creation of a}} locking hinge which allows compact storage and easy assembly of structural members having a minimal number of parts...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparatus}} and method are disclosed for releasably connecting {{first and second}} objects, where a magnetic end effector may include at least one elongated pin number, a proximal end of which {{is connected to the}} first object and the distal end of which may be inserted into a receiving portion in the second object. <b>Latch</b> <b>members</b> are carried by the pin member for radial movement between retracted and expanded positions for releasing and locking, respectively, first and second objects. A plunger member carried by the pin member is axially moveable between first and second positions. In the first plunger position, the <b>latch</b> <b>members</b> are located in the expanded (locked) position and in the second plunger position the <b>latch</b> <b>members</b> are released for movement to retracted or unlocked position. The magnetic end effector is provided for releasable attachment to the first object and for moving the plunger member to the second position, releasing the first object...|$|R
40|$|A design {{concept for}} the {{construction}} of an offset-fed antenna is discussed. Antennas of this type are of interest for space applications because the configuration eliminates the effects of feed and feed-support blockage. The proposed construction concept is developed around the assembly of a stiff truss substructure by pressure-suited astronauts operating in extravehicular activity (EVA) assisted by a mobile platform that moves along the structure to position the astronauts at joint locations where they can <b>latch</b> <b>members</b> in place. Construction can be accomplished from the shuttle cargo bay {{in the course of a}} normal flight or from a space station platform. The concepts demonstrates the versatility of machine assisted manned assembly and is only one of many potential applications...|$|R
40|$|A preloadable vector-sensitive latch which {{automatically}} releases {{when the}} force vector from a latch memebr reaches a specified release angle is presented. In addition, it contains means to remove clearance between the <b>latched</b> <b>members</b> and to preload the latch to prevent separation at angles {{less than the}} specified release angle. The latch comprises a triangular main link, a free link connected between a first corner of the main link and a yoke member, a housing, and an actuator connected between the yoke member and the housing. A return spring bias means connects the main link to {{a portion of the}} housing. A second corner of the main link is slidably and pivotally connected to the housing via a slot in a web portion of the housing. The latch housing has a rigid docking ring alignable with a mating locking ring which is engageable by a locking roller journalled on the third corner of the triangular main link...|$|R
40|$|Mechanism {{eliminates}} clearance and applies positive load <b>latched</b> to <b>member.</b> Simpler {{and lighter}} than previous direction-sensitive latches (also called "vector-sensitive latches"). New mechanism {{well suited to}} operation by automatic control or by remote controlled manipulator. Stages of latching process begin with application of downward force to secondary member, causing it to displace roller. After secondary member has passed roller and joined primary member, actuator removes clearance between roller and secondary member...|$|R
5000|$|This {{works when}} the {{proteins}} {{involved in the}} complex bind to each other tightly, {{making it possible to}} pull multiple members of the complex out of solution by <b>latching</b> onto one <b>member</b> with an antibody. This concept of pulling protein complexes out of solution is sometimes referred to as a [...] "pull-down". Co-IP is a powerful technique that is used regularly by molecular biologists to analyze protein-protein interactions.|$|R
