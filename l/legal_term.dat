5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} {{at one of}} the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each <b>legal</b> <b>term,</b> particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.|$|E
5|$|Women in Mediaeval and Renaissance Europe were legally {{assumed to}} be subject to their fathers, then to their husbands after marriage. The status of women within Mediaeval trades was largely {{dependent}} on the local interpretation of femme sole, the <b>legal</b> <b>term</b> for a single woman. This was usually the widow of a tradesman, who was permitted to continue her husband's business after his death, and often established in the rights and privileges of his trade guild or company. More rarely, single women would achieve success in their father's trade. Exceptions occurred mainly in trades linked to traditional women's occupations, such as haberdashery and needlecraft.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian's {{primary concern}} was {{to place the}} {{provision}} of food supplies to the army on a rational and sustainable basis. To this end, the emperor {{put an end to}} the arbitrary exaction of food levies (indictiones) for the army, whose burden fell mainly on border provinces and which had ruined them economically. He instituted a system of regular annual indictiones ("tax levies") with the tax demanded set in advance for 5 years and related to the amount of cultivated land in each province, backed by a thorough empire-wide census of land, peasants and livestock. To deal with the problem of rural depopulation in some areas (and consequent loss of food production), he decreed that peasants, who had always been free to leave their land during the Principate, must never leave the locality in which they were registered by the census (<b>legal</b> <b>term</b> is 'origo'). This measure had the effect of legally tying tenant farmers (coloni) and their descendants to their landlords' estates.|$|E

25|$|Zina is an Islamic <b>legal</b> <b>term</b> {{referring}} to unlawful sexual intercourse. According to traditional jurisprudence, zina can include adultery (of married parties), fornication (of unmarried parties), prostitution, bestiality, {{and according to}} some scholars, rape. The Quran disapproved of the promiscuity prevailing in Arabia at the time, and several verses refer to unlawful sexual intercourse, including one that prescribes the punishment of 100 lashes for fornicators. Zina thus belong to the class of hadd (pl. hudud) crimes which have Quranically specified punishments.|$|E

40|$|The "Deutsches Rechtswoerterbuch" (DRW, Dictionary of Historical German <b>Legal</b> <b>Terms)</b> was {{established}} in 1897. The project of a dictionary of Anglo-Norman <b>legal</b> <b>terms,</b> devised by the Selden Society about the same time, served at its ideal - although {{it has never been}} carried out. Despite its name: Right from the beginning the DRW was not only supposed to be a dictionary of German <b>legal</b> <b>terms,</b> but of all West Germanic languages and dialects (for example: Lombardic, Old Frisian, Middle Dutch, Low German, High German). Therefore - among others - Old English <b>legal</b> <b>terms</b> are still subject of the lexicographical work. The dictionary reflects about 1400 years of legal and language history - from the first Germanic written sources until the 19 th century. It is edited by an interdisciplinary team of academics (lawyers, philologists, etc.) at the "Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities" and comprises 11 volumes with about 90, 000 articles from A to S so far. Since 1999 the DRW has gradually been provided with an appearance on the world-wide web.
