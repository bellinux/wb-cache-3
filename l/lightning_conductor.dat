40|$|The {{regulations}} for construction {{in many countries}} impose the connection of <b>lightning</b> <b>conductors</b> to concrete rebars. In the present work {{the effect of this}} connection on the corrosion of rebars was studied in order to avoid connections that accelerate corrosion. In some cases artificial lightning and radioactive <b>lightning</b> <b>conductors</b> were used. It was found that these connections influence the corrosion rate. It depends on the electrical characteristics of the atmosphere that is, on the season and the weather. In most cases the corrosion is accelerated. In some cases the electron flow is inversed, and protection is found. The overall phenomenon for the whole year is an acceleration of the corrosion from 35 to 70 %. The artificial lightning and the use of radioactive <b>lightning</b> <b>conductors</b> also accelerate the corrosion. It follows that the grounding of <b>lightning</b> <b>conductors</b> must be separately made with a network to divide the charge of lightning and should not be connected to the rebars...|$|R

At low tide the landing stage is forty feet above a boat, yet not completely {{out of the reach of}} the swell. Landings other than via the precarious use of dangling ropes from a derrick were most unusual even on calm days. The storm seas could rise to extraordinary heights.

500|$|During the 18th century, the gusto {{that had}} characterised {{the early years}} of the society faded; with a small number of {{scientific}} [...] "greats" [...] compared to other periods, little of note was done. In the second half, it became customary for His Majesty's Government to refer highly important scientific questions to the council of the society for advice, something that, despite the non-partisan nature of the society, spilled into politics in 1777 over lightning conductors. The pointed <b>lightning</b> <b>conductor</b> had been invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1749, while Benjamin Wilson invented blunted ones. During the argument that occurred when deciding which to use, opponents of Franklin's invention accused supporters of being American allies rather than being British, and the debate eventually led to the resignation of the society's president, Sir John Pringle. During the same time period, it became customary to appoint society fellows to serve on government committees where science was concerned, something that still continues.|$|E
500|$|The French translation, {{published}} in 1752, contained an experiment {{suggesting that a}} long, pointed iron rod would attract a lightning bolt from a thunderstorm cloud. In 1750 Hopkinson suggested to Franklin the concept that electricity is attracted to points. Franklin then carried the idea a step forward and surmised that a pointed iron rod high above a rooftop would attract a lightning bolt, if the bolt was of electricity. Frenchman Thomas-Francois d'Alibald did the actual experiment May 10, 1752, as Franklin had suggested and lightning struck the iron rod. In London it was repeated in Spital Square on July 20, 1752, and again in Chelmsford, Essex, on August 12, 1752. The electricity attraction from a lightning storm was also done by Franklin himself in the kite experiment that he talked about {{in a letter to}} Collinson dated October 19, 1752. A {{man by the name of}} G. W. Richman was killed in 1753 from electrocution doing the kite experiment. Franklin had proven that lightning bolts and electricity were one and the same. He also showed that this [...] "electric fluid" [...] was attracted to a sharply pointed object high in the sky. An iron rod could have the other end put into the ground to create a path for safe conduction of the high voltage electricity. Thus, a way of diverting lightning bolts from wooden buildings [...] and preventing them from going aflame due to lightning hits [...] had been discovered. Franklin's <b>lightning</b> <b>conductor</b> invention, with its lightning rod uppermost point, became a model for the lightning-protection system used in America in the eighteenth century.|$|E

Installation of <b>lightning</b> <b>conductors</b> based on thesestandards is not, however, in accordance with the valid legislation in the Czech Republic and Hungary. In response to a growing number of ESE installations in the Czech Republic, it is vital to inform boththe broader professional publc and the lay public of cases involving failures of this type of lightningconductor...|$|R

2500|$|A {{lightning}} rod (US, AUS) or <b>lightning</b> <b>conductor</b> (UK) is a metal rod [...] {{mounted on a}} structure and intended to protect the structure from a lightning strike. If lightning hits the structure, it will preferentially strike the rod and be conducted to ground through a wire, instead of passing through the structure, where it could start a fire or cause electrocution. Lightning rods are also called finials, air terminals or strike termination devices.|$|E

2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high ground conductivity. If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the <b>lightning</b> <b>conductor</b> between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the <b>lightning</b> <b>conductor</b> and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [...] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship was}} one of the first to be fitted with the <b>lightning</b> <b>conductor</b> invented by William Snow Harris. FitzRoy spared no expense in her fitting out, which {{included}} 22 chronometers, and five examples of the Sympiesometer, a kind of mercury-free barometer patented by Alexander Adie which was favoured by FitzRoy as giving the accurate readings required by the Admiralty. To reduce magnetic interference with the navigational instruments, FitzRoy proposed replacing the iron guns with brass guns, but the Admiralty turned this request down. (When the ship reached Rio de Janeiro in April 1832, he used his own funds for replacements: the ship now had a [...] "six-pound boat-carronade" [...] on a turntable on the forecastle, two brass six-pound guns before the main-mast, and aft of it another four brass guns; two of these were nine-pound, and the other two six-pound.) ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} an {{accommodation}} hut just underneath the west summit since 1883. At that time the Alpine Club section at Munich built a wooden hut with places for twelve people.
