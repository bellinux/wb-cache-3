5|$|In December 2009, Circle line {{services}} began serving the station. Originally operating as a loop-line using tracks {{constructed by the}} MR and the DR and serving only the station in Praed Street, the Circle line's route was altered to include the Hammersmith branch to increase train frequency on the branch and improve the regularity of Circle line trains. Trains run in a spiral anti-clockwise from Edgware Road around the <b>loop,</b> <b>back</b> to Edgware Road {{and then on to}} the Hammersmith branch.|$|E
5|$|Cycle detection, {{the problem}} of {{following}} a path in a functional graph to find a cycle in it, has applications in cryptography and computational number theory, as part of Pollard's rho algorithm for integer factorization and as a method for finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions. In these applications, ƒ is expected to behave randomly; Flajolet and Odlyzko study the graph-theoretic properties of the functional graphs arising from randomly chosen mappings. In particular, a form of the birthday paradox implies that, in a random functional graph with n vertices, the path starting from a randomly selected vertex will typically <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> on itself to form a cycle within O(√n) steps. Konyagin et al. have made analytical and computational progress on graph statistics.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on August15, the NHC began {{forecasting}} {{that the}} hurricane would make landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina within two days. Early on August16, the eye became better defined, although the feature diminished {{within a few}} hours, and the NHC {{was on the verge}} of downgrading Felix to tropical storm status. A break in the ridge allowed Felix to turn to the north, bringing it about 150mi (250km) east of the Outer Banks. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to a northeast drift, and there was initial uncertainty whether Felix would <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> to the west or recurve to the northeast. During this time, the system remained a minimal hurricane, maintaining a large eye about 60 to 80miles (95 to 130km) in diameter, but with weak convection due to cooler air. After the trough that turned Felix to the east-northeast bypassed it to the north, the hurricane turned to the southeast, executing a small loop while northwest of Bermuda. On August20, Felix weakened below hurricane intensity for the first time in nine days, due to cooler waters and increased wind shear. By that time, the convection was removed from the center, and another trough brought the storm to the northeast. While passing east of Newfoundland on August22, Felix became extratropical. The remnants continued to the northeast, eventually passing north of the United Kingdom on August25.|$|E
40|$|IPv 6 Loopback Suppression and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) are {{discussed}} in Appendix A of RFC 4862. That specification mentions a hardware-assisted mechanism to detect <b>looped</b> <b>back</b> DAD messages. If hardware cannot suppress <b>looped</b> <b>back</b> DAD messages, a software solution is required. Several service provider communities have expressed a need for automated detection of <b>looped</b> <b>back</b> Neighbor Discovery (ND) messages used by DAD. This document includes mitigation techniques and outlines the Enhanced DAD algorithm to automate the detection of <b>looped</b> <b>back</b> IPv 6 ND messages used by DAD. For network loopback tests, the Enhanced DAD algorithm allows IPv 6 to self-heal after a loopback is placed and removed. Further, for certain access networks, this document automates resolving a specific duplicate address conflict. This document updates RFCs 4429, 4861...|$|R

5|$|In 2002, NSB {{launched}} a now abandoned proposal {{to establish an}} urban train service in Trondheim. According to the proposal, trains would have operated along the Dovre Line from Melhus Station and then run to Lerkendal before continuing onwards to Lademoen and running in a <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> to the central station. The services was proposed to be operated {{as part of the}} commuter rail system. It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone, including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel. In a 2005 report, SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced, it should have four services per hour and operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle line with a tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus. The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3.6-percent gradient, which would be too steep for mainline trains.|$|E

Often trails branch out from a common segment; the more challenging ones then branch off on longer legs. The length of each loop, including segments that coincide with other loops, is typically counted separately. Consequently, the total length of loops {{is greater than the}} total length of trail structure.|$|E

An object in such an orbit would repeatedly return to the same point in spacetime if it stays in free fall. Returning to the original spacetime location would be only one possibility; the object's future light cone would include spacetime points both forwards and backwards in time, and so it should be possible for the object to engage in time travel under these conditions.|$|E
25|$|To the {{southwest}} in Henrietta, construction began by 1978 on {{an extension of}} Erie Station Road {{in the vicinity of}} Scottsville–West Henrietta and East River Roads. The new roadway, as proposed, would begin at the junction of Erie Station and East River Roads and parallel the New York State Thruway westward toward the Genesee River, then <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> to the southeast to end at Farrell Road. Ultimately, the proposed loop to Farrell Road was scrapped in favor of a more direct connection with Scottsville–West Henrietta Road. The new highway became part of a rerouted NY253 on April1, 1984, when it was added to the state highway system as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and Monroe County. In the swap, ownership and maintenance of the former routing of NY253 on Scottsville–West Henrietta Road was transferred from the state to the town of Henrietta while the East River Road portion was given to Monroe County and is now part of County Route84 (CR84).|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce head-on {{collisions}} caused by vehicles crossing over the grass median in north Calgary, the installation of high tension cable barriers was completed {{in the first half of}} 2007. In 2009, modifications were made to the interchange of Peigan, Barlow, and Deerfoot Trails, built in 1979. [...] The existing westbound to southbound ramp left little distance for traffic to merge, causing bottlenecks. [...] The ramp was modified to first curve north and then <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> underneath itself, extending the merge distance before the three southbound lanes crossed Ogden Road and then the Bow River.

500|$|On November29, the JTWC began {{tracking}} {{a disturbance}} {{well to the}} northeast of Madagascar. On December1, after a defined circulation developed, MFR began issuing warnings on the system. After having moved to the west-southwest, the depression turned to the southeast on December2. Haven received the name Bemany, the storm gradually intensified; the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of minimal hurricane status on December3, {{and the next day}} MFR estimated peak winds of 115km/h (70mph). While near peak intensity, Bemany passed about [...] east of Mauritius, and it subsequently weakened. The influence of an anticyclone turned the storm to the east and caused Bemany to <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> to the west.

500|$|There {{have been}} {{railways}} in Portland {{since the early}} 19th century. The Merchant's Railway was the earliest—it opened in 1826 (one year after the Stockton and Darlington railway) and ran from the quarries at the north of Tophill to a pier at Castletown, from where the Portland stone was shipped around the country. [...] The Weymouth and Portland Railway was laid in 1865, and ran from a station in Melcombe Regis, across the Fleet and along the low isthmus behind Chesil Beach to a station at Victoria Square in Chiswell. At {{the end of the}} 19th century the line was extended {{to the top of the}} island as the Easton and Church Ope Railway, running through Castletown and ascending the cliffs at East Weares, to <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> north to a station in Easton. The line closed to passengers in 1952, and the final goods train (and two passenger 'specials') ran in April 1965.|$|E
500|$|According to the DCNR, Quehanna Wild Area is for {{the public}} [...] "to see, use and enjoy for such {{activities}} as hiking, hunting, and fishing". The main hiking trail on the Quehanna plateau is the Quehanna Trail, a [...] loop trail that passes through the wild area and Moshannon and Elk State Forests. The main trailhead for most hikers is at Parker Dam State Park {{to the west of}} the wild area. From there the trail, which is blazed in orange, heads east to the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, skirts Piper and the Boot Camp there, then turns north, crosses Wykoff Run and turns west again. After passing through Marion Brooks Natural Area, the trail leaves the wild area and completes the <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> at Parker Dam. The Quehanna Trail is considered a strenuous hike not just because of its length, but for its [...] of changes in elevation. Two blue-blazed connector trails add [...] to the system, and there are many side trails and small trails off the Quehanna Highway. Most trails are open to cross-country skiing in the winter. According to the DCNR, the Quehanna Trail [...] "passes through some of the most wild and beautiful country Pennsylvania has to offer".|$|E

2500|$|Most {{of the eye}} {{movements}} in “rapid eye movement” sleep are in fact less rapid than those normally exhibited by waking humans. They are also shorter in duration {{and more likely to}} <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> to their starting point. About seven of such loops take place over one minute of REM sleep. In slow-wave sleep the eyes can drift apart; however, the eyes of the paradoxical sleeper move in tandem. These eye movements follow the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves originating in the brain stem. The eye movements themselves may relate to the sense of vision experienced in the dream, but a direct relationship remains to be clearly established. Congenitally blind people, who do not typically have visual imagery in their dreams, [...] still move their eyes in REM sleep. An alternative explanation suggests that the functional purpose of REM sleep is for procedural memory processing, and the rapid eye movement is only a side effect of the brain processing the eye-related procedural memory.|$|E
