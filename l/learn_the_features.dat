30|$|Early {{approaches}} for <b>learning</b> <b>the</b> appropriate <b>feature</b> space in clustering algorithms implemented deep autoencoders (DAEs) [9]. Song et al. [10] used DAEs to directly <b>learn</b> <b>the</b> data representations and cluster centers. Huang et al. [11] employed a DAE with locality and sparsity preserving constraints, which {{is followed by}} a K-means to obtain the cluster memberships. A more recent and popular approach by Xie et al. [8] <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> space and cluster membership directly using a stacked denoising autoencoder [12]. Following Xie et al. [8], there have been many studies proposing deep clustering algorithms to <b>learn</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> space and cluster membership simultaneously using some form of an autoencoder [13 – 15]. A departure from the autoencoder framework was demonstrated by Yang et al. [16], who used recurrent and convolutional neural networks with agglomerative (hierarchical) clustering.|$|R
