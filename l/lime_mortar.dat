5|$|All {{buildings}} have been adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures and {{were supported by}} large stone columns. These stone columns {{can be seen in}} several buildings such as the Lovamahapaya (brazen palace). Drainage systems of these buildings are also well planned, and terra cotta pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits. Large ponds were attached to some monasteries, such as the Kuttam Pokuna (twin pond). Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries. Buildings were constructed using timber, bricks and stones. Stones were used for foundations and columns, while brick were used for walls. <b>Lime</b> <b>mortar</b> was used for plastering walls.|$|E
5|$|Stone keep {{construction}} required skilled craftsmen. Unlike {{timber and}} earthworks, {{which could be}} built using unfree labour or serfs, these craftsmen had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive. They were also relatively slow to erect, due to {{the limitations of the}} <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> used during the period â€“ a keep's walls could usually be raised by a maximum of only 12 feet (3.6 metres) a year; the keep at Scarborough was not atypical in taking ten years to build. The number of such keeps remained relatively low: in England, for example, although several early stone keeps had been built after the conquest, there were only somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100, and only around a hundred had been built by 1216.|$|E
40|$|Lime based mortal's are {{now widely}} {{acknowledged}} to be generally superior to cement based mortars in the repair of appropriate historic infrastructure. Increasingly {{the benefits of}} hydraulic <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> are also being realised in new masonry construction. In order to standardise the expected performance of mortars, designers will specify the type of lime, the type of filler (aggregate), the proportions of each and quantity of water or the required workability. Limes can be non-hydraulic (calcium or dolomitic) or hydraulic (natural or artificial). It {{is well known that}} the water/binder ratio has a marked effect on the structural performance of cement-based mortars. This is relationship is known as Abrams' rule, which states that when a cement mortar is fully compacted, its strength is inversely proportional to the water/cement ratio. Abrams' rule has also been demonstrated to apply to hydraulic <b>lime</b> <b>mortars.</b> The {{reason for this is that}} both cement and hydraulic limes require a minimum quantity of water to produce the chemical set resulting from the hydration of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates. Surplus water eventually dries out, leaving micropores in the matrix which weaken the resulting set mortar. It has generally been assumed that the same relationship applies to non-hydraulic <b>lime</b> (air <b>lime)</b> <b>mortars.</b> This paper reports on results of tests conducted on air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> at early stages of curing. It is known that the form of air lime and the physical and chemical characteristics of the aggregate have a strong impact on the structural performance of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars.</b> Results to date show that the water/lime ratio has a minimal impact on the structural performance of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> compared with the impact of lime and aggregate type. 91 day compressive strengths for air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> with a water/lime ratio of 0. 56 (a stiff mix) are identical to those with a water/lime ratio of 0. 875 (a loose slurry). Whereas Abrams' rule is a key consideration for designers of cement and hydraulic <b>lime</b> <b>mortars,</b> it has been demonstrated that it requires modification in the case of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars.</b> A relationship between form of lime, type of aggregate, water/lime ratio, and age of mortar is proposed. The resultant equation allows the compressive strength of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> to be predicted taking into account these factors. The insights gained from this study will allow practitioners to more confidently design and specify air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars...</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{strength}} grades for natural hydraulic lime, {{laid down in}} the European Norm EN459; NHL2, NHL3.5 and NHL5. The numbers stand for the minimum compressive strength at 28 days in newtons per square millimeter (N/mm2). For example, the NHL 3.5 strength ranges from 3.5 N/mm2 (510 psi) to 10 N/mm2 (1,450 psi). These {{are similar to the}} old classification of feebly hydraulic, moderately hydraulic and eminently hydraulic, and although different, some people continue to refer to them interchangeably. The terminology for hydraulic <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> was improved by the skilled French civil engineer Louis Vicat in the 1830s from the older system of water limes and feebly, moderately and eminently. Vicat published his work following research of the use of <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> whilst building bridges and roads in his work.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{carbonic}} anhydrase enzyme on the precipitation kinetics and phase transformations of calcium carbonate, {{and on the}} strength development of <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> has been investigated with saturated lime solutions, lime pastes and <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> under atmospheric conditions. The results clearly show that carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reaction between carbon dioxide and aqueous lime, and increases the rate of calcium carbonate crystallization, the yield of the carbonation reaction and mortar strength at early ages. This is most likely a kinetic effect associated with the increased rate of carbonate ions supply to the solution by the enzyme. In addition, this enzyme favors the formation of stable calcite and significantly modifies its morphology by developing new crystal faces. These results suggest a novel approach for accelerating the hardening of <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> using carbonic anhydrase enzyme, which may offer a potentially novel approach with significant benefits on the applications of <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> in architectural heritage conservation {{as well as in}} construction. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Lime {{has been}} used in {{construction}} for millennia, and its value, especially in the field of conservation architecture, has only recently been rediscovered. <b>Lime</b> <b>mortars</b> harden through carbonation, and this thesis is a study of that process. The research conducted has resulted in the development of two novel techniques for the measurement and detection of carbonation. The first technique is a method of thermogravimetric analysis which allows the carbonation profile to be measured within an acceptable time-frame. The second technique is the use of drilling resistance measurement to visualise the carbonation profile. The potential of elemental analysis to measure the carbonation profile has also been identified. It has been demonstrated that the lime/water ratio has less impact on the compressive strength of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> than had previously been supposed. The change in the pore size distribution of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> caused by carbonation has been studied, and a theory has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Five different forms of air lime binder were studied. The impact of these on the structural performance of the resultant mortars has been assessed. It was concluded that <b>mortars</b> made with <b>lime</b> putties perform better than mortars made with dry <b>lime</b> hydrate. <b>Mortars</b> made with dispersed hydrated lime appear to perform as well as <b>mortars</b> made with <b>lime</b> putties, but at a slower rate of strength growth. The use of extra mature lime putty does not appear to confer structural performance benefits when compared with ordinary lime putty. It has been shown that the use of calcitic aggregates can produce air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> which perform as well as moderately hydraulic <b>lime</b> <b>mortars.</b> It is theorised that this phenomenon is not directly related to carbonation, but rather to a complex interaction of the granulometry, mineralogy, chemistry and porosity of the aggregate with the binder.

Air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> were used for centuries and many architectural monuments show this type of mortars. Modern renders and coating mortars can also be made of air lime as the main binding phase. The use of several admixtures to improve different characteristics of these mortars is now explored and discussed in the current presentation. Insights into the action mechanisms are addressed.
