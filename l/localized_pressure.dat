50|$|A {{sound wave}} propagates through a {{material}} as a <b>localized</b> <b>pressure</b> change. Increasing {{the pressure of}} a gas or fluid increases its local temperature. The local speed of sound in a compressible material increases with temperature; as a result, the wave travels faster during the high pressure phase of the oscillation than during the lower pressure phase. This affects the wave's frequency structure; for example, in an initially plane sinusoidal wave of a single frequency, the peaks of the wave travel faster than the troughs, and the pulse becomes cumulatively more like a sawtooth wave. In other words, the wave self-distorts. In doing so, other frequency components are introduced, which can be described by the Fourier series. This phenomenon is characteristic of a non-linear system, since a linear acoustic system responds only to the driving frequency. This always occurs but the effects of geometric spreading and of absorption usually overcome the self distortion, so linear behavior usually prevails and nonlinear acoustic propagation occurs only for very large amplitudes and only near the source.|$|E

Young's modulus was 300 kPa for the Carbopol-polymer and 5 kPa for the Chitosan-polymer. The Chitosan-polymer exhibited much larger shear adhesion than its tensile adhesion: 3. 4 N vs. 1. 2. Both tensile and shear adhesions contributed to the large retraction force (2. 6 N) obtained during l polymer-bowel retraction testing. Work of adhesion at the polymer/serosa interface, defined as the area under the force curve, was 64 mJ, which is appreciably larger than that reported with existing polymers.

40|$|Physical {{properties}} of the mantle lithosphere have a strong influence on the rifting processes and rifted structures. In particular, in context of rifting, two of these properties have been overlooked: (1) Mohr-Coulomb plasticity (<b>localizing</b> <b>pressure</b> dependent) may not be valid at mantle depths as opposed to nonlocalizing pressure-independent plasticity (hereafter, perfect plasticity), and (2) lithosphere buoyancy can vary, depending on the petrological composition of the mantle. Focussing on the Arabian plate, we show that the lithosphere may be negatively buoyant. We use thermomechanical modeling to investigate the importance of mantle rheology and composition on {{the formation of a}} passive margin, ocean-continent transition (OCT) and oceanic basin. We compare the results of this parametric study to observations in the eastern Gulf of Aden (heat flow, refraction seismics and topography) and show that (1) mantle lithosphere rheology controls the margin geometry and timing of the rifting; (2) lithosphere buoyancy has a large impact on the seafloor depth and the timing of partial melting; and (3) a perfectly plastic mantle lithosphere 20 kg m(- 3) denser than the asthenosphere best fits with observed elevation in the Gulf of Aden. Finally, thermomechanical models suggest that partial melting can occur in the mantle during the Arabian crustal breakup. We postulate that the produced melt could then infiltrate through the remnant continental mantle lithosphere, reach the surface and generate oceanic crust. This is in agreement with the observed narrow OCT composed of exhumed continental mantle intruded by volcanic rocks in the eastern Gulf of Aden...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the two- and {{three-dimensional}} nonlinear water waves generated by a steady or oscillating pressure distribution acting at the free surface of a running stream on water of finite depth h. The solutions of the corresponding linearized problems become singular depending on the relative values of the water depth, frequency, and {{the speed of the}} applied pressure leading to a resonant phenomenon. When the applied oscillatory pressure distribution moves at a resonant speed, the finite amplitude response is governed by the forced nonlinear Schrödinger (fNLS) equation. Under certain circumstances, the generated wave disturbance may not reach a steady state; in particular, for deep water, a steady state is never attained. For the case of a two-dimensional wave generated by a <b>localized</b> steady <b>pressure</b> moving at a resonant speed, the generated waves are actually of bounded amplitude and are governed by a forced Korteweg–de Vries (fKdV) equation subject to appropriate asymptotic initial conditions. A computational study of the forced KdV equation reveals that a series of solitons is generated in front of the pressure distribution. On the other hand, for the case of the three-dimensional waves induced by a <b>localized</b> steady <b>pressure</b> traveling at a resonant speed, the nonlinear response is governed by a forced Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (fKP) equation. In order to extend the range of applicability of the Boussinesq-type equations in the theory of water waves, the modified Boussinesq equations are derived in terms of the velocity potential on an arbitrary elevation and the free surface displacement...|$|R
