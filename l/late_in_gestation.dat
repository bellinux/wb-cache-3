In utero delivery of transgenes was shown previously {{to result in}} high efficiency transfer to pulmonary and intestinal epithelial stem cells. Thus, this technology {{can be used to}} evaluate <b>late</b> <b>gestation</b> development.

We therefore studied maternal and fetal metabolism, growth and glucose–insulin axis function <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>gestation</b> <b>in</b> twin and singleton sheep pregnancies, either undernourished from 60 days before until 30 days after conception or fed ad libitum. We found that twin-bearing ewes had decreased maternal food intake <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>gestation</b> and lower maternal and fetal plasma glucose and insulin levels. Twin fetuses had fewer everted placentomes, grew slower <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>gestation,</b> and had a greater insulin response to a glucose challenge, but lesser response to arginine.

Thus, the physiology of twin pregnancy is quite different from that of singleton pregnancy, and is probably determined by a combination of factors acting in both early and late gestation.

40|$|To {{determine}} if pancreatic glucoregulatory hormones can be {{implicated in the}} glucose fall of pregnancy, we have measured plasma immunoreactive insulin and glucagon (IRI and IRG) in rats. Fed rats in midgestation show a rise in IRI without a corresponding increase <b>in</b> IRG. <b>In</b> <b>late</b> <b>gestation,</b> IRG rises significantly, but only enough {{to keep pace with}} a further rise in IRI. On a molar basis, IRI remains the predominant hormone despite a marked fall in blood glucose. After a 48 -h fast IRI falls to comparably low levels in pregnant and virgin rats. A small rise in IRG is seen in virgin but not in pregnant rats despite frank hypoglycemia in the latter. Thus, IRG secretion in pregnancy is diminished relative to IRI in the fed state and fails to increase in the fasted state despite the stimulus of a lower glucose in both instances. To evaluate IRG secretory reserve, the IRG response to i. v. alanine was assessed <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>gestation.</b> <b>In</b> fed rats a greater IRG increase is seen in pregnancy; after fasting no difference is seen between pregnant and virgin rats. These results preclude an absolute deficiency in glucagon secretion. Pancreas hormone stores were alos measured in an effort to explain the altered secretory state. We find reciprocal changes in IRI and IRG content favoring IRG in midgestation and IRI <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>gestation.</b> Thus, pancreas hormone storage is altered in pregnancy but does not account for the changes in hormone secretion. Rather, pregnancy exerts an effect on the islet secretory process itself. Release of IRI is enhanced relative to IRG regardless of the blood sugar level. These observations suggest that in the pregnant rat circulating levels of insulin and glucagon may act to limit hepatic glucose output. Available evidence from the literature supports the concept of restrained glucose production. It is proposed that a lower blood glucose production. It is proposed that a lower blood glucose in rat pregnancy may be a lesser liability teleologically than would be the obligate nitrogen wasting which accompanies gluconeogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhea}} virus (BVDV) infection {{occurs in}} the cattle population worldwide. Non-cytopathic (ncp) BVDV strains cause transient infection (TI) or persistent infection (PI) depending on the host 2 ̆ 7 s immune status. Immunocompetent adult animals and fetuses <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>gestation</b> resolve the infection. Fetal infection <b>in</b> early <b>gestation</b> results <b>in</b> PI with chronic viremia and life-long viral shedding, ensuring virus perpetuation in the population. Eighteen pregnant heifers, divided into three groups, were intranasally inoculated with ncp BVDV 2 virus early (day 75) and <b>late</b> (day 175) <b>in</b> <b>gestation,</b> or kept BVDV-naïve. Fetuses were retrieved on day 190. Antiviral activity in blood of dams and fetuses, maternal expression of interferon (IFN) stimulated gene 15 kDa (ISG 15), virological and serological status of heifers and fetuses, and fetal growth were studied. A pronounced antiviral activity in blood of heifers and TI fetuses during acute BVDV infection was accompanied by drastic up-regulation of ISG 15 mRNA in maternal blood. Only one PI fetus expressed low IFN response 115 days post inoculation despite high BVDV antigen and RNA levels. PI fetuses presented with growth retardation. Infection of pregnant heifers with ncp BVDV 2 early <b>in</b> <b>gestation</b> adversely affects fetal development and antiviral responses, despite protective immune responses in the dam...|$|R
