40|$|In low {{atmospheric}} pressure stunning (LAPS), poultry are rendered unconscious before slaughter by gradually reducing oxygen {{tension in the}} atmosphere to achieve a progressive anoxia. The effects of LAPS are not instantaneous, so there are legitimate welfare concerns around the experience of birds before loss of consciousness. Using self-contained telemetry logging units, high-quality continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (EKG) recordings were obtained from 28 broiler chickens during exposure to LAPS in a commercial poultry processing plant. Application of LAPS was associated with changes in the EEG pattern {{in the form of}} increases in total power, decreases in mean frequency, and in particular, increases in slow-wave (delta) activity, indicating a gradual loss of consciousness. Increased delta wave activity was seen within 10 s of LAPS onset and consistently thereafter, peaking at 30 s into LAPS at which point the EEG signal shared characteristics with that of birds in a surgical plane of anesthesia. During LAPS, heart rate consistently decreased, with more pronounced bradycardia and arrhythmia observed after 30 s. No heart rate increases were observed in the period when the birds were potentially conscious. After an initial quiescent period, brief body movements (presumed to be ataxia/loss of posture) were seen on average at 39 s into the LAPS process. Later (after 120 s on average), artifacts related to clonic (wing flapping) and tonic (muscle spasms) convulsions were observed in the EKG recordings. Based on EEG analysis and body movement responses, a conservative estimate of time to loss of consciousness is approximately 40 s. The lack of behavioral responses indicating aversion or escape and absence of heart rate elevation in the conscious period strongly suggest that birds do not find LAPS induction distressing. Collectively, the results suggest that LAPS is a humane approach that has the potential to improve the welfare of poultry at slaughter by gradually inducing unconsciousness without distress, eliminating <b>live</b> <b>shackling</b> and ensuring every bird is adequately stunned before exansguination...|$|E
50|$|In September 2013, Mujica {{addressed}} the United Nations General Assembly, {{with a very}} long speech devoted to humanity and globalization. The speech called on {{the international community to}} strengthen efforts to preserve the planet for future generations and highlighted the power of the financial systems and the impact of economic fallout on ordinary people. He urged a return to simplicity, with lives founded on human relationships, love, friendship, adventure, solidarity and family, instead of <b>lives</b> <b>shackled</b> to the economy and the markets.|$|R

He said that {{he does not want to}} <b>live</b> his life <b>shackled</b> to his past and that he wrote the book in gratitude for the attention and love he has received, which has been a great comfort to him.|$|R

They work as slaves to a feudal {{landlord}} (Radha Ravi) who exploits them. Maheswari (Abhirami), a doctor, {{falls in love with}} Karmegham. Later through his mother (Manorama), Karmegham comes to know that Radha Ravi is his father and then it becomes a father-son conflict. Karmegham stood with the villagers and opposed his father and brother Shakthi. His sister, Mangai, loves a poor villager but Sakthi and his father are against her love. Sakthi kills her sister's lover, his sister goes mad and Karmegham calls the police. His brother escapes but the police shot him in an encounter. Karmegham gets married with Maheswari. His sister and mother die in a bomb blast planned by Karmegham's father. Karmegham kills his father to save at least his village.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} in two parts. Part A {{is a novel}} titled Abraham&rsquo;s Pictures. It reveals the story of Abraham Rosen, a writer and {{photographer}} in current day Melbourne seeking {{to come to terms}} with a prediction, made on his fiftieth birthday, that his life will end in three months. He is committed to living his life &lsquo;as normal&rsquo; in the shadow of his prediction. He also decides to shoot photographs for an exhibition he calls Just in Time. He schedules the exhibition for the very day of his predicted demise. As he sits at his regular outdoor table at Caf&eacute; Obscura trying to make sense of the &lsquo;ridiculous&rsquo; prediction, he is approached by a disheveled young man who seems to want money. He tries to engage with the young man but an out-of-control car skids on the wet tram tracks, killing its two occupants and knocking the young man into a coma. The following day Abraham learns that he has won a competition to photograph the prototype of the Clock of the Long Now in London and to address the annual dinner of the Long Now Foundation. The prediction and the accident set Abraham on a quest that takes him from Melbourne to London via Mumbai and Colombo before returning to Melbourne for his exhibition. Along the way he confronts issues of memory and denial as he is forced to question his life as a photographer. In the end it is the photographer who dies but Abraham survives as man who has learnt to <b>live</b> without being <b>shackled</b> to his past. This novel sets out to explore the relationships between time, memory and photography. It becomes a meditation on the nature of lost time and on the power of the image. Part B is the exegesis titled: Double Gazing and Novel Spaces: An examination of the role of photographs in novels, using W. G. Sebald&rsquo;s Austerlitz as a case study and Roland Barthes&rsquo;s interrogations of photography as an underlying context. This exegetical work investigates the question of what happens to a photograph when it becomes manifest in an imaginative narrative. The exegesis surveys the manifestations of photographs in contemporary novels and engages in semiotic and intertextual analysis to interrogate the indexical nature of the photograph. Combined &ndash; Parts A and B show how photographs form a mnemonic discourse that can propel imaginative narratives into new and speculative realms...|$|R
