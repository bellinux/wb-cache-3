5000|$|The Eaton BladeUPS is a modular {{three-phase}} UPS system {{consisting of}} individual 6U 12 kW UPS units {{which can be}} paralleled together to create up to a 60 kW N+1 redundant UPS. A feature of the BladeUPS is that the 6U cabinet houses both the UPS electronics and batteries; other modular systems house them separately. [...] The high power density and 6U form factor of the BladeUPS are targeted at the growing power demands of IT servers and equipment, especially blade servers.The BladeUPS does not fall into a defined category for UPS type {{as it is a}} hybrid of a <b>line</b> <b>interactive</b> and online architecture, which Eaton calls Double Conversion on Demand. [...] During normal operation the BladeUPS operates as a <b>line</b> <b>interactive</b> UPS allowing it to be energy efficient. When power conditions fluctuate outside preset standards, the unit switches into online mode (also known as double conversion). Software upgrades by Eaton have allowed BladeUPS owners to defeat this hybrid architecture and force the unit to operate entirely in online (double conversion) mode.|$|E

In grid-connected mode, power can be imported from the grid by the UPS to charge its battery. Power can also be exported when required, e. g., when the tariffs are advantageous. In stand-alone mode, the UPS supplies local distributed loads in parallel with other sources. In this paper, a <b>line</b> <b>interactive</b> UPS and its control system are presented and discussed. Power flow is controlled using the frequency and voltage drooping technique to ensure seamless transfer between grid-connected and stand-alone parallel modes of operation. The drooping coefficients are chosen to limit the energy imported by the USP when re-connecting to the grid and to give good transient response.

By determining the location of the poles and zeros of the open loop transfer function, comments are made about the stability of the controlled system for various gains. The value of control gain that causes instability can be determined analytically. Simulations in Scilab are used to show the change in the poles of the controlled system with changes in control gain.

40|$|Abstract [...] Power supply {{availability}} and quality are key factors in many industrial, ICT and domestic appliances. Using the right UPS architectures in properly designed electrical installations and appropriate matching with the loads are the objectives to be achieved. The European standard ENV 50091 (and new IEC/EN 62040) defines different UPS classes dealing with different transients responses, non-linear loads driving capability and input-output dependency. Harmonic {{voltage and current}} distortion are also significant UPS evaluation parameters. UPS selection is made among double conversion, <b>line</b> <b>interactive,</b> stand-by and delta conversion technology. The power quality provided by {{each one of the}} described UPS systems is related to harmonic distortion, inverter structure and voltage/frequency correction capability. Moreover, the use of CROSS System static Transfer Switches (STS) allows to achieve higher {{availability and}} reliability levels.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{comparative study}} {{and implementation of}} Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) to eliminate harmonics and reactive power compensation in a single-phase to threephase converter system. The proposed configuration solves typical problems encountered in remote rural area applications, where only a single-phase supply is available {{and there is a}} demand for three-phase supply. The universal active power filter is a power line conditioner. It consists of a combination of series type and shunt type active power filter topologies. The series active power filters are used to minimizevoltage harmonic distortion and sag/swell compensation of the input voltage. The shunt active filters used are to minimize current harmonics and compensate reactive power of the system, resulting in effective power factor improvement. In this scheme, a three phase <b>line</b> <b>interactive</b> uninterruptible power supply system also is used. A suitable control approach is used to minimize the voltage and current harmonics simultaneously. The simulation model of Universal Active Power Filter, for single phase to three phase system was developed using MATLAB -simulink with PI and Neural Network controller.

40|$|Abstract: Uninterruptible power {{supplies}} (UPS) {{play an important}} role in interfacing critical loads such as computers, communication systems, medical/life support system and industrial controls to the utility power grid. They are designed to provide clean and continuous power to the load under essentially any normal or abnormal utility power condition. Among the various UPS topologies such as online UPS, offline UPS and <b>line</b> <b>interactive</b> UPS, online UPS are widely used. In this paper hardware implementation of single phase 50 Hz, online uninterruptable power supply with over voltage, under voltage and phase out protection have been carried. Atmega 32 microcontroller is the heart of the system and controls entire system. By programming the microcontroller using embedded C, SPWM pulses to drive H-bridge are generated. By alternating switching switches of two legs of H-bridge alternating 9 V DC voltage is converted into 9 V Ac voltage. Output of H-bridge is given to step up transformer to step up the voltage to 220 V, 50 Hz. The microcontroller is so programmed that at every instant it checks the voltage that is supplied to the load through sensors. At any instant if it detects that there is over voltage, under voltage or phase out, microcontroller acts to isolate the load from the power source by sending tripping signal to relay. Once relay isolates the load from the power source, microcontroller supplies the load through the charged battery. Battery supplies the load until the power supply voltage reaches normal value of voltage...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} a high step-up/down transformerless dc-dc modular {{multilevel}} converter (MMC) that would be applicable to dc power systems. The design achieves high voltage ratios for interfacing renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic and <b>line</b> <b>interactive</b> Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) systems. The circuit topology provides for high step-up/down dc-dc conversion ratios using an MMC approach operating in resonant mode {{in order to improve}} overall efficiency. This topology operates to step-up the input voltage with 1 : 10 or larger conversion ratio. As a bidirectional converter, it also provides step-down capability at the same voltage ratio (10 : 1 or greater). The MMC circuit system consists of an upper and lower set of cells. The number of the upper cells is N, and the number of the lower cells is M. Phase-shift pulse width modulation (PS-PWM) is used to control voltage and power flow. PS-PWM with high duty cycle is generated to ensure that all the capacitors are connected except for one of them, which is out of the connection. A MATLAB/Simulink™ and LTspice simulations for the proposed topology are presented. Moreover, PV and UPS systems with the proposed topology are simulated using MATLAB/Simulink™. In photovoltaic application systems, a closed loop control system is represented for voltage regulation in case there is a change in the input voltage.

Significantly improves performance reliability of autonomous systems using the modularity of its main functional units.

40|$|Underground {{openings}} and excavations {{are increasingly}} being used for civilian and strategic purposes all over the world. Recent earthquakes and resulting damage have brought into focus and raised the awareness for aseismic design and construction. In addition, underground tunnels, particularly, have distinct seismic behaviour due to their complete enclosure in soil or rock and their significant length. Therefore, seismic response of tunnel support systems warrant closer attention. The geological settings {{in which they are}} placed are often difficult to describe due to limited site investigation data and vast spatial variability. Therefore, the parameters which govern the design are many and their variabilities cannot be ignored. A solution to this issue is reliability based analysis and design. These real conditions of variability can only be addressed through a reliability based design. The problem addressed here is one of reliability-based analysis of the support system of an underground tunnel in soil. Issues like the description of the interaction between the tunnel lining and the surrounding medium, the type of limit state that would be appropriate, the non-availability of a closed form performance function and the advantages of response surface method [RSM] are looked into.
