5|$|<b>Logarithms</b> {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral. Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. <b>Logarithms</b> are also linked to self-similarity. For example, <b>logarithms</b> appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on <b>logarithms.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} of whether a matrix has a <b>logarithm</b> has the easiest answer when considered in the complex setting. A matrix has a <b>logarithm</b> if and only if it is invertible. The <b>logarithm</b> is not unique, but if a matrix has no negative real eigenvalues, then there is a unique <b>logarithm</b> that has eigenvalues all lying in the strip {z ∈ C | −π < Im z < π}.

5|$|The modern form of {{a binary}} logarithm, {{applying}} to any number (not just powers of two) was considered explicitly by Leonhard Euler in 1739. Euler established the application of binary <b>logarithms</b> to music theory, long before their more significant applications in information theory and computer science became known. As part of his work in this area, Euler published a table of binary <b>logarithms</b> of the integers from 1 to 8, to seven decimal digits of accuracy.|$|E

5000|$|In mathematics, {{the common}} <b>logarithm</b> is the <b>logarithm</b> with base 10. It {{is also known}} as the decadic <b>logarithm</b> and also as the decimal <b>logarithm,</b> named after its base, or Briggsian <b>logarithm,</b> after Henry Briggs, an English {{mathematician}} who pioneered its use, as well as [...] "standard logarithm". Historically, it was known as logarithmus decimalis or logarithmus decadis. It is indicated by log10(x), or sometimes Log(x) with a capital L (however, this notation is ambiguous since it can also mean the complex natural logarithmic multi-valued function). On calculators it is usually [...] "log", but mathematicians usually mean natural <b>logarithm</b> (<b>logarithm</b> with base e ≈ 2.71828) rather than common <b>logarithm</b> when they write [...] "log". To mitigate this ambiguity the ISO 80000 specification recommends that log10(x) should be written lg (x) and loge(x) should be ln (x).|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} {{logarithm}} in seventeenth century Europe is {{the discovery of}} a new function that extended the realm of analysis beyond the scope of algebraic methods. The method of <b>logarithms</b> was publicly propounded by John Napier in 1614, in a book titled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Rule of <b>Logarithms).</b> Prior to Napier's invention, there had been other techniques of similar scopes, such as the prosthaphaeresis or the use of tables of progressions, extensively developed by Jost Bürgi around 1600.|$|E
5|$|The non-sliding {{logarithmic}} scale, Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their <b>logarithms.</b> Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding <b>logarithms.</b> For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E
5|$|Complex {{powers and}} <b>logarithms</b> are more {{naturally}} handled as single valued functions on a Riemann surface. Single valued versions {{are defined by}} choosing a sheet. The value has a discontinuity along a branch cut. Choosing one out of many solutions as the principal value leaves us with functions that are not continuous, and the usual rules for manipulating powers can lead us astray.|$|E

5|$|Data points {{obtained}} {{in this way}} are often visualized as a scatterplot in which {{one or both of}} the coordinate axes are binary <b>logarithms</b> of intensity ratios, or in visualizations such as the MA plot and RA plot that rotate and scale these log ratio scatterplots.|$|E
5|$|<b>Logarithms</b> {{also occur}} in {{log-normal}} distributions. When the logarithm of a random variable has a normal distribution, the variable {{is said to}} have a log-normal distribution. Log-normal distributions are encountered in many fields, wherever a variable is formed as the product of many independent positive random variables, for example in the study of turbulence.|$|E
5|$|This {{identity}} allows multiplication to {{be carried}} out by consulting a table of <b>logarithms</b> and computing addition by hand; it also enables multiplication on a slide rule.

5|$|In {{the same}} way as the <b>logarithm</b> reverses exponentiation, the complex <b>logarithm</b> is the inverse {{function}} of the exponential function applied to complex numbers. The discrete <b>logarithm</b> is another variant; it has uses in public-key cryptography.|$|R
25|$|Consider {{the natural}} <b>logarithm</b> {{function}} mapping the real numbers to themselves. The <b>logarithm</b> of a non-positive real {{is not a}} real number, so the natural <b>logarithm</b> function doesn't associate any real number in the codomain with any non-positive real number in the domain. Therefore, the natural <b>logarithm</b> function is not a total function when viewed as a function from the reals to themselves, {{but it is a}} partial function. If the domain is restricted to only include the positive reals (that is, if the natural <b>logarithm</b> function is viewed as a function from the positive reals to the reals), then the natural <b>logarithm</b> is a total function.|$|R
5|$|Apart from {{a number}} of other books and pamphlets, Wright {{translated}} John Napier's pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of <b>logarithms</b> from Latin into English. This was published after Wright's death as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes (1616). Wright's work influenced, among other persons, Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius; Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland; and the English mathematician Richard Norwood, who calculated the length of a degree on a great circle of the earth using a method proposed by Wright.|$|E
5|$|Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging {{quantities}} to tiny scopes. For example, the decibel is a unit quantifying signal power log-ratios and amplitude log-ratios (of which {{sound pressure}} {{is a common}} example). In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. <b>Logarithms</b> are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements {{of the complexity of}} algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They describe musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.|$|E
5|$|Lyapunov exponents use <b>logarithms</b> {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a {{dynamical}} system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E
