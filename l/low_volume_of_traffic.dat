40|$|Abstract — A large {{proportion}} of India‟s villages has been connected with all weather roads and has <b>low</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> The main composition of such roads is granular layer with or without thin bituminous surfacing. The common problem to rural roads is that their maintenance is neglected because of paucity of funds and poor institutional set up, and the road asset created at a great cost is lost. Cement concrete pavement offer an alternate to the flexible pavements especially when the soil strength is poor, the aggregates are costly and drainage conditions are bad. Concrete pavements have now been constructed for <b>low</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> because of their durability even under poor drainage conditions. Rural roads connecting major roads are sometimes required to carry diverted traffic which may damage the concrete pavement slabs. Such factors may be considered while arriving at thickness of concrete pavements. It is well established that the concrete pavements demand {{a high degree of}} professional expertise at the design stage as the defective design may lead to concrete failure even if the construction is done with great care. Indian Roads Congress has issued the first revision of IRC: SP: 62 in 2014 for design and construction of concrete pavement for low volume of roads. In this paper, efforts have been made to elaborate the different design aspects of concrete pavement for rural roads which will be helpful for the young engineers and research scholars...|$|E

A semi-dense and a coarse asphalt mixture were studied, both containing 50 % recycled aggregate from construction and demolition debris.

It was shown that the mixtures containing recycled aggregates were more open graded and had considerable potential for stripping, a characteristic that can be related to the high water absorption level of the mortar adhered to the recycled aggregates. It was also shown that the dynamic modulus was higher in the mixtures made with recycled aggregates, particularly in the semi-dense asphalts. Whereas a deterioration of the fatigue law was observed in the semi-dense mixtures, this property did not appear to worsen in the coarse mixtures.

30|$|Based on the {{application}} of wireless mesh network, the objectives like throughput maximization, fairness between traffic demands, balancing of frequency channels utilization, and node utilization balancing must be considered. However, only throughput maximization has been investigated in most researches [9 – 17]. This can result in some serious problems in the network. Firstly, because of the imbalance in resource utilization, the network congestion is occurred in some areas while the other areas carry <b>low</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> Secondly, the fairness between traffic demands is not established and therefore, some traffic demands are not satisfied. Thirdly, the density of mesh routers is usually low and the traffic volumes are high; therefore, {{the failure of a}} router, even for a moment, greatly increases the packet losses. For this reason, in addition to the above-mentioned objectives, the robustness of the network against failures should also be considered. According to the definition provided in [18], if the network graph is K-Connected, the network will remain connected even after the failure of fewer than K nodes. Therefore, wireless mesh networks must be designed such that the K-Connectivity feature of the graph is guaranteed.|$|E

The primary highway system provides an inter-regional, inter-provincial, and inter-national highway network that was built to accommodate <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> in excess <b>of</b> 4, 000 vehicles per day with significant numbers of heavily loaded trucks. The secondary highway system consists of structural, thin membrane surface (TMS), and gravel highways. TMS highways were constructed to provide feeder links into the primary system for relatively <b>low</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> with few heavily loaded trucks. Years <b>of</b> increasing <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> heavy trucks and inadequate funding on the TMS highway system have forced SHT to evaluate various management strategies. New maintenance and management strategies like partnerships with Rural Municipalities and full depth in-place chemical strengthening have been developed and, along with conventional management strategies, are being used throughout Saskatchewan. 	 The purpose {{of this research is}} to develop a project level analytical framework capable of evaluating management strategies for secondary highways, based on SHT surfacing and structure standards. The best management strategy is the lowest total cost strategy (agency and road user) based on SHT standards. Probabilistic modeling was also included in the framework so uncertainty in the variables, like length of the service life of these new strategies, could be analyzed. A project on Highway No. 19 was evaluated to demonstrate the framework. From the analysis, the full depth in-place chemical strengthening was the preferred strategy if it lasted 15 to 20 years, relative to a 15 year expected life of the conventional strategy. As well, as the technology advances in Saskatchewan, it appears that the full depth in-place chemical strengthening should decrease in cost while the conventional strategy increases in cost as aggregate sources are depleted. This trend should result in long-term cost savings to SHT...|$|R

The majority of the information used to derive the relationships contained in this procedure was collected on medium and heavily trafficked roads. Very little performance data existed {{prior to the start}} of this project for lightly trafficked roads, with the result that the relationships in the above procedure had to be extrapolated at the lower traffic levels. This investigation has resulted in the setting up of a large data base containing pavement condition, construction and strength information. A new methodology has been developed for investigating the performance of {{flexible pavement}}s based upon data gathered over a limited time scale. This methodology has been used to relate deflection to pavement condition and the subsequent relationships used to validate those published by TRRL. The work has added confidence to the use of the evaluation and overlay design procedure for roads that have carried <b>low</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> An investigation has also been undertaken into the use of deflected shape measurements, made with a Deflectograph, to characterise pavement construction.

These streets carry a relatively <b>low</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic,</b> yet are standard in form. This factor in conjunction with the self-contained nature of houses in residential areas results in a lack of social capital in areas with a large amount of social potential. The suburbs of Kilbirnie on the Rongotai isthmus in Wellington have been selected as the site due to the potential of the streets; in particular due to their width and mono-functionality. The five sites that have been selected have potential far beyond their current use and are going {{to be used as a}} design case study to explore pre-emptive disaster design in conjunction with providing social amenities. The streetscape within the identified site is excessively wide with a large amount of on-street parking. This thesis argues that this extra, underutilised space has the potential to be adapted into an aesthetically pleasing, functional community amenity. The designs will break up the monotonous nature of the residential streets and create a hub for surrounding residents through the exploration of programme and form. The introduction of water storage infrastructure as a programme will pre-emptively service the suburb in the event of a disaster. The likelihood of the potable water supply being severed to both the Wellington CBD and to the Rongotai Isthmus and Miramar Peninsula is high due to the location of the service pipes in relation to the dominant fault lines in the suburb. The study proposes exploring programmes which challenge people’s perception of ownership of public land and amenity. Re-allocating and prioritising parts of street space to provide amenity for surrounding residents has the potential to initiate a change from monotone, mundane functionality into a hub of social activity, community building and disaster resilience. The design methodology uses precedents which employ techniques that can be used to challenge the norm and provide a design outcome which creates engaging residential spaces...|$|E

40|$|Global {{warming is}} one of the biggest {{challenges}} of our society. The road transport sector is responsible for a big share of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, which are considered to be the dominant cause of global warming. Although most of those emissions are associated with traffic operation, road infrastructure should not be ignored, as it involves high consumption of energy and materials during a long lifetime. The aim of my research was to contribute to improved road infrastructure planning by developing methods and models to include a life cycle perspective. In order to reach the aim, GHG emissions and energy use at different life cycle stages of road infrastructure were assessed in three case studies using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). These case studies were also used for development of methodology for LCA of road infrastructure. I have also investigated the coupling of LCA with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the possibility to integrate LCA into Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The results of the first case study indicated that operation of the tunnel (mainly, lighting and ventilation) has the largest contribution in terms of energy use and GHG emissions throughout its life cycle. The second case study identified the main hotspots and compared two methods for asphalt recycling and asphalt reuse. The results of the third case study indicated that due to the dominant contribution <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> to the total impact of the road transport system, the difference in road length plays a major role in choice of road alternatives during early planning of road infrastructure. However, infrastructure should not be neglected, especially in the case of similar lengths of road alternatives, for roads with <b>low</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> or when they include bridges or tunnels. This thesis contributed in terms of foreground and background data collection for further LCA studies of road infrastructure. Preliminary Bill of Quantities (BOQ) was identified and used as a source for site-specific data collection. A new approach was developed and tested for using geological data in a GIS environment as a data source on earthworks for LCA. Moreover, this thesis demonstrated three possible ways for integrating LCA in early stages of road infrastructure planning. QC 20160329 </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{expansion}} of global air travel and seaborne trade overcomes geographic barriers to insect disease vectors, {{enabling them to}} move great distances in short periods of time. Here we apply a coupled human-environment framework to describe the historical spread of Aedes albopictus, a competent mosquito vector of 22 arboviruses in the laboratory. We contrast this dispersal with the relatively unchanged distribution of Anopheles gambiae and examine possible future movements of this malaria vector. We use a comprehensive database of international ship and aircraft traffic movements, combined with climatic information, to remap the global transportation network in terms of disease vector suitability and accessibility. The {{expansion of}} the range of Ae. albopictus proved to be surprisingly predictable using this combination <b>of</b> climate and <b>traffic</b> data. Traffic volumes were more than twice as high on shipping routes running from the historical distribution of Ae. albopictus to ports where it has established in comparison with routes to climatically similar ports where it has yet to invade. In contrast, An. gambiae has rarely spread from Africa, which we suggest is partly due to the <b>low</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> sea <b>traffic</b> from the continent and, until very recently, a European destination for most flights...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Structural {{analysis}} of flexible pavements {{has been and}} still is currently performed using multi-layer elastic theory. However, for thinly surfaced pavements subjected to <b>low</b> to medium <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffics,</b> the importance <b>of</b> non-linear stress-strain behavior of unbound granular materials (UGM) {{requires the use of}} more sophisticated numerical models for structural design and performance of such pavements. In the present work, nonlinear unbound aggregates constitutive model is implemented within an axi-symmetric finite element code developed to simulate the nonlinear behavior of pavement structures including two local aggregates of different mineralogical nature, typically used in Algerian pavements. The performance of the mechanical model is examined about its capability of representing adequately, under various conditions, the granular material non-linearity in pavement analysis. In addition, deflection data collected by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) are incorporated into the analysis in order to assess the sensitivity of critical pavement design criteria and pavement design life to the constitutive model. Finally, conclusions of engineering significance are formulated. Keywords—Nonlinear resilient behavior, unbound granular materials, RLT test results, FWD backcalculations, finite element simulations, pavement response and performance. I...|$|R
