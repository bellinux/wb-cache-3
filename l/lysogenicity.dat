40|$|Using the bacteriophages {{and their}} {{propagating}} strains shown in Table 1, <b>lysogenicities</b> of the strains, sensitivities of the strains to the phages and sensitivities of phage resistant mutants to the phages were tested to clarify specificities of the phages. Growth inhibition of the strains with low reproducibilities were observed by spotting the culture filtrates of the strains (Table 2). Applying plaque assay method, <b>lysogenicities</b> {{were found in}} 20 combinations (Table 3). Differences between two methods {{may be caused by}} different induction rates by the time and also by pyocine activities when undiluted filtrates were spotted. From these results, {{it can be said that}} there is no misreading caused by lysogenic phages in the stocks of typing phages when 1 - 3 × 10 ^ 6 PFU/ml solutions were applied. In addition, frequent host-induced modifications were observed among lysogenic phages originated from the same culture filtrate grown on different hosts (Table 4). Sensitivities of the propagating strains to typing phages were shown in Tables 5 and 6. The same host range between the two phages was not seen in each method except between phages 44 and 1214 in the method of spotting 10 ^ 9 PFU/ml. This result shows specificity of each phage, and possibility to select two out of four non-lysogenic strains for propagating 12 phages. Forty-nine kinds of phage resistant mutants were isolated from 11 strains except GN 3405, and a total of 410 mutants were tested for sensitivity to the phages (Table 7 - 13). Thirteen cases gained the sensitivity to originally insensitive phages and 16 cases lost the sensitivities to all phages in almost all strains. Six kinds of phage 119 X resistant mutants originally not sensitive to phage 21 retained the sensitivities to the other phages and two kinds lost also sensitivity to phage 21, but there was no phage 21 resistant mutant isolated. This result indicates that phage 119 X is specific to the other phages but there is some relation between phages 119 X and 21. Table 14 summarised cross-resistances between two kinds of phage resistant mutants. Cross-resistance was always observed between phages 7 and 352, 7 and M 4, M 4 and E 79, 1214 and M 4, E 79 and M 4, and M 4 and C 11, whereas no cross-resistances were found between 7 and 1214 or F 8, 352 and 44, 1214, F 8, E 79 or C 11, F 8 and M 4, 21 and C 188, 119 X and eight kinds of phages. Finally, the similarity indexes of the lytic spectra of two phages on 410 mutants show the correlation between phages 7 and 352, 44 and 1214, F 8 and E 79 which support the typing method of Sakamoto et al.

Many gram-posi-tive bacteria, including mycobacteria and streptomycetes, were sensitive to the anti-bacterial activity. Streptococcus mutans is of interest in oral microbiology because strains of S mutans can initiate dental plaque and carious lesions in experimental animals fed a high sucrose diet.

40|$|<b>Lysogenicity</b> was {{examined}} of 169 strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci {{which had been}} isolated from bovine milk samples. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Out of the 169 strains, 74 (43. 8 %) were proven to be phage carriers and 121 were susceptible {{to any of the}} phages. The lysogenic strains were detected with almost equal frequency from both of two groups of which the one consisted of phage-typable strains and the other of untypable ones. 2. The greater part of the carriers released phages which attack strains of types III and IV; about a half of the remaining part carried phages which were active on strains quite resistant to the phages of the International Series. 3. It was clearly recognized that more than a half of the phage-carrying milk strains, especially those attacking type IV cultures, were lysogenic toward none of the propagating strains of the International phages. 4. No significant correlation was observed in phage types between lysogenic strains and their indicators. 5. It was concluded that <b>lysogenicity</b> is not an important factor in an acquired phage resistance. 6. It was suggested in this paper that the phages carried by the lysogenic milk strains might be available for the typing of staphylococcal strains isolated from milk samples.

40|$|That {{bacterial}} cultures can be chronically infected with viruses {{has been recognized}} {{almost as long as}} the bacteriophage itself has been known. <b>Lysogenicity,</b> as this host-parasite relationship is commonly called, has been observed with almost every bacterial species in which virus infection has been studied. Two instances will serve {{to call attention to the}} fact that infection of the bacterial cell is associated with, if, indeed, it does not cause, important changes in the host. These changes may well have significant impacts upon man, for, following Smith and Jordan's " early observation that all of the field cultures of C. diphtheriae which they examined carried bacteriophage, Freeman ' and Freeman and Morse 7 have found that the ability of this organism to produce toxin is always accompanied by infection of the bacterial cell by phage, and that when the cell loses its virus, it also loses its toxigenic power. This relation is probably one example of a broader phenomenon described by Zinder and Lederberg,'l a phenomenon, termed "transduction, " in which it has been shown that infection of one strain of an organism with phage from another lysogenic strain is associated with a transfer of genetic characteristics, and the transferring agent seems to be identical with the virus. These two citations should suffice to suggest that the phenomenon of <b>lysogenicity</b> may have far-reaching implications. While both of these examples have been drawn from the bacteria, the study of the lysogenic process itself has been most profitable with the sporeforming bacilli, and much of the attention has been directed towards B. megatherium.

40|$|In a {{previous}} report (Groman, 1953 a) {{it was concluded}} that toxigenic Corynebacterium diph-theriae which are recovered following exposure of a nontoxigenic strain to specific bacteriophage result from a direct conversion to toxigenicity' rather than from selection of toxigenic mutants. This conclusion was supported and strengthened by the work of Barksdale and Pappenheimer (1954) in their study of the same phage-host system. It has been proposed as a working hypothesis (Groman, 1953 a) that conversion to toxigenicity is a direct consequence of the establishment of the lysogenic state. This proposal was based primarily on the one-to-one relationship existing between toxigenicity and <b>lysogenicity</b> under all conditions including those in which selection by phage was inoperative. This fact, together with the stability of the converting principle in the presence of desoxy-ribonuclease (Groman, 1953 b), made it appear unlikely that a single principle acting inde-pendently of phage was involved in the con-version process.

40|$|SUMMARY: Cultures {{of strain}} W of Bacillus cereus {{sometimes}} contained a phage, Wa, which could form plaques on strain W itself. Phage W a {{was found to}} be a virulent mutant of a temperate phage, Wp, with which strain W was lysogenic. Anot,her non-lysogenizing mutant, Wy, was also isolated which, unlike a, did not form plaques on strain W. The genetic determinants of a, p and y are probably allelic. Neither phage y nor phage p formed plaques on bacterial strains lysogenic with p, but these strains were not completely immune, even to the temperate phage. This finding shows that <b>lysogenicity</b> does not invariably confer complete immunity to the carried phage. The colonial appearance of a strain was altered after lysogenization in a way suggesting that the alteration was due to its incomplete immunity to the tem-perate phage produced during growth. Lysogenic strains of bacteria are usually immune to the phage they produce and the immunity is conferred on them by the prophage (Lwoff, 1953; Bertani, 1958).

40|$|SUMMARY: Further {{experimental}} evidence is described {{to support the}} concept that bacterial viruses exert a controlling effect on bacterial variation and evolution. A number of strains of diphtheria bacilli, both mitis and gravis, {{have been found to}} be carrying viruses capable of converting a susceptible avirulent diphtheria strain to full virulence and toxigenicity. The virus-resistant strains thus converted to viru-lence retain this property when subcultured and the change can be effected in uivo as well as in uitro. The mechanism of virulence transfer has been investigated, and it appears that this virus-controlled conversion to virulence cannot be explained on the basis of the selection of virulent mutants already present in the avirulent culture. Also <b>lysogenicity</b> in a diphtheria strain does not itself imply virulence, since some viruses which attack the avirulent strain give rise to resistant cultures which are lysogenic and carry the infecting virus but they remain avirulent and non-toxigenic. It remains possible that the infecting virus transfers genetic properties such as virulence from the original virulent host bacterium to the infected strain. Selection by the infecting virus is also involved, and when a bacterial strain becomes infecte...|$|E

Preincubation of strain 8325 - 4 with culture filtrates from a competent strain can induce competence, but rabbit anti-P 11 serum can neutralize the competence factor. Superinfection of competent strain 8325 - 4 (P 11) with phage P 11 at high multiplicities increases the transfection frequency. Uptake of deoxyribonucleic acid by competent cells is dependent on calcium ion concentration, pH, and temperature. Inhibition of energy metabolism or protein synthesis before and during incubation with deoxyribonucleic acid affects the binding and uptake. The ability to develop competence during bacterial growth differs between the wild-type strain (8325 N) and a nuclease-deficient mutant (8325 N nuc).

The transduction of the CMr character with the lysate was consistently accompanied by lysogenization with the phage used for transduction. This lysate exhibits no beneficial effect with normal P 1, and no effect is produced by decreasing the multiplicity of infection. A single infection with the phage allows the formation of plaques as well as CMr lysogenic cells {{at the center of the}} plaque. Both the transducing and plaque-forming activities of the lysate were lost by neutralization with anti-P 1 phage serum, and its absorption to the host bacteria was enhanced by the addition of Ca++.
