5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|Kinetic {{measurements}} taken {{under various}} solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often shed <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> chemical mechanism, as they reveal the rate-determining step or intermediates in the reaction. For example, {{the breaking of}} a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom is a common rate-determining step. Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium, its stable isotope. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary kinetic isotope effect, which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen. It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as 13C/12C and 18O/16O, but these effects are more subtle.|$|E
5|$|Some doubt {{exists as}} to whether the current {{classification}} accurately represents relationships within the Banksia spinulosa complex. B.spinulosa var.collina is a form of inland gorges and tablelands in central Queensland, but is a coastal plant on the New South Wales central and north coast. B.spinulosa var.spinulosa, on the other hand, is coastal in central Queensland and in New South Wales south of Sydney. Similarly, B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii is widely separated between New South Wales and Victorian forms (where the longer leaved form was originally called B.prionophylla by Meissner). Notably both B.spinulosa var.spinulosa and B.spinulosa var.collina in northern Queensland have old spikes bare as opposed to them having persistent old flower parts in New South Wales and Victoria. Mast listed B.spinulosa var.collina and B.spinulosa var.neoanglica as sister clades in 1998, with B.spinulosa var.spinulosa and B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii flanking these. Alex George also reports that the taxon should be reviewed. A molecular study with specimens of each subspecies from the three mainland eastern states they occur would shed <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> matter.|$|E

25|$|The {{movements}} of pittas are poorly known and notoriously difficult to study.

Only four species of pitta are fully or mostly migratory, all in the genus Pitta, the Indian pitta, African pitta, fairy pitta and blue-winged pitta. In addition to these four the northern subspecies of the hooded pitta (cucullata) is a full migrant. Other species make smaller or more local, and poorly understood, movements across small parts of their range, for example the noisy pitta of Australia. The migration of pittas is apparently nocturnal, and pittas migrate in small loose flocks which use the same resting and foraging sites each year.|$|E
500|$|Monkey lemurs, or baboon lemurs, share {{similarities}} with macaques, {{although they}} have also been compared to baboons. [...] Members of the family Archaeolemuridae, {{they were the most}} terrestrial of the lemurs, with short, robust forelimbs and relatively flat digits. [...] Although they {{spent a lot of time}} on the ground, they were only semi-terrestrial, spending time in trees to feed and sleep. They were heavy-bodied and ranged in size from approximately [...] They had relatively good day vision and large brains compared with other lemurs. [...] Their robust jaws and specialized teeth suggest a diet of hard objects, such as nuts and seeds, yet other evidence, including fecal pellets, suggests they may have had a more varied diet, including leaves, fruit, and animal matter (omnivory). [...] Dental wear analysis has shed some <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> dietary mystery, suggesting that monkey lemurs had a more eclectic diet, while using tough seeds as a fall-back food item. [...] Within the family, the genus Archaeolemur was the most widespread in distribution, resulting in hundreds of subfossil specimens, and may have been one of the last subfossil lemurs to die out.|$|E
500|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} is a diurnal, arboreal, and secretive species of snake, and {{it tends to}} spend most of its time above the ground in {{relatively}} dense brush, where it is well camouflaged. This species is not commonly found on land unless motivated by thirst, prey, or the need to bask in the sun (thermoregulation). It is an alert, nervous, excellent climber and extremely agile snake. It sleeps at night in a tree coiled up in leafy clumps rather than seeking a tree hollow (although sometimes found in them). In a study of the movement patterns of two adult specimens of this species over a 27-day period, the researcher found that their activity range areas to be very low, comparable to other predators who ambush prey rather than actively hunt them. This is in contrast to most elapid species, including other mambas, who tend to actively hunt or forage for prey. The study's preliminary evidence sheds some <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> species' method of hunting prey and suggests that it may be an ambush predator due to the sit-and-wait behavior displayed. However, this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species. A specimen systematically hunting a sleeping bat was observed by William York. There {{is no evidence that the}} eastern green mamba migrates; in fact, this species is thought to be relatively sedentary. It can remain in the same location for days at a time, apparently moving most commonly to find food or mates. On average, individuals of this species move only about [...] per day. Unlike its much larger cousin the black mamba, this mamba is more shy and not as aggressive or fearsome. It will avoid confrontation with humans or any other potential predators when possible, and will rather rely on its camouflage, or flee, than alert a potential threat of its presence. They are fast snakes, capable of moving 7mph. They don't always strike, but under continuous harassment and provocation and especially if cornered, they may suddenly strike repeatedly in quick succession, often leading to severe envenomation.|$|E

2500|$|After being apprised of the {{situation}} in Bulgaria and of the Turkish positions in Europe, Amadeus led his fleet into the Dardanelles, where it was joined by a flotilla under Francesco I Gattilusio, Prince of Lesbos, and son-in-law of the trapped emperor. They may also have been met by a detachment of the Byzantine army under the Patriarch of Constantinople, as the Savoyard chronicles record. The combined crusader fleet launched an attack on Gelibolu (Gallipoli), the second city of the European Turks, on 22 August. While the army began the siege with an assault on the walls, during the night the Turks abandoned the city and in the morning the inhabitants opened the gates to the crusaders. The sources shed limited <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> brief episode. It is known from the count's register that both town and citadel were in Savoyard hands by 26 August, and garrisons and commanders were appointed for each—Giacomo di Luserna for the city and Aimone Michaele for the citadel, with responsibility for not just defending Gelibolu but also for guarding the entrance to the straits. On 27 August a messenger was sent westward with news of the count's [...] "first and most famous victory against the heathen Turks".|$|E
2500|$|There {{is a large}} debate {{regarding}} {{whether or}} not bilingualism is truly beneficial to children. Parents of children often view learning a second language throughout {{elementary and high school}} education beneficial to the child. Another perspective dictates that the second language just confuses the child and prevents them from mastering their primary language. Studies have shown that American bilingual children have greater cognitive flexibility, better perceptual skills and tend to be divergent thinkers than monolingual {{children between the ages of}} five to ten. [...] Better executive functioning skills are likely because bilingual children have to choose one language to speak while actively suppressing the other. This builds stronger selective attention and cognitive flexibility because these skills are being exercised more. In addition, bilingual children have a better understanding of universal language concepts, such as grammar, because these concepts are applied in multiple languages. However, studies comparing Swedish-Finnish bilingual children and Swedish monolingual children between the ages of five to seven have also shown that the bilingual children have a smaller vocabulary than monolingual children. In another study throughout America, elementary school English-monolingual children performed better in mathematics and reading activities than their non-English-dominant bilingual and non-English monolingual peers from kindergarten to grade five. Learning two languages simultaneously can be beneficial or a hindrance to a child's language and intellectual development. [...] Further research is necessary to continue to shed <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> debate.|$|E
