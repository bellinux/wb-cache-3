In his first at-bat, Koby {{hit a home run}} off his father. In his next at-bat, Roger threw an inside pitch that almost hit Koby. Koby <b>laughed</b> <b>in</b> an interview after the game about the incident.|$|E
500|$|During {{the initial}} {{storyboard}} pitch to Frederator Studios, Ward brought a guitar {{and played the}} episode's theme song. Frederator's CEO Fred Seibert was initially disinclined to make the short, feeling {{it was too much}} of a [...] "student film" [...] and without much commercial appeal. Longtime colleagues, development executive Homan and production executive Kevin Kolde, convinced him otherwise, arguing that Seibert had actually <b>laughed</b> <b>in</b> the presentation, something that he did not often do. Frederator approved the pitch, and [...] "Adventure Time" [...] soon went into production.|$|E
500|$|Although President Bush shook Colbert's hand {{after his}} presentation, several of Bush's aides and {{supporters}} walked out during Colbert's speech, and one former aide {{commented that the}} President had [...] "that look that he's ready to blow". Colbert recalled that [...] "not {{a lot of people}} <b>laughed</b> <b>in</b> the front row" [...] during the speech, and that [...] "when it was over, no one was even making eye contact with me ... no one is talking to me in the whole damn room"; only Scalia came to him afterward, praising Colbert's imitation of a gesture the justice had recently been photographed making.|$|E

500|$|Orr is {{also well}} known for his {{charitable}} works, although he kept mention of {{them out of the}} press. Former Eagle-Tribune writer Russ Conway noted of one occasion when Orr and Conway visited Boston Children's Hospital, with a box of programs, pennants, pucks, pictures and Boston memorabilia: [...] "We went from room to room, Orr popping in, unannounced to visit the kids. Some couldn't believe their eyes; sick as they were, they <b>laughed</b> <b>in</b> astonishment and delight. Bobby Orr! He talked and joked with every one of them, asking names, rubbing heads, giving everybody a little present from the box, leaving a stick, autographing everything in sight." [...] Orr made Conway promise to not print a word in the newspaper. Orr was involved in numerous charity fund raisers. In 1980, Orr was awarded the Multiple Sclerosis Silver Hope Chest Award by the Multiple Sclerosis Society for his [...] "numerous and unselfish contributions to society".|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times film critic, Charles Champlin, {{explained}} that the Director's Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival [...] "came into being {{as one of the}} consequences of the political turmoil that aborted the festival in 1968. It is designed to make the festival a less than totally establishment affair and it offers Third World, independent and frequently angry films on social themes." [...] He further {{explained that}} Carradine's Americana was [...] "an ideal selection for the fortnight." [...] In fact, the film won the People's Choice Award there in 1981. Film columnist Christopher Hicks stated that Americana was also warmly received at the 1981 United States Film and Video Festival in Park City, Utah. [...] This was the third of such events which would later become known as the Sundance Film Festival. Carradine said of the audience's reaction to the film, [...] "Well, they <b>laughed</b> <b>in</b> all the right places, and they applauded at the end, so I guess it went alright." [...] He also said, [...] "Americana swept the festival and I came very close to making a distribution deal with Warner Brothers." [...] However, the Associated Press described Americanas reception in Utah as [...] "quiet".|$|E
500|$|... "The Variable" [...] was the {{hundredth}} {{episode of the}} show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have <b>laughed</b> <b>in</b> my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Predicates {{are placed}} on the left outside of brackets, whereas the predicate's {{arguments}} are placed inside the brackets. One acknowledges the valency of predicates, whereby a given predicate can be avalent (not shown), monovalent (<b>laughed</b> <b>in</b> the first sentence), divalent (helped in the second sentence), or trivalent (gave in the third sentence). These types of representations are analogous to formal semantic analyses, where one {{is concerned with the}} proper account of scope facts of quantifiers and logical operators. Concerning basic sentence structure, however, these representations suggest above all that verbs are predicates and the noun phrases that they appear with are their arguments. On this understanding of the sentence, the binary division of the clause into a subject NP and a predicate VP is hardly possible. Instead, the verb is the predicate, and the noun phrases are its arguments.|$|E
2500|$|While {{still in}} high school in Ukiah, California, Davey Havok (vocals), Mark Stopholese (guitar) and Vic Chalker (bass) formed a band called AFI in November 1991. While the meaning of the initialism [...] "AFI" [...] {{currently}} stems from the full title [...] "A Fire Inside," [...] band members have stated that the name formerly originated from the titles [...] "Asking for It" [...] and [...] "Anthems for Insubordinates." [...] At the time, the band {{did not know how to}} play any instruments. Stopholese suggested his friend, Adam Carson, who had a drum kit join the band. Stopholese learned guitar and Chalker learned bass, but Chalker was soon replaced by Geoff Kresge and AFI made its first EP in recording Dork (1993) with the now defunct band Loose Change, which included future AFI guitarist Jade Puget. AFI's beginnings were somewhat inauspicious, as Davey Havok <b>laughed</b> <b>in</b> a 1999 interview, [...] "We were amazed that we even got our shit together enough to put out a split 7-inch with Jade's band at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Raimi and Tapert {{ran into}} {{conflicts}} with the studio during post-production. The director {{had a problem with}} the editor that the studio assigned him and eight weeks into assembling the rough cut, he was not following Raimi's storyboards. The editor had a nervous breakdown and left. Early preview screenings did not go well as people <b>laughed</b> <b>in</b> the wrong places and complained about a lack of a happy ending. Universal told Raimi that some people rated Darkman the worst film they had ever seen. According to executives, the film was one of the worst-scoring pictures in Universal's history. Then, two preview screenings, one with Danny Elfman's score, went well. Tapert remembers, [...] "the experience on Darkman was very difficult for Sam and me; it isn't the picture we thought it should be, based on the footage we shot and all that. The studio got nervous about some kind of wild things in it, and made us take them out, which was unfortunate." [...] However, Raimi did like the [...] "brilliant" [...] marketing campaign that the studio came up with, releasing posters in advance with a silhouette of the main character and the question, [...] "Who is Darkman?" [...] According to the director, [...] "the marketing made the film a money-maker." ...|$|E
