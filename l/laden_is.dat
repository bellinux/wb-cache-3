Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E

[...] He called the killing of bin Laden [...] "a tremendous step forward in attaining justice for the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans who were murdered on September 11, 2001." [...] Commenting on the legality under international law, University of Michigan Law Professor Steven Ratner said, [...] "A lot of it depends on whether you believe Osama bin <b>Laden</b> <b>is</b> a combatant in a war or a suspect in a mass murder."

500|$|The final part {{addresses}} the actual rise of al-Qaeda. Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and Zawahiri {{had little or}} no popular support, let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists, and were dependent on independent operatives to carry out their new call for jihad. However, the film argues that in order to prosecute bin Laden in absentia for the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, U.S. prosecutors had to prove that he is the head of a criminal organisation responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin Laden, Jamal al-Fadl, and pay him to testify that bin <b>Laden</b> <b>is</b> the head of a massive terrorist organisation called [...] "al-Qaeda". With the September 11 attacks, neoconservatives in the new Republican administration of George W. Bush use this invented concept of an organisation to justify another crusade against a new enemy, culminating in the launch of the War on Terror.|$|E
