500|$|While Deangelo gets {{annoyed with}} Jim and Pam, {{he loves the}} antics of Andy, who has resorted to {{physical}} comedy when his jokes fall flat, {{getting to the point}} where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that [...] "this is my life now". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

In {{an interview with the}} Manchester Evening News, Graham states that Sam is now in the afterlife, where time lasts an eternity compared to the suicide's duration of a few seconds: [...] "The truth is, when I wrote it, what I was trying to say is that he's died, and that for however long that last second of <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be, it will stretch out for an age, as an eternity for him.

His first introduction to music was when Donald Swann attended his primary school to play to all the pupils after the school's music teacher died.

6000|$|The Webbites do {{not deny}} the broad facts of the case. Our present electoral system, with our big modern {{constituencies}} of thousands of voters, leads to huge turnovers of political power with a relatively small shifting of public opinion. It makes a mock of public opinion by caricature, and Parliament becomes the distorting mirror of the nation. Under some loud false issue a few score of thousands of votes turn over, and in goes this party or that with a big sham majority. This the Webbites admit. But they applaud it. It gives us, they say, [...] "a strong Government." [...] Public opinion, the intelligent man outside the House, is ruled out of the game. He has no power of intervention at all. The artful little Fabian politicians rub their hands and say, [...] "Now {{we can get to}} work with the wires! No one can stop us." [...] And when the public complains of the results, there is always the repartee, [...] "You elected them." [...] But the Fabian psychology is the psychology of a very small group of pedants who believe that fair ends may be reached by foul means. It is much easier and more natural to serve foul ends by foul means. In practice it is not tricky benevolence but tricky bargaining among the interests that will secure control of the political wires. That is a bad enough state of affairs in ordinary times, but in times of tragic necessity like the present men will not be mocked in this way. <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be very intense in the years ahead of us. If we go right on to another caricature Parliament, with perhaps half a hundred leading men in it and the rest hacks and nobodies, the baffled and discontented outsiders in the streets may presently be driven to rioting and the throwing of bombs. Unless, indeed, the insurrection of the outsiders takes a still graver form, and the Press, which has ceased entirely to be a Party Press in Great Britain, helps some adventurous Prime Minister to flout and set aside the lower House altogether. There is neither much moral nor much physical force behind the House of Commons at the present time.|$|E
