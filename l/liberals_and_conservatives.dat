Sanderson, diminished the CCF's initially favourable position: the September 1943 Gallup poll showed the CCF leading nationally with 29 percent support, with the <b>Liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>Conservatives</b> {{tied for second}} place at 28 percent. By April 1945, the CCF was down to 20 percent nationally, and on election day it received only 16 percent.|$|E
5|$|After {{the control}} of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba {{attained}} full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province {{carved out of the}} Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (<b>Liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>Conservatives).</b> The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.|$|E

5|$|Cross was a Liberal, {{and fast}} {{established}} himself {{was one of}} the party's leading Edmonton lights. By some assessments, he was the second most influential Liberal in the city after Frank Oliver, the owner of the Edmonton Bulletin and local Member of Parliament. Once {{the decision was made to}} create the province of Alberta, the question emerged of who would govern it: the Northwest Territories were governed on a non-partisan basis by Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, who was a Conservative in federal politics. Some Liberals, such as Peter Talbot, were amenable to Haultain's becoming the first Premier of Alberta, either as the head of a non-partisan government or one formed by a coalition of <b>Liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>Conservatives.</b> Cross was not among them.|$|E

Overall the parties managed to gain in vote percentage that went to the Labor candidate in 1905. The Conservatives picked up one seat and the Liberal incumbent held his. The Socialist candidate was not much of a factor, but Howell kept the main parties from gaining a clear majority in the popular vote.|$|E

40|$|In the {{following}} thesis I examine the possible evolutionary significance of behavioural differences associated with <b>liberal</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservative</b> ideological orientations. In investigating the evolutionary {{significance of these}} two orientations I have two primary research questions. First, how do <b>liberal</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservative</b> oriented individuals differ in their responses to the same socio-environmental stimuli? Second, do differences in their responses to socio-environmental stimuli represent alternative behavioural strategies for social interaction, specifically adaptive strategies to maximize returns from social interactions? To answer these research questions I evaluate how trust <b>and</b> cooperation among <b>liberal</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservative</b> oriented individuals are affected by conditions of social change and inequality. Previous research finds that attitudes and behaviours consistent with the tolerance or intolerance of social change and inequality are strong predictors of ideological orientation across a liberal-conservative scale. Based on a synthesis of behavioural research I construct two theoretical frameworks {{to account for the}} adaptive utility associated with a sensitivity to social change and inequality; 1) The Group Reciprocity Hypothesis, and 2) The Social Risk Hypothesis. I test these frameworks using an experimental research design. I predict that, if <b>liberal</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservative</b> orientations are reflective of alternative adaptive strategies to maximize returns from social interaction, then the willingness of <b>liberal</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservative</b> individuals to participate in a social interaction should be differentially affected by conditions related to social change and inequality. </p...|$|R
25|$|The National Question is {{the debate}} {{regarding}} {{the future of}} Quebec {{and the status of}} it as a province of Canada. Political parties are organized along ideologies that favor independence from Canada (sovereigntist or separatist) and various degrees of autonomy within Canada (federalists). Social democrats, <b>liberals,</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> are therefore present in most major parties, creating internal tensions.|$|E
25|$|The agrarian revolt and anti-Catholic {{sentiment}} in 1894, {{exemplified by the}} rise of the Patrons of Industry and the Protestant Protective Association, was deftly handled by the <b>Liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>Conservatives</b> declining to nominate a full bank of candidates in that election and fielding candidates that were nominated by these protest groups. The Patrons and PPA ceased to exist by 1898.|$|E
