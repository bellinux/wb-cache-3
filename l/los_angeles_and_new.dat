5|$|In 1959, {{longtime}} NFL commissioner Bert Bell {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} while attending an Eagles/Steelers game at Franklin Field. That same year, Dallas businessman Lamar Hunt led the formation of the rival American Football League, the fourth such league to bear that name, with war hero and former South Dakota Governor Joe Foss as its Commissioner. Unlike the earlier rival leagues, and bolstered by television exposure, the AFL posed a significant threat to NFL dominance of the professional football world. With the exception of <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York, the AFL avoided placing teams in markets where they directly competed with established NFL franchises. In 1960, the AFL began play with eight teams and a double round-robin schedule of fourteen games. New NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle took office the same year.|$|E

Special release parties were organized in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York, featuring the artists who recorded songs for the project.|$|E
5|$|The Coast Starlight began {{operating}} with Superliners in January 1981. The Sunset Limited, a long-distance train {{running along the}} southern border of the United States between <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Orleans, gained them in February, resulting in a commendation from the Texas State Legislature. The Pioneer gained Superliner coaches on April 26. The Eagle, an overnight train between San Antonio and Chicago, began carrying Superliners in October on those days it connected with the Sunset Limited in San Antonio. Superliner assignments became permanent in the 1990s. Amtrak estimated that reequipping a train with Superliners boosted ridership on it by 25%. The last car of the order, a sleeper delivered in July 1981, was also the last car ever built by Pullman, and was {{named in honor of}} the company's founder, George Mortimer Pullman.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{candidates}} {{to host the}} program included Soupy Sales, host of children's variety shows in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian Dana Carvey. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for Saturday Night Live, {{the search for a}} host continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York. First attending a tryout in lieu of a friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television warm-up comedian Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition. Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host Double Dare. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a commercial break was more professional and he was hired for the position {{in the first week of}} September 1986. Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly.|$|E
