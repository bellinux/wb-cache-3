5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, which is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms {{do not want to}} mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E
5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E

The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand.

5|$|The mouse {{reference}} genome has {{at least}} 21 distinct Mup genes (with open reading frames), and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with reading frames disrupted by a nonsense mutation or an incomplete gene duplication). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups, and 15 central Class B Mups. The central Class B Mup gene cluster formed {{through a number of}} sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means {{they are likely to be}} unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more different from each other and are therefore <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> stable, older genes but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster is one of the few parts of the mouse whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.|$|E

25|$|Allergic {{diseases}} are strongly familial: identical twins {{are likely to}} have the same allergic diseases about 70% of the time; the same allergy occurs about 40% of the time in non-identical twins. Allergic parents {{are more likely to have}} allergic children, and those children's allergies are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> severe than those in children of non-allergic parents. Some allergies, however, are not consistent along genealogies; parents who are allergic to peanuts may have children who are allergic to ragweed. It seems that the likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and related to an irregularity in the immune system, but the specific allergen is not.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, {{researchers}} at the University of California, Riverside, suggested that the brown widow spider, newly established in Southern California, {{may in fact be}} displacing black widow spiders from the region, competing and/or fighting for territory. While certainly not definitive, this evidence does suggest that the brown widow is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> hostile and aggressive towards its relative, the black widow, than the black widow is towards it. If that proves to be true, humans may be positively affected because, over time, brown widows will aggressively eradicate and replace the black widows from the areas they inhabit, and since brown widows are less venomous than black widows, this may have the effect of making those areas safer.|$|E

25|$|Dr. David C. Lane {{proposes a}} {{checklist}} consisting of seven points to assess gurus in his book, Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical. One of his points is that spiritual teachers should have {{high standards of}} moral conduct and that followers of gurus should interpret {{the behavior of a}} spiritual teacher by following Ockham's razor and by using common sense, and, should not naively use mystical explanations unnecessarily to explain immoral behavior. Another point Lane makes is that the bigger the claim a guru makes, such as the claim to be God, the bigger the chance is that the guru is unreliable. Dr. Lane's fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage.|$|E
25|$|As {{would be}} expected, REBT argues that mental {{wellness}} {{and mental health}} {{to a large degree}} results from an adequate amount of self-helping, flexible, logico-empirical ways of thinking, emoting and behaving. When a perceived undesired and stressful activating event occurs, and the individual is interpreting, evaluating and reacting to the situation rationally and self-helpingly, then the resulting consequence is, according to REBT, <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> healthy, constructive and functional. This does not by any means mean that a relatively un-disturbed person never experiences negative feelings, but REBT does hope to keep debilitating and un-healthy emotions and subsequent self-defeating behavior to a minimum. To do this, REBT generally promotes a flexible, un-dogmatic, self-helping and efficient belief system and constructive life philosophy about adversities and human desires and preferences.|$|E
25|$|Because swarm-founding colonies {{can contain}} {{more than one}} {{egg-laying}} queen, they tend to challenge the kin selection theory and typically do not meet Hamilton’s rule of haplodiploid species mentioned in the introduction. In comparison to other swarm-founding species, these theories are challenged further in R. romandi. R. romandi colonies are extremely large, and can have an average of up to 400 queens at any one time. The average for other swarm-founding species is only around 20 queens. Having such {{a large number of}} queens decreases the genetic relatedness within the nest. Workers in R. romandi have a genetic relatedness of only 0.16, and queens have a genetic relatedness of only 0.34. The next lowest genetic relatedness among a swarm founding species is found in Polybia emaciata 's 0.24 among workers and 0.55 among queens. These numbers indicate a large deviation from Hamilton’s ¾ rule. Independent-founding species, with fewer queens, are much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> genetically related.|$|E
