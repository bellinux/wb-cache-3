Leaked documents suggested that the new console would include an improved Kinect sensor, cloud access to games and media, integration with phone and tablet devices, and technology to provide players heads-up displays on glasses worn by the player, codenamed [...] "Fortaleza"; Microsoft did not comment on these reported features. Leaked design documents also suggested that Microsoft was seeking to eliminate the ability to play used games, though Microsoft later clarified it was still reviewing the design and were [...] "thinking about what is next and how we can push the boundaries of technology <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> with Kinect", but did not comment on the validity of the information.|$|E

500|$|With {{temperatures}} reaching 122° on {{the artificial}} turf at Texas Stadium, the Giants played the Dallas Cowboys on September 16. The Giants dominated {{from the outset}} and used backup players heavily throughout the game. Lawrence Taylor batted a Troy Aikman pass high into the air, which he caught and returned for a touchdown. The Giants' defense held the Cowboys to 20 rushing yards and 156yards of total offense, while the Giants' offense gained 369 yards. The Cowboys totaled only nine first downs, averaged 1.8yards per rush and were dominated in time of possession, 41:40 to 18:20. Despite the 28–7 victory, Giants center Bart Oates still felt the offense could improve its play: [...] "e missed a lot of assignments. We rushed the ball O.K., but not <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> against Buffalo in preseason. Phil was pressured some. There were plenty of things we didn't do." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this, the duo {{have not}} staged a {{full-scale}} tour or performed shows since 2010.

[...] "I know that audiences {{all over the world}} like Simon and Garfunkel. I'm with them. But I don't think Paul Simon's with them," [...] he remarked. In a 2016 interview with NPR's David Greene, when asked about the possibility of reuniting, Simon stated; [...] "Well, I don't think most people do [...] The fact is, is, <b>like,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> do two big reunions, and we're done. There's nothing really much to say. You know, the music essentially stopped in 1970. [...] And, you know, I mean, quite honestly, we don't get along. So it's not like it's fun. If it was fun, I'd say, OK, sometimes we'll go out and sing old songs in harmony. That's cool. But when it's not fun, you know, and you're {{going to be in a}} tense situation, well, then I have a lot of musical areas that I like to play in. So that'll never happen again. That's that." ...|$|E

The club beat Odense BK and Standard Liège {{to reach the}} quarter-finals, with the latter {{described}} as a [...] "breathtaking performance" [...] by Graham, after winning 7–0 at the Stade Maurice Dufrasne. Arsenal defeated Torino of Italy and French representative Paris Saint-Germain to reach the 1994 European Cup Winners' Cup Final alongside Parma, staged at Copenhagen. Without top goalscorer Ian Wright and markers John Jensen and Martin Keown, Arsenal went into the final as outsiders. Although Parma began the match the strongest of both teams, Arsenal opened the scoring through a well taken volley by striker Alan Smith. Defending in numbers, the team held on to record an improbable victory and win the club's second European trophy, after a 24-year wait. After the match Graham praised his team's performance and defended his pragmatic approach; [...] "Sometimes we could go forward {{a little bit more}} and entertain a bit more, but we play to our strengths, <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> in this match. There's nothing wrong with having a very, very good defence, believe me. We've proved it, and it's a big plus." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the release}} of [...] "Flux", Bloc Party's style became even more diverse with the {{inclusion}} of electronic music. [...] "Mercury" [...] saw Bloc Party distance themselves even further from the traditional guitar band set-up by experimenting with dark electronic sounds and a brass section inspired by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The band's third album Intimacy also features synths, processed drum beats and loops, vocal manipulation, and choral arrangements. Even though the album was influenced by electronic music, the band still had not lost their feel for guitar music. For example, in an interview, Okereke said that the band was starting to miss their more traditional sound, and confirmed {{that may have been}} the way fourth album was headed. However, Tong contradicted this, stating: [...] "There's every chance we might go back to more orthodox arrangements or things that resemble a traditional band but I don't think we'll ever write songs <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> on Silent Alarm again." [...] A 2009 Vice Records mix lists the following songs Bloc Party are influenced by: Eagle Boston's [...] "Wild Wild Ost", Pylon's [...] "Working Is No Problem", Delta 5's [...] "Mind Your Own Business", John Foxx's [...] "Underpass", Prince's [...] "I Would Die 4 U" [...] (also covered live), Sonic Youth's [...] "Youth Against Fascism", Dinosaur Jr.'s [...] "Freak Scene", La Roux's [...] "Quicksand (Nightrunners Edit)", and Bruce Springsteen's [...] "57 Channels (And Nothin' On)".|$|E

[...] Harrison said: [...] "We weren't very good at telling Pete he had to go," [...] and [...] "Historically it may look <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> something nasty to Pete and it may have been that we could have handled it better." [...] Starr, on the other hand, feels he has no apology to make: [...] "I never felt sorry … I was not involved." [...] In 1968, authorised Beatles biographer Hunter Davies wrote: [...] "But for the sake of Pete's career, whatever happened to the Beatles afterward, the handling and especially the announcing of the sacking might have been done more neatly and cleanly. He could have been fixed up with a job in another group before the news was announced." [...] Over twenty years later Mark Lewisohn concluded that [...] "Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete, who had served the group unstintingly from their hapless, drummerless Silver Beatles days through three lengthy Hamburg seasons and over 200 Cavern Club performances. He had shared in the heartaches and the headaches, had controlled the Beatles' bookings before Epstein took over, and had made his home – the Casbah – their home. The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now – as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured – he was out. It was the most underhand, unfortunate and unforgivable chapter in the Beatles' rise to monumental power." ...|$|E

This was clearly demonstrated in 2002, when the band was booked to appear on UK national TV channel GMTV, where they were to play [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] before being interviewed. The producer was astounded when the band arrived at 5am (three hours early) expecting {{to set up and}} rehearse; it had been assumed they would just mime to playback. Joanne Catherall explained why on air during the interview: [...] "We simply don't sound <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> 20 years ago; it would be wrong if we used tapes, so we do everything live." ...|$|E

I found them, they are there; their job is to find their successors. So there must be this continuous renewal of talented, dedicated, honest, able people who will do things not for themselves but for their people and for their country.

He would rather read a good baseball novel than a complex statistical analysis of the game. 'I found that players are very suspicious of computers, much like the general public,' he said. 'They fear them as cold and impersonal and inhuman. I couldn't make them understand that I was still going to make my own decisions, I wasn't going to let the computer make them for me.
