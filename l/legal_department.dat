5|$|In July 1866, Willamette University's {{trustees}} {{formed a}} committee to explore {{the possibility of a}} <b>legal</b> <b>department.</b> At that time, legal education was traditionally taught as an apprenticeship in which those wishing to be lawyers would study under an existing attorney for several years before being allowed to pass the bar. Although the school did not begin a <b>legal</b> <b>department</b> in 1866, Willamette did confer a Doctor of Laws degree on Matthew P.

5|$|Hatfield's {{re-election}} {{victory for}} governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made him something of a national figure. In 1968, Hatfield was on Richard Nixon's short list for vice president, and received the strong backing of his friend, the Rev. Billy Graham. Hatfield was considered too liberal by many conservatives and Southern moderates, and Nixon chose the more centrist Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew. Hatfield would later find himself at odds with Nixon over Vietnam and other issues, including a threat by Hatfield to reduce funding for the White House's <b>legal</b> <b>department</b> in 1973 during the Watergate Scandal, after Nixon had failed to use funds appropriated for renovating dams on the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|The script {{remained}} under Columbia's shelf until {{legal issues}} {{forced them to}} withdraw. The studio was set to begin shooting a comedic send-up of Double Indemnity entitled Big Trouble. Columbia's <b>legal</b> <b>department</b> determined that the film's plot was too similar to Double Indemnity and they needed the permission of Universal Pictures, owners of the earlier film, if the film was ever to begin shooting. With Big Trouble already set to go, desperate Columbia executives phoned Universal's Frank Price to get the necessary paperwork. Price was a former Columbia executive who had been quite fond of the script for Back to the Future during his tenure there. As a result, Universal agreed to trade the Double Indemnity license {{in exchange for the}} rights to Back to the Future. Thus, the film finally had a home at Universal.|$|E

40|$|With massive trends {{affecting}} {{the manner in}} which legal services are delivered and will frame the way In-house <b>legal</b> <b>departments</b> consider the make-or-buy decision. This study explored the make-or-buy decision considering a comprehensive academic framework, utilising Transaction Cost economics, Neoclassical economics and Capabilities economics to determine the economic drivers of a concurrent sourcing choice where In-house <b>legal</b> <b>departments</b> both make-and-buy <b>legal</b> services. Mixed methodology research included 12 in-depth interviews with Chief Legal Officers/Head of Legal or Head of legal function for qualitative purposes and a questionnaire distributed to all 486 members of the Corporate Counsel Association of South resulting in 32 valid responses, to triangulate and validate the qualitative results. Both interview schedule and the questionnaire were adapted from Parmigiani's (2007) concurrent sourcing academic framework. From the results of interviews, an inherent complexity arose in the distinction between generalised and specialised legal services. The results demonstrated support for the Neoclassical and Capabilities economics, through economies of scale and scope and firm and supplier expertise, over Transaction Cost economics considerations. Institutional knowledge and the mitigation of legal risk were two exogenous factors that arose and which influence the make-or-buy decision for In-house <b>legal</b> <b>departments.</b> This offered a composite interpretation to develop a decision tree model to be considered by In-house <b>legal</b> <b>departments</b> in the make-or-buy decision. The model assists In-house <b>legal</b> <b>departments</b> to consider the choice of legal services provider {{depending on the type of}} services required, be that generalised or specialised/Internal or External legal services, resulting in value-adding legal services delivery that helps to deliver the organisations overall goals and objectives.
