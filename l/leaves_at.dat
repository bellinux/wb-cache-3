5|$|Adults are {{extremely}} mobile during the day, and find refuge in resting sites in flowers and young <b>leaves</b> <b>at</b> night and early morning. They migrate from crop to crop following flower availability. Field density can vary.

5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of <b>leaves</b> <b>at</b> {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} cacti {{fall into}} only two genera, Pereskia and Maihuenia, and are rather different, which means any description of cacti {{as a whole}} must frequently make exceptions for them. Pereskia species superficially resemble other tropical forest trees. When mature, they have woody stems that may be covered with bark and long-lasting leaves that provide the main means of photosynthesis. Their flowers may have superior ovaries (i.e., above the points of attachment of the sepals and petals), and areoles that produce further leaves. The two species of Maihuenia have small, globe-shaped bodies with prominent <b>leaves</b> <b>at</b> the top.|$|E
5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she <b>leaves</b> <b>at</b> the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 {{the island}} was visited by a {{magistrate}} P. Cloete aboard the Thetis investigating a possible murder. He was accompanied by Charles Moore, director of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and his assistant William Carron who forwarded plant specimens to Ferdinand Mueller at the botanic gardens in Melbourne who, by 1875, had catalogued and published 195 species. Also on the ship was William Fitzgerald, a surveyor, and Mr Masters from the Australian Museum. Together they surveyed the island with the findings published in 1870 when the population was listed as 35 people, their 13 houses built of split palm battens thatched {{on the roof and}} sides with palm <b>leaves.</b> <b>At</b> about this time there began a downturn of trade with the demise of the whaling industry and sometimes six or twelve months passed without a vessel calling. With the provisions rotting in the storehouses the older families lost interest in market gardening.|$|E
50|$|On weekdays {{the first}} (northbound) FrontRunner train (to the Ogden Intermodal Transit Center) leaves the Provo Station at about 4:45 am, {{with the last}} train <b>leaving</b> <b>at</b> 10:20 pm.

The chosen team member had to climb up the ladder attached {{to one of the}} legs of the tower, and then continue climbing up a rope ladder. They then had to cross one of the support beams of the tower before they could pull up their next clue, dangling in the air by a rope.|$|R

5|$|NY78 {{takes on}} its best-known name as well when it <b>leaves</b> <b>at</b> Transit Road (US20), as NY16 assumes an eastwest heading across the {{suburban}} neighborhoods of West Seneca. It crosses NY277, a major retail strip, at Union Road in the hamlet of Ebenezer. One final trumpet exit to NY400 (and by extension, the New York State Thruway) precedes its junction with Harlem Road (NY240), where county maintenance of NY16, {{and thus the}} overlap with CR572, ends. Just west of NY240, NY16 crosses the Thruway itself as it begins {{to head to the}} northwest and enter the city of Buffalo, where the route is locally maintained. Running almost due northwest through the residential neighborhoods of South Buffalo, NY16 reaches its last major junction, with US62, at Bailey Avenue just after crossing the Buffalo River. Immediately afterwards it crosses I-190 with no exit (but with northbound access) and returns to a more eastwest course through industrial areas before ending at Main Street, NY5, in the city center.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins as}} two one-way streets, Goodell Street (traveling west) and East Tupper Street (traveling east). Both {{intersect}} with NY5 (Ellicott Street) in Buffalo, {{from where they}} serve as a one-way couplet for three blocks before they merge to become the Kensington Expressway, a limited-access highway. It initially travels through dense urban areas {{by way of a}} cut, in which both roadways are separated only by a Jersey barrier. The expressway runs past the Buffalo Museum of Science, located at Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, and through the middle of Humboldt Parkway in Buffalo, where the Scajaquada Expressway (NY198) <b>leaves</b> <b>at</b> the former exit for Main Street. The section of the expressway between the Scajaquada and Harlem Road (NY240) just outside the city limit is the busiest on all of NY33, handling in excess of 100,000 vehicles per day in areas.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having foliage that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their <b>leaves</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of}} the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage. Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis. The crown is a name for the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy. A sapling is a young tree.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the golden-crowned sifaka {{consists}} {{of a wide variety}} of plants—as many as 80species—whose availability varies based on the season. It is a seed predator, making seeds a year-round staple in its diet when available. The golden-crowned sifaka also eats unripe fruits, flowers, and leaves. One study showed a diet composition of 37%unripe fruit and seeds, 22%immature leaves, 17%mature leaves, 13%flowers, and 9%fruit pulp. Individuals have also been observed consuming tree bark during the dry season. In general, approximately 60% of its diet {{consists of}} unripe fruits and seed, mainly from leguminous pods, and less than 50% consists of <b>leaves.</b> <b>At</b> Daraina, it has been observed feeding on the sakoa tree (Poupartia caffra) and on mango trees. Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available, in the early wet season. Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available. Studies have also shown that when food distribution is patchy, feeding times are shorter and more time is spent traveling. Dietary diversity has been shown to be consistent between populations, suggesting that it is important for the lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins.|$|E

25|$|Amtrak, the {{national}} passenger rail system, provides service to Jackson. The Amtrak station {{is located at}} 300 West Capitol Street. The southbound City of New Orleans provides service from Jackson to New Orleans and some points between; it <b>leaves</b> <b>at</b> 11:20a.m. and arrives in New Orleans about 3:30p.m. The northbound City of New Orleans provides service from Jackson to Memphis, Carbondale, Champaign-Urbana, Chicago, and some points between. It <b>leaves</b> <b>at</b> 5:40p.m., arrives in Memphis at 10 p.m., and in Chicago at 9 a.m. the new day. Efforts to establish service with another long-distance train, the proposed Crescent Star, {{an extension of the}} Crescent westward from Meridian, Mississippi, to Dallas, failed in 2003, because Congress refused any growth in Amtrak routes.|$|E
