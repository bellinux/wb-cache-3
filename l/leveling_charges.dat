40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a {{management}} method considering load demand for electric vehicle charging. The method developed by means of modeling a stochastic distribution of charging and a demand dispatch calculation. Optimization processes have proposed to determine optimal demand shifting so that charging costs and demands can possibly be managed. The time of use electricity rate has been put into practice to change the tendencies of charging time. Nevertheless, since it focuses only minimizing costs of charging from vehicle owners, loads would be concentrated {{at a certain time}} and form a new peak load. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to suggest a scenario of load <b>leveling.</b> Therefore <b>charging</b> costs and demands can be managed suitably considering the discordance between electrical prices and system load fluctuations. In case study results, charging patterns and daily demands in the areas are investigated. And optimum solutions are conducted regarding costs and operation aspects by determining demand distribution proportions...|$|R

The purpose is several-fold. First, it is to discredit any charges by claiming the person is an anti-Semite. It's to turn Jews into the victims, so that the victims are not the Palestinians any longer. As people like Abraham Foxman of the ADL put it, the Jews are being threatened by a new holocaust. It's a role reversal — the Jews are now the victims, not the Palestinians. So it serves the function of discrediting the people <b>leveling</b> the <b>charge.</b> It's no longer Israel that needs to leave the Occupied Territories; it's the Arabs who need to free themselves of the anti-Semitism." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} natural photosynthesis provides {{inspiration for the}} development of sustainable and renewable energy sources, i. e. a technology that is capable of converting solar energy directly into chemical fuels. This concept is called artificial photosynthesis. The work described in this thesis contains contributions to the development of artificial photosynthesis in two separate areas. The first one relates to light harvesting with a focus on the question of how electronic properties of photosensitizers can be tuned to allow for efficient photo-induced electron transfer processes. The study is based on a series of bis(tridentate) ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes, the geometric properties of which make them highly appealing for the construction of linear donor-photosensitizer-acceptor arrangements for efficient vectorial photo-induced electron transfer reactions. The chromophores possess remarkably long lived 3 MLCT excited states and it is shown that their excited-state oxidation strength can be altered by variations of the ligand scaffold over a remarkably large range of 900 mV. The second area of relevance to natural and artificial photosynthesis that is discussed in this thesis relates to the coupled movement of protons and electrons. The delicate interplay between these two charged particles regulates thermodynamic and kinetic aspects in many key elementary steps of natural photosynthesis, and further studies are needed to fully understand this concept. The studies are based on redox active phenols with intramolecular hydrogen bonds to quinolines. The compounds thus bear a strong resemblance to the tyrosine/histidine couple in photosystem II, i. e. the water-plastoquinone oxidoreductase enzyme in photosynthesis. The design of the biomimetic models is such that the distance between the proton donor and acceptor is varied, enabling studies on the effect the proton transfer distance has on the rate of proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. The results of the studies have implications {{for the development of}} artificial photosynthesis, in particular in connection with redox <b>leveling,</b> <b>charge</b> accumulation, as well as electron and proton transfer. In addition to these two contributions, the excited-state dynamics of the intramolecular hydrogen-bonded phenols was investigated, thereby revealing design principles for technological applications based on excited-state intramolecular proton transfer and photoinduced tautomerization...|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, General Musharraf {{issued the}} {{executive}} decree and eventually forced President Rafiq Tarar to resign {{in order for}} General Musharraf to assume the presidency. [...] In the light of Supreme Court's verdict, the national referendum was held on 30 April 2002, allowing himself to continue his rule. The controversial referendum, which Musharraf won with almost 98% of the votes in his favour, was alleged by many, including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, to be fraudulent. In 2002, the general elections restored the democracy when the Musharraf-backed PML(Q), the libertarians, were able to form the minority government who would later nominate General Musharraf's for the presidential elections held in 2004. In 2007, President Musharraf eventually imposed another martial law by having suspend the populist Chief Justice IM Chaudhry, <b>leveling</b> <b>charges</b> on corruption and misconduct. Unlike the earlier martial law, Musharraf was widely disapproved, inviting the mass demonstration led by Nawaz Sharif, and eventually resigned {{in an attempt to}} avoid impeachment in the Parliament.|$|E
50|$|Just a {{year after}} {{arriving}} in St. Louis, Rufus Easton received two federal appointments from President Thomas Jefferson. His reputation for legal work in New York preceding him, Easton was appointed a Territorial Judge for the United States territorial court. Additionally he was appointed the first Postmaster of St. Louis in 1805. It {{was a time of}} political intrigue in the western United States and new territories with several prominent men implicated in the Burr Conspiracy. While Easton did exchange correspondence with Aaron Burr during that time period, primarily regarding the actions of James Wilkinson, he strongly denied being a co-conspirator. Burr had become acquainted with Easton a few years previous and helped arrange his appointment as a judge. When Burr visited St. Louis in July, 1805 he met with Easton and revealed to him some details of his plot,asking him to join. Easton refused and broke off all further contact with Burr. Shortly thereafter Easton wrote to President Jefferson informing him of Burr's plot. In retaliation for Easton's repudiation, Wilkinson, a key Burr conspirator, began a campaign to have Easton removed from the court by <b>leveling</b> <b>charges</b> of official misconduct and fraud. Rufus Easton was acquitted and even traveled to Washington D.C. to meet with Jefferson. It was for naught, as the President removed Easton from his judicial post in February, 1806. Several months later however, Jefferson attempted to set right the removal by appointing Easton as U.S. Attorney for the territory.|$|E
40|$|In late 1893, {{the nascent}} Indian-backed American Islamic Propaganda {{movement}}, led by Mohammed Alexander Russell Webb, fell into discord. Emin L. Nabakoff and John A. Lant left {{the movement and}} formed their own Muslim group, the First Society for the Study of Islam in America. For {{the next two years}} the leaders of the bitter rival organizations continued to conduct business. However, they also fought a very public war of words in the newspapers, <b>leveling</b> <b>charges</b> and countercharges against each other’s character, integrity, and Islamic legitimacy. The quarrel spread abroad to India and Britain where each side tried to gain supporters and financial patronage. In the end, the constant fighting and suspicions it raised turned most willing financial backers away from both groups. When progress among American Muslims depended on unity, only fractious disarray was present. This essay explores the history of the rivalry and ultimate demise of late nineteenth century Islamic movements in the United States and examines the profound implications of the whole affair for the budding American Muslim community...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{drivers in}} rural areas worry that VMT taxes would have them paying more because they drive farther between {{destinations}} than do urban drivers. They argue that while they do drive greater distances on the roads, they drive at faster speeds that are more fuel-efficient. [...] Others, however, are supporting VMT fees because they allow lower rates to be charged in a rural settings, which the gas tax does not. It {{should also be noted}} that a possible unintended consequence of a VMT is that it would monetarily punish drivers of energy efficient cars by <b>leveling</b> similar <b>charges</b> for all drivers, negating reasons to own energy efficient vehicles. A VMT may actually increase purchases of less efficient vehicles, leading to increased consumption of fuels, and release of more CO2. It is also unrealistic to assume repeal of gasoline taxes in conjunction with VMT implementation. In federal systems, gasoline excise may be levied by multiple jurisdictions, reducing overall net revenue from the need to maintain both VMT and gasoline excise revenue services.|$|R
