25|$|The Museo de Arte (Museum of Art) {{originally}} was constructed {{to be the}} Temple of San Pedro, founded in 1541 to be a church and a hospital. Eventually it was established as the Hospital of San Pedro y San Pablo {{under the direction of}} the Cathedral of Tlaxcala. It was functioning as a hospital by 1544, but it incurred major expenditures, forcing it to <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> to men only. The arches of the main courtyard were completed in 1640, as well as it fountain and nursing units. In the first half of the 18th century, the hospital ceased to be under the direct control of the Cathedral, passing to the monks of the order of San Juan de Dios. In the latter half of the century, it began to house soldiers in order to improve its finances. The hospital underwent major reforms in the early 19th century to improve medical care, and began to receive medical students from the Medical-Surgical Academy of Puebla. In 1867, the facility became the Hospital General del Estado. In 1917, the hospital moved to new facilities in the city. Through most of the 20th century, the building was used for a wide-variety of purposes. In 1998, a project to restore the building for its use as Puebla Museum of Viceregal Art. In 2002, this museum was converted into the San Pedro Museum of Art, which exhibits works from various epochs.|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{stringing}} cable {{on telephone}} poles or using microwave antennas {{to receive the}} signals, Sterling laid cable beneath the streets. [...] This was partly because the tall buildings in the city blocked television signals and partly because the New York City Council had required that all electrical and telecommunication wiring be laid underground to <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> disruptions during bad weather, an ordinance that was passed after a blizzard in 1888 damaged telephone and telegraph lines in the area.

50|$|Despite popular conceptions {{promoted}} by movies and television, many US police departments {{prefer not to}} maintain officers in non-patrol bureaus and divisions beyond {{a certain period of}} time, such as in the detective bureau, and instead maintain policies that <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> in such divisions to a specified period of time, after which officers must transfer out or return to patrol duties. This is done in part based upon the perception that the most important and essential police work is accomplished on patrol in which officers become acquainted with their beats, prevent crime by their presence, respond to crimes in progress, manage crises, and practice their skills.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{batteries}} are useful where {{long periods of}} storage are required; a primary battery can be constructed to have a lower self-discharge rate than a rechargeable battery, so all its capacity is available for useful purposes. Applications that require a small current for a long time, for example a smoke detector, also use primary batteries since the self-discharge current of a rechargeable battery would exceed the load current and <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> time to {{a few days or}} weeks. For example, a flashlight used for emergencies must work when needed, even if it has sat on a shelf for a long time. Primary cells are also more cost-efficient in this case, as rechargeable batteries would use {{only a small fraction of}} available recharge cycles. Reserve batteries achieve very long storage time (on the order of 10 years or more) without loss of capacity, by physically separating the components of the battery and only assembling them at the time of use. Such constructions are expensive but are found in applications like munitions, which may be stored for years before use.|$|E

Although early signs suggest that domestic deregulation will be a success, U. S. firms still face substantial barriers to competition in many international markets. In ocean shipping and international aviation, for example, the U.

Despite claims that licensure increases service quality, the effect of licensure on consumption quality is ambiguous.

But disruptions such as infrastructure failures and rolling-stock breakdowns can occur, and then require an adaptation of the timetable, rolling-stock and crew schedules. The {{aim of this study}} is to anticipate those potential disruptions by proposing robust rolling-stock rosters. A robust rolling-stock roster should anticipate operational disruptions in order to <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> quality deterioration and additional costs. So we introduce a criterion to measure robustness of a rolling-stock roster. We model the robust rolling-stock planning problem by a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This problem is di cult to solve because of its exponential number of variables. Then, we obtain a good feasible solution by a column generation-based approach...|$|E

40|$|Upgrading the {{software}} of long-lived, highly-available distributed systems is dicult. It {{is not possible}} to upgrade all the nodes in a system at once, since some nodes may be unavailable and halting the system for an upgrade is unacceptable. Instead, upgrades may happen gradually, and there may be long periods of time when dierent nodes are running dierent software versions and need to communicate using incompatible protocols. We present a methodology and infrastructure that address these challenges and make it possible to upgrade distributed systems automatically while limiting service disruption. Our methodology defines how to enable nodes to interoperate across versions, how to preserve the state of a system across upgrades, and how to schedule an upgrade so as to <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> disrup...|$|E
40|$|Wrought Alloy 600 and its weld metals (Alloy 182 and Alloy 82) were {{originally}} used in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) {{due to the}} material's inherent resistance to general corrosion {{in a number of}} aggressive environments and because of a coefficient of thermal expansion that is very close to that of low alloy and carbon steel. Over the last thirty years, stress corrosion cracking in PWR primary water (PWSCC) has been observed in numerous Alloy 600 component items and associated welds, sometimes after relatively long incubation times. The occurrence of PWSCC has been responsible for significant downtime and replacement power costs. As part of an ongoing, comprehensive program involving utilities, reactor vendors and engineering/research organizations, this report will help to ensure that corrosion degradation of nickel-base alloys does not <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> life and that full benefit can be obtained from improved designs for both replacement components and new reactors...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how certain conditions of work affect human service workers ’ job stress. We propose and assess {{a model of}} organizational-professional conflict to determine how professional and bureaucratic conditions of work influence service providers ’ expectations and in turn their job stress. The model was tested using data from a survey of 514 human service providers in Alberta, Canada. The findings suggest that whether service providers ’ expectations are met is critical in explaining job stress. Professional conditions of work relating to working relationships and client interactions are key to fulfilling service providers’ expectations, whereas bureaucratic conditions of work that reflect role conflict and excessive role demands are particularly stressful. An unexpected finding is that bureaucratization of procedures that may <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> workers ’ control over their work does not contribute significantly to their job stress. A major area {{in the study of}} professions is the potential for conflict between professionals and the organizations for which they work (Sorense...|$|E

40|$|In non-economic {{cooperative}} applications with resource constraints, explicitly motivating {{cooperation is}} important so that autonomous service providers have incentives to cooperate. When participants of such applications have different skills and expectations over services, {{it may be}} that an agent receives less than expected from a cooperation. A decision-making strategy over interactions in this context must consider not only the motivation to cooperate, but also which interactions to perform to cope with resource limitations. In this paper, we present a computational approach for modelling noneconomic cooperative interactions based on the theory of exchange values. Here, exchange values are used to motivate cooperative interactions, and to allow agents to identify successful and unsuccessful cooperations with others, in order to <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> provision and to improve the number of successful interactions. We also present a scenario in which agents participate in a cooperative application in the bioinformatics domain, and show how agents can improve their interactions using the proposed approach. ...|$|E
40|$|Online Published: April 28, 2017 Despite the {{evidence}} to support cardiac rehabilitation, existing services remain underutilised. Accessibility to those services {{is a major factor}} in the underutilisation of current programs. Available literature on barriers to the accessibility of out-patient cardiac rehabilitation services were reviewed. Using Penchansky and Thomas’ (1981) five dimensions of accessibility as a structural framework, the information obtained from this review was then used to create a formal questionnaire which was sent to each of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs within Australia in 2007 - 2008 (n= 401). The survey highlighted that the need for a referral, the disease the patient has, the distance required for travel, whether group and individual sessions are provided, flexibility in service delivery setting, hours of operation, cost, and the range of program components, significantly limit patient accessibility to Phase 2 Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs. Completion rates were low for most programs. The Survey revealed that patient accessibility to Phase 2 Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs includes various socio-economic and geographic impediments that can prevent or <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> use. While barriers to cardiac rehabilitation are well known, service providers need to ensure these patient barriers are taken into consideration when providing a Phase 2 Cardiac Rehabilitation Program to improve their accessibility.

40|$|AbstractSpatial disconnections between {{locations}} where ecosystem services are produced {{and where they}} are used are common. To date most ecosystem service assessments have relied on static indicators of provision and often do not incorporate relations with the corresponding beneficiaries or benefiting areas. Most studies implicitly assume spatial and temporal connections between ecosystem service provision and beneficiaries, while the actual connections, i. e., ecosystem service flows, are poorly understood. In this paper, we present a generic framework to analyze the spatial connections between the ecosystem service provisioning and benefiting areas. We introduce an indicator that shows the proportion of benefiting areas supported by spatial ecosystem service flows from provisioning areas. We illustrate the application of the framework and indicator by using global maps of provisioning and benefitting areas for pollination services. We also illustrate our framework and indicator using water provision and climate regulation services, as they portray important differences in spatiotemporal scale and process of service flow. We also describe the possible application of the framework for other services and other scales of assessment. We highlight how, depending on the ecosystem service being studied, the spatial service flows between provisioning and benefiting areas can <b>limit</b> <b>service</b> delivery, thereby reducing the local value of ecosystem service supply...|$|E
