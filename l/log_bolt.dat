40|$|Field-collected {{adults of}} the {{southern}} pine sawyer, Monochamus titillator (F.) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), naturally infested with fourth-stage juveniles (dauerlarvae) of the pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner and Buhrer, 1934) Nickle, 1970, were maturation fed on excised shoots of typical slash pine, Pinus elliottii Engelm. var elliottii, for 21 days. During August 1981, a male and female adult beetle were held in a sleeve cage placed on the terminal of a side branch of each of seven replicate, healthy 10 -year-old slash pine trees. All seven branch terminals showed evidence of beetle feeding on the bark after 1 week, and pinewood nematodes were present in wood samples taken near these feeding sites. Four of the seven trees showed wilt symptoms in 4 - 6 weeks and died about 9 weeks after beetle feeding. Pinewood nematodes were recovered from the roots and trunks of the dead trees. Each of seven replicate slash pine <b>log</b> <b>bolts</b> was enclosed in a jar {{with a pair of}} the same beetles used in the sleeve cages. After 1 week, wood underlying beetle oviposition sites in the bark of all replicate <b>log</b> <b>bolts</b> was infested with the pinewood nematode...|$|R
40|$|This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) {{has been}} {{modified}} for applicability {{to the newly}} constructed Great Lakes Forestry Centre (GLFC) Insect Quarantine (IQ) Facility. Changes include the following:-The floor plan has been revised. -The title “Insect Quarantine Officer (IQO) ” has been revised to “Bio-Safety Officer (BSO) ” to match terminology used by the regulatory authority (i. e., Canadian Food Inspection Agency- CFIA). -Insect Production Services (IPS) personnel now have a separate entrance to the quarantine facility via the domestic rearing zone; all other personnel are restricted from using this entrance. -When portions of the quarantine zone require heightened bio-safety measures, personnel working in those areas {{will be required to}} wear bunny suits, shoe covers, head covers and beard covers (if applicable), rather than lab coats as required elsewhere in the facility; notices will be posted in the change rooms and at affected research modules whenever heightened bio-safety measures are required. -Personnel no longer have access to the entire quarantine facility, only to areas for which access was approved by the BSO. -Lists of equipment available to facility users have been revised. -Storage room C 343 is no longer available to facility users. -Facility users will be required to assist with splitting of <b>log</b> <b>bolts</b> when quantities are large or when the <b>log</b> <b>bolts</b> exceed the maximum size restriction. -A central vacuum system, chemical fume hood and wireless phone system ar...|$|R
50|$|The {{burning of}} wood is {{currently}} the largest use of energy derived from a solid fuel biomass. Wood fuel may be available as firewood (e.g. <b>logs,</b> <b>bolts,</b> blocks), charcoal, chips, sheets, pellets and sawdust. Wood fuel {{can be used for}} cooking and heating through stoves and fireplaces, and occasionally for fueling steam engines and steam turbines that generate electricity. From many centuries many types of traditional ovens were used in order to benefit from the heat generated by wood combustion. Now, more efficient and clean solutions have been developed: advanced fireplaces (with heat exchangers), wood-fired ovens, wood-burning stoves and pellet stoves, that are able to filter and separate pollutants (centrifuging ashes with rotative filters), thus eliminating many emissions, also allowing to recover a higher quantity of heat that escaped with the chimney fumes.|$|R
60|$|I {{had some}} {{talk with a}} youngish man whose {{business}} it was to train avalanches to jump clear of his section of the track. Thor went to Jotunheim only once or twice, {{and he had his}} useful hammer Miolnr with him. This Thor lived in Jotunheim among the green-ice-crowned peaks of the Selkirks--where if you disturb the giants at certain seasons of the year, by making noises, they will sit upon you and all your fine emotions. So Thor watches them glaring under the May sun, or dull and doubly dangerous beneath the spring rains. He wards off their strokes with enormous brattices of wood, wing-walls of <b>logs</b> <b>bolted</b> together, and such other contraptions as experience teaches. He bears the giants no malice; they do their work, he his. What bothers him a little is that the wind of their blows sometimes rips pines out of the opposite hill-sides--explodes, as it were, a whole valley. He thinks, however, he can fix things so as to split large avalanches into little ones.|$|R
40|$|The heating of <b>logs,</b> <b>bolts,</b> and {{flitches}} to be {{cut into}} high-quality rotary or sliced veneer requires {{a knowledge of the}} temperatures appropriate for various species and conditions, and of the factors that control the attainment of these temperatures during the heating process. Good equipment and good control of the heating process are essential. Under the guidelines given in this paper, optimum temperature levels for different woods and different conditions can be determined, and time schedules can be calculated for heating in steam or water. Optimum temperatures can be determined by following suggested values given for a number of veneer species. Adjustments must be made, depending on the quality of cutting obtained and taking into consideration other species factors, such as tendencies for end-splitting, presence of hard knots, and color changes in the woods. Three steps are involved in arriving at a heating schedule applicable to a given set of conditions. Mathematical analyses have provided graphic shortcuts to aid in taking each step. The first step is to adjust for temperature differences from those assumed in this paper, namely a 70 ° F. initial wood temperature and a 212 ° F. heating medium temperature. The second step is to determine the time required to attain the desired temperature under conditions where the heat diffusivity factor is 0. 00027. The third step is to adjust the time thus determined to take into account different diffusivity factors that apply to woods of different densities, and that depend on whether the heating is done in steam or in water...|$|R

40|$|The European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio F. (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) {{utilizes}} pine as {{its host}} during larval development. Females drill through pine bark to deposit eggs, a symbiotic fungus, Amylostereum, and phytotoxic mucus into the tree. In their native range, these insects are not viewed as primary pests because they attack dead or dying trees. Over the last century, this woodwasp has been accidentally introduced into several {{countries in the}} southern hemisphere. Some regions have incurred {{millions of dollars in}} damage to large plantations of the widely planted pine species, radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don). Sirex noctilio was discovered in northeastern United States and Canada in 2004. Prior studies have focused on damage done to pine stands in the southern hemisphere and, because those pines are not native, these studies may not be applicable to native pines in the U. S. The southeastern U. S. contains millions of hectares of possibly susceptible pine trees and, thus it is advisable to study the native Arkansas woodwasp, S. nigricornis F., (as a species with similar biology) in preparation for a possible invasion by its exotic counterpart. The objectives of this research were to 1) examine how shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) <b>logs</b> (<b>bolts)</b> in moderate drought conditions of Arkansas lose moisture over time, and 2) determine oviposition preferences of Sirex nigricornis females in aging pine bolts. To complete these objectives, shortleaf pines were felled and moisture content was measured over a period of 45 days. Moisture content results were used to create parameters for oviposition choice experiments. After a cross-sectional cut was made, the most moisture loss occurs within 3 - 4 cm of bolt ends while the center of the bolt stays consistent during this time period. Females prefer to oviposit in recently cut bolts. Using these results, trap tree methods can be altered to create more efficient methods of siricid capture and laboratory rearing...|$|R
30|$|Felled {{trees were}} {{crosscut}} into 10.67  m long logs, from which two 5.33  m mill-length logs were obtained. Each mill-length log was crosscut into two veneer bolts (peeler blocks) which were steamed and peeled into veneer until the core measured approximately 8.9  cm in diameter. The veneer sheets were tracked during the peeling process, allowing each sheet to be uniquely {{traced back to}} the veneer bolt and consequently to the position within the <b>bolt,</b> <b>log,</b> and parent tree, thus enabling the construction of internal stiffness maps for each tree (after Todoroki et al. 2012).|$|R
50|$|Systematically, the auto-stages (and {{eventually}} the automobile) pushed aside the railroad {{as the primary}} means of passenger traffic. However, what the Tacoma Eastern Railroad became famous for was not moving passengers, but moving timber—big timber and lots of it too. Ninety percent of all freight hauled by the railroad was extricated from the forests beneath Mount Rainier. Forty- and fifty-car trains were loaded with <b>logs,</b> lumber, cedar <b>bolts,</b> shingles, cordwood, wood pulp and delicately crafted wood trim. Of these materials, the logs were the most prevalent {{and many of these}} train cars were loaded with one enormous log that measured eight feet or more in diameter at the butt and could tip the scales at 40 tons. These massive logs were euphemistically referred to as “Tacoma Toothpicks”.|$|R
40|$|The early {{colonization}} of newly created coarse woody material (CWM) by beetles was studied in aspen mixedwood forests at two locations in north-central Alberta. Healthy trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) trees, in old (3 ̆e 100 years) and mature (40 – 80 years) stands, were cut to provide {{three types of}} CWM: stumps, bolts on the ground (<b>logs),</b> and <b>bolts</b> suspended above the ground to simulate snags. Over 2 years, 1049 Coleoptera, represent- ing 49 taxa, were collected. Faunal structure differed little between the two locations. Species diversity was higher in old than in mature stands, and higher in stumps and logs than in suspended bolts; however, these “snags” tended to have higher abundance when compared with stumps and logs. Overall beetle abundance and the catch of wood-boring beetles was significantly higher {{in the first year}} post-treatment, mainly because of the ambrosia beetle (Trypodendron retusum (LeConte)) and one of its predators, Rhizophagus remotus LeConte; however, beetle diversity was higher in the second year, suggesting that early wood-boring species may “precondition” the wood for a number of succeeding spe- cies. The high turnover rate of taxa and spatial or temporal variation in faunal structure suggests that effort focused on habitat classification of CWM will facilitate management to conserve saproxylic faunal diversity...|$|R
