5|$|In the 1998 storyline {{where he}} fakes dissociative {{identity}} disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities {{may not have been}} as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> psyche; at multiple points within the series, Téa attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.|$|E
25|$|With {{nearly every}} explanation, Fulgentius {{provides}} {{the reader with}} a small quotation {{as an example of}} the word’s practical use, often citing the work it was taken from. However, many of these quotes are likely to be faked. Some works may be entirely made-up, while others have been liberally edited by Fulgentius. As was common with writers of this period, Fulgentius does not cite his immediate sources, perhaps in an attempt to obscure the fact that he had access to very few to draw from. The entire work was probably an attempt to improve his reputation as a scholar in hopes the reader would not take a critical <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> methods.|$|E
25|$|In 1535, Pedro de Alvarado, {{previous}} {{governor of}} Guatemala, returned in defeat from Peru. Not only was his expedition a failure, but {{upon his return}} he {{was faced with a}} trial over his reckless adventure without royal approval, and for taking Guatemalan Indians with him, many of whom died on the expedition. On October 27, 1535 the Audiencia of Mexico, which had loose jurisdiction over Guatemala, dismissed him from the governorship of the province and sent Alonso de Maldonado as provisional governor and juez de residencia ("judge of grievances") to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> conduct. Alverado had many enemies in Guatemala, and there were many grievances against him. To avoid a trial, he fled to Honduras to fight rebellious Indians, and later to Spain.|$|E

25|$|The Man with Red Eyes is a being whom Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin {{encounter}} {{on their}} quest to rescue Meg and Charles Wallace's father on the planet Camazotz. He is the Prime Coordinator on Camazotz. Although he appears human, he explains that IT actually talks through him, like a robot or demented puppet, {{that he is a}} part of IT. He entices Charles Wallace to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> glowing red eyes in order to find his father. When Charles Wallace does so, he too becomes possessed by the mind of IT, after which the Man with Red Eyes drops out of the story. Then, the man with red eyes tries to capture Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace. IT talks through him. He has the ability to communicate telepathically.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{was looking}} ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier. Presley had wanted to join Special Services, {{allowing}} {{him the opportunity to}} continue to perform {{while at the same time}} getting an easier ride than other soldiers. Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could show the world that he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own service record. He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.|$|E
500|$|McClure's {{character}} is most developed in [...] "A Fish Called Selma", {{which provides a}} more in-depth <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> private life and backstory. Showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of Hartman, and wished to make an episode entirely about McClure {{in order to give}} Hartman as much to do as possible. From this came the idea of McClure's marriage to Selma Bouvier, as she was [...] "always marrying people". Animator Mark Kirkland was particularly pleased that McClure was the star of the episode. He enjoyed interpreting Hartman's voice-over performances, and the episode allowed him and the other animators to [...] "open [...] up visually as a character".|$|E

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I {{could do it in}} a way that also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it takes is to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ... This is a man with amazing instincts." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scenes in}} which Chef, {{and later the}} lead turkey, don blue and white war paint and speak {{inspirational}} words to their armies are a parody of Braveheart, the 1995 Mel Gibson-directed film about Scottish historical hero William Wallace. Parker {{said it was the}} first of many times a film was spoofed in a South Park episode, even though both said they enjoyed Braveheart. [...] During class, Mr. Garrison incorrectly tells the children the internationally known English pop singer Engelbert Humperdinck was the first man to walk on the moon. Also in the classroom, when it is suggested some poor people would rather die than go to a poorhouse, Cartman says, [...] "Well then perhaps they should – and decrease the surplus population!" [...] The line is lifted word-for-word from the Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol, prompting Mr. Garrison to respond, [...] "Okay, kids, that's enough Dickens for one day." [...] Kyle incorrectly tells Stan that Sally Struthers appeared on Full House, an American sitcom that ran from the late 1980s to early 1990s; she actually starred in the 1970s series All in the Family. When Dr. Mephisto asks Chef to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> microscope, Chef says he sees [...] "an extreme close-up of Vanessa Redgrave's private parts", a reference to the Academy Award-winning English actress. At the end of the episode, Stan said it is important to remember the images of starving children on television are [...] "just as real as you or I". Kyle says by that logic, MacGyver is a real person too, a reference to the secret agent protagonist from the 1980s television series of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{writers who}} contributed to the show were Bill Manhoff, Mel Diamond, Dale and Katherine Eunson, Ben Gershman, George Tibbles (who later became the head writer on My Three Sons), Fran van Hartesvelt, Bob Ross, Alan Manings, Mathilde and Theodore Ferro, John Whedon and the team of Dick Conway and Roland MacLane, who wrote many of the shows {{for the last two}} seasons. Connelly told an interviewer, [...] "If we hire a writer we tell him not to make up {{situation}}s, but to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own background. It's not a 'situation' comedy where you have to create a situation for a particular effect. Our emphasis is on a natural story line." ...|$|E

2500|$|The private {{investigator}} Jeff Katz, hired by Calvi's family in 1991 to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> death, {{claimed it was}} likely that senior figures in the Italian establishment escaped prosecution. [...] "The {{problem is that the}} people who probably actually ordered the death of Calvi are not in the dock - but to get to those people might be very difficult indeed," [...] he said in an interview. Katz said it was [...] "probably true" [...] that the Mafia carried out the killing, but that the gangsters suspected of the crime were either dead or missing. The verdict in the trial was {{not the end of the}} matter, since by June 2007 the prosecutor's office in Rome had opened a second investigation implicating, among others, Licio Gelli.|$|E
2500|$|The man of {{business}} and fortune ... is up and in the city by eight, swallows his breakfast in haste, attends a meeting of creditors, must read Lloyd's lists, consult the price of consols, study the markets, <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> accounts, pay his workmen, and superintend his clerks: he has hardly a minute {{in the day to}} himself, and perhaps in the four-and-twenty hours does not do a single thing that he would do if he could help it. Surely, this sacrifice of time and inclination requires some compensation, which it meets with. But how am I entitled to make my fortune (which cannot be done without all this anxiety and drudgery) who do hardly any thing at all, and never any thing but what I like to do? I rise when I please, breakfast at length, write what comes into my head, and after taking a mutton-chop and a dish of strong tea, go to the play, and thus my time passes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997 {{he tried}} to help the Second Division {{football}} club Exeter City win a crucial end of season game by placing [...] "energy-infused" [...] crystals behind the goals at Exeter's ground (Exeter lost the game 5–1); he was appointed co-chairman of the club in 2002. The club was relegated to the Football Conference in May 2003, where it remained for five years. He has since severed formal ties with the club. He had also been involved with Reading F.C. and claimed in 2002 that he had helped them to avoid relegation by getting the club's supporters to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> eyes and say [...] "win, Reading, win". Reading manager Alan Pardew however dismissed Geller's role in the club's survival - which was achieved thanks to a draw in the crucial match rather than a Reading victory - stating [...] "as {{soon as we get}} a bit of joy, thanks to all the hard work and efforts of my staff and players, he suddenly comes out of the blue and tries to claim the limelight." ...|$|E
