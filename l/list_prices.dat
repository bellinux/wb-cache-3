5|$|Initially {{second to}} the 747 as Boeing's most {{profitable}} jetliner, the 777 became the company's most lucrative model in the 2000s. Program sales accounted for an estimated US$400million of Boeing's pretax earnings in 2000, US$50million more than the 747. By 2004, the airliner comprised the bulk of wide-body revenues for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division. In 2007, orders for second-generation 777 models approached 350 aircraft, and in November of that year, Boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 2012. The program backlog of 356 orders was valued at US$95billion at <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> in 2008.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 2016, Boeing {{announced}} that it had finalized terms of acquisition with Volga-Dnepr Group for 20 747-8 freighters, valued at $7.58 billion at <b>list</b> <b>prices.</b> Four aircraft were delivered beginning in 2012. Volga-Dnepr Group is the parent of three major Russian air-freight carriers – Volga-Dnepr Airlines, AirBridgeCargo Airlines and Atran Airlines. The new 747-8 freighters will replace AirBridgeCargo's current 747-400 aircraft and expand the airline's fleet and will be acquired through a mix of direct purchases and leasing {{over the next six}} years, Boeing said.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A320neo family {{aircraft}} {{ordered in}} 2011 {{were to be}} delivered starting 2015. However, due to a delay in the production and delivery of these aircraft, IndiGo dry-leased a total of 22 used aircraft {{to cope with the}} demand. On 15 October 2014, IndiGo expressed its intention to order a further 250 A320neo aircraft worth US$25.7 billion at <b>list</b> <b>prices.</b> On 15 August 2015, IndiGo confirmed the order for 250 A320neo aircraft for $26.5 billion. The order also provides IndiGo the flexibility to convert some A320neos to A321neos that can seat more passengers and fly on longer routes. The order of 250 jets was Airbus' single largest order by number of aircraft. Indigo received the first A320neo in March 2016.|$|E

50|$|Typically, {{the real}} estate agent has the {{experience}} and data to determine a suitable <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> for the seller's property and will recommend a <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> to the seller. The seller can accept, reject, or try to negotiate a different <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> for the contract. If the seller's price is unrealistically high and the agent cannot convince the seller otherwise, the agent can decline to list the property.|$|R
40|$|Many {{goods are}} marketed after first stating a <b>list</b> <b>price,</b> with the {{expectation}} that the eventual sales price will differ. In this article, we first present a simple model of search behavior that includes the seller setting a <b>list</b> <b>price.</b> Holding constant the mean of the buyers’ distribution of potential offers for a good, we assume that the greater the <b>list</b> <b>price,</b> the slower the arrival rate of offers but the greater is the maximal offer. This trade-off determines the optimal <b>list</b> <b>price,</b> which is set simultaneously with the seller's reservation price. Comparative statics are derived through a set of numerical sensitivity tests, where we show that the greater the variance of the distribution of buyers’ potential offers, the greater is the ratio of the <b>list</b> <b>price</b> to expected sales price. Thus, sellers of atypical goods will tend to set a relatively high <b>list</b> <b>price</b> compared with standard goods. We test this hypothesis using data from the Columbus, Ohio, housing market and find substantial support. We also find empirical support for another hypothesis of the model: atypical dwellings take longer to sell. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose In Italy {{selling prices}} are not public {{information}} and therefore <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> {{play a key}} role for market analyses and are used by real estate companies and appraisers for estimating house values. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the listing behaviours of agents and sellers. In particular, the paper analyzes <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> and the predicting power of the house features described in advertisements, to improve their use in real estate valuations. Design/methodology/approach We employed a traditional hedonic model to measure the overall contribution to <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> of the characteristics described in advertisements. We performed the analysis both on houses put on the market by agents and on houses put on the market by sellers. We analyzed <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> distributions and their deviation from normality. Furthermore, we performed the hedonic analysis, which consisted in two steps. Firstly, the coefficient of determination for any characteristic was computed. Secondly, we measured the overall contribution to the <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> of the characteristics described in advertisements. Findings The analysis shows the presence of factors which affect <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> and which are not revealed to buyers in real estate advertisements. On the other hand, we also found the presence of characteristics that do not affect the <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> but are described in advertisements. Furthermore, agents and sellers showed different behaviours. While the marginal contributions of each characteristic estimated on a sample of houses put on the market by agents were significant, our analysis reveals that <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> of houses put on the market by sellers themselves are not explained by the house features. Originality/value To our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a hedonic approach to exploring the major determinants of <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> of houses on sale on the Italian market. The listing behaviour of agents and sellers and the predicting power of the observable characteristics could address the use of <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> in real estate valuations. At the same time, the potential presence of unobservable factors that affect the <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> could be a source of bias in estimating the value of houses...|$|R

40|$|<b>List,</b> or retail, <b>pricing</b> is {{a widely}} used trading {{institution}} where firms announce a price that may be discounted at a later stage. Competition authorities view <b>list</b> <b>pricing</b> and discounting as a procompetitive practice. We modify the standard Bertrand-Edgeworth duopoly model to include <b>list</b> <b>pricing</b> and a subsequent discounting stage. Both firms first simultaneously choose a maximum <b>list</b> <b>price</b> and then decide whether to discount, or not, in a subsequent stage. We show that <b>list</b> <b>pricing</b> works as a credible commitment device that induces a pure strategy outcome. This is true for a general class of rationing rules.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study how bargainers impact on markets in which ?rms set a <b>list</b> <b>price</b> {{to sell to}} those {{consumers}} who take prices as given. The <b>list</b> <b>price</b> acts as an outside option for the bargainers, so the higher the <b>list</b> <b>price,</b> the more the ?rms can extract from bargainers. We ?nd that {{an increase in the}} proportion of consumers seeking to bargain can lower consumer surplus overall, even though new bargainers receive a lower price. The reason is that the <b>list</b> <b>price</b> for those who don?t bargain and the bargained prices for those who were already bargaining rise: sellers have a greater incentive to make the bargainers?outside option less attractive, at a cost to pro?ts from non-bargainers. Competition Authority exhortations to bargain can therefore be misplaced. We also consider the implications for optimal seller bargaining...|$|R
40|$|Information about price {{changes during}} a home's {{marketing}} period is typically missing from data used {{to investigate the}} <b>listing</b> <b>price,</b> selling price, and selling time relationship. This paper incorporates price revision information into the study of this relationship. Using a maximum-likelihood probit model, we examine the determinants of <b>list</b> <b>price</b> changes and find evidence consistent with the theory of pricing behavior under demand uncertainty. Homes most likely to undergo <b>list</b> <b>price</b> changes are those with high initial markups and vacant homes, while homes with unusual features are {{the least likely to}} experience a price revision. We also explore the impact of missing price change information on estimating a representative model of house price and market time. Our results suggest that mispricing the home in the initial listing is costly to the seller in both time and money. Homes with large percentage changes in <b>list</b> <b>price</b> take longer to sell and ultimately sell at lower prices.
