5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and much closer to pn, {{than it is to}} 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals.|$|E

Dal-po, who is {{actually}} a genius, pretends to be dumb (<b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Dal-po) and gets all zeroes in his test scores {{in order to keep}} up the deception in front of Choi Gong-pil. With his last-place class standing and scruffy, country bumpkin hair, Dal-po is friendless at school while In-ha is the most popular girl. Dal-po secretly likes In-ha, and he is forced to join a televised quiz show at first to prevent Ahn Chan Soo, who has a crush on In Ha, from confessing to her on national TV. At the TV studio, he runs into the show producer Hwang Gyo-dong, who had been a YGN reporter and one of Cha-ok's rivals, but changed careers after what happened to the Ki family. After seeing Dal-po on TV, and despite knowing that her Pinocchio syndrome limits her career choices, In-ha decides to become a journalist.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} of the dorms for habitual sex offenders where Father Joe lives was actually an apartment complex in Vancouver that was slated for demolition while the production crew were filming there. Snow {{that can be seen}} outside the dorms was actually fake snow that was imported by the crew and fabricated by the film's Special Effects Department. Bill Roe and Mark Freeborn worked together to create a creepy green glow on the location using green lights. The production crew also created their own factory smoke for chimneys in the background, as Carter came to the opinion that the smoking chimneys made the location look like London. The interior of Joe's apartment was another set and was exactly <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> apartment except that it was slightly bigger. A trans-light was incorporated into the set to resemble daylight visible through a window of the apartment. The set also had a porch that was used for some shots in the scene where Mulder and Scully were outside the apartment. Additional filming was done in Coquitlam, another Vancouver suburb, at Riverview Hospital's Unit 8 building.|$|E

[...] On the other hand, Dallas Stewart, trainer of rival Commanding Curve, dismissed California Chrome's chances due to his pedigree and the supposed lack of competition in his prior races. Others doubted his ability because the colt had never raced outside California. In contrast to the critics, reports surfaced that the owners had turned down a new offer of $10million.|$|E

500|$|The year 1904 saw {{the passage}} of the Shop Hours Act, which made some {{provision}} for limiting shop opening hours. In 1907 the first steps were taken to end the Victorian [...] "living-in" [...] practice, which at the time still affected two-thirds of Britain's 750,000 shopworkers. Initially, living-out privileges were only given to male employees; Bondfield campaigned for equivalent rights for women shop workers, arguing that if they were to become [...] "useful, healthy... wives and mothers", they needed to live [...] "rational lives". As part of her campaign, Bondfield advised the playwright Cicely Hamilton, whose shop-based drama Diana of Dobsons appeared that year. Bondfield described the opening scene, set in a dreary, comfortless women's dormitory over a shop, as very <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> thing.|$|E

The video {{featured}} reality TV show actors <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> Housewives of Beverly Hills, and works of artist Nathan Sawaya and YouTube's Minecraft gamer SkyDoesMinecraft. Running for over 11 minutes, the video shows Gaga as a wounded fallen angel who is revived by her followers in a pool. Once rejuvenated, she takes revenge on the men who hunted her and replaces them with clones known as G.U.Y. The video received positive reviews for its visuals and its references to Greek mythology. Gaga has performed [...] "G.U.Y."

500|$|Spielberg stated before {{production}} began {{that very}} few CGI effects {{would be used to}} maintain consistency with the other films. During filming significantly more CGI work was done than initially anticipated as in many cases it proved to be more practical. There ended up being a total of about 450 CGI shots in the film, with an estimated 30 percent of the film's shots containing CG matte paintings. Spielberg initially wanted brushstrokes to be visible on the paintings for added consistency with the previous films, but decided against it. The script also required a non-deforested jungle for a chase scene, but this would have been unsafe and much CGI work was done to create the jungle action sequence. Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman (who worked on Lucas' [...] and [...] as well as Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Munich) traveled to Brazil and Argentina to photograph elements that were composited into the final images. Industrial Light and Magic then effectively created a virtual jungle with a geography <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Amazon.|$|E
500|$|Bond {{wrote of}} her next role, [...] "It {{was like a}} dream come true when I saw my own name in the title role" [...] of Iolanthe (1882–84). Bond's first {{entrance}} as Iolanthe was across a [...] "stream". [...] She wrote in her memoirs about a performance of Iolanthe: [...] "Realism can be carried too far, as it was when one night a zealous property man said to me: 'It'll be just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> thing to-night, Miss Bond. I've put some frogs into the water!' [...] 'Then you'll just have to fish them out again,' I retorted, 'and the curtain won't go up until you do.' [...] They had to catch those frogs in an inverted umbrella. [...] Everybody got splashed and agitated, and the performance was delayed for some time." [...] The critics praised Bond's portrayal of the title character: [...] "Miss Jessie Bond... may be credited with all the grace, delicacy, and fascination we should expect from a fairy mother, and her singing of the really exquisite melody in the last scene {{was one of the most}} successful items in the entire opera." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was also}} {{considerable}} {{mention of the}} evolution of Underwood's relationship with Claire. [...] "heir partnership has morphed into an entirely professional exercise, with a shared lust for power having supplanted more conventional matrimonial bonds," [...] wrote Brian Lowry of Variety. The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber remarked, however, that the utter ruthlessness displayed by Underwoods in the season finale may have represented a [...] "jump the shark" [...] moment for the series: The Underwoods have murdered a politician and a journalist, and some innocents have also been collateral damage to their activities. Now, though, they've set out to maintain their power at the cost of mass casualties. Netflix hasn't said how many seasons are to come, but it's hard to imagine the show being watchable for all that much longer now that this rubicon of despicability has been crossed.Some compared Underwood's story line in season 4 to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Brian Moyland of The Guardian wrote: House of Cards has never felt <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> presidency: Frank Underwood is evil incarnate, bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in front of trains. But now that, in real life, we're in the throes of such a bizarre presidential race, his machinations are starting to look almost viable. There are several parallels between Underwood's re-election campaign and the 2016 campaigns of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} that Wittgenstein was inspired for this theory by the way that traffic courts in Paris reenact automobile accidents. A toy car is a representation of a real car, a toy truck is a representation of a real truck, and dolls are representations of people. In order to convey to a judge what happened in an automobile accident, someone in the courtroom might place the toy cars in a position <b>like</b> <b>the</b> position <b>the</b> <b>real</b> cars were in, and move them {{in the ways that}} <b>the</b> <b>real</b> cars moved. In this way, the elements of the picture (the toy cars) are in spatial relation to one another, and this relation itself pictures the spatial relation between <b>the</b> <b>real</b> cars in <b>the</b> automobile accident.|$|R
