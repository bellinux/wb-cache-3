50|$|Transport in Fishguard is {{restricted}} to motor vehicles for moving about in the town. A small railway, the Fishguard - Fishguard Railway (run by Fishrail) is also used. To get around outside of Fishguard, the main mode of transport is <b>lace-up</b> <b>shoes,</b> although there are elastic-sided boots on some routes. A pipeline was also built to pump thousands of tourists each year into West Wales, but the casualties from its first run meant that it was soon replaced by an A-Road.|$|R
5000|$|The {{meaning of}} [...] "Oxford" [...] and [...] "Balmoral" [...] may vary geographically. In the United States, [...] "Balmoral" [...] is often synonymous with [...] "Oxford". In the United Kingdom, [...] "Oxford" [...] often means any more formal <b>lace-up</b> <b>shoe,</b> {{including}} the Blucher and Derby. In Britain and other countries, the Balmoral is an Oxford with no seams, {{apart from the}} toe cap seam, descending to the welt, a style common on boots. Shoes with closed lacing (Oxfords/Balmorals) are considered more formal than those with open lacing (Bluchers/Derbys).|$|R

5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather <b>lace-up</b> <b>shoes,</b> some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|R

50|$|In Colombia, all {{students}} are required to wear uniforms in public and private schools. Uniforms in Colombia consist of two sets, one for everyday use and a sports one for physical education. Everyday use uniforms for girls generally include a knee-length skirt, a white T-shirt and a vest over it along with white mid-calf socks, and for the boys the uniform generally is a dark long trousers and a short or long-sleeved shirt. The shoes for both girls and boys are black <b>lace-up</b> <b>shoes</b> (sometimes it may vary for dark blue or red wine shoes depending on the uniform colours) and the shirts usually have the school's symbol at the left side.

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of shoes; soft shoes (also known as ghillies or pumps) and hard shoes. Hard shoes are similar to tap shoes, except that the tips and heels are made of fiberglass, instead of metal, and are {{significantly}} bulkier. The first hard shoes had wooden or leather taps with metal nails. Later the taps and heels were made of resin or fiberglass to reduce the weight and to make the sounds louder. The soft shoes, which are called ghillies, are black <b>lace-up</b> <b>shoes.</b> Ghillies are only worn by girls, while boys wear black leather shoes called [...] "reel shoes", which resemble black jazz shoes with a hard heel. Boy's soft-shoe dancing features audible heel clicks. A new trend includes adding white laces to the soft shoes, and white tape to the straps of the hard shoes in order to give the illusion of elongating the legs.|$|R
5000|$|The kung fu shoe, {{also known}} as a [...] "Tai Chi shoe" [...] or as a [...] "martial arts slipper", is a type and style of cloth slip-on shoe that is {{traditionally}} made in China, and was originally worn while practicing kung fu and other martial arts, and also while performing Tai Chi. Variants of this shoe are now mass-produced for general-purpose wear, and there are several slightly different styles. These shoes are inexpensive and are available worldwide.One common kind is cheaply produced and is typically black, with minimal lining; it has a low-sided cloth upper, and a pale brown hard plastic sole. One variant is made as a <b>lace-up</b> <b>shoe</b> rather than a slip-on shoe. A version of the shoe for girls and women has a buckle strap and resembles the Mary Jane shoe. Some varieties of the kung fu shoe have reinforced cotton soles instead of plastic ones, and some have rubber soles.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{uniform of}} the school comprised a black blazer with school badge on the breast pocket, a white shirt, a school tie in stripes of black gold and silver, a black cap with school badge and black <b>lace-up</b> leather <b>shoes.</b> 1st and 2nd year boys wore grey shorts whilst older boys were allowed to wear grey flannel trousers. 6th formers wore a slightly more flamboyant tie whilst prefects wore a cap with a gold stripe.|$|R
50|$|The school uniform has {{undergone}} many changes since its founding. Currently, {{junior and senior}} students are distinguished by the pale blue shirts worn by juniors, and the navy and white striped shirts worn by senior students. Navy shorts and trousers are worn by boys, with navy skirts (ankle length for senior girls in the winter, and knee length for all girls in the summer) and Maclean tartan kilts worn by girls (the tartan skirts are only worn by junior girls in the winter terms). Shoes include brown Roman sandals in summer and black <b>lace-up</b> <b>shoes</b> in winter (but can also be worn in summer). The school jersey is blue and v-necked with the school emblem on the left-hand side. Badges are sewn onto these jumpers when received by a student for representing the school in a premier team, such as in sports, drama, debating or music. School jackets, scarves, hats and schoolbags are also available, but not compulsory. For formal events, a blue striped blazer is worn with a school tie and long skirts or trousers. Senior students {{have the option to}} mix summer and winter uniforms throughout the year (apart from sandals only being worn in the summer and only with shorts or short skirts), whilst junior students must adhere to the assigned summer and winter uniforms.|$|R
5000|$|A strict high {{standard}} of dress code was enforced at all times. Make-up and hairstyles were scrutinized, and in general, jewelry was not acceptable, {{with the exception of}} wristwatches. The standard complete uniform was a navy blue blazer, white cotton blouse, and navy blue pleated skirt (skirt length below the knee, preferably mid-calf) with white bobby socks or anklets, and <b>lace-up</b> walking <b>shoes</b> or loafers. Once monthly, the more relaxed [...] "First Fridays" [...] dress code rule was in place with the girls being allowed to attend classes “out of uniform”, but with good taste and modesty in mind.|$|R
50|$|When the Marine Police was reorganised and renamed as the Police Coast Guard in 1993, {{the uniform}} was also changed to the Combat (or No. 4) Uniform. This uniform {{consisted}} of a long-sleeved shirt and long pants made of a slightly tougher polyester, and does away with almost all metal parts via the use of Velcro and plastic buttons. They don a blue beret, but are permitted to wear a baseball cap while on operational duties. Footwear {{is in the form}} of <b>lace-up</b> leather <b>shoes</b> with non-slip soles. Unlike the Combat Uniform worn by other units in the police force, the uniform adopted hidden plastic buttons to avoid entanglements, and does away with garters since shoes, and not boots, are worn to allow rapid removal should water entry be required.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{formal and}} {{traditional}} shoes are patent leather opera pumps (court shoes) decorated with grosgrain bows. The more popular alternative currently {{is the black}} <b>lace-up</b> Oxford <b>shoe,</b> in patent leather or calfskin, with a rounded plain toe. Brogueing or any other decorative patterns should never be seen on Black Tie footwear. Matte finish pumps are also seen. [...] Shoes are almost invariably black and patent leather is considered more formal than matte finishes while pumps are considered more formal than lace-ups. Generally considered too informal for black tie are shoes with open lacing, such as the Derby shoe (bluchers in American English). Notable alternatives include the black button boot (primarily of historical interest only) and the monogrammed Albert slipper which was originally worn only at home. The black Gucci loafer in leather is also considered as an alternative, especially in urban British settings. Hosiery is black socks made from fine wool or silk.|$|R

The new dress is green with green and red pin stripes in a tartan-like pattern. In 2010 the old green jumper was replaced with a ruby red jumper.
