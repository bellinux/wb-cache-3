25|$|On flight day 4 Stephanie Wilson and Naoko Yamazaki grappled and berthed the Multi-purpose <b>Logistics</b> <b>Module</b> (MPLM) Leonardo. The MPLM was berthed to {{the station}} at 04:24 UTC (00:24 EDT). The hatches were opened by station flight {{engineer}} Soichi Noguchi and shuttle mission specialist Clayton Anderson at 11:58 UTC (07:58 EDT). The joint STS-131/Expedition 23 crews began transferring cargo from the MPLM, with the first item being a Rate Gyro Assembly (RGA) which will be replaced on the first spacewalk of the mission. During flight day 4 commander Alan Poindexter did several in-flight interviews. Commander Poindexter was joined by mission specialists Rick Mastracchio and Stephanie Wilson. The interviews were with the Tom Joyner Radio Show, WVIT-TV and Fox News Radio. At {{the end of the}} day Mastracchio and Anderson entered the Quest airlock and begin breathing pure oxygen for an hour, while the atmospheric pressure inside the airlock was lowered to 10.2 psi. This procedure is known as the pre-breathe protocol and is done before every spacewalk, to purge nitrogen from the blood stream and prevent decompression sickness.|$|E
2500|$|STS-128 (ISS {{assembly}} flight 17A) was a NASA Space Shuttle {{mission to}} the International Space Station (ISS) that launched on 28 August 2009.

2500|$|During flight day 6 {{the joint}} crews {{continued}} the {{activation of the}} new crew quarters. The last of the major transfer items, the Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR), Materials Science Research Rack and the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer ISS 2 (MELFI-2) were transferred from the Multi-Purpose <b>Logistics</b> <b>Module</b> (MPLM) Leonardo. Astronauts Danny Olivas and José Hernández answered some questions submitted on YouTube and Twitter. Olivas along with Christer Fuglesang also prepared for the second EVA and [...] "camped out" [...] in the air lock at a lower pressure to help get ready for EVA 2 on flight day 7.|$|E
2500|$|STS-127 (ISS {{assembly}} flight 2J/A) was a NASA Space Shuttle {{mission to}} the International Space Station (ISS). It was the twenty-third flight of [...] The {{primary purpose of the}} STS-127 mission was to deliver and install the final two components of the Japanese Experiment Module: the Exposed Facility (JEM EF), and the Exposed Section of the Experiment <b>Logistics</b> <b>Module</b> (ELM-ES). When Endeavour docked with the ISS on this mission in July 2009, it set a record for the most humans in space {{at the same time in}} the same vehicle, the first time thirteen people have been at the station at the same time. It also tied the record of thirteen people in space at any one time.|$|E
2500|$|On Flight Day 10, {{the crew}} of Atlantis wrapped up the {{transfer}} work inside the Raffaello MPLM. During the Mission Status Briefing, Space Station lead Flight Director Chris Edelen said that [...] "They (crew) reached a key milestone today in that the Raffaello <b>logistics</b> <b>module</b> was closed out, all the cargo that (came) up to space station has been transferred over, that was actually completed {{a couple of days}} ago, and today they've packed Raffaello with all the return cargo that's going to be coming back to Earth". STS-135 delivered 9403 pounds of cargo in the MPLM up to the space station and the crew packed up 5666 pounds of returning cargo inside the MPLM. The crew also installed the control and power assemblies in the hatch leading into the MPLM. On the next day, the controllers were used to drive the bolts to release the MPLM from Node 2.|$|E
30|$|The {{integration}} of transport logistics hubs via <b>logistics</b> <b>modules,</b> which select between several predefined transport chains, {{is a more}} sophisticated method. A decisive influence on the consideration of hubs within <b>logistics</b> <b>modules</b> is the properties of shipments (e.g., commodity, shipment size). Due to the characteristics of hubs there are often limits in handling certain shipments. If hubs are not suitable to handle a certain shipments, the likelihood of transportation via these hubs will be reduced. Different transport chains, processing only via certain hubs, {{are the result of}} that consideration. In this manner, the characteristics of hubs in combination with the characteristics of shipments determine the utilization and impact of hubs or transport demand respectively. Another aspect of integrating logistics hubs into modelling is the inclusion of further hub characteristics that excess the characteristics mentioned above (capability of handling certain shipments). The {{integration of}} information about differences in technologies used at hubs, for instance, can turn out to be very helpful if used technologies vary significantly. This way offers the possibility to a more nuanced consideration of hubs if they differ regarding their characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|The International Standard Payload Rack {{is too big}} to {{fit through}} the Russian probe and drogue docking system, APAS, or NDS docking systems, and {{therefore}} cannot be transferred directly from a Progress, ATV, Space Shuttle, or Orion to the ISS.In the past ISPRs were delivered in Multi-Purpose <b>Logistics</b> <b>Modules,</b> which were carried in the Space Shuttle cargo bay and berthed to CBM ports.
