Adaptations for seniors take into account the most common physical impairments affecting the elderly. For example, a common cause of serious injury for seniors is falling inside the home. Adding handrails and grab bars throughout the home, particularly in bathrooms and along stairways, helps reduce the risk of falling. Other adaptations that improve accessibility for seniors include: easy-to-reach work and storage areas in the kitchen; reaching devices to grab objects on high shelves; <b>lever</b> <b>handles</b> on doors; toilet seat risers; walk-in showers; and bathtub and shower seats.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} and basic type of door handle is the Lever latch door handle on a {{backplate}} found in residential houses and commercial and public buildings. Doors fitted with this handle has a latch {{which is used to}} keep the door shut. The door handle features only a <b>lever</b> <b>handle</b> which operates this latch. When the handle is pushed down, the spindle rotates which “passes through the door and the tubular latch inside the door allowing the door to be opened”. This type of door handle is normally found on doors leading into the living and dining rooms as they don’t require any type of locking. The lever latch handle is also easy to install and use and is available in a variety of styles and finishes.|$|E

5000|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, under Title III, {{and many}} {{state and local}} governments {{regulate}} locksets in buildings occupied by the public. Typically, locksets that employ door knob controlled latches are forbidden for public use in favor of <b>lever</b> <b>handles,</b> which are easier to operate by gravity instead of the grasping and turning required by knobs. Many municipalities also regulate locksets in terms of fire rating, using standards determined more broadly by national or international organizations such as Underwriters Laboratories in the United States or the International Code Council, which are often supplemented by local governmental organizations, e.g. New York City's Materials and Equipment Acceptance (MEA) Division of their Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA), or by local building codes. For example, mandates of building code may outlaw, e.g., E2141/F16 [...] "Double-Keyed Deadbolt" [...] from group occupancies, or require, e.g., F93/F15 on hotel or motel doors.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Lever</b> lock door <b>handle</b> on a {{backplate}} {{is another}} type of door handle which operates similarly to the <b>lever</b> latch door <b>handle.</b> This type of handle on a backplate consists of a lever and just below it, a key hole cut. This allows a key to be inserted into the door to control a mortice sash lock. Just the like the lever latch, the door can be opened and shut by pushing the handle but can also be locked using a key. This locking mechanism is why this type of door handle is used for front and back doors of residential housing.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} aging {{successfully}} {{has become increasingly}} important as demographics shift towards an aging population. Successful aging has been defined to include (1) a low probability of disease and disease-related disability; (2) {{a high level of}} physical and cognitive functioning; and (3) an active engagement in life. The built environment can create opportunities or constraints for seniors to participate in social and productive activities. Universally designed spaces are more easily accessed and used by a spectrum of people without specialized adaptations. Thus, a universally designed environment creates opportunities for older adults to participate in these activities without the stigmatization associated with adapted or accessible designs. Providing older adults with specific universal design options (e. g., <b>lever</b> <b>handle</b> faucets) has the potential to increase the ease of completing activities of daily living, which promotes a continual engagement in life. Literature regarding universal design is promising; however, its theory requires further attention from professionals designing the built environment, evidence of the significance of its application from academics, and the embracement of its core principles from society. Overall, universal design has the potential to provide a stepping stone toward successful aging...|$|E
40|$|The 'modern ' {{bathroom}} is an {{area which}} poses considerable barriers to the elderly, specifically a mismatch between the shape and the placement of faucet handles and their physiological capabilities. Fifteen residents of a retirement facility, {{with a mean age}} of 79. 9 years, exerted their maximum turning torques in a randomized fully-crossed design incorporating the following factors: two positions (low- 21 inches and high- 42 inches), two angles (45 ' and 90 ') and three types of handles (acrylic, star, and lever). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the data indicated that the type of handle and the position, along with the covariates: age, gender and subject height, were significant at p<. O 5. Angle and the covariates: weight and arthritis were not significant, most likely because weight is correlated with height and arthritis with age. The second order interactions of handle-angle and position-angle were also significant at p<. 05. being 50 % greater than those from the acrylic and star handles. levels on the acrylic handle and the star handle were very similar, with the acrylic handle slightly superior in the 45 O-angled position and the star handle being slightly better in the 9 O 0 -angled position. Overall, the 45 O- 10 ~ position resulted in the lowest torques, while the 45 O high position resulted in the highest torques. Age had a profound effect, with torque values decreasing an average of 10 % over the 15 year age span of the subjects. Based on the study, it is recommended that plumbing systems with both high (42 inches) and low (21 inches) faucets with lever handles be installed where ever possible.

5000|$|He {{trained as}} a {{shoemaker}} in Baťa’s Zlín factory, then as locksmith and later as engineer. He studied under prominent Czech sculptor Vincenc Makovský at Zlín’s Art School from 1939 where he became interested in industrial design. He graduated there in 1943. He continued to work at Zlín for Baťa creating body designs for vertical drilling machines. In 1947 he founded an industrial design studio in the Zlín Technical College. From 1959 he taught at the Institute of Arts & Crafts in Prague. Kovář was also a sculptor. His industrial designs involved projects for scissor and tool <b>handles,</b> <b>lever</b> door <b>handles,</b> sewing machines, lathes, typewriters, film projectors, record players. His most well-known proposals are for the Tatra truck bodies for types T137 and T138 (1956-1958) and studies for the passenger car Tatra T603 (1954). His design for scissors handles in 1952 anticipated similar product designed products produced in the West, such as Olaf Backstrom's excellent scissors (1960), produced by Fiskars in 1967.|$|R

40|$|Traditional manual wheelchairs require {{considerable}} use {{and control}} of both arms for operation, thus adaptations are required for individuals with asymmetrical use of their arms. Building upon previous projects, {{the goal of this}} project was to create an accessory, to be installed on a standard wheelchair, which would allow full control of the wheelchair with only one arm/hand while addressing areas lacking in commercial products and previous designs, such as manufacturability, attendant control, user comfort and ergonomics. After preliminary testing and analysis of three one-arm propulsion designs (Meyra lever-operated chair, Quickie dual-pushrim chair, and the 2005 - 06 MQP’s prototype), the project team developed a design for a removable, lever-operated accessory which could be adapted to fit a range of the most popular standard wheelchair models. The propulsion system, connected to the main lever by a coupler link, consists of a dual gear-pawl assembly in which the desired direction of motion is chosen by moving a shifter to engage one of the two gears press-fit around clutches, each of which allows motion in only one direction, either forward or reverse. By including a neutral pawl position in which neither clutch is engaged, this design allows an attendant to propel and control the chair. Disc brakes mounted to each of the two wheels are operated via a brake lever attached to the handle of the main propulsion lever. The steering design consists of a cable wrapped around two pulleys. One pulley, attached to the main <b>lever</b> <b>handle,</b> transmits the user’s input to the second pulley at the caster wheel, causing the caster to turn. Careful attention was paid to minimizing the number of specialized parts and hardware used in the design in order to improve its manufacturability and ease of installation, and to minimize the need for maintenance. During final testing, the team’s prototype was compared to the Meyra lever-operated wheelchair and the prototype from the 2005 - 06 MQP by Cassidy, et al. The 2008 - 09 wheelchair showed considerable improvement over the prior MQP in the areas of size, required propulsion force, and user comfort. The 2008 - 09 MQP was also successful in greatly reducing operational noise and safety hazards due to sharp edges and moving parts. Deficiencies in the 2008 - 09 design included mechanical disadvantage in the steering system, excessive weight, and failure due to stress concentrations in the accessory mounting spokes...|$|E
