40|$|This paper {{studies the}} <b>last</b> <b>departure</b> time from a queue with a {{terminating}} arrival process. This problem {{is motivated by}} a model of two-stage inspection in which finitely many items come to a first stage for screening. Items failing first-stage inspection go to a second stage to be examined further. Assuming that arrivals at the second stage {{can be regarded as}} an independent thinning of the departures from the first stage, the arrival process at the second stage is approximately a terminating Poisson process. If the failure probabilities are not con-stant, then this Poisson process will be nonhomogeneous. The <b>last</b> <b>departure</b> time from an Mt/G/ ∞ queue with a terminating arrival process serves as a remarkably tractable approxi-mation, which is appropriate when there are ample inspection resources at the second stage. For this model, the <b>last</b> <b>departure</b> time is a Poisson random maximum, so that is possible to give exact expressions and develop useful approximations based on extreme-value theory. Key words: queues with terminating arrival processes, <b>last</b> <b>departure</b> time, infinite-server queues, non-stationary queues, congestion caused by inspection, two-stage inspection, extreme-value theory.

40|$|M. Cur. The aim {{with this}} study is to {{describe}} guidelines for curriculation, with primary health care as <b>departure</b> <b>point.</b> This study is based on the Judeo-Christian human and world premise and philosophy. The Nursing Theory for the Whole Person serves as meta-theoretic <b>departure</b> <b>point,</b> while the theoretic assumptions are based on: The Nursing Theory for the Whole Person (Oral Roberts University, Anna Vaughn School of Nursing, 1990). Van Niekerk's, Accompaniment Guidelines for Theory - Practice Correlation (1993). Curriculation Models of Malan & Jorrisen (1990) and Uys (1983). Klopper's Model for Accompanied selfstudy in Nursing Science (1994). The Botes's Model for Research in Nursing Science serves as methodological <b>departure</b> <b>point</b> (1991). Emphasis is placed on participative decision making regarding basic needs, including health care, within the ideology of the new Government of National unity (ANC, 1994 : 45) The Reconstruction and Development Programme, (RDP) accepted within the new political dispensation of South Africa, supports primary health care as total <b>departure</b> <b>point,</b> such as the National health Plan (ANC, 1994 : 45). This, however, is not a new concept in health care services. The South African Nursing Council (SANC) has been supporting this principle for a considerable time. However {{there is little or no}} existing literature regarding the curriculation of the four year diploma programme, with primary health care as the <b>departure</b> <b>point.</b> This Qualitative study is executed in four phases. The first and second phase explore and describe the perceptions and interpretations of the share holders of the curriculum, in respect of primary health care as <b>departure</b> <b>point,</b> within curriculums, in terms of focus group interviews. The third phase describes a conceptual framework, according to a comprehensive literature study. Phase four describes guidelines for the facilitation of meso and micro curriculation, with primary health care as <b>departure</b> <b>point,</b> in respect of inferential data obtained from focus group interviews, the literature study and conceptual framework. The study's unique contribution, within the context of the Mpumalanga region is embodied in the manner in which the researcher succeeds to describe guidelines for curriculation for the four year diploma programme, that leads to registration as Professional Nurse (General-, Psychiatric-, and Community-) and Midwife, with primary health care as the <b>departure</b> <b>point.</b> This was achieved through inductive deliberation and cross triangulation in all four phases, which increases the trustworthiness of the study...|$|R
