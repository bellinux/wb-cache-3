40|$|AbstractObjective: Transmyocardial laser revascularization is an investigational {{technique}} for revascularizing ischemic myocardium {{in patients with}} inoperable coronary arterial disease. This study tests the hypothesis that laser revascularization prevents left ventricular functional deterioration and aneurysm formation after acute anteroapical myocardial infarction. Methods: An ultrasonic ascending aortic flow probe and snares around the distal left anterior descending and second diagonal coronary arteries were placed in 26 Dorsett hybrid sheep. Ten to 14 days later, snared arteries were occluded to produce an anteroapical infarction of 23 % of left ventricular mass. Before infarction 14 animals had 34 ± 4 transmyocardial perforations {{in the area of}} the anticipated infarction made with a carbon dioxide laser. Twelve animals served as controls. Hemodynamic measurements and transdiaphragmatic quantitative echocardiograms were obtained before, immediately after, and 2, 5, and 8 weeks after infarction. Eighteen sheep completed the protocol. Results: All animals had large anteroapical left ventricular aneurysms with massive ventricular enlargement. Immediately after infarction the anterior wall became thinner and dyskinetic in all sheep. At 8 weeks aneurysmal size and shape were indistinguishable between groups. Two days after infarction, laser holes were filled with fibrin. At 5 and 8 weeks the infarct consisted of dense collagen, fibroblasts, scattered calcifications, myocyte fragments, neutrophils, macrophages, and no laser holes. There were no significant differences at any time between groups for cardiac pressures or output, ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, stroke work, and the stroke work–left ventricular end-diastolic pressure index.

40|$|The {{small size}} and {{heterogeneity}} {{of the pores}} in bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) hydrogels limit the ingrowth of cells and their use as tissue-engineered implant materials. The use of placeholders during BNC biosynthesis or post-processing steps such as (touch-free) <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> can overcome this limitation. Since three-dimensionally arranged channels may be required for homogeneous and functional seeding, three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> of never-dried BNC hydrogels was performed. Never-dried BNC hydrogels were produced in different shapes by: (i) the cultivation of Gluconacetobacter xylinus (DSM 14666; synonym Komagataeibacter xylinus) in nutrient medium; (ii) the removal of bacterial residues/media components (0. 1 M NaOH; 30 min; 100 °C) and repeated washing (deionized water; pH 5. 8); (iii) the unidirectional or 3 -D <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> and cutting (pulsed CO 2 Rofin SC × 10 laser; 220 μm channel diameter); and (iv) the final autoclaving (2 M NaOH; 121 °C; 20 min) and washing (pyrogen-free water). In comparison to unmodified BNC, unidirectionally perforated – and particularly 3 -D-perforated – BNC allowed ingrowth into and movement of vital bovine/human chondrocytes throughout the BNC nanofiber network. <b>Laser</b> <b>perforation</b> caused limited structural modifications (i. e. fiber or globular aggregates), but no chemical modifications, as indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron scattering and viability tests.

In the first study, IQF blueberries were treated with varying degrees of <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> (i. e., 3 levels of perforation density x 3 levels of perforation depth = 9 treatment combinations) and then subjected to stepwise sugar infusion using low solution concentration increments (5 °Brix/day) to a final °Brix of 70 with a high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) solution. The effects of the perforation density: depth combinations were evaluated against a traditional mechanical treatment in terms of fruit weight change and final product characteristics. A clear, systematic tendency of increasing final fruit weight was observed as the two perforation parameters were increased. The increase in the two parameters also contributed to producing infused blueberries that were maintaining the original shape and appearance with reduced product shrinkage and texture hardening as a result of enhanced solute impregnation. Due to the invasive nature of the treatment, blueberries that were subjected to the mechanical treatment showed considerable rupture {{at the end of the}} infusion process. The second study was carried out under a sugar infusion condition using higher solution concentration increments (10, 20 and 30 °Brix/day). Due to the increased osmotic gradient, the time required for the fruit to reach the target soluble solid content (70 ± 0. 5 °Brix) was markedly shortened. A systematic increase in the final fruit weight with increasing perforation density and depth was again observed. However, only the fruit that was subjected to the greatest <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> exhibited promoted solute gain, thereby attaining a moderate final process yield with reduced product shrinkage.

40|$|Abstract. This {{study focused}} on {{investigating}} the Nd:YAG <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> process of several common plastic films including biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP), biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate (BOPET) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) films. Films were perforated under various pulse energies of 50, 150 and 250 mJ and with pulse duration of ~ 10 ns and pulse repetition of 1 Hz. It was found that, BOPP, BOPET and LDPE films could be perforated using our developed Nd:YAG laser perforating system. Perforation width or diameters of all films increased with increasing pulse energies. Observed perforations were different among the three film types. For instance, at the pulse energy of 150 mJ, average microperforation diameters of BOPP, BOPET, and LDPE were 51. 9, 57. 5, and 31. 0 microns, respectively. Overall results clearly demonstrated that a Nd:YAG <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> process {{used in this study}} was effective in developing breathable packaging films with tailored oxygen permeation property. Commercial BOPP films containing 200 - 1, 400 micro-perforations/m 2 (average perforation diameter of 50 µm) showed a significant improvement in oxygen transmission rates (OTR) of 25 - 700 % over that of the regular BOPP. Very high OTR films of 16, 000 cc/m 2. day could be effectively produced for the micro-perforated BOPP, where OTR values of close to 20, 000 cc/m 2. day was obtainable in the case of BOPET films...|$|E

When compared to its competitors; the HPFL represents a technology that is more cost effective to operate, capable of remote operations, and requires considerably less maintenance and repair. Work performed under this contract included design and implementation of laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of high power laser energy on a variety of rock types. All previous laser/rock interaction tests were performed on samples in the lab at atmospheric pressure. To determine the effect of downhole pressure conditions, a sophisticated tri-axial cell was designed and tested. For the first time, Berea sandstone, limestone and clad core samples were lased under various combinations of confining, axial and pore pressures. Composite core samples consisted of steel cemented to rock in an effort to represent material penetrated in a cased hole. The results of this experiment will assist {{in the development of a}} downhole <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> or side tracking prototype tool. To determine how this promising laser would perform under high pressure in-situ conditions, GTI performed a number of experiments with results directly comparable to previous data. Experiments were designed to investigate the effect of laser input parameters on representative reservoir rock types of sandstone and limestone. The focus of the experiments was on laser/rock interaction under confining pressure as would be the case for all drilling and completion operations. As such, the results would be applicable to drilling, perforation, and side tracking applications. In the past, several combinations of laser and rock variables were investigated at standard conditions and reported in the literature. More recent experiments determined the technical feasibility of <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> on multiple samples of rock, cement and steel. The fiber laser was capable of penetrating these materials under a variety of conditions, to an appropriate depth, and with reasonable energy requirements.

In order to treat arteriosclerotic vessel lumen stenoses and prevent restenoses after angioplasties local drug-delivery during intervention has been suggested. Within four examination modules a method for MR-guided percutaneous angioplastie and dilatation of vascular stenoses with simultaneous substance application into the vessel wall could be acquired. The experiments were performed with specifically modified catheters inside a 1, 5 Tesla MRI-Scanner. The membranes of the balloon catheters were perforated by a <b>laser,</b> inducing <b>perforations</b> of diameter 10 - 20 µm, through which a solution marked with a contrast-medium and containing Evans blue dye disperse during inflation. In the first instance the suitability of the catheter was investigated with a phantom trial. The emission of the gadodiamid charged agent through the perforations could be visualized by real-time imaging. Within the second examination module the catheter was approved in a cadaver study and at this verified whether the substance could permeate the tissue. In the third module the effectiveness of the catheter was examined in the vital circulation of pigs. Based on the results of the examination modules 1 - 3, the dilatation of experimental peripheric stenoses in an animal model was performed in the fourth examination module. At the same time the diffusion of the contrast-medium marked solution into the vessel wall and the dissemination in the tissue could be demonstrated. The contrast-medium, which had entered the tissue, could be detected in T 1 -weighted sequences. The generated intensity enhancement in the penetrated areas as well as the contrast enhancement were significant in each experiment (p < 0, 01). By this the effecttive enrichment of the substance inside the tissue is shown. In the subsequent pathological analyses of the vessel preparations the infiltration of Evans-blue dye could be substantiated in all vascular layers both macroscopically as well as microscopically. The experimentally placed stenoses could be demonstrated, assessed and localised prior to the dilatations by magnetic resonance angiography. Angiographies subsequent to the interventions showed the effective expansion of the narrowings in all experiments.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{immediate}} and medium term results of transcatheter laser valvotomy with balloon valvoplasty in selected infants with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Tertiary cardiac unit. PATIENTS: All infants with pulmonary atresia and intact septum {{with no more}} than minor tricuspid valve hypoplasia referred between November 1990 and June 1995. Laser valvotomy was attempted in nine infants of median age 4 - 5 days and median weight 3. 6 kg. INTERVENTION: The pulmonary valve was perforated using a 0. 018 inch fibreoptic guidewire attached to a NdYag laser and introduced through a catheter positioned beneath the valve. After perforation the valve was dilated with progressively larger balloons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Successful laser valvotomy and balloon dilatation, complications, pulse oximetry, right ventricular outflow velocities, and need for surgical treatment. RESULTS: Valvotomy was successful in all but one case, the failure being due to <b>laser</b> breakdown. After <b>perforation</b> the valve was dilated to 6 - 8 mm diameter.

In vitro fertilization of oocytes from fetuin-B-deficient mice only worked after rendering the ZP penetrable by <b>laser</b> <b>perforation.</b> Mechanistically, fetuin-B sustains fertility by inhibiting ovastacin, a cortical granula protease known to trigger ZP hardening.

Much research has been done on perforation onto lidding film. This research is based on the attempt of perforating on the tray materials : uncoated paperboard and paperboard coated with PE polymer or PET polymer. The study was an approach to the perforations on the paperboard and how to design its patterns. The study focused on to which degree does the perforation influences the strength of the paperboard materials. The diameter and the shape of perforations were observed. The GTR and WVTR of the materials were tested. From the comparison of 25 patterns, it is inferred that the better tensile strength could be achieved when the micro-holes placed with more distance and more uniformly. The less perforation done on horizontal direction of the sample, the better tensile properties it gains. The less destructing rows made on the samples, the better tensile strength the sample gets. More even and straight fraction surfaces appeared in MD samples, while CD samples also have slant and more layered fraction surfaces. Tensile strength in MD is close to two times higher than CD samples. These results are caused by the orientation of the fibers. The appearance differences between micro-holes of the three materials are quite obvious. For manual made perforated hole, the surface is not smooth enough. For laser made perforation, the paperboard got discoloration due to <b>laser,</b> <b>perforation</b> on uncoated board is more flat, outstanding ring circles appeared on PET and PE boards, and a few bubbles could be seen around the ring circle of PET coated board.

30|$|Numerical {{modelling}} of <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> on limestone and granite {{samples were}} performed {{for the study}} of thermal and mechanical stresses. With an increase in confining pressure, the thermo-mechanical stress increases rapidly within the range 16  MPa, whereas temperature is relatively stable under high lateral pressures over the same range. Stronger samples have higher thermo-mechanical stress and strain. In limestone and granite samples, higher stresses were generated in the saturated samples compared to dry samples as a result of laser drilling, while maximum temperature created in water-saturated samples are less than dry and oil-saturated samples. It can thus be concluded that the thermo-mechanical stress and strain developed in the rock has a direct relationship with the drilling specific energy, in which the quantity of essential specific energy, thermo-mechanical stress and strain increases, with an increase in the amount of compressive strength. Also, the finite element method can be considered as an efficient tool for analysing temperature and thermo-mechanical stresses induced by laser drilling due to fast response and high performance.|$|E

The changed liquid water distribution is visualized using synchrotron radiography and ESEM liquid water imaging. The observed effects are correlated with in-situ performance characteristics, pre-assembly and post-mortem analysis to examine on the beneficial and obstructive effects of the modifications. The analysis reveals that laser-perforation results in PTFE loss and hydrophilic regions which results in a good performance at dry conditions but serious flooding at high humidification conditions. Machined perforations show beneficial effects in the in-situ performance characteristics at high humidification conditions. A draining of {{the vicinity of the}} perforations is observed which results in an improved oxygen diffusivity. Water balancing and synchrotron visualization indicate that under the analyzed operating conditions the MPL increases the humidification of the ionomer on the one hand but creates an additional diffusion barrier by liquid water in the interface between the cathode catalyst layer and the MPL on the other hand...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} study {{kinetics}} of modulation by intracellular Mg(2 +) of cardiac gap junction (Mg(2 +) gate). Paired myocytes of guinea-pig ventricle were superfused with solutions containing various concentrations of Mg(2 +). In order to rapidly apply Mg(2 +) to {{one aspect of}} the gap junction, the non-junctional membrane of one of the pair was perforated at nearly the connecting site by pulses of nitrogen laser beam. The gap junction conductance (G(j)) was measured by clamping the membrane potential of the other cell using two-electrode voltage clamp method. The <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> immediately increased G(j), followed by slow G(j) change with time constant of 3. 5 s at 10 mM Mg(2 +). Mg(2 +) more than 1. 0 mM attenuated dose-dependently the gap junction conductance and lower Mg(2 +) (0. 6 mM) increased G(j) with a Hill coefficient of 3. 4 and a half-maximum effective concentration of 0. 6 mM. The time course of G(j) changes was fitted by single exponential function, and the relationship between the reciprocal of time constant and Mg(2 +) concentration was almost linear. Based on the experimental data, a mathematical model of Mg(2 +) gate with one open state and three closed states well reproduced experimental results. One-dimensional cable model of thirty ventricular myocytes connected to the Mg(2 +) gate model suggested a pivotal role of the Mg(2 +) gate of gap junction under pathological conditions...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{performance of}} PEM fuel cells water transport in Gas Diffusion Layer {{becomes more and}} more a critical aspect. High humidity conditions, which are favoured for proton conducting membranes, enhance the problem of water condensation and removal. A well designed GDL can help to avoid critical operation conditions, which can decrease performance and lifetime. One way of possible improvement is to add artificial pore paths to the porous GDL structure. Vertically arranged paths can guide liquid water more easily from the electrode to the channel due to the lowered capillary pressure. To achieve this, <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> and mechanical milling were used to apply perforations to the GDL. From former investigations, it is known that natural cracks in Micro Porous Layer (MPL) serve as transport ways for liquid water. GDL with separately perforated MPL are considered in this work as well. For investigation of liquid water transport, synchrotron radiography and tomography have proven to be suitable measurement techniques. Thus, water transport dynamics and 3 D water distribution were analyzed regarding to the influence of the different perforation techniques. It showed that perforations fill with water under high humidity conditions and may serve as transport ways, as well. By comparing laser and mechanical treated GDL, a difference in the filling behaviour was observed. Laser treated material looses PTFE content due to high temperatures and the perforation area gets hydrophilic, whereas mechanical treatment showed less influence to the surface properties of the surroundings. This result was proved by EDX measurements (F distribution) and by hydro head analysis (influence on water transport behaviour). Finally, performance tests showed the difference between the perforation techniques and different perforation diameters. It has been proven that perforating of GDL enhances the performance compared to unperforated material, especially under high humidity conditions...|$|E
40|$|The gas {{diffusion}} layer (GDL) plays {{a crucial role}} for PEM fuel cell performance. The main requirements of a GDL are the provision of a gas and water transport as well a significant electrical and thermal conductivity. For the development of PEMFC diffusion media the still unknown influence of the micro porous layer (MPL) on fuel cell performance is a major obstacle. Therefore a self-supporting MPL was developed because it allows basically to measure the properties of the MPL separately from the substrate. This MPL consists of a thin nonwoven of synthetics coated on one side with a mixture of carbon and PTFE produced by the dry spraying technology. For in-situ experiments and some ex-situ measurements these layers are pressed with the non coated side on a commercial GDL without MPL (Sigracet® GDL 25 BA from SGL). To get a correlation of the global intrinsic properties of the MPL, like through-plane permeability, electrical conductivity or hydrophobicity, to fuel cell performance, Ucell(i) -curves up to limiting current densities and electrochemical impedance spectra are measured in a 5 cm² fuel cell setup. Additionally the function of the MPL structure on water distribution is investigated. Synchrotron radiography studies proved the importance of liquid water pathways through the porous structure for the water management. These pathways can be formed by natural cracks in the MPL and the texture of the carbon fibre substrate or by artificial pore paths through the GDL. With artificial paths in a carbon fiber GDL produced by <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> an overall performance gain has been obtained. In the presented work, we performed further experiments to investigate the influence of artificial pores in the MPL on the water management. Therefore the liquid water transport of nonperforated GDL/MPLs is compared to the perforation of both layers {{as well as to the}} exclusive perforation of MPL and the GDL, by means of in-situ synchrotron imaging...|$|E
40|$|Li-Ion {{batteries}} {{are commonly used}} in portable electronic devices due to their outstanding energy and power density. A remaining issue which hinders the breakthrough e. g. in the automotive sector is the high production cost. Going ‘giga’ is one approach currently pursued but requires large investments. Recently, battery concepts with thick electrodes were presented as attractive alternative 1. Batteries with thicker electrodes provide higher theoretical energy densities {{with only a few}} electrode layers which reduces production time and cost 2. In our contribution we present 3 D micro-structure resolved simulations of thick (electrodes > 300 µm) Graphite-NMC batteries based on our thermodynamically consistent simulation framework BEST 3. The parametrization and validation of our model is presented in a recent publication 4 and simulation results agree favourably with experimental data 2. As a major problem we identified transport limitations in the electrolyte at comparatively small C-rates 2, 4. Novel design and operation strategies of the battery and its components are needed to mitigate this issue. In this presentation we will focus on our on-going electrode design studies. Two different design concepts using <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> and/or porosity gradients were evaluated regarding their performance at high C-rates. Therefore, multiple realizations of electrode structures were generated with a stochastic 3 D geometry generator 5. The structures and corresponding electrochemical simulations were validated against tomography and experimental data of model electrodes. The virtual screening of different configurations provides material-structure-function relationships which are a helpful tool for the processing of thick electrodes on larger scales. 1. 	Hopkins, B.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell has a strong dependence of its water management. The membrane needs humidity to have sufficient ion conductivity. But at high humidity, especially at high current densities, flooding of the electrodes can occur and consequently the available active area begins to decrease. The primary purpose of a micro porous layer (MPL) on a gas diffusion layer (GDL) is the effective wicking of liquid water from the catalyst layer into the diffusion media as well as reducing electrical contact resistance with the adjacent layers. In synchrotron radiography studies the importance of liquid water pathways through the porous structure for the water management is proven. These pathways can be formed by natural cracks in the MPL and {{the texture of the}} carbon fibre substrate or by artificial pore paths through the GDL. With artificial paths in a carbon fibre GDL produced by <b>laser</b> <b>perforation</b> an overall performance gain has been obtained. To get additional information about the function of the MPL as an interconnection between the reaction layer and the macro porous carbon fibre substrate a self-supporting MPL was developed. This allows the manufacturing and the following treatments of the MPL independent from the GDL substrate. This MPL consists of a thin nonwoven of synthetics coated on one side with a mixture of carbon and PTFE produced by the dry spraying technology. It is possible to perforate this layer alone and press it with the non-coated side on a commercial GDL without MPL (Sigracet® GDL 25 BA from SGL). Thus it was feasible to perform experiments for investigation of the influence of artificial pores in the MPL on the water management. As a consequence, the liquid water transport of non-perforated GDL/MPLs is compared to the perforation of both layers {{as well as to the}} exclusive perforation of MPL and the GDL, by means of in-situ synchrotron imaging. Further measurements, in particular Ucell(i) -curves up to limiting current densities and electrochemical impedance spectra were done in a 5 cm² fuel cell setup, to obtain a correlation of the global intrinsic properties of the MPL, like through-plane permeability, electrical conductivity or hydrophobicity, with fuel cell performance. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{requirements}} of a gas diffusion layer (GDL) of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are the provision of a gas and water transport {{as well as a}} significant electrical and thermal conductivity. The development of membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) for a wide temperature range (- 20 °C until + 130 °C) still favours membranes that require a certain level of humidification for sufficient proton conductivity. For the improvement of PEMFC diffusion media for these conditions, the still mostly unknown influence of the micro porous layer (MPL) on fuel cell performance is a major obstacle. An important function of the cathode side MPL at high temperature operation of PEMFCs is the prevention of membrane drying. However, concurrently a flooding of porous structures in the GDL or catalyst layers at lower temperatures has to be avoided. To get an insight that could lead to an improved GDL design for a broad range of operating conditions, a self-supporting MPL was developed, because this allows the manufacturing and the following treatments of the MPL independent from the GDL substrate. This MPL consists of a thin nonwoven synthetics coated on one side with a mixture of carbon and PTFE produced with the dry spraying technology.
