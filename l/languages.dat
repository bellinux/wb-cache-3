5|$|All spoken <b>languages</b> have phonemes of {{at least}} two {{different}} categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables. As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some <b>languages</b> also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many <b>languages,</b> for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called suprasegmental. Some <b>languages</b> have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas <b>languages</b> like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes. In sign <b>languages,</b> the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.|$|E
5|$|Although English is {{the common}} {{language}} of Westeros, the producers charged linguist David J.

It {{has been reported that}} during the series these fictional <b>languages</b> have been heard by more people than the Welsh, Irish, and Scots Gaelic <b>languages</b> combined.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{feature of}} Tolkien's Elvish <b>languages</b> was his {{development}} of a complex internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe.

5|$|As a philologist, Tolkien's {{interest}} in <b>languages</b> {{led him to}} invent several <b>languages</b> of his own as a pastime. In considering the nature of who might speak these <b>languages,</b> and what stories they might tell, Tolkien again turned {{to the concept of}} elves.|$|E
5|$|As for the {{classification}} of the Mongolic family relative to other <b>languages,</b> the Altaic theory (which is increasingly less well received among linguists) proposes that the Mongolic family {{is a member of}} a larger, now discredited Altaic family that would also include the Turkic and Tungusic, and usually Koreanic <b>languages</b> and Japonic <b>languages</b> as well.|$|E

5|$|English and French are {{recognized}} by the Constitution of Canada as official <b>languages.</b> All federal government laws are thus enacted in both English and French, with government services available in both <b>languages.</b> Two of Canada's territories give official status to indigenous <b>languages.</b> In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official <b>languages</b> alongside the national <b>languages</b> of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government.

5|$|English is an Indo-European language, and {{belongs to}} the West Germanic group of the Germanic <b>languages.</b> Old English {{originated}} from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum {{along the coast of}} the North Sea, whose <b>languages</b> are now known as the Anglo-Frisian subgroup within West Germanic. As such, the modern Frisian <b>languages</b> are the closest living relatives of Modern English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian <b>languages,</b> and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic, though this grouping remains debated. Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English. Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other English (Anglic) <b>languages,</b> including Scots and the extinct Fingallian and Forth and Bargy (Yola) dialects of Ireland.|$|E

50|$|A first <b>language,</b> native <b>language</b> {{or mother}} tongue (also known as father tongue, {{arterial}} <b>language</b> or L1) is a <b>language</b> {{that a person}} has been exposed to from birth or within the critical period.

5|$|FPGAs can be {{programmed}} with hardware description <b>languages</b> such as VHDL or Verilog. However, programming in these <b>languages</b> can be tedious.

5|$|However, <b>languages</b> {{differ from}} {{biological}} organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other <b>languages</b> {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different <b>languages</b> come into contact.

5|$|In his 1707 work Archaeologia Britannica Edward Lhuyd, {{keeper of}} the Ashmolean Museum, noted the {{similarity}} between the two Celtic language families: Brythonic or P–Celtic (Breton, Cornish and Welsh); and Goidelic or Q–Celtic (Irish, Manx and Scottish Gaelic). He argued that the Brythonic <b>languages</b> originated in Gaul (France), and that the Goidelic <b>languages</b> originated in the Iberian Peninsula. Lhuyd concluded that as the <b>languages</b> had been of Celtic origin, the people who spoke those <b>languages</b> were Celts. (According to a more recent hypothesis, also widely embraced today, Goidelic and Brythonic <b>languages,</b> collectively known as Insular Celtic <b>languages,</b> evolved together for some time separately from Continental Celtic <b>languages</b> such as Gaulish and Celtiberian.) From the 18th century, the peoples of Brittany, Cornwall, Ireland, Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales were known increasingly as Celts, and they are regarded as the modern Celtic nations today.|$|E
