50|$|The small <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> or <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> (Erebia epiphron) is a {{butterfly}} of the Nymphalidae family. It {{is found in}} mountainous regions of southern and central Europe.|$|R
50|$|Butler's ringlet is {{visually}} {{similar to}} the black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet,</b> Percnodaimon pluto. The two species may be differentiated by where the individual in question is sighted. Butler's ringlet prefers to fly over vegetation, settling among snow-tussock, subalpine shrubs and herbaceous flowers, whereas the black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> tends to congregate over rock and scree.|$|R
50|$|Its Māori name is pepe pouri, {{which means}} dark moth, and shares the name {{with the black}} <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> and the forest ringlet butterfly.|$|R
5000|$|Percnodaimon is a {{monotypic}} genus of satyrid butterflies in {{the family}} Nymphalidae. Its sole species, Percnodaimon merula, the black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet,</b> is endemic to New Zealand. Its Māori name is pepe pouri, which means [...] "dark moth".|$|R
5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the last}} ice age, small populations of arctic-alpine plants have survived in {{favourable}} spots on rock ledges high in the eastern coves. Rare to Britain species of alpine butterfly, the <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet,</b> also live on and around Helvellyn.|$|R
50|$|The adult female black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> {{deposits}} {{her eggs}} atop stones on the alpine slopes. When {{the sun is}} out it heats these stone's exposed surface, acting as an incubator for the eggs. This behaviour is unique among New Zealand butterflies and is only seen {{in a handful of}} butterfly species occupying the Himalayas and European Alps.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 the RSPB leased two farms {{from the}} {{landowner}} United Utilities. The {{aim is to}} combine the improvement of wildlife habitats and water quality with running a viable sheep farm.Moorland and woodland habitats are being improved for birds {{as well as the}} rare small <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> butterfly. Measures include grip blocking, heather replanting, juniper woodland planting (especially in the ghylls).|$|R
50|$|Not much {{research}} has been conducted on the black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet,</b> and although {{it is one of the}} few endemic species of butterfly New Zealand has, it is still a field where more can be learned from. Because they inhabit the intrepid Southern Alps, it is difficult to predict the exact distribution, but it is believed that they can be found through the mountain range.|$|R
50|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the butterfly}} also {{plays an important}} physiological role. Its dark wings coupled with its large surface area acts as a black body, and absorbs the electromagnetic energy from the sun's rays. By absorbing and storing heat, {{the wings of the}} black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> butterfly essentially act like solar panels. This is another adaptation evolved for survival in the frosty conditions of the Southern Alps.|$|R
50|$|Galium saxatile is a {{perennial}} matt-forming herb, found on grassland, moors, heaths and woods. It can reach {{a height of}} 20 cm, and flowers in the UK from May to August. The stems are hairless and four sided. Its leaves are 8 - 25 mm long, with 6-8 per whorl, and are lanceolate or obovate in shape. The <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> butterfly uses the plant for nectar.|$|R
50|$|Larval colours {{can vary}} from dull grey to brown, but contain black {{anterior}} setae. The black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> larvae have five instars which take about a month each in pleasant summer temperatures, but {{can take up to}} eight months if it occurs over winter. For this reason the butterfly can stay in its larval stage for up to two years and can be found almost year round in an instar stage.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of {{pupation}} the black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> turns grey with brown speckles to match the surrounding stones. During the actual process however, the butterfly has another interesting strategy; the pupae suspend themselves horizontally (unlike most butterflies) against the under surface of a rock and hold themselves to the surface by a cremaster, a hook shaped protuberance near the abdominal area. Pupae have been found up to 3 {{feet away from the}} nearest food plant and emerge as adult butterflies emerge 2 to 3 weeks later.|$|R
5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid grassland species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) on the summit ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} that, the small grass, Poa colensoi was a food source for these larvae. This grass is common throughout the Southern Alps, {{but it appears}} that the larvae are present only where the grass grows adjacent to rocky areas. The black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> larvae are known night feeders and have been spotted feeding on the tips of tussock blades. The larvae spend little time feeding, but instead choose to conceal themselves in nearby hiding spots. This is to prevent them being preyed upon by aerial predators, which can easily spot them atop tussock grass blades.|$|R
25|$|The term <b>Lesser</b> Caucasus <b>Mountains</b> {{is often}} used to {{describe}} the mountainous (highland) areas of southern Georgia that are connected to the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range by the Likhi Range. The area can be split into two separate sub-regions; the <b>Lesser</b> Caucasus <b>Mountains,</b> which run parallel to the Greater Caucasus Range, and the Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland, which lies immediately to the south of the <b>Lesser</b> Caucasus <b>Mountains.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>lesser</b> <b>mountain</b> chain, the Serranía de Mbaracayú, also rises at {{the point}} where the Cordillera de Amambay and Cordillera de Mbaracayú meet. The Serranía de Mbaracayú extends east and then south to {{parallel}} the Río Paraná; the mountain chain has an average height of 500 m.|$|R
5000|$|The {{highest point}} is the {{impressive}} 1694 m high summit known as Doi Luang.

50|$|The Himalaya {{mountains}} of Bhutan dominate {{the north of}} the country, where peaks can easily reach 7000 m; the highest point in Bhutan is Gangkhar Puensum, which has the distinction of being the highest unclimbed mountain in the world, at 7570 m. Weather is extreme in the mountains: the high peaks have perpetual snow, and the <b>lesser</b> <b>mountains</b> and hewn gorges have high winds all year round, making them barren brown wind tunnels in summer, and frozen wastelands in winter. The blizzards generated in the north each winter often drift southward into the central highlands.|$|R
50|$|While Schunemunk, {{like many}} of the <b>lesser</b> <b>mountains</b> of the American East Coast, is {{relatively}} devoid of the usual mountaineering hazards, one fatality has occurred in the recent past. On May 22, 2002, a group of hikers was bushwhacking on a boulder slide on the southeastern side of the mountain, above Dark Hollow Brook. While ascending the slide, 76-year-old Nicholas Styranovski was struck in the head and killed when a boulder he was grasping became dislodged and fell down the mountainside. Two other hikers below were seriously injured when the boulder struck them.|$|R

50|$|The {{northern}} and western {{slopes of the}} <b>Lesser</b> Caucasus <b>Mountains</b> are characterized both by Colchian and other deciduous forests at lower elevations while mixed and coniferous forests (mainly spruce and fir) dominate at higher elevations. Beech forests are also common at higher elevations. The southern slopes of the <b>Lesser</b> Caucasus <b>Mountains</b> are largely covered by grasslands and steppes up to an elevation of 2500 m. The highest areas of the region contain alpine grasslands as well. Volcanic and other rock formations are common throughout the region. The volcanic zone extends over a large area from southern Georgia into Armenia and southwestern Azerbaijan. Some of the prominent peaks of the region include Mt. Aragats, Didi Abuli, Samsari, and others. The area is characterized by volcanic plateaus, lava flows, volcanic lakes, volcanic cones and other features. The <b>Lesser</b> Caucasus <b>Mountains</b> lack the type of glaciers and glacial features that are common on the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range.|$|R
5000|$|The {{entire region}} is {{regularly}} subjected to strong earthquakes from this activity. While the Greater Caucasus Mountains have a mainly folded sedimentary structure, the <b>Lesser</b> Caucasus <b>Mountains</b> are largely of volcanic origin.|$|R
50|$|The Caucasus Mountains {{are known}} for the high amount of snowfall, {{although}} many regions which are not located along the windward slopes do not receive nearly as much snow. This {{is especially true for}} the <b>Lesser</b> Caucasus <b>Mountains</b> which are somewhat isolated from the moist influences coming in from the Black Sea and receive considerably less precipitation (in the form of snow) than the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The average winter snow cover of the <b>Lesser</b> Caucasus <b>Mountains</b> ranges from 10 to(-) 30 cm. The Greater Caucasus Mountains (especially the southwestern slopes) are marked by heavy snowfall. Avalanches are common from November to April.|$|R
