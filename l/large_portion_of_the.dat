5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, {{out of fear}} of offending Adolf Hitler. By the time the invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A <b>large</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E

The battery {{was unable to}} shoot low enough to hit the charging cavalry, and was soon captured.

Because of their position on the field, most of the Union casualties in this encounter belonged to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry—but a <b>large</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss was from wounds that were not lethal.|$|E

By 1876 the city's population stood at 817,000. The dense population areas were not only growing north and south along the Delaware River, but also moving westward across the Schuylkill River. A <b>large</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growth came from immigrants, still mostly Irish and German. In 1870, twenty-seven percent of Philadelphia's population was born outside the United States.|$|E

5|$|The final major {{campaign}} {{in which the}} PanzerI formed a <b>large</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armoured strength was Operation Barbarossa, 22June 1941. The 3,300 German tanks included about 410 PanzerI's. By {{the end of the}} month, a <b>large</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Army found itself trapped in the Minsk pocket, and by 21September Kiev had fallen, thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on their ultimate objective, Moscow. Despite the success of Germany's armour in the Soviet Union, between June and September most German officers were shocked to find their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models, the T-34 and KV series. Army Group North quickly realized that none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could penetrate the thick armour of the KV-1. The performance of the Red Army during the Battle of Moscow and the growing numbers of new Soviet tanks made it obvious the PanzerI was not suitable for this front. Some less battle-worthy PanzerIs were tasked with towing lorries through mud to alleviate logistics problems at the front.|$|E
