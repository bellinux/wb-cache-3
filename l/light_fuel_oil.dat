2500|$|Tractors {{and heavy}} {{equipment}} were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s, running spark-ignition and low-compression engines. Thus many farm tractors {{of the era}} could burn gasoline, alcohol, kerosene, and any <b>light</b> grade of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> such as diesel <b>fuel,</b> heating <b>oil,</b> or tractor vaporising oil, according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time. On U.S. farms during this era, the name [...] "distillate" [...] often referred {{to any of the}} aforementioned <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> The engines did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting, and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to switch to distillate. Engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. Dieselization with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition) replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned.|$|R

40|$|Oil spill {{response}} and socioeconomic costs, {{and natural resource}} damages were estimated for hypothetical vessel oil spill scenarios in San Francisco Bay for three spill sizes (20 th, 50 th, and 95 th percentile) and four oil types (gasoline, diesel, heavy <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> and crude oil). Oil spread onto the water surface and into the water column, and shoreline oiling were modeled using Applied Science Associates’ stochastic modeling software, SIMAP. Response costs, natural resource damages, and socioeconomic impact were modeled and estimated based on spill trajectory and fate. Response costs were higher for mechanical recovery-based operations than for dispersant-based operations, {{as well as for}} the more persistent oils (crude and heavy <b>fuel</b> <b>oil).</b> For diesel and gasoline spills, the response costs comprised approximately 20 % of total costs, in contrast to approximately 43 % for crude and heavy <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> spills. Natural resource damages were generally higher for the more toxic <b>lighter</b> <b>fuels</b> (gasoline and diesel). The <b>lighter,</b> more toxic <b>fuels</b> tend to have a greater water column impact with less shoreline oiling leading to greater natural resource damages, while the heavier oils tend to have a greater shoreline impact with resultant higher response costs and socioeconomic costs. Socioeconomic costs varied by impact locations, but tended to override both response costs and natural resource damage costs, comprising 61 % and 76 % for gasoline and diesel spills, respectively, and 45 % and 53 % for crude and heavy <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> spills.

50|$|Diesel fuel {{is a form}} of <b>light</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> {{very similar}} to {{kerosene}} (paraffin), but diesel engines, especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems, can run {{on a wide variety of}} other fuels. Some of the most common alternatives are Jet A-1 type jet fuel or vegetable oil from a very wide variety of plants. Some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification, and most others require fairly basic alterations. Biodiesel is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines. Requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines, the ability of the fuel to lubricate the injector pump and injectors adequately, and its ignition qualities (ignition delay, cetane number). Inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater 'swirl' effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because (in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels) lipid depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low (such as starting the engine from cold).|$|E

50|$|A third-order Fresnel lens, {{which stood}} six feet in height—manufactured by Henry LePaute Cie. of Paris—was {{used for the}} lamp. This lens was invented by a Frenchman of the same name, and it quickly became popular in towers across the country. Its strong, {{efficient}} lens was able to cast light much farther than previous techniques: open flame, <b>light</b> <b>fueled</b> by whale <b>oil,</b> or small wicks. The Fresnel lens system was a great improvement over previous lenses in lighthouses, {{but it was not}} until the 1850s that it was commonly adopted in the United States and on the Great Lakes. The lens allowed only a small amount of light to “escape” - that is, disperse and not shine directly to the water and incoming vessels. Fresnel was able to do this by creating various concentric rings surrounding the lens that would bend the light, ultimately focusing it in one direction. A very intense light could thus be seen by boats on the Lakes several miles away. This advantage would be very valuable for the lake freighters or passenger steamers lost in a storm or dangerous weather that is prone to occur on the Lakes.|$|R
