The measure enabled the addition of renovated science classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and media center, and a sound-proofed music building. The parking <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> central quad were expanded, with more than 550 parking spaces in the new <b>lot,</b> <b>and</b> classrooms were equipped to be more energy efficient.|$|E

5|$|After {{planting}} the vineyards and vinting wines, Romito opened the Mount Hope Estate and Winery in 1980. To promote his new business the first year, Romito hosted several events including an art show, a bluegrass concert, a fifties revival, a country-western weekend, a classical orchestra concert, and a one-day modern jousting tournament. The jousting tournament {{was so popular}} that Romito held a two-day renaissance festival the following year in the winery's parking <b>lot,</b> <b>and</b> gradually expanded this into a permanent attraction, the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire.

The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research found them to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant <b>lot</b> <b>and</b> erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E
