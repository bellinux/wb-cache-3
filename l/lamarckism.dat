5|$|<b>Lamarckism</b> was popularised in the English-speaking {{world by}} the {{speculative}} Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.|$|E
5|$|Philosophie Zoologique ("Zoological Philosophy, or Exposition with Regard to the Natural History of Animals") is an 1809 book by the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, {{in which}} he {{outlines}} his pre-Darwinian theory of evolution now known as <b>Lamarckism.</b>|$|E
5|$|The early 19th-century {{zoologist}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck {{suggested the}} inheritance of acquired characteristics {{as a mechanism}} for evolutionary change; adaptive traits acquired by an organism during its lifetime could be inherited by that organism's progeny, eventually causing transmutation of species. This theory, <b>Lamarckism,</b> was an influence on the Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko's antagonism to mainstream genetic theory {{as late as the}} mid 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated <b>Lamarckism</b> into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of the fittest, and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.|$|E
5|$|Enquiries about insect {{pollination}} led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed {{demonstration of the}} power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating <b>Lamarckism</b> and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of <b>Lamarckism.</b> The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E
5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building on his work with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. <b>Lamarckism</b> also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, with the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian genetics, producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) was {{a member}} of the French Academy of Sciences and a {{professor}} of botany at the Jardin des Plantes and then became the first professor of zoology at the new Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. He became known for his work on the taxonomy of the invertebrates, especially of molluscs. However, he is mainly remembered for the theory that now bears his name, <b>Lamarckism,</b> and in particular his view that the environment (called by Lamarck the conditions of life) gave rise to permanent, inherited, evolutionary changes in animals. He described his theory in his 1802 Recherches sur l'organisation des corps vivants, and in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique, and later in his Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertèbres, (1815–1822).|$|E
5|$|Between 1913 and 1916, Gerhard Heilmann {{published}} {{a series of}} articles in the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society, all heavily illustrated and dealing with the question of the origin of birds. He first proposed the idea of a popular treatise on bird evolution in 1912 to Otto Helms, the editor of the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society. Helms supported the idea but recommended that Heilmann first seek professional advice on the topic. Despite the lack of formal training in zoology, Heilmann succeeded in amassing his research with the help of several others, including the expert in prehistoric animals at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen, Adolf Herluf Winge, and the biologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson of the University of Dundee. Winge, though initially showing interest in Heilmann's work, later proved {{to be a source of}} frustration by refusing to engage Heilmann in depth on various scientific queries. Heilmann eventually broke off contact, expressing some bitterness at the apparent change of heart, which Heilmann later ascribed to Winge's belief in <b>Lamarckism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin {{outlined a}} hypothesis of transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called <b>Lamarckism.</b> Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|E
5|$|In November 1844, the {{anonymously}} published popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, {{written by}} Scottish journalist Robert Chambers, widened {{public interest in}} the concept of transmutation of species. Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped {{to pave the way for}} the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, Herbert Spencer became an active proponent of <b>Lamarckism</b> and progressive development in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the term neo-Lamarckism {{came to be}} {{associated}} with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, and the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. They considered <b>Lamarckism</b> to be philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of selection acting on random variation. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. Inheritance of acquired characteristics was part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Critics of neo-Lamarckism, such as the German biologist August Weismann and Alfred Russel Wallace, pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, {{a theory}} of the {{transmutation}} of species (transformisme). Lamarck {{did not believe that}} all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as <b>Lamarckism</b> and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as <b>Lamarckism</b> and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work would contribute to a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E
25|$|So, after {{insisting on}} {{empirical}} (non-religious) evidence, he has clearly rejected <b>Lamarckism</b> {{but has not}} thought of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} this {{hypothesis}} probably {{has its roots}} in the 1890s, when it was proposed as a form of <b>Lamarckism.</b> It is important to note its historical context.|$|E
25|$|Both Darwin and {{his close}} {{supporter}} Thomas Henry Huxley freely admitted, too, that selection {{might not be}} the whole explanation; Darwin was prepared to accept a measure of <b>Lamarckism,</b> while Huxley was comfortable with both sudden (mutational) change and directed (orthogenetic) evolution.|$|E
25|$|He {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{consider}} psychology as a branch of physiology. He also proposed the kingdom Protista in 1866. His chief interests lay in evolution and life development processes in general, including development of nonrandom form, which culminated in the beautifully illustrated Kunstformen der Natur (Art forms of nature). Haeckel did not support natural selection, rather believing in <b>Lamarckism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Darlington's account {{goes further}} than other commentators. He seems to credit Lawrence with a modern {{appreciation}} of selection (which he definitely did not have); subsequently, Darlington's account was criticised as an over-statement. Darlington does not claim Lawrence actually enunciated {{a theory of}} evolution, though passages in Lawrence's book do suggest that races were historically developed. On heredity and adaptation, and the rejection of <b>Lamarckism</b> (soft inheritance), Lawrence is quite advanced.|$|E
25|$|Most later Marxists {{agreed with}} this view, but some – {{particularly}} those in the early Soviet Union – believed that evolutionary theory conflicted with their economic and social ideals. As a result, they came to support <b>Lamarckism</b> instead – the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. This led {{to the practice of}} Lysenkoism, which caused agricultural problems.|$|E
25|$|Darwin’s {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} {{laid the groundwork for}} modern evolutionary theory, and his experiments and observations showed that the organisms in populations varied from each other, that some of these variations were inherited, and that these differences could be acted on by natural selection. However, he could not explain the source of these variations. Like many of his predecessors, Darwin mistakenly thought that heritable traits were a product of use and disuse, and that features acquired during an organism's lifetime could be passed on to its offspring. He looked for examples, such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the ostrich, they could not fly at all. This misunderstanding was called the inheritance of acquired characters and was part of the theory of transmutation of species put forward in 1809 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. In the late 19th century this theory became known as <b>Lamarckism.</b> Darwin produced an unsuccessful theory he called pangenesis to try to explain how acquired characteristics could be inherited. In the 1880s August Weismann's experiments indicated that changes from use and disuse could not be inherited, and <b>Lamarckism</b> gradually fell from favor.|$|E
25|$|After Huxley {{the most}} {{important}} influence on his thought was August Weismann, the German zoologist who rejected <b>Lamarckism,</b> and wholeheartedly advocated natural selection as the key force in evolution {{at a time when}} other biologists had doubts. Weismann's separation of germplasm (genetic material) from soma (somatic cells) was an idea which took many years before its significance was generally appreciated. Lankester {{was one of the first}} to see its importance: his full acceptance of selection came after reading Weismann's essays, some of which he translated into English.|$|E
25|$|Charles Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species was {{successful}} in convincing most biologists that evolution had occurred, but was less successful in convincing them that natural selection was its primary mechanism. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, variations of <b>Lamarckism,</b> orthogenesis (progressive evolution), saltationism (evolution by jumps) and mutationism (evolution driven by mutations) were discussed as alternatives. Samuel Butler coined the term neo-Darwinism in 1880 {{to refer to the}} selectionist version of evolution advocated by Alfred Russel Wallace. Unlike Darwin, Wallace completely rejected neo-Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 three scientists, Carl Correns, Erich von Tschermak and Hugo De Vries, had rediscovered {{the work}} of Gregor Mendel, {{and with it the}} {{foundation}} of genetics. De Vries proposed that new species were created by mutation, bypassing the need for either <b>Lamarckism</b> or Darwinism. As Morgan had dismissed both evolutionary theories, he was seeking to prove De Vries' mutation theory with his experimental heredity work. He was initially skeptical of Mendel's laws of heredity (as well as the related chromosomal theory of sex determination), which were being considered as a possible basis for natural selection.|$|E
25|$|From 1920, Sanielevici was an {{isolated}} {{figure on the}} left, editing {{a new version of}} Curentul Nou and only affiliating with the popular daily Adevărul. He moved away from literary theory and, following his anthropological speculations, revived <b>Lamarckism</b> and scientific racism to formulate his own racial-sociological system. Himself a Jewish Romanian, Sanielevici attempted to undermine the racial assumptions of Nazi ideologists and local fascists, but his own interpretations of natural history were universally ridiculed. Sanielevici placed human nutrition and mastication at the core of racial distinctions, and went on to stratify artistic temperaments into racial clusters.|$|E
25|$|The {{modern era}} {{generally}} remembers Lamarck for {{a theory of}} inheritance of acquired characteristics, called soft inheritance, <b>Lamarckism</b> or use/disuse theory, which he described in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique. However, his idea of soft inheritance was, perhaps, {{a reflection of the}} wisdom of the time accepted by many natural historians. Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of biological evolution, in which an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local environments through use and disuse of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms. Scientists have debated whether advances in the field of transgenerational epigenetics mean that Lamarck was to an extent correct, or not.|$|E
25|$|August Weismann's idea, {{set out in}} his 1892 book Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance), {{was that}} the {{hereditary}} material, which he called the germ plasm, {{and the rest of}} the body (the soma) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails, demonstrated that inheritance was 'hard'. He argued strongly and dogmatically for Darwinism and against <b>Lamarckism,</b> polarising opinions among other scientists. This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to its eclipse.|$|E
25|$|From the 1880s onwards, {{there was}} a {{widespread}} belief among biologists that Darwinian evolution was in deep trouble. This eclipse of Darwinism (in Julian Huxley's phrase) {{grew out of the}} weaknesses in Darwin's account, written with an incorrect view of inheritance. Darwin himself believed in blending inheritance, which implied that any new variation, even if beneficial, would be weakened by 50% at each generation, as the engineer Fleeming Jenkin correctly noted in 1868. This in turn meant that small variations would not survive long enough to be selected. Blending would therefore directly oppose natural selection. In addition, Darwin and others considered Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics entirely possible, and Darwin's 1868 theory of pangenesis, with contributions to the next generation (gemmules) flowing {{from all parts of the}} body, actually implied <b>Lamarckism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Developments in {{genetics}} persuaded field naturalists such as Bernhard Rensch and Ernst Mayr {{to abandon}} neo-Lamarckian ideas about {{evolution in the}} early 1930s. By the late 1930s, Mayr and Theodosius Dobzhansky had synthesized the ideas of population genetics {{with the knowledge of}} field naturalists about the amount of genetic diversity in wild populations, and the importance of genetically distinct subpopulations (especially when isolated from one another by geographical barriers) to create the early 20th century modern synthesis. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson integrated paleontology into the synthesis by statistically analyzing the fossil record to show that it was consistent with the branching non-directional form of evolution predicted by the modern synthesis, and in particular that the linear trends cited by earlier paleontologists in support of <b>Lamarckism</b> and orthogenesis did not stand up to careful analysis. Mayr wrote {{that by the end of}} the synthesis natural selection together with chance mechanisms like genetic drift had become the universal explanation for evolutionary change.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck had {{originally}} proposed a theory on the transmutation {{of species that}} was largely based on a progressive drive toward greater complexity. Lamarck also believed, as did many others at the time, that characteristics acquired {{during the course of}} an organism's life could be inherited by the next generation, and he saw this as a secondary evolutionary mechanism that produced adaptation to the environment. Typically, such characteristics included changes caused by the use or disuse of a particular organ. It was this mechanism of evolutionary adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that much later {{came to be known as}} <b>Lamarckism.</b> Although Alfred Russel Wallace completely rejected the concept in favor of natural selection, Charles Darwin always included what he called Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection in On the Origin of Species, giving examples such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the ostrich, they could not fly at all.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century the term neo-Lamarckism {{came to be}} {{associated}} with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, the American paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt, and the American entomologist Alpheus Packard. They considered <b>Lamarckism</b> to be more progressive and thus philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of natural selection acting on random variation. Butler and Cope both believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution, since organisms that developed new behaviors would change the patterns of use of their organs and thus kick-start the evolutionary process. In addition, Cope and Haeckel both believed that evolution was a progressive process. The idea of linear progress was an important part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Cope and Hyatt looked for, and thought they found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. Packard argued that the loss of vision in the blind cave insects he studied was best explained through a Lamarckian process of atrophy through disuse combined with inheritance of acquired characteristics. Packard also wrote a book about Lamarck and his writings.|$|E
500|$|For {{the columns}} for other philosophies of {{evolution}} (i.e., combined theories including any of <b>Lamarckism,</b> Mutationism, Natural selection, and Vitalism), [...] "yes" [...] means that person definitely supports the theory; [...] "no" [...] means explicit {{opposition to the}} theory; a blank means the matter is apparently not discussed, {{not part of the}} theory.|$|E
500|$|Cope also {{objects to}} Poulton's [...] {{critique}} of <b>Lamarckism,</b> where in a footnote he cites S.B.J. Skertchly as writing that [...] "other butterflies noticed this immunity [...] copied it, to which Cope replies as that [...] "even the American Neo-Lamarckians [...] {{do not follow}} their founder {{so far as to}} believe that the volition of an animal could account for all the details of mimetic resemblance." ...|$|E
500|$|The various {{alternatives}} to Darwinian evolution {{by natural selection}} were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope {{is a case in}} point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in embryology and palaeontology. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to <b>Lamarckism</b> to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, [...] "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop {{at the expense of the}} rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, <b>Lamarckism,</b> and vitalism. Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and <b>Lamarckism</b> until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|At Montevideo in November {{the mail}} from home {{included}} {{a copy of}} the second volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, a refutation of <b>Lamarckism</b> in which there was no shared ancestry of different species or overall progress to match the gradual geological change, but a continuing cycle in which species mysteriously appeared, closely adapted to their [...] "centres of creation", then became extinct when the environment changed to their disadvantage.|$|E
500|$|The Colours of Animals {{was well}} {{received}} on its publication, although the book's support for sexual selection was criticised by Alfred Russel Wallace, and its Darwinism and critique of <b>Lamarckism</b> {{were attacked by}} Edward Drinker Cope. [...] Wallace liked Poulton's experimental work but was critical of his opinions on sexual selection. The Neo-Lamarckian Cope criticised Poulton's support for Darwin but liked the book's many observations of animal coloration. Modern biologists respect Poulton's advocacy of natural selection and sexual selection, despite the lack {{at the time of}} an adequate theory of heredity, and his recognition of frequency-dependent selection.|$|E
