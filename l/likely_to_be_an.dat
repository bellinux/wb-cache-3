5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{antelope}} {{has been}} categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated {{the total population}} to be about 62,000, however this is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> underestimate. The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat {{to the survival of}} this antelope is hunting for bushmeat; it is seldom hunted in Sierra Leone and Liberia, whereas it is a major source of bushmeat in Côte d'Ivoire. Protected areas where the royal antelope occurs include the Tai National Park, Haut Bandama Fauna and Flora Reserve and Mabi-Yaya Classified Forest (Côte d'Ivoire); Kakum National Park and Assin-Attandanso Game Production Reserve (Ghana); Ziama and Diecke Forest Reserves (Guinea); Tiwai Island and Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone).|$|E
25|$|In closed culture systems {{some species}} of sponge may produce {{bioactive}} and cytotoxic metabolites which may rapidly build up and inhibit further sponge growth. However, biofilters {{are likely to}} be ineffective at removing secondary metabolites expelled from the sponge. Adsorption methods where biomolecules adhere to an adsorbate are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> effective way of removing these compounds.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{swelling}} {{is over the}} area of the root apex, it <b>is</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> periapical abscess; if it <b>is</b> closer <b>to</b> the gingival margin, it <b>is</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> periodontal abscess.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the tooth}} has {{pre-existing}} periodontal disease, with pockets {{and loss of}} alveolar bone height, it <b>is</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> periodontal abscess; whereas if the tooth has relatively healthy periodontal condition, it <b>is</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> periapical abscess.|$|R
50|$|The {{destruction}} or {{modification of}} the habitat of the New Zealand freshwater mussel <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor in the decline of its population. This modification or destruction of freshwater habitat <b>is</b> also <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor in the decline in numbers of the mussel's host fish, the kōaro.|$|R
25|$|Polymers can be {{deposited}} on many substrates {{other than the}} electrode surfaces, such as glass, other organic polymers or metals, when either a surface is {{placed in front of}} the electrodes, or placed in the middle between them. The ability for them to build off of electrode surfaces is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> electrostatic interaction, while on other surfaces covalent attachment is possible.|$|E
25|$|If {{these cases}} are both met, then a player with the small change in their mixed {{strategy}} will return immediately to the Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium {{is said to be}} stable. If condition one does not hold then the equilibrium is unstable. If only condition one holds then there are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> infinite number of optimal strategies for the player who changed.|$|E
25|$|Any {{number of}} players may be {{replaced}} by substitutes {{during the course of}} the game. Substitutions can be performed without notifying the referee and can be performed while the ball is in play. However, if the substitute enters the ice before his teammate has left it, this will result in a five-minute ban. A team can bring at the most four substitutes to the game and one of these is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> extra goalkeeper.|$|E

25|$|The {{gender of}} God {{may be viewed}} as either a literal or an allegorical aspect of a deity who, in {{classical}} western philosophy, transcends bodily form. Polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most monotheistic religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other. Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse.|$|E
25|$|In blessing Peter, Jesus {{not only}} accepts the titles Christ and Son of God which Peter {{attributes}} to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation {{by stating that}} his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter. In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God. The proclamation of Jesus as Christ is fundamental to Christology and the Confession of Peter, and Jesus' acceptance of the title is a definitive statement {{for it in the}} New Testament narrative. While some of this passage may well be authentic, the reference to Jesus as Christ and Son of God is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> addition by Matthew.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{legitimate}} {{e-mail messages}} from companies {{to their customers}} contain an item of information that is not readily available to phishers. Some companies, for example PayPal, always address their customers by their username in emails, so if an email addresses the recipient in a generic fashion ("Dear PayPal customer") it is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> attempt at phishing. Furthermore, PayPal offers various methods to determine spoof emails and advises users to forward suspicious emails to their spoof@PayPal.com domain to investigate and warn other customers. Emails from banks and credit card companies often include partial account numbers. However, recent {{research has shown that}} the public do not typically distinguish between the first few digits and the last few digits of an account number—a significant problem since the first few digits are often the same for all clients of a financial institution.|$|E

500|$|Ealhmund was {{probably}} the father of Egbert of Wessex, {{and it is possible}} that Offa's interventions in Kent in the mid-780s are connected to the subsequent exile of Egbert to Francia. The Chronicle claims that when Egbert invaded Kent in 825, the men of the southeast turned to him [...] "because earlier they were wrongly forced away from his relatives". This is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> allusion to Ealhmund, and may imply that Ealhmund had a local overlordship of the southeastern kingdoms. If so, Offa's intervention {{was probably}} intended to gain control of this relationship and take over the dominance of the associated kingdoms.|$|E
500|$|The stoor worm is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> Orkney {{variant of}} the Norse Jörmungandr, or world serpent, {{also known as the}} Midgard Serpent. The Orcadian folklorist Marwick {{highlights}} the similarity between the method Assipattle used to kill the mythical creature and those recounted in the slaying of the Worm of Linton and the Cnoc na Cnoimh of Sutherland tales. He also notes that in Bel and the Dragon, the dragon is killed by Daniel using [...] "fat and hair" [...] instead of peat. In Shetland there was a long-standing belief that [...] "away, far out to sea, {{near the edge of the}} world, lived a monstrous sea-serpent that took about six hours to draw in his breath, and six hours to let it out", which Marwick speculates was probably an explanation for the cycle of the tides.|$|E
500|$|A {{distinction}} is drawn betwixt the offence of assault {{and that of}} battery. Assault is the apprehension {{of the possibility of}} immediate unlawful violence, and battery that of the infliction of such violence. Several proposals, including one from the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980 have proposed merging the offences. However, the distinction was confirmed in DPP v Little in 1992. There, the conflation of assault and battery was criticised as duplicitous. If D throws a punch at V, who dodges, this is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> assault but not a battery; if V is attacked from behind, this may constitute a battery without an assault. Actions which constitute ordinary daily life are not considered assault or battery, for example, jostling on a crowded train. The term [...] "common assault" [...] is used to refer to either a technical assault or a battery.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} Clive Ruggles {{has argued}} that {{there are problems with}} the selection of data in Thom's surveys. Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon. A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: [...] "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions." [...] Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.|$|E
500|$|As an {{only child}} growing up in what were, in all but name, palaces, her {{childhood}} {{appears to have been}} quite lonely. She was a companion to her hypochondriac mother and, in later life, a hostess with her father during her mother's long periods of indisposition. She was indulged by both parents and her formal education was neglected in favour of music and singing lessons, subjects in which she was accomplished. Her parents were very protective of her, attempting to ensure that she was never exposed to the risk of sickness or even the sight of poverty. As a result, she was never allowed to enter the cottages on the Rothschilds' estates. A cousin, who seems to have disliked her, claims that Hannah was so sheltered that the phrase [...] "the poor" [...] was just a meaningless euphemism to her. This is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exaggeration, as from her teens onwards she used much of her fortune to improve the lot of the poor, in housing and education. Whatever the faults of her education, she possessed great confidence, impressing her Rothschild relations, who noted her poise and competence when she hosted a large house party at Mentmore for the Prince of Wales while only 17 years of age.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, of 4,035 {{species of}} {{amphibians}} {{that depend on}} water during some lifecycle stage, 1,356 (33.6%) {{were considered to be}} threatened. This is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which evidence was insufficient to assess their status. Frog populations have declined dramatically since the 1950s. More than one-third of frog species are considered to be threatened with extinction, and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. Among these species are the gastric-brooding frogs of Australia and the golden toad of Costa Rica. The latter is of particular concern to scientists because it inhabited the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and its population crashed in 1987, along with about 20 other frog species in the area. This could not be linked directly to human activities, such as deforestation, and was outside the range of normal fluctuations in population size. Elsewhere, habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline, as are pollutants, climate change, increased UVB radiation, [...] and the introduction of non-native predators and competitors. A Canadian study conducted in 2006 suggested heavy traffic in their environment was a larger threat to frog populations than was habitat loss. Emerging infectious diseases, including chytridiomycosis [...] and ranavirus, are also devastating populations.|$|E

2500|$|During construction, {{the stadium}} was reputedly cursed by a gypsy when {{officials}} evicted a gypsy camp from the area. This curse was allegedly removed on 28 December 1998. [...] However, the gypsy curse is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> urban myth, as such stories are endemic {{to a number}} of football league grounds. Construction took 300 days, the total cost £100,000. The initial layout of the ground consisted of one covered stand with a seating capacity of 10,000, and uncovered terracing on the other three sides, with gentle curves connecting the corners.|$|E
2500|$|Craig Blomberg {{states that}} if the three {{elements}} [...] "lawful to call him a man", [...] "he was the Christ" [...] and the reference to the resurrection are removed from the Testimonium {{the rest of the}} passage flows smoothly within the context, fits the style of Josephus and is likely to be authentic. Blomberg adds that after the removal of these three elements (which are likely interpolations) from the Greek versions the remaining passage fits well with the Arabic version and supports the authenticity of the reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate. Joel B. Green also states that the removal of some elements from the Testimonium produces a passage that is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> authentic reference to the death of Jesus.|$|E
