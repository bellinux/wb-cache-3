5000|$|The <b>lingot</b> (a {{portmanteau}} of {{the words}} lingo and ingot) is the currency of Duolingo. Users gain lingots by leveling up, finishing a skill, maintaining a usage-streak {{for a total of}} seven days, inviting others to Duo via social media, and by uploading documents to the Immersion. Items available in the <b>lingot</b> store include power-ups, practice and bonus skills. Users of the mobile apps can also customize the appearance of the Duolingo mascot, which is by default the green owl. This feature is not available on the browser version. A hidden bonus skill included in some courses is [...] "Christmas", which is only available in the period surrounding Christmas. Other Bonus Skills include [...] "Flirting" [...] and [...] "Idioms and Proverbs".|$|E
5000|$|For each language, Duolingo {{also has}} a [...] "Progress Quiz" [...] feature, an {{extended}} quiz found in the <b>Lingot</b> store for 25 lingots. It measures the user's language learning progress on a 5 point scale, with 5 being the best score. This quiz is not adjusted to the player's level and only tests overall language competence.|$|E

50|$|All cassoulets {{are made}} with white beans (haricots blancs or <b>lingots),</b> duck or goose confit, sausages, and {{additional}} meat. In the cassoulet of Toulouse, the meats are pork and mutton, the latter frequently a cold roast shoulder. The Carcassonne version is similar but doubles the portion of mutton and sometimes replaces the duck with partridge. The cassoulet of Castelnaudary uses a duck confit instead of mutton.|$|R

It is made from pork and pig’s liver with a local variety of white beans (<b>Lingots</b> de Castelnaudary) flavoured with garigue herbs. On the coast, eel stew (borrida d’anguilles) is a dish of choice. Finally, the cassoulet of Castelnaudary, made from white beans and sausage, is a typical dish of the Lauragais.|$|R
5000|$|Duolingo also {{includes}} a timed practice feature, where users are given 30 seconds and twenty questions and awarded a skill point and seven or ten additional seconds (time depends {{on the length of}} the question) for each correct answer. This timed practice feature is only available after purchase in the <b>Lingot</b> store for ten lingots, the currency the site uses. As the goal of Duolingo is to get people to learn the language, each skill (containing between 1 and 10 lessons) has a [...] "strength bar" [...] that corresponds to the computer's estimate of how strongly certain words or constructions still exist in the user's memory. After a certain duration of time, strength bars fade, indicating a need for a user to refresh/re-study that lesson, or to [...] "strengthen weak skills." [...] Courses can teach upwards of 2,000 words. Duolingo uses a data-driven approach to lesson planning. At each step along the way, the system measures which questions the users struggle with and what sorts of mistakes they make.|$|E

It aims to provide teachers with tools to manage theheterogeneity of learning needs in elementary algebra for students at the endof compulsory schooling. First, we show how the <b>Lingot</b> project draws oncognitive and anthropological approaches.

In addition, after the 1851 coup d'état by Napoleon III, many people were exiled to California. In later years, around 120,000 immigrants from Béarn or Basque country arrived in America between 1820 and 1926; many settled in San Francisco Bay Area.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{implementation}} of AMICO 1, a prototype to enhance mathematics learning by interactions between a student (or a dyad) and virtual agents (several co-learner companions and a mathematician). This work {{is part of a}} multidisciplinary project, the project <b>LINGOT</b> that aims to give math teachers tools to improve their teaching. We first present the foundations of the project: the pedagogical assumptions, the design approach and the different kinds of virtual agents we propose. Then we present our virtual companions who allow students and teachers to use different learning and teaching strategies. They can play several characters: more or less trouble maker, more or less correct in their answers, more or less algebra speakers. In AMICO we propose two scenarios of interactions between students and virtual agents: competition and cooperation. We sketch the software architecture we propose in order to implement a simple authoring tool. Teachers specify problems, figures, the lists of common answers for students and companions. Then AMICO generates automatically and dynamically the dialogues between students and companions according to the companions’ characters and students ’ answers. First user testing are encouraging and give perspectives. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{main focus}} of the <b>LINGOT</b> project is how to build systems that {{facilitate}} algebra learning. The starting point is to capture in a multi-dimensional way students knowledge from their behaviour when working with a computer on algebraic tasks. Once captured, this knowledge is used by humans teachers to propose to the students learning activities likely to help the evolution of their knowledge. The originality of this on going project is {{to be based on}} a mathematical education research that had set up a multi-dimensional model of competence in algebra. This model is first applied to analyse and design tasks given by teachers to students, paper-and-pencil tasks as well as computerised tasks. Secondly this model is used to analyse the students’ answers when performing those tasks. We have built a first prototype, PÉPITE, that helps teachers to assess students in elementary algebra, setting up students’ cognitive profiles. This system is yet tested in actual classrooms and yet used in teachers training. The research work on computer mediated remedial activities is just beginning. In this paper, we focus on the assessment system and we share our experience of designing classrooms tools in a participative way. The methodology adopted is a combination of work in mathematics education and user-centred design derived from Human-Computer Interaction research. Finally we discuss the validation process of such an assessment system and our research results...|$|E
