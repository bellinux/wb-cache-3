50|$|The Exchange Ilford is {{the main}} retail {{shopping}} mall in the town centre of Ilford, London. It was owned by The Mall Fund {{for a period of}} time but has now been sold and reverted to its original name of The Exchange Mall. It trades from three levels of retail, though its architectural design layout has resulted in the lower floor of retail being separated into two parts, meaning customers wishing to access both parts of the lower level have to travel between the sections via the middle level. There is also an upper level of retail and food court facilities accessed from the middle <b>level.</b> <b>Transit</b> between levels is via a series of lifts, stairs and escalators within the Mall; in addition, some stores trade from two or more levels of the mall.|$|E
50|$|The final {{steps in}} the {{integration}} process involved the relocation of the turnstiles for the Kelana Jaya Line from Level B1 to the Ground <b>Level</b> <b>Transit</b> Plaza. This essentially converted the entire Level B1 of the Kelana Jaya Line station into a paid area (previously, it was partially paid and unpaid) while part of the Ground Level Plaza became a paid area with the new entrance into the Kelana Jaya Line (as well as the entrance for Ampang- and then Sri Petaling-bound trains of the Ampang Line) being relocated to this level. The underpass which previously allowed passengers to access Jalan Benteng without needed to cross Jalan Tun Perak from the Kelana Jaya concourse Level B1 was converted into a paid area for passengers transferring between the Kelana Jaya Line and the Ampang Line Station Platform 1 (Sentul Timur-bound). As the underpass was now a restricted area, access to and from Jalan Benteng was sealed-off. The Kelana Jaya Line ticketing office on Level B1 was then closed and integrated with what was previously the Ampang Line ticketing office at the Ground Level Plaza.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTransit {{peptides}} are N-terminal extensions {{that facilitate}} the targeting and translocation of cytosolically synthesized precursors into plastids via a post-translational mechanism. With the complete Arabidopsis genome in hand, {{it is now}} evident that transit peptides direct more than 3500 different proteins into the plastid during {{the life of a}} typical plant. Deciphering a common mechanism for how this multitude of targeting sequences function has been hampered by the realization that at a primary sequence <b>level,</b> <b>transit</b> peptides are highly divergent in length, composition, and organization. This review addresses recent findings on several of the diverse functions that transit peptides must perform, including direct interaction with envelope lipids, association with a cis-acting guidance complex, recognition by envelope receptors, insertion into the Toc/Tic translocon, interaction with molecular motors, and finally, recognition/cleavage by the stromal processing peptidase. In addition to higher plants, transit peptides also direct the import of proteins into complex plastids derived from secondary endosymbiosis. An emerging concept suggests that transit peptides contain multiple domains that provide either distinct or possibly overlapping functions. Although still poorly characterized, evolutionary processes could yield transit peptides with alternative domain organizations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} 4 -step {{travel demand}} forecasting {{model is the}} most widely used model for the transportation planning in the world. However, it requires extensive time and costs for analysis. In addition, it is uncertain to have an accurate result of transit ridership, especially when two or more stations exist in the same traffic analysis zone. For this reason, transportation planners consistently point out the need of a sketch ridership model or a direct demand model based on socio-economic data. This study empirically analyzes the relationship among urban railway ridership, socio-economic characteristics and catchment bands. For this purpose, the study develops sketch <b>level</b> <b>transit</b> ridership models that are practical in the process of an initial railway plan. The study utilizes socio-economic data based on a block group level, which is about 1 / 24 of a traditional zone size. The analysis examines 278 existing stations, including 248 stations of heavy rail transit (HRT) and 30 stations of light rail transit (LRT) in Korea. The results show that the catchment band of HRT stations is wider than that of LRT stations. Ridership of HRT stations is highly correlated with numbers of business and household, while ridership of LRT stations is highly correlated with numbers of economically active population and business...|$|E
