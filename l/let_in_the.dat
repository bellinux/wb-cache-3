500|$|Hypostyle halls, covered rooms {{filled with}} columns, appear in temples {{throughout}} Egyptian history. By the New Kingdom they typically lay {{directly in front}} of the sanctuary area. These halls were less restricted than the inner rooms, being open to laymen at least in some cases. They were often less dark as well: New Kingdom halls rose into tall central passages over the processional path, allowing a clerestory to provide dim light. The epitome of this style is the Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak, whose largest columns are [...] tall. In later periods, the Egyptians favored a different style of hall, where a low screen wall at the front <b>let</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light. The shadowy halls, whose columns were often shaped to imitate plants such as lotus or papyrus, were symbolic of the mythological marsh that surrounded the primeval mound at the time of creation.

500|$|This {{story is}} partly in {{conflict}} with what is told by the Origo, which has Peredeo acting as an instigator and not as the murderer.

However, the primary intent of the Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani may have been to obtain a more straightforward and coherent narrative by reducing the number of actors in the story, beginning with Peredeo. The disappearance of Peredeo, however, means that the role of Helmichis changes: while Paul presents him as [...] "the efficient conspirator and killer", with Agnellus he is a victim of a ruthless and domineering queen.|$|E

Green baize cloth covered the benches in the pit and served to decorate the boxes, additionally ornamented with gold-tooled leather, and even the stage itself. The backless green benches in the pit were in a semicircular arrangement facing the stage, according to a May 1663 letter from one Monsieur de Maonconys: [...] "All benches of the pit, where people of rank also sit, are shaped in a semi-circle, each row higher than the next."

The village residents also set up roadblocks and mines, and dug trenches and foxholes along the road. The commander of the triangle was in contact with the Iraqi Army nearby, and there was an Israeli fear that the Iraqis would attempt to connect with his forces.

After Harry refuses, Quirrell tries to take the Stone by force. Voldemort orders Quirrell to attack Harry, who holds off Quirrell long enough for aid in the form of Dumbledore to arrive, at which point Voldemort flees, in his non-physical form. Voldemort's departure, as well as the agony suffered by him because of his contact with Harry, who continues to be protected by the love of his mother and the spell that was cast by her sacrificing her life to save Harry, causes Quirrell to die, hence Dumbledore's comment that Voldemort is as merciless to his followers as to his enemies.|$|E
2500|$|Thomson played rugby {{union for}} the Royal Navy before the First World War, {{appearing}} as a centre three-quarter in a match against Harlequins at New Year 1914. After the war, The Times carried reports on matches played {{by both the}} Royal Navy and by the United Services team in which Thomson features, and he was [...] "one of the outstanding players" [...] in the trial match for the Scottish national side in January 1921. On 12 January 1921 The Times reported his name among those picked to play for Scotland against France as a centre. The match itself was not a success for Thomson: he [...] "was entirely out of form" [...] and [...] "mishandled the ball practically every time it came to him", said {{the report of the}} match, a 3-0 win for France. Thomson retained his place in the Scotland team for the next match against Wales at St Helen's, Swansea and was the subject of comment in The Times: [...] "A. E. Thomson's mishandling of the ball was so atrocious that the Scottish selectors may, perhaps, be pardoned for assuming that his form was too bad to be real. One knows that he does possess the quality of pace." [...] This match was won by Scotland and Thomson was the scorer of the first try; the report in The Times, which dwelt largely on pitch invasions that once brought the match to a halt and impeded play throughout, praised Thomson's speed, though again it said his handling was [...] "weak". An ankle injury prevented Thomson playing in the next international match away to Ireland, when Scotland were beaten, but he was recalled for the final international of the season, the Calcutta Cup match against England at Inverleith. It was again not a happy experience: his miss of a pass <b>let</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> England wing three-quarter for a try, and the report in The Times said that both Thomson and his Royal Navy colleague Cecil MacKenzie, the other centre three-quarter, were [...] "entirely at sea, both in attack and defence". Thomson did not play any further international rugby in subsequent seasons, though he continued to play for the United Services club, moving successfully to full back.|$|E
