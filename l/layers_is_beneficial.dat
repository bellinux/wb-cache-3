40|$|The {{impact of}} a thin {{interfacial}} SiO 2 layer between HfO 2 and SiC {{for the improvement of}} dielectric’s electrical property was investigated. Regarding the material choice of dielectric on SiC, various combinations of HfO 2 and SiO 2 were examined on devices by capacitance and current measurements. It was found that the thickness of SiO 2 interfacial <b>layer</b> <b>is</b> critical. As SiO 2 grows thicker, excess carbon is believed to be generated in SiC close to SiC/SiO 2 interface as observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

Excess carbon does not behave as mobile ion when examined by bias-temperature stress, and it can induce considerable electron trapping under constant bias stress. On the other hand, large capacitance voltage (C-V) frequency dispersion appears when HfO 2 is directly deposited on SiC. With 7. 4 nm thin SiO 2 layer between HfO 2 and SiC, the C-V distortion and dispersion can be significantly eliminated.

[12] found that a Au cap <b>layer</b> <b>was</b> <b>beneficial</b> for FePt <b>layer</b> forming isolated grains and larger coercivity; Chen et al.

In this study, the effect of Ru and Ag cap layer on the microstructure and magnetic properties of ultrathin FePt films was investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), vibrate sample magnetometer (VSM), and anomalous Hall effect (AHE). We found that the Ag cap layer segregates from the FePt/Ag bilayer after annealing, which lowers the FePt ordering temperature, promotes the FePt thin films to form island structure, and enhances the coercivity, whereas the Ru cap layer shows a completely inverse behavior. The effects can be mainly attributed to the different melting point and thermal expansion stress between the cap layer and the FePt thin films.|$|R

The cleanliness of the metal film is also extremely important, and unclean conditions result in poor PtSi synthesis. [...] However, in certain cases an oxide <b>layer</b> can <b>be</b> <b>beneficial.</b> When PtSi <b>is</b> used as a Schottky barrier, an oxide <b>layer</b> has <b>been</b> shown to be protective and prevent wear of the PtSi.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to determine the impact of diet supplementation with yeast cell walls (YCW) and Yucca schidigera extract (YE) on performance, egg weight, specific gravity, body weight, and intestinal tissue hist­ology in layer hens. White, 48 -week-old, Hy-line hybrid hens (n= 320) were divided into four main groups, each comprising eight groups of 10 hens: (1) control, (2) 500 mg/kg YCW added, (3) 500 mg/kg YE added and (4) 250 mg/kg YE plus 2500 mg/kg YCW added. While the egg production and feed intake of the hens was significantly affected, overall feed efficiency, damaged-egg ratio, dirty-egg ratio, egg weight and specific gravity did not differ between the control group and the YCW, YE or YCW+YE groups. Final body weight was higher in the YCW, YE and YCW+YE groups than in the control group. There were differences in the width, muscle layer thickness and height/crypt depth ratio of the duodenal villus and {{the width of the}} ileal villus among the four groups. It can be concluded that YCW and YCW+YE supplementation for <b>layer</b> hens <b>are</b> <b>beneficial</b> for egg production...|$|R
