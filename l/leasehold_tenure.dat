Virtual guerrilla warfare broke out. Riders disguised as Indians and wearing calico gowns ranged through the countryside, terrorizing the agents of the landlords. In late 1844, Governor William Bouck sent three companies of militia to Hudson, where anti-renters threatened to storm the jail and release their leader, Big Thunder (Dr. Smith A. Boughton, in private life).

The spirit of {{institutions}} is their legitimate object; and {{it would be hard to}} prove that a <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenure,</b> with any conditions of mere pecuniary indebtedness whatever, is opposed to any institutions that recognise the full rights of property. The obligation to pay rent no more creates political dependency, than to give credit from an ordinary shop; not so much, indeed, more especially under such leases as those of the Rensselaers; for the debtor on a book-debt can be sued at any moment, whereas the tenant knows precisely when he has to pay. There is the great absurdity of those who decry the system as feudal and aristocratic; for they do not see that those very leases are more favourable to the tenant than any other." ...|$|E

I have heard already other abuses of the anti-renters urged as a reason why the laws should be changed, in order that men may not be tempted beyond their strength; and why not use the same reasoning {{in favor of this}} crime when it has been used already, in cases of murder? 'The <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenures</b> make men commit murder,' it is said, 'and they ought to be destroyed themselves.'

Murder has already been committed by these anti-renters, and that obviously to effect their ends; and they are to be told that whenever you shoot a landlord, as some have already often shot at them, you can convert your <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenures</b> into tenures in fee!

If it be a civilized country, it will respect the rights of property, and its own laws; and if the reverse, it will not respect them. As for setting up the doctrine, at this late day, when millions and millions are invested in this particular species of property, that the <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenure</b> is opposed to the spirit of institutions of which it has substantially formed a part, ever since those institutions have themselves had an existence, it requires a bold front, and more capacity than any man at Albany possesses, to make the doctrines go down. Men may run off with the notion that the tendencies to certain abuses, which mark every system, form their spirit; but this is a fallacy that a very little thought will correct. Is it true that proposals have actually been made, by these pretenders to liberty, to appoint commissioners to act as arbitrators between the landlords and tenants, and to decide points that no one has any right to raise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As for myself, I {{was well}} enough {{disposed}} to consider Opportunity, in this unfortunate affair of the fire, for it Would {{have been a}} cruel thing to suffer the girl to imagine she had been an instrument in destroying her brother. It is true, there is no great danger of a rogue's being hanged, nowadays, and Seneca was not sufficiently a gentleman, though very tenacious of the title, to endanger his neck. Had he been a landlord, and caught lighting a fire on the kitchen-floor {{of one of the}} tenants, the State would not grow hemp enough for his execution; but it was a very different thing to catch a tenant at that work. I could not but ask myself, how many of the [...] "honorable gentlemen" [...] at Albany would interfere in my behalf, had matters been reversed? for this is the true mode of arriving at the [...] "spirit of the institutions;" [...] or, rather, I have just as good a right to affirm such is their [...] "spirit," [...] as any one has to assert that the <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenure</b> is opposed to them; the laws and institutions themselves being equally antagonist to both.|$|E
6000|$|My {{grandmother}} and uncle were already {{seated in the}} canopied pew when we pedestrians entered the church. Mary Warren turned into another aisle, and proceeded to the pew reserved for the rector, accompanied by my sister, while the other two ladies passed up to the chancel, and took their customary places. I followed, {{and for the first}} time in my life was seated beneath the offensive canopy, vested with all the rights of ownership. By the term [...] "canopy," [...] however, the reader is not to imagine anything like festooned drapery--crimson colors and gilded laces; our ambition had never soared so high. The amount of the distinction between this pew and any other in the church was simply this: it was larger and more convenient than those around it, an advantage which any other might have equally enjoyed who saw fit to pay for it, as had been the case with us, and it was canopied with a heavy, clumsy, ill-shaped sort of a roof, that was a perfect caricature of the celebrated baldachino of St. Peter's in Rome. The first of these advantages probably excited no particular envy, for it came within the common rule of the country, of [...] "play and pay;" [...] but as for the canopy, that was aristocratic, and was not to be tolerated. Like the <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenure,</b> it was opposed to the [...] "spirit of the institutions." [...] It is true, it did no real harm, as an existing thing; it is true, it had a certain use, as a memorial of past opinions and customs; it is true, it was property, and could not be touched without interfering with its privileges; it is true, that every person who saw it secretly felt there was nothing, after all, so very inappropriate in such a pew's belonging to a Littlepage; and, most of all, it was true that they who sat in it never fancied for a moment that it made them any better or any worse than the rest of their fellow-creatures. There it was, however; and, next to the feudal character of a lease, it was the most offensive object then existing in Ravensnest. It may be questioned if the cross, which occupied the place that, according to provincial orthodoxy, a weathercock should have adorned, or Mr. Warren's surplice, was one-half as offensive.|$|E

6000|$|... [Footnote 28: In {{order that}} the reader who is not {{familiar}} with what is passing in New York may not suppose that exaggerated terms are here used, the writer will state a single expedient of the anti-renters in the Legislature to obtain their ends. It is generally known that the Constitution of the United States prevents the separate States from passing laws impairing the obligations of contracts. But for this provision of the Federal Constitution, it is probable, numbers would have succeeded, long ago, in obtaining {{the property of the}} few on their own terms, amid shouts in honor of liberty! This provision, however, has proved a stubborn obstacle, until the world, near {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, has been favored with the following notable scheme to effect the ends of those who [...] "want farms and must have them." [...] The State can regulate, by statute, the laws of descents. It has, accordingly, been solemnly proposed in the Legislature of New York, that the statute of descents should be so far altered, that when a landlord, holding lands subject to certain <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenures,</b> dies, or a descent is cast, that it shall be lawful for the tenants, on application to the chancellor, to convert these <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenures</b> into mortgages, and to obtain the fee-simple of the estates in payment of the debt! In other words, A leases a farm to B forever, reserving a ground-rent, with covenants of re-entry, etc., etc. B wishes a deed, but will not pay A's price. The United States says the contract shall not be impaired, and the Legislature of New York is illustrated by the expedient we have named, to get over the provision of the Constitution! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very easily}} explained. The {{spirit of the}} {{institutions}} is their intention; their tendencies are the natural direction they take under the impulses of human motives, which are always corrupt and corrupting. The 'spirit' refers to what things ought to be; the 'tendencies,' to what they are, or are becoming. The 'spirit' of all political institutions is to place {{a check on the}} natural propensities of men, to restrain them, and keep them within due bounds; while the tendencies follow those propensities, and are, quite often, in direct opposition to the spirit. That this outcry against <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenures</b> in America is following the tendencies of our institutions, I am afraid is only too true; but that it is in any manner in compliance with their spirit, I utterly deny." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{reader will}} be {{surprised}} to hear two things. My engagement with {{the daughter of a}} poor clergyman has produced great scandal among the anti-renters, they who so loudly decry aristocracy! The objection is that the match is not equal! That equality which is the consequence of social position, connections, education and similarity of habits, thoughts, and, if you will, prejudices, is all thrown away on these persons. They have no notion of its existence; but they can very well understand that the owner of an unencumbered and handsome estate is richer than the heiress of a poor divine, who can just make the year meet on $500 per annum. I let them grumble, as I know they must and will find fault with something connected with myself, until they have got away my land, or are satisfied it is not to be had. As for Opportunity, I have been assured that she threatens to sue me for a [...] "breach of promise;" [...] nor should I be at all surprised were she actually to make the attempt. It is by no means unusual, when a person sets his or her whole soul on a particular object, to imagine circumstances favorable to his or her views, which never had an existence; and Opportunity may fancy that what I have heard has been [...] "the buzzing in her own ear." [...] Then the quackery of Legislatures has set the ladies at work in earnest, and he will soon be a fortunate youth who can pass through his days of celibacy without some desperate assault, legal or moral, from the other sex. Besides, nothing can be out of the way, when it is found that the more popular and most numerous branch of the Legislature of New York really believes it can evade that solemn provision of the Constitution of the United States, which says [...] "no State shall pass any law impairing the obligations of contracts," [...] by enacting, as they can regulate the statute of descent, that whenever a landlord dies, the tenant, by applying to the chancellor, can have his <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenure</b> converted into a mortgage, on discharging which the land will be his, unencumbered! We have heard of a [...] "thimble-rig administration" [...] in England, and really that industrious nation seems to have exported the breed to this country. How many of those who voted for such a law will like to see the ayes and noes on the journals of the Assembly ten years hence? If there should be one such man left in the State, he will be an object of humane commiseration. We have had many efforts at legislative chicanery, and some that have been tolerably clever, but this is a palpable experiment in the same way, made for a reason that everybody understands, that has not even the negative merit of ingenuity. Our own courts will probably disregard it, should the Senate even concur; and as for those of the United States, they will, out of all doubt, treat it as it ought to be treated, and brand it with ignominy. The next step will be to pass a law regulating descents, as it is called, under the provisions of which the debtors of the deceased can meet his obligations with a coin technically called [...] "puppies." ...|$|E

The issues that were ultimately addressed by the legislation represented {{a key element in}} the negotiations that led to Prince Edward Island's entry into Confederation in 1873. William Buell Richards, the first Chief Justice of Canada, wrote that the Land Purchase Act was to be [...] "viewed not as ordinary legislation, but as the settling of an important question of great moment to the community, and in principle like the abolition of the Seigniorial tenure in Lower Canada and the settling of the land question in Ireland. ...

60|$|Nor is it {{an apology}} for anti-rentism, in any of its aspects, to say that <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenures</b> are in{{expedient}}. The most expedient thing in existence is to do right. Were there no other objection to this anti-rent movement than its corrupting influence, that alone should set every wise man in the community firmly against it. We have seen too much of this earth to be so easily convinced {{that there is any}} disadvantage, nay, {{that there is not a}} positive advantage, in the existence of large leasehold estates, when they carry with them no political power, as is the fact here. The commonplace argument against them, that they defeat the civilization of a country, is not sustained by fact. The most civilized countries on earth are under this system; and this system, too, not entirely free from grave objections which do not exist among ourselves. That a poorer class of citizens have originally leased than have purchased lands in New York is probably true; and it is equally probable that the effects of this poverty, and even of the tenure in the infancy of a country, are to be traced on the estates. But this is taking a very one-sided view of the matter. The men who became tenants in moderate but comfortable circumstances, would have been mostly laborers on the farms of others, but for these <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenures.</b> That is the benefit of the system in a new country, and the ultra friend of humanity, who decries the condition of a tenant, should remember that if he had not been in this very condition, he might have been in a worse. It is, indeed, one of the proofs of the insincerity of those who are decrying leases, on account of their aristocratic tendencies, that their destruction will necessarily condemn a numerous class of agriculturists, either to fall back into the ranks of the peasant or day-laborer, or to migrate, as is the case with so many of the same class in New England. In point of fact, the relation of landlord and tenant is one entirely natural and salutary, in a wealthy community, and one that is so much in accordance with the necessities of men, that no legislation can long prevent it. A state of things which will not encourage the rich to hold real estate would not be desirable, since it would be diverting their money, knowledge, liberality, feelings and leisure, from the improvement of the soil, to objects neither so useful nor so praiseworthy.|$|R
6000|$|But, it is pretended, {{whatever}} may be {{the equity}} of these leasehold contracts, they are offensive to the tenants, {{and ought to be}} abrogated, for the peace of the State. The State is bound to make all classes of men respect its laws, and in nothing more so than in the fulfilment of their legal contracts. The greater the number of the offenders, the higher the obligation to act with decision and efficiency. To say that these disorganizers ought not to be put down, is to say that crime is to obtain impunity by its own extent; and to say that they cannot be put down [...] "under our form of government," [...] is a direct admission that the government is unequal to the discharge of one of the plainest and commonest obligations of all civilized society. If this be really so, the sooner we get rid of the present form of government the better. The notion of remedying such an evil by concession is as puerile as it is dishonest. The larger the concessions become, the greater will be the exactions of a cormorant cupidity. As soon as quiet is obtained by these means, in reference to the <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenures,</b> it will be demanded by some fresh combination to attain some other end.|$|R

40|$|The author {{argues that}} {{conversion}} of over 1 million hectares of customary land to <b>leasehold</b> land <b>tenure</b> merely endowed the elite with excessive landholdings {{they did not}} fully utilise for tobacco production because it exceeded the requirement for production of the quota of tobacco output allocated to Malawi.

The author also argues that government policy of suppressing producer prices combined with a policy of preventing smallholder farmers from growing the lucrative tobacco crop reduced incomes of the poor and deprived the rural sector the means to adopt high productivity technologies. The author also argue that estates would have used their excess land to produce more maize but the low producer prices paid by ADMARC, the grain marketing board, acted as a disincentive. Land rents were also pegged far below market levels that farmer held on to large amounts of idle land with a speculative motive.

40|$|Environmental offsets and {{environmental}} trading initiatives are being rapidly introduced into environmental regulatory regimes. These relatively new legal mechanisms {{are attempting to}} fill in the gaps left by command and control regulation. The introduction of environmental offset and trading policy in Queensland will need to be compatible with existing land tenure regulation. Who owns and who uses natural resources are controlled by a range of legislative reservations and restrictions. Reservations give the State ownership of certain natural resources such as minerals, quarry material and, in some circumstances, forest products. Where there is a reservation in operation, the land holders rights are weakened. Restrictions in relation to uses prevent land holders from carrying out certain activities on the land. An example of a restriction of use is the operation of the Vegetation Management Act 1999 (Qld), which prescribes the manner in which vegetation is to be dealt with. This article explores the nature of freehold and <b>leasehold</b> land <b>tenure</b> in Queensland and examines the effect of reservations and restrictions upon the operation of environmental offset and trading initiatives. Presently Queensland legislation does not directly address the relationship between land tenure {{and environmental}} offset and trading initiatives. The stability of tenure required for the creation of environmental offsets can be at odds with the flexibility allowed for under leasehold arrangements. This flexibility may act to undermine the permanency requirement of environmental offset creation (i. e. the guarantee that the offset is created for the long term) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Management {{on public}} lands has {{generally}} been focused on promotion of sustainable practices and maintenance of biological diversity to achieve desirable social outcomes. These objectives call for application of a Triple Bottom Line (TBL) approach {{that is capable of}} consistent and accountable integration of expert assessments of biophysical and economic resources and community preferences with clearly defined management priorities and values. In Queensland, several approaches to native forest management have been developed {{in the past few years}} to achieve individual elements of this goal. Some approaches focus on systematic assessment of biophysical and economic aspects of resources. Others address the Government commitment to the participatory democracy model of natural resource management and explored various methods and models of public involvement in land use allocation. Lastly, new models of decision-making have also been developed and tested. However, the integration of these social, biophysical and economic components remains difficult and methodologically uncharted territory largely due to the complexity of the management environment. New challenges in the future arise from managing sustainability on <b>leasehold</b> and freehold <b>tenure,</b> particularly with respect to vertical integration of private property management objectives with a broader catchment and regional scale planning decisions.

50|$|By 1844 the anti-rent {{movement}} had {{grown from a}} localized struggle against the van Rensselaer family to a full-fledged revolt against <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenure</b> throughout eastern New York, where other major manors existed. Virtual guerrilla warfare broke out. Riders disguised as Indians and wearing calico gowns ranged through the countryside, terrorizing the agents of the landlords. In late 1844, Governor William Bouck sent three companies of militia to Hudson, where anti-renters threatened to storm the jail and release their leader, Big Thunder (Dr. Smith A. Boughton, in private life). The following year Governor Silas Wright was forced to declare Delaware County {{in a state of}} insurrection after an armed rider had killed undersheriff Osman N. Steele August 7, 1845 at an eviction sale.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{exceptionally}} fertile soil, {{market gardening}} {{is carried out}} on a commercial scale in the surrounding area, known as the Vale of Evesham, which {{is known for its}} production of fruit and vegetables. A distinctive form of <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenure,</b> known as the Evesham Custom, still regulates market garden tenancies in the area. A decline {{in the second half of}} the 20th century resulted in the closing of Evesham's Smithfield Market while the Central Market stopped being used for produce auctions. Between 1983 and 2008, Evesham was home to computer manufacturer Evesham Micros, later renamed Evesham Technology. It was a significant contributor to the United Kingdom's domestic computer and digital television market. At its peak, the company employed up to 300 people with a chain of 19 retail stores in towns and cities throughout the UK. It went into liquidation in 2008.|$|E
