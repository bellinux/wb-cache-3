In recent years, optical fibres have been widely applied to various applications in communication and sensor systems. Optical fibre sensors have the advantage over electrical transducers in their high sensitivity and immunity from any electromagnetic interference effects. The main work concentrates on the theoretical application of optical fibre sensors in pressure and displacement sensing. The computer modelling of these two systems is achieved via {{the use of the}} mathematica software package. In the pressure sensing system, optical fibre is cut and rejoined in housings which allow for the application of forces near the jointed sections.

The calculation of the coupling efficiency and sensitivity of the system are then investigated for various fibre geometries. In the displacement sensor system, models are developed to describe the coupling between <b>launch</b> <b>fibre,</b> reflective surface and receive fibre in which the system geometries and fibre type are variable.

40|$|Correction of modal {{dispersion}} of light transmitted through multimode optical fibres {{has been the}} subject of extensive research to date. At low optical powers photoconductive crystals are typically used to produce phase conjugate correction at the output end of the fibre in doublepass schemes [1].

We report the results of our study on the implementation of phase conjugate correction of modal distortion in highly multimode, (300 micron diameter), short (~ 1 m) passive optical fibres using a non-polarisation preserving phase conjugation scheme [2] and its application to a non-reciprocal transmission element.

40|$|In {{this talk}} we will review {{some of the}} key {{enabling}} technologies of optical communications and potential future bottlenecks. Single mode fibre (SMF) has long been the preferred waveguide for long distance communication. This is largely due to low loss, low cost and relative linearity over a wide bandwidth. As capacity demands have grown SMF has largely been able to keep pace with demand. Several groups have been identifying the possibility of exhausting the bandwidth provided by SMF [1, 2, 3]. This so called “capacity-crunch” has potentially vast economic and social consequences and will be discussed in detail. As demand grows optical power <b>launched</b> into the <b>fibre</b> has the potential to cause nonlinearities that can be detrimental to transmission. There has been considerable work done on identifying this nonlinear limit [4, 5] with a strong re- search interest currently on the topic of nonlinear compensation [6, 7]. Embracing and compensating for nonlinear transmission is one potential solution that may extend the lifetime of the current waveguide technology. However, at sufficiently high powers the waveguide will fail due to heat-induced mechanical failure. Moving forward it be- comes necessary to address the waveguide itself with several promising contenders discussed, including few-mode fibre and multi-core fibre...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} potential technologies in both optical and electrical domains for transmission capacity improvement in multimode waveguide links. The {{first half of}} the dissertation focuses on the multimode waveguide made from glass, the multimode glass fibre. A new optical launch scheme is developed, namely low-loss Hermite-Gaussian launch, to achieve single mode group excitation in the multimode glass fibre. Novel implementations using elliptical Gaussian beam and square-shaped launching profiles are developed, achieving a coupling loss at least 2. 5 dB lower than the previously reported line launch scheme. Theoretical calculations show that these launches provide 50 % bandwidth-distance product improvement over the dual launch scheme for a 99 % yield of the entire OM 1 fibre installed base. It is also found experimentally that the low-loss Hermite-Gaussian launches outperform dual <b>launch</b> for <b>fibres</b> favouring either centre launch or offset launch. Misalignment tolerance measurements reveal that the bandwidth improvements over a perfectly aligned centre launch using these launches are maintained within a radial offset range of ≤ 8 μm. Error free transmissions at 10 Gbit/s are demonstrated for different orders of low-loss Hermite-Gaussian launches over 250 m worst case OM 1 fibre without the use of equalisation. The second half of the dissertation concentrates on another type of multimode waveguide which is made from plastic, namely step-index plastic optical fibre (SI-POF). Both baseband and passband multilevel modulation schemes are investigated to provide over gigabit/s transmissions using LEDs. For the first time, fractionally-spaced equalisers are thoroughly examined in multilevel modulation systems for LED-based SI-POF links. Based on the link budget analysis, it is found that PAM- 8 and CAP- 64 are the best baseband and passband solutions respectively. For 25 m links, calculations show that PAM- 8 and CAP- 64 can achieve data rate up to 3 Gbit/s with system margins of 2. 2 dB and 1. 3 dB. Meanwhile for 50 m links, they achieve data rate up to 1. 5 Gbit/s with system margins of 1. 9 dB and 1. 2 dB respectively. A new FPGA system is developed to experimentally evaluate the PAM- 8 and CAP- 64 schemes. Error free transmissions are achieved at 3 Gbit/s using PAM- 8 for 25 m SI-POF and 1. 5 Gbit/s using CAP- 64 for 50 m SI-POF.

Subsequently tapered fibres were coated with nanostructured films of materials that change their optical properties {{in response to an}} external stimulus. An investigation of the effect of depositing chemically sensitive nano-scale films onto tapered optical fibres has been undertaken. Three different methods of deposition were applied: Langmuir-Blodgett technique, electrostatic-self-assembly and – for the first time - chemical grafting. Six different films of materials were deposited onto tapered fibres: 4 -[2 -(4 -dimethylamino- naphtalen- 1 -yl) -vinyl]- 1 -octadecyl-quinolinium iodide (merocyanine dye), calix[4]resorcinarene, bilayers of poly(allyamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and anionic tetrakis(4 -sulfophenyl) porphine (TSPP), PAH and cyclodextrine, TiO 2 nanoparticles imprinted with ((1 -(4 -Nitrophenylazo) - 2 -naphthol (NPAN) compound), polyaniline (PANI).

Many solid and liquid-cored fibres, all having sharp core-cladding boundaries, were investigated for the effect upon pulse broadening (dispersion) of launching beam semi-angle, launching angle of incidence, wavelength of the launched probe pulse, peak pulse power of the probe pulse, length of the <b>fibre,</b> <b>launched</b> spot-size at the fibre input end face etc. Pulse dispersion was strongly dependent on the input beam semi-angle and further, for large angles, the output pulse was asymmetrical with the trailing part sustaining the major dispersion. A ray propagation model gave good agreement with the experimental results. It was further found that under similar launching angle, dispersion was essentially independent of the wavelength. A narrow input angle can be converted to a wider angle soon after launch and thereafter the dispersion is a linear function of length. This has also been found in long lengths of liquid-cored fibres. Non-linear effects can occur in optical fibres if the peak power in the launched pulse is high. Therefore it is shown which parameters are important and must be cited when quoting the dispersion of a particular fibre, and how the propagation characteristics of optical fibres can be elucidated with reasonable confidence by performing relatively simple measurements, hence providing the necessary and important feedback for the production of fibres having even greater transmission capacities...|$|R

These composite rods are popular in the manufacturing, construction and electrical industries due to their chemical, electrical and strength properties. Such FRCs are manufactured on automated production lines that operate day and night. Non-destructive testing techniques are desired to quickly and accurately detectmanufacturing flaws such as coating thickness irregularities and surface cracks. Layers and cracks can present as large changes in acoustic impedance and will strongly reflect ultrasonic waves. Combined with their low cost, east of use and absense of potentially harmful radiation, ultrasound has proven popular worldwide for Non-Destructive Testing. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was employed to investigate the propagation of ultrasonic waves through layers of material to simulate a thickness measurement and the ability of ultrasound to measure thicknesses was proven. Experimental work was conducted on two fibre reinforced composite samples with varying thickness coatings of plastic and paint. The thickness was measured accurately using immersion transducers at 50 MHz and a resolution of 20 μm was attained through the use of matched filtering techniques. Surface acoustic waves, particularly Rayleigh waves were investigated using FEA techniques so that the generation, scattering and detection of such waves was understood. This lead to the development of methods for detecting surface cracks in glass using Rayleigh waves and these methods were successfully used in experimental work. Wave propagation in fibre reinforced composites was modelled and experimentally investigated with the results confirming theoretical expectations. Finally a Rayleigh wave was <b>launched</b> onto a <b>fibre</b> reinforced composite sample however the amount of energy leakage into the water was so great, due to the acoustic impedance of water, the detection of the wave was prevented.

The potential of the device to perform WDM regeneration is firstly demonstrated through the first pigtailed saturable absorber chip implemented with 8 independent fibres using a cost effective coupling technique. The cascadability and wavelength tunability assessment of this module associated to a power limiter fibre-based function has been experimentally demonstrated at 42. 6 Gbit/s. Because this method of power limiting is not a suitable solution for all-optical multichannel 2 R regeneration, a new SA structure allowing a power limiting function was proposed. We describe and characterize such a structure in this paper. This new SA {{opens the door to}} a complete passive all-optical 2 R regeneration relying upon a single technology, as shown in this paper through the use of two SA: SA. 0 for extinction ratio enhancement and SA. 1 for power level equalization allowing receiver sensitivity (up to 3. 5 dB) and Q factor (up to 1. 4 dB) improvement for a RZ signal at 42. 6 Gbit/s. The limitation of SA. 1 when the regenerator must be cascaded a large number of times is also described, leading to the observation that SA. 1 should be more suitable for phase encoded formats which are more spectrally efficient than OOK formats. A SA. 1 used as a phase-preserving amplitude regenerator in a 42. 6 Gbit/s RZ-DPSK transmission system is therefore assessed.

Specific {{attention has been paid to}} the absorption strength near 1140 nm from both the ground state and the excited states, 3 H 4, and 3 F 4, of the Tm 3 + ion. This spectroscopy has allowed a rate equation model of the process to be produced which aided the selection of the optimum pump wavelength and enabled the small-signal gain and laser threshold to be calculated. The most efficient blue laser fabricated had a slope efficiency of 31 % and a laser threshold of 90 mW. both with respect to 1140 nm pump power <b>launched</b> into the <b>fibre</b> core. By variation of the laser cavity parameters the laser threshold could be lowered at the expense of the slope efficiency; the lowest threshold achieved was 11 mW, which demonstrates the suitability of this laser for diode pumping. These results were all obtained with fibre doped to 1000 ppm by weight with Tm 3 + ions. Fibres of a higher doping level displayed a photodarkening effect when pumped with infra-red light; this has also been investigated. A laser source with a broad gain bandwidth, 1100 to 1150 nm, has been produced to pump the upconversion fibre laser. This was based on Yb 3 +-doped germanosilicate fibre and utilised fibre grating technology to select the laser wavelength within the gain bandwidth. The knowledge of Yb 3 +-doped germanosilicate glass obtained was further used in a short investigation into fabricating a single frequency laser, operating at 1083 nm, based on a short fibre laser cavity formed with fibre grating reflectors. An output power of approximately 5 mW was achieved in a single frequency...|$|R
40|$|The output {{powers of}} fibre lasers at 1 µm {{continue}} to grow and such lasers {{are now beginning to}} compete with conventional solid state lasers (for example, Nd:YAG lasers) in many important application areas, e. g., material processing, medicine, range finding, etc. Fibre lasers benefit from a geometry that allows easy thermal management and an easy selection of a high quality output beam. So far a pulse energy of 7. 7 mJ and 10 W average output power has been reported from a large core Yb-doped Q-switched fibre laser [1]. In fact, the maximum extractable energy is limited by the build-up of amplified spontaneous emission or spurious lasing between pulses [2], and thus, large-mode area (LMA) fibres are preferred. Besides the pulse energy, factors to be considered are the average power and the beam quality, which are especially important for applications operating at very high average power levels such as materials processing. In this paper, we investigate Q-switching of LMA cladding-pumped Yb-doped fibre laser in terms of its high-power operation. We designed and fabricated an LMA fibre with a 30 µm diameter, 0. 07 NA, core, and a 350 µm D-shaped inner cladding with 0. 49 NA. The continuous wave slope efficiency was ~ 84 % with respect to the absorbed pump power at 975 nm. The experimental setup for the Q-switched fibre laser is shown in Fig. 1. A diode-laser stack at 975 nm was used as the pump source. The first-order diffracted beam from the acousto-optic modulator was fed back by a dichroic mirror that had a high reflectivity at ~ 1 µm, the diffraction efficiency of which was ~ 70 %. The fibre length was ~ 9 m. The Q-switched pulse energy and the average power are shown in Fig. 2. A maximum pump power of 250 W was <b>launched</b> into the <b>fibre.</b> We evaluated the maximum pulse energy to 8. 4 mJ at ~ 1. 06 µm, for a repetition rate of 0. 5 kHz, though with a large uncertainty because of the high level of amplified spontaneous emission present between pulses. The maximum average power at the repetition rate of 200 kHz was 120 W with 0. 6 mJ pulses. The pulse width was ~ 460 nsec at a low repetition rate. These values are the highest that have ever been reported for a Q-switched fibre laser, {{to the best of our}} knowledge...|$|R
