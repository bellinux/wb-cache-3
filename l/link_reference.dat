50|$|The {{original}} CK722 were direct fallouts from CK718 {{hearing aid}} transistors, {{that did not}} meet specifications. These fallouts were later stamped with CK721 or CK722 numbers based on gain, noise and other dynamic characteristics. Early CK722's were plastic encapsulated and had a black body. As Raytheon improved its production of hearing aid transistors {{with the introduction of}} the smaller CK78x series, the body of the CK721/CK722's was changed to a metal case. Raytheon, however kept the basic body size and used a unique method by taking the smaller CK78x rejects and inserting it into the larger body and sealing it. The first metal-cased CK721/CK722's were blue and the later ones were silver. More details of this can be found in Jack Ward's website, Semiconductor Museum or the CK722 Museum- see external <b>link</b> <b>reference</b> below.|$|E
40|$|Transfer {{functions}} for the reference clock jitter in a serial link {{such as the}} PCI Express 100 MHz reference clock are established for various clock and data recovery circuits (CDRCs). In addition, mathematical interrelationships between phase, period, and cycle-to-cycle jitter are established and phase jitter is used with the jitter transfer function. Numerical simulations are carried out for these transfer functions. Relevant eye-closure/total jitter at a certain bit error rate (BER) level for the receiver is estimated by applying these jitter transfer functions to the measured phase jitter of the reference clock over a range of transfer function parameters. Implications of this new development to serial <b>link</b> <b>reference</b> clock testing and specification formulation are discussed. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Persistent {{programming}} {{systems are}} designed to provide technology for the construction and maintenance of large, long-lived object-based application systems. Many successful prototypes have been constructed and {{a large body of}} application building experience is emerging. Three common attributes of persistent systems are persistent linkage, strong typing and the referential integrity of data. Persistent linkage allows persistent objects {{to be included in the}} binding process. Strong typing guarantees that objects are only manipulated in a manner consistent with their type system descriptions. Referential integrity ensures that once a <b>link</b> (<b>reference)</b> to an object is established, its identity is unique and it persists over time. As a consequence no object can be deleted while another refers to it. Here we examine some of the advantages of providing software engineering environments within a persistent object system with strong typing and referential integrity. It is shown how the integration of system specifications, programs, configuration management tools and documentation all within a single persistent environment leads to powerful new techniques. This new power is achieved by sharing structured persistent data across the hitherto enclosing boundaries of system components...|$|E

40|$|The Jansen {{mechanism}} is a one degree-of-freedom, planar, 12 -link, leg mechanism {{that can be}} used in mobile robotic applications and in gait analysis. This paper presents the kinematics and dynamics of the Jansen leg mechanism. The forward kinematics, accomplished using circle intersection method, determines the trajectories of various points on the mechanism in the chassis (stationary <b>link)</b> <b>reference</b> frame. From the foot point trajectory, the step length is shown to vary linearly while step height varies non-linearly with change in crank radius. A dynamic model for the Jansen leg {{mechanism is}} proposed using bond graph approach with modulated multiport transformers. For given ground reaction force pattern and crank angular speed, this model helps determine the motor torque profile as well as the link and joint stresses. The model can therefore be used to rate the actuator torque and in design of the hardware and controller for such a system. The kinematics of the mechanism can also be obtained from this dynamic model. The proposed model is thus a useful tool for analysis and design of systems based on the Jansen leg mechanism.
