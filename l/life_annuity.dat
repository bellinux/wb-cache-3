25|$|In most countries, {{life and}} {{non-life}} insurers {{are subject to}} different regulatory regimes and different tax and accounting rules. The main reason for {{the distinction between the}} two types of company is that <b>life,</b> <b>annuity,</b> and pension business is very long-term in nature – coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over many decades. By contrast, non-life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.|$|E
50|$|Valuation of <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> may be {{performed}} by calculating the actuarial present value of the future life contingent payments. Life tables are {{used to calculate the}} probability that the annuitant lives to each future payment period. Valuation of <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> also depends on the timing of payments just as with <b>annuities</b> certain, however <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> may not be calculated with similar formulas because actuarial present value accounts for the probability of death at each age.|$|R

25|$|Ignoring tax, someone {{wishing to}} work for a year and then relax for a year on the same living {{standard}} needs to save 50% of pay. Similarly, someone wishing to work from age 25 to 55 and be retired for 30 years till 85 needs to save 50% of pay if government and employment pensions are not a factor and if it is considered appropriate to assume a zero real investment return. The problem that the lifespan is not known in advance can be reduced in some countries by the purchase at retirement of an inflation-indexed <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b>|$|E

500|$|As noted, the feud {{between the}} Bonvilles and Courtenays {{was rooted in}} local Devonshire politics. The rivalry between them stemmed {{from the fact that}} they were major estate holders in the south west, and further, because both had claims to crown patronage. For example, William Bonville had fought in the Hundred Years' War for both Henry VI and his father, Henry V, whilst Devon through his wife was the king's cousin. Although the earl was both the {{greatest}} landowner and the highest ranking nobleman in the county, he had in recent years seen members of the lesser gentry and nobility (such as William Bonville) receive advancement in his stead. Bonville had also furthered his own advancement by successively marrying into the lower nobility (a daughter of the Lord Grey of Ruthin) and then to an aunt of the Earl of Devon himself. The main royal office in the area – [...] and therefore the main source of royal patronage – [...] was the stewardship of the highly profitable Duchy of Cornwall. Both men had held the office alternately over recent years. Tensions between the two have been traced back to 1437, when the stewardship was taken from Courtenay and granted to William Bonville. Courtenay did receive a royal grant of £100 per annum <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> at this time. But, says Griffiths, this is unlikely to have made up for loss of the main royal office in the county. Certainly, within two years, severe attacks were being launched on Bonville's property, and by 1440, relations between the two were, Griffiths says, [...] "at breaking point." [...] This tension became apparent in open manifestations of military strength; manifestations worrying enough to government to lead to them both being summoned before council. In 1441 the stewardship was returned to the Earl of Devon, although Radford questions whether Bonville actually ever physically surrendered the office, as in November that year an arbitration took place between them to [...] "end all [...] differences." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 17th {{century was}} a period of {{advances}} in mathematics in Germany, France and England. At the same time there was a rapidly growing desire and need to place the valuation of personal risk on a more scientific basis. Independently of each other, compound interest was studied and probability theory emerged as a well-understood mathematical discipline. Another important advance came in 1662 from a London draper named John Graunt, who showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a group, or cohort, of people of the same age, despite the uncertainty of the date of death of any one individual. This study became the basis for the original life table. One could now set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people, and to calculate with some degree of accuracy how much each person in the group should contribute to a common fund assumed to earn a fixed rate of interest. The first person to demonstrate publicly how this could be done was Edmond Halley (of Halley's comet fame). Halley constructed his own life table, and showed how it could be used to calculate the premium amount someone of a given age should pay to purchase a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> [...]|$|E

60|$|In 1717 it is {{probable}} that Young accompanied the Duke of Wharton to Ireland, though so slender are the materials for his biography that the chief basis for this supposition is a passage in his “Conjectures on Original Composition,” written when he was nearly eighty, in which he intimates that he had once been in that country. But there are many facts surviving to indicate that for the next eight or nine years Young was a sort of attaché of Wharton’s. In 1719, according to legal records, the Duke granted him an annuity, in consideration of his having relinquished the office of tutor to Lord Burleigh, with a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> of £100 a year, on his Grace’s assurances that he would provide for him in a much more ample manner. And again, from the same evidence, it appears that in 1721 Young received from Wharton a bond for £600, in compensation of expenses incurred in standing for Parliament at the Duke’s desire, and as an earnest of greater services which his Grace had promised him on his refraining from the spiritual and temporal advantages of taking orders, with a certainty of two livings in the gift of his college. It is clear, therefore, that lay advancement, as long as there was any chance of it, had more attractions for Young than clerical preferment; and that at this time he accepted the Duke of Wharton as the pilot of his career.|$|E
50|$|In 1671 De Witt {{conceived}} of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> as a weighted average of annuities certain where the weights were mortality probabilities (that sum to one), thereby producing the expected {{value of the}} present value of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Edmond Halley’s (of comet fame) representation of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> dates to 1693, when he re-expressed a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> as the discounted value of each annual payment multiplied by the probability of surviving long enough to receive the payment and summed until there are no survivors. De Witt's approach was especially insightful and ahead of its time. In modern terminology, De Witt treats a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> as a random variable and its expected value is what we call the value of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Also in modern terminology, De Witt's approach allows one to readily understand other properties of this random variable such as its standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, or any other characteristic of interest.|$|E
