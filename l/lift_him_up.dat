5|$|In February 1307, Bruce reappeared {{and started}} {{gathering}} men, and in May he defeated Aymer de Valence at the Battle of Loudoun Hill. Edward, who had rallied somewhat, now moved north himself. On the way, however, he developed dysentery, and his condition deteriorated. On 6July he encamped at Burgh by Sands, {{just south of}} the Scottish border. When his servants came the next morning to <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> so that he could eat, he died in their arms.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was contested for in an Iron Man {{match in}} the seventh match, as then-champion, A.J. Styles, defended the title against Christopher Daniels. The first fall of the match came when Daniels pinned Styles {{following}} bending Styles forward, placing Styles' head between his legs, tucked Styles' arms behind Styles' back, lifted him up, turned 90°, and dropped to the mat to force Styles' face into the mat in what Daniels dubbed the Angel's Wings. Styles scored the second fall by pinning Daniels with a roll-up, tying the match one fall apiece. Before the deciding fall to break the tie could take place, the thirty-minute time limit ran out. Daniels then demanded the match go into overtime/sudden death, which he was granted by Dusty Rhodes. The deciding pinfall saw Styles grab Daniels, <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up,</b> hold him upside down, trap Daniels' arms behind his legs, and jump forward to implant Daniels entire body into the mat in a move Styles dubbed the Styles Clash to retain the X Division Championship.|$|E
25|$|Davis came {{to public}} {{prominence}} after his {{performance at the}} 1980 World Championship, where he reached the quarter-finals, defeating defending champion Terry Griffiths en route, before losing to Alex Higgins. Davis won his first major title {{in the same year}} – the UK Championship – during which he beat Griffiths 9–0 in the semi-finals and Higgins 16–6 in the final. This began an 18-month period of dominance. He won the Classic and then the International Masters and English Professional titles in 1981, and became the bookmakers' favourite to win the 1981 World Championship, despite being seeded only 15. Davis reached the final by defeating Jimmy White in the first round, Higgins in the second round, Griffiths in the quarter-finals and defending champion Cliff Thorburn in the semi-final. Davis's 18–12 victory over Doug Mountjoy in the final confirmed bookmakers' early predictions, and in celebration his manager Barry Hearn charged across the arena to <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> in the air. He would go on to reach seven out of the next eight world finals. Peculiarly, Davis's first four world finals were each against a player of a different nationality, something that had not occurred before and has not since.|$|E

25|$|After {{sitting out}} the next Pride to recuperate, Sakuraba found himself across the ring from Quinton Jackson, a former collegiate wrestler who had {{compiled}} a record of 10–1 on the American circuit. At {{the sound of the}} bell, Sakuraba immediately took the bigger man to the canvas with a low single-leg takedown. However, Jackson's superior size and enormous physical strength allowed him to muscle out of Sakuraba's submission attempts. After locking his legs around Jackson for a triangle choke, Sakuraba found himself hefted into the air and repeatedly slammed to the canvas {{in the way of a}} powerbomb. Later, he attempted an armbar against Jackson, only for the Tennessee native to again <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> and this time attempt to drop him from the ring. His expression unchanging through the course of Jackson's assault, Sakuraba continued to flow from one lock to another. Eventually, he took the back of an exhausted Jackson and submitted him with his first rear naked choke victory. The contest was a launchpad for Jackson's career, leading to a long-term contract with Pride where he eventually became regarded as a top middleweight competitor, and later, a UFC champion.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, wait. Nehushta, come hither; you are {{stronger}} than I. Now, while I unlatch the secret door, do you <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up.</b> Be swift, I hear the guard stirring without." ...|$|E
60|$|They <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> <b>up,</b> {{and he was}} overjoyed to {{find that}} {{they were about to}} take him in the {{direction}} whither the star seemed to him to lead.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Ermentrude, [...] "you {{need not}} fear for him! I saw his own folk return and <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up.</b> But {{what is he}} to thee or to us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{the only}} one with his eyes closed," [...] he said. [...] "I expect there's someone would break her heart if she knew he was lying here. Well, <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up,</b> mates." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] said George, in an {{authoritative}} tone, {{to two or}} three negroes, who were looking at the body, [...] "help me <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up,</b> and carry him to my wagon; and get me a spade." ...|$|E

60|$|Stringer and Bogart {{hurried to}} Mac and, <b>lifting</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> and {{supporting}} <b>him</b> between {{them with his}} arms around their shoulders, they led him off amid cheers from the stands. Mac was white with pain.|$|R
60|$|His men {{immediately}} mounted and followed, {{leaving the}} earl's men with their master. <b>Lifting</b> <b>him</b> <b>up,</b> they placed <b>him</b> on a horse, {{and with a}} mounted man on each side to hold <b>him</b> <b>up,</b> they moved back at a walking pace towards Wherwell.|$|R
60|$|They all {{rushed to}} <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up.</b> Tregarva {{was the first}} to take him in his arms and place him tenderly in his chair, where he lay back with glassy eyes, snoring heavily in a fit of apoplexy.|$|E
6000|$|... "If it had {{not been}} for Mr. Donald falling to the ground, I should have fainted; but Alice called me as she ran to him, and I think I was trying to <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> when the constable ran in, and I knew we were saved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't say that, Frank. This is an {{important}} business, and let us go through it steadily. I would certainly like to have him again at my feet. Whether I would deign to <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> again is another thing. Is not that natural, after {{what he has done}} to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Theseus <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> all bruised, and said, ‘Come hither {{and wash}} my feet.’ And {{he drew his}} sword, and sat down by the well, and said, ‘Wash my feet, or I cut you piecemeal.’ ...|$|R

60|$|The next morning, {{when he came}} in, {{he found}} the patient lying as ever, {{in a sort of}} heap in the bed. Nurse had had to <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> and hold him up again.

6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better <b>lift</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> on the foot board behind; James can ride his horse. We will hand the body over to the constable at Reigate.

6000|$|... "Mr. Sampson {{will bear}} witness that I struck fair, and that Mr. Esmond hit the first blow," [...] said Mr. Warrington.

60|$|Her {{strength}} {{was gone and}} she could only wait. More soldiers had come up and were using their fists freely, and gradually the crowd retired, still snarling; and they <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> and brought <b>him</b> to her.|$|R
60|$|The {{men took}} Walter under {{the arms and}} <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> <b>up,</b> and half dragged, half carried {{him out of the}} stable and into the house adjoining. He was taken into a room where four or five men were sitting.|$|R
