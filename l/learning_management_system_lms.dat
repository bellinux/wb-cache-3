40|$|Today an {{increasing}} number of schools and organizations are investing in so called <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Systems.</b> Researchers disagree on the pedagogical value of these tools. Some mean that <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Systems</b> cement old-fashioned behaviouristic teaching practices; others mean that the systems provide good opportunities in supporting learning in a socio cultural perspective. The aim {{of this study is to}} reach better understanding and increased knowledge of how the introduction of a <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System</b> influences the role of the teacher and how the learning is organized. We have conducted two case studies. The data was gathered in qualitative semi-structured interviews with six teachers, and in document studies. The questions that were answered were: How was the implementation of the <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System</b> organized? What kind of attitude do the teachers have towards the <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System?</b> In what way has the access to a <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System</b> influenced how the teaching is organized? How has the introduction of a <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System</b> affected the role of the teacher? The result shows that the implementation was organized in very different ways; in one of the cases there was a clear plan and a goal, and in the other case the implementation process was vaguer. The teachers had a positive attitude to the <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System,</b> but the access to a <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System</b> had no substantial effect on how the teaching was organized. However, all the teachers agreed that the role of the teacher in the <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System</b> is different from the role of the teacher in the classroom. In the <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System</b> there is more focus on text based communication which puts increased demands on clear and formal language, the teachers also need to plan their work more carefully and the <b>Learning</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System</b> puts increased demands on the technical competence of the teachers...|$|R

A research study was conducted to investigate the complexity of factors that could influence the use of <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> and to identify the individual, organizational, and technological factors that were affecting the use of the <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> for students. <b>Learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> are tools to improve learn-ing outcomes.

The primary purpose of <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> is to provide proper virtual educational environments and convenient communicational channels between instructors and students letting them to overcome the barrier {{of time and space}} for the general schooling. In this paper, we are investigating the security vulnerabilities in such <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> Especially, we are examining the vulnerability discovery process in the two popular <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems,</b> Moodle and Blackboard, using datasets spanning a decade. We applied two vulnerability discovery models to examine the vulnerability discovery process quantitatively. The discovery models allow us to estimate the approximate number of vulnerabilities likely to be discovered in software systems in the future. It also helps policy makers when they need to decide which <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> will be adopted for their organizations when security is an extremely important factor. Result shows that the vulnerability discovery process in <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> could be predictable which could be utilized for IT risk assessment in organizations having the systems...|$|R
