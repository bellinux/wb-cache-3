40|$|This paper investigates {{nonlinear}} bending and buckling behaviours of composite plates {{characterized by}} a thickness variation. Layer interfaces are described as functions of inplane coordinates. Top and bottom surfaces of the plate are symmetric about the midplane and the plate could {{be considered as a}} flat surface in analysis along with thickness parameters which vary over the plate. The variable thickness at a certain position in the midplane is modeled by a set of control points (or thickness-parameters) through NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline) basic functions. The knot parameter space which is referred in modelling geometry and approximating displacement variables is employed for approximating thickness, simultaneously. The use of quadratic NURBS functions results in C^ 1 continuity of modeling variable thickness and analyzing solutions. Thin to moderately thick <b>laminates</b> <b>in</b> <b>bound</b> of first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) are taken into account. Strain-displacement relations in sense of von-Karman theory are employed for large deformation. Riks method is used for geometrically nonlinear analysis. The weak form is approximated numerically by the isogeometric analysis (IGA), which {{has been found to be}} a robust, stable and realistic numerical tool. Numerical results confirm the reliability and capacity of the propose method...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry {{is beginning to}} use advanced composite materials for primary load bearing structures and their failure mechanisms must be better understood to predict their behavior in service. The Combined Loads Tests (COLTS) facility is being constructed at the NASA Langley Research Center to characterize these failure mechanisms. Laser based ultrasonic NDE can monitor the samples during dynamic loading without interfering with the structural tests. However, the constraints of implementing laser ultrasound in a structures laboratory reduces {{the efficiency of the}} technique. The system has to be “eye-safe” because many people will be present during the structural tests. Consequently, laser light has to be delivered through fiber optics and a significant amount of light is lost. Also, the nature of the composite materials makes laser ultrasonic inspection difficult. The composites of interest are formed from woven layers that are stitched through the <b>laminate</b> thickness and <b>bound</b> <b>in</b> a resin matrix. These materials attenuate ultrasound strongly and exhibit a high degree of scattering. In this paper, we describe a field-deployable laser based ultrasonic NDE system that we developed to investigate structures during testing in the COLTS facility. We illustrate the design constraints that reduced efficiency and present some ultrasonic data from thick stitched composites...|$|R
