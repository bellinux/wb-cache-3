25|$|Spacecraft {{propulsion}} is any {{method used}} to accelerate spacecraft and artificial satellites. There {{are many different}} methods. Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a supersonic de <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzle.</b> This sort of engine is called a rocket engine.|$|E

These nozzles turn the hot {{gas from the}} combustion chamber into a cooler, hypersonic, highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2% to 64%. On 16 March 1926 Robert Goddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled rocket in Auburn, Massachusetts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{analysis}} of gas flow through de <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzles</b> involves {{a number of}} concepts and assumptions: ...|$|R
50|$|This {{principle}} {{was first}} used in a rocket engine by Robert Goddard. Most modern rocket engines that employ hot gas combustion use de <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Then the {{hot gases}} enter the jet <b>nozzles</b> (De <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzles),</b> {{where they are}} first constricted, then allowed to expand, thereby {{accelerating}} them to supersonic speed and creating reactive thrust.|$|R
25|$|First, fuel {{should be}} burned {{in a small}} {{combustion}} chamber, instead of building the entire propellant container to withstand the high pressures. Second, rockets could be arranged in stages. Finally, the exhaust speed (and thus the efficiency) could be greatly increased to beyond {{the speed of sound}} by using a De <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzle.</b> He patented these concepts in 1914. He also independently developed the mathematics of rocket flight.|$|E
25|$|Goddard {{described}} extensive {{experiments with}} solid-fuel rocket engines burning high grade nitrocellulose smokeless powder. A critical breakthrough {{was the use}} of the steam turbine nozzle invented by the Swedish inventor Gustaf de Laval. The de <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzle</b> allows the most efficient (isentropic) conversion of the energy of hot gases into forward motion. By means of this nozzle, Goddard increased the efficiency of his rocket engines from 2 percent to 64 percent and obtained supersonic exhaust velocities of over Mach 7.|$|E
25|$|Spaceflight {{became an}} {{engineering}} possibility {{with the work}} of Robert H. Goddard's publication in 1919 of his paper A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes. His application of the de <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzle</b> to liquid fuel rockets improved efficiency enough for interplanetary travel to become possible. He also proved in the laboratory that rockets would work in the vacuum of space; nonetheless, his work was not taken seriously by the public. His attempt to secure an Army contract for a rocket-propelled weapon in the first World War was defeated by the November 11, 1918 armistice with Germany.|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the structure and stochastic asymmetry of pseudo-shock systems in <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzles</b> with parallel side walls in detail by numerical and experimental means. The location of the pseudo-shock system is defined in an adiabatic system of two successive chocked <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzles</b> by {{the ratio of the}} critical cross sections A 2 */A 1 *, the stagnation pressure loss across the shock system and viscous losses. Depending on the geometry and the test conditions, the pseudo-shock system attaches stochastically to the upper and lower nozzle wall where the driving mechanism is analysed by means of high speed and short pulse Schlieren visualisation and numerical simulations...|$|R

500|$|The engine's nozzle is [...] {{long with}} a {{diameter}} of [...] at its throat and [...] at its exit. The nozzle is a bell-shaped extension bolted to the main combustion chamber, {{referred to as a}} de <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The RS-25 nozzle has an unusually large expansion ratio (about 77.5:1) for the chamber pressure. At sea level, a nozzle of this ratio would normally undergo flow separation of the jet from the nozzle, which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage the vehicle. However, to aid the engine's operation [...] Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle walls from the theoretical optimum for thrust, reducing it near the exit. This raises the pressure just around the rim to an absolute pressure between , and prevents flow separation. The inner part of the flow is at much lower pressure, around [...] or less. The inner surface of each nozzle is cooled by liquid hydrogen flowing through brazed stainless steel tube wall coolant passages. On the Space Shuttle, a support ring welded to the forward end of the nozzle is the engine attach point to the orbiter-supplied heat shield. Thermal protection is necessary because of the exposure portions of the nozzles experience during the launch, ascent, on-orbit and entry phases of a mission. The insulation consists of four layers of metallic batting covered with a metallic foil and screening.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, Meyer sought further {{employment}} in theoretical physics {{but could not}} find it in depression-era postwar Germany. [...] Ludwig Prandtl was not financially able to hire him, but Meyer did design the de <b>Laval</b> <b>nozzle</b> for a supersonic wind tunnel that Prandtl wanted to build.

2500|$|The obvious {{result is}} {{that in order to}} {{accelerate}} a flow to supersonic, one needs a convergent-divergent nozzle, where the converging section accelerates the flow to sonic speeds, and the diverging section continues the acceleration.
