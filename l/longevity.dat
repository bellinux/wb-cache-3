5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median <b>longevity</b> of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean <b>longevity</b> of 13.41years {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional <b>longevity</b> for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.|$|E

5000|$|There {{appears to}} be only one health survey of Anatolian Shepherds, done in 2004 by the UK Kennel Club.

The leading causes of death of the dogs in the survey were cancer (22%), [...] "combinations" [...] (17%), cardiac (13%), and old age (13%).|$|R
5|$|Though coral {{have large}} sexually-reproducing populations, their {{evolution}} can be slowed by abundant asexual reproduction. Gene flow is variable among coral species. According to the biogeography of coral species gene flow cannot {{be counted on}} as a dependable source of adaptation as they are very stationary organisms. Also, coral <b>longevity</b> might factor into their adaptivity.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{is not as}} hard as some {{grades of}} {{heat-treated}} steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used.
