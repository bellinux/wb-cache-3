5|$|Identified <b>land-based</b> {{resources}} {{throughout the}} world averaging 1% nickel or greater comprise at least 130 million tons of nickel (about the double of known reserves). About 60% is in laterites and 40% in sulfide deposits.|$|E
5|$|The <b>land-based</b> search, {{including}} shoreline searching, was {{the responsibility}} of Halifax Regional Search and Rescue. The organization was responsible for all ground operations including military operations and other ground search and rescue teams.|$|E
5|$|Further {{education}} in Yeovil is principally offered by Yeovil College, with <b>land-based</b> studies available through a Yeovil centre of Bridgwater College, and some provision through private providers. It also contains one higher education university centre, University Centre Yeovil. The registered awarding {{body for the}} university centre is primarily Bournemouth University with University of the West of England offering some additional courses.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s the United States Maritime Administration funded {{a special}} program to train a {{contingent}} of 50 Seattle firefighters to provide <b>land-based</b> support in the control and extinguishing of dockside and shipboard conflagrations. The effort, which was studied by the Stanford Research Institute, later became {{a model for other}} waterfront cities.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that, {{as in other}} {{polygynous}} animals (in which males compete for association with harems of females), Pteranodon lived primarily on offshore rookeries, where they could nest away from <b>land-based</b> predators and feed far from shore; most Pteranodon fossils are found in locations which at the time, were hundreds of kilometres from the coastline.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February 1942, the Japanese carrier {{striking}} force, {{consisting of}} aircraft carriers Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu, and Soryu {{under the command}} of Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, launched 189 planes to attack Darwin. The carrier planes rendezvoused with 54 <b>land-based</b> bombers from Kendari and Ambon.|$|E
5|$|Since Leyte was out {{of range}} of Kenney's <b>land-based</b> aircraft, MacArthur was {{dependent}} on carrier aircraft. Japanese air activity soon increased, with raids on Tacloban, where MacArthur decided to establish his headquarters, and on the fleet offshore. MacArthur enjoyed staying on Nashvilles bridge during air raids, although several bombs landed close by, and two nearby cruisers were hit. Over the next few days, the Japanese counterattacked in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, resulting in a near-disaster that MacArthur attributed to the command being divided between himself and Nimitz. Nor did the campaign ashore proceed smoothly. Heavy monsoonal rains disrupted the airbase construction program. Carrier aircraft proved to be no substitute for <b>land-based</b> aircraft, and the lack of air cover permitted the Japanese to pour troops into Leyte. Adverse weather and tough Japanese resistance slowed the American advance, resulting in a protracted campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} <b>land-based</b> subductive {{waste disposal}} method would dispose of nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land, and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method {{has been described}} as a viable means of disposing of radioactive waste, and as a state-of-the-art nuclear waste disposal technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} G and H {{models were}} used for nuclear standby ("alert") duty {{as part of the}} United States' nuclear triad, the combination of nuclear-armed <b>land-based</b> missiles, submarine-based missiles and manned bombers. The B-1, intended to supplant the B-52, replaced only the older models and the supersonic FB-111. In 1991, B-52s ceased continuous 24-hour SAC alert duty.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Great Britain and Ireland, {{ships in}} distress, {{or the public}} {{reporting}} an accident, contact the emergency services by telephone or radio. Calls are redirected to HM Coastguard or the Irish Coast Guard as appropriate, who will coordinate air-sea rescue operations and may call on the RNLI (or independent lifeboats), their own <b>land-based</b> rescue personnel and rescue helicopters to help.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{far from}} land are tracked by weather satellites capturing visible and infrared images from space, usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals. As a storm approaches land, {{it can be}} observed by <b>land-based</b> Doppler weather radar. Radar {{plays a crucial role}} around landfall by showing a storm's location and intensity every several minutes.|$|E
5|$|Two torpedoes {{fired by}} <b>land-based</b> torpedo {{batteries}} struck the ship, causing serious damage. A major {{fire broke out}} aboard Bl√ºcher, {{which could not be}} contained. After a magazine explosion, the ship sank, with major loss of life. The wreck remains {{on the bottom of the}} Oslofjord.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{conducted}} many {{air raids}} on Japan during World War II, causing extensive destruction to the country's cities and killing between 241,000 and 900,000 people. During {{the first years}} of the Pacific War these attacks were limited to the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 and small-scale raids on military positions in the Kuril Islands from mid-1943. Strategic bombing raids began in June 1944 and continued until the end of the war in August 1945. Allied naval and <b>land-based</b> tactical air units also attacked Japan during 1945.|$|E
5|$|Although press freedoms have {{improved}} {{since the first}} decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as <b>land-based</b> telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since {{the first decade of}} the 21st century and are largely unregulated.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{a number}} of <b>land-based</b> {{gravitational}} wave detectors are in operation, and a mission to launch a space-based detector, LISA, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) which was launched in 2015. Gravitational wave observations {{can be used to}} obtain information about compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes, and also to probe the state of the early universe fractions of a second after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Egypt is a {{prolific}} operator of the Sea King, using many different variants {{for a wide}} variety of purposes. In addition to operating ASW Sea Kings for coastal patrols, Egypt procured a <b>land-based</b> transport adapted from the basic Sea King, marketed by Westland as the Commando, including a VIP subvariant. An electronic warfare version was also deployed by the Egyptian Air Force, featuring sophisticated onboard jamming systems. As of 2011, 23 Sea Kings/Commandos remain in service with Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In the battle, Japanese naval <b>land-based</b> torpedo bombers, {{seeking to}} provide {{protection}} for the impending evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal, made several attacks over two days on US warships operating as a task force south of this island. In addition to approaching Guadalcanal {{with the objective of}} engaging any Japanese ships that might come into range, the U.S. task force was protecting an Allied transport ship convoy carrying replacement troops there.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to the Japanese {{invasion}} of Java {{a force of}} 242carrier and <b>land-based</b> aircraft attacked Darwin on 19 February 1942. At the time Darwin was an important base for Allied warships and a staging point for shipping supplies and reinforcements into the NEI. The Japanese attack was successful, and resulted {{in the deaths of}} 235 military personnel and civilians, many of whom were non-Australian Allied seamen, and heavy damage to RAAF Base Darwin and the town's port facilities.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{aircraft}} made almost 100 raids, {{most of them}} small, against northern Australia during 1942 and 1943. <b>Land-based</b> IJN aircraft {{took part}} {{in many of the}} 63 raids on Darwin which took place after the initial attack. The town of Broome, Western Australia experienced a devastating attack by IJN fighter planes on 3 March 1942, in which at least 88 people were killed. Long-range seaplanes operating from bases in the Solomon Islands made a number of small attacks on towns in Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Japanese carrier {{doctrine}} {{preferred the}} launching of fully constituted strikes rather than piecemeal attacks. Without confirmation of whether the American force included carriers (not received until 08:20), Nagumo's reaction was doctrinaire. In addition, the arrival of another <b>land-based</b> American air strike at 07:53 gave weight {{to the need to}} attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Of the 108 Japanese {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged to some degree. The initial Japanese attack {{did not succeed in}} neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's <b>land-based</b> defenses were intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's defenses would be necessary if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{have been}} used as food, for clothing, as pets, and as {{laboratory}} animals in research. Some species, in particular the brown rat, the black rat, and the house mouse, are serious pests, eating and spoiling food stored by humans, and spreading diseases. Accidentally introduced species of rodents are often considered to be invasive, and have caused the extinction of numerous species, such as island birds, previously isolated from <b>land-based</b> predators.|$|E
5|$|Several nomadic {{indigenous}} groups in Maritime Southeast Asia live in boats and derive nearly {{all they need}} from the sea. The Moken people live on the coasts of Thailand and Burma and islands in the Andaman Sea. The Bajau people are originally from the Sulu Archipelago, Mindanao, and northern Borneo. Some Sea Gypsies are accomplished free-divers, able to descend to depths of , though many are adopting a more settled, <b>land-based</b> way of life.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} manganese ore is pyrolusite (MnO2). Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial {{relation to the}} iron ores. <b>Land-based</b> resources are large but irregularly distributed. About 80% of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa; other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine, Australia, India, China, Gabon and Brazil. According to 1978 estimate, the ocean floor has 500 billion tons of manganese nodules. Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The new fort {{was built}} as an {{extension}} to the north-west of the existing battery, and thus took an irregular plan. The rampart was extended to accommodate more guns ‚Äì a total of seventeen 32-pdrs. ‚Äì and a much enlarged interior replaced the old barracks and magazine. Caponiers at the east side and firing positions on the other sides facilitated musketry defence against <b>land-based</b> assailants. The fort {{was surrounded by a}} wide water-filled ditch. A bridge on the west (landward) side provided the only access route.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I largely halted the dreadnought arms race as funds and technical resources were diverted to more pressing priorities. The foundries which produced battleship guns were dedicated {{instead to the}} production of <b>land-based</b> artillery, and shipyards were flooded with orders for small ships. The weaker naval powers engaged in the Great War‚ÄîFrance, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia‚Äîsuspended their battleship programmes entirely. The United Kingdom and Germany continued building battleships and battlecruisers but at a reduced pace.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the air forced through the phonic lips is the right nasal passage. While the left nasal passage opens to the blow hole, the right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips. It is thought that the {{nostrils}} of the <b>land-based</b> ancestor of the sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions, the left nostril becoming the blowhole and the right nostril becoming the phonic lips.|$|E
5|$|The √òstfold Line is {{the railway}} that connects Norway to Continental Europe, and 80% of all <b>land-based,</b> {{international}} freight transport goes through √òstfold. Until the Follo Line opens, there cannot be a capacity increase on international freight trains to Norway. The Rail Administration {{has set a}} goal of tripling the amount of rail freight by 2040, which for the South Corridor is equal to the removal of 750 trucks per day from European Route E18. The Follo Line will also allow freight trains to pass during rush hour.|$|E
5|$|Their {{collaboration}} proved successful when, on the 3tht {{day at sea}} on the 1976 voyage, Mau stated {{soon they}} would see land, and the next day, Tahiti. A few hours later, they spotted <b>land-based</b> white terns (Gygis alba) followed by a diminution of the trade-wind swell. That night, they spotted Mataiva. After a brief stopover, {{with little more than}} another day's sailing they made landfall at Tahiti where they were welcomed by 17,000 people, half the population of Tahiti.|$|E
5|$|This, {{and other}} {{successful}} hit-and-run raids by American carriers in the South Pacific, showed {{that they were}} still a threat, although seemingly reluctant to be drawn into an all-out battle. Yamamoto reasoned that another air attack on the main U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor would induce all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers. However, considering the increased strength of American <b>land-based</b> air power on the Hawaiian Islands since the December 7 attack the previous year, he judged that it was now too risky to attack Pearl Harbor directly.|$|E
5|$|Whitehead assumed {{command of}} the Fifth Air Force in June 1944, {{although}} he remained subordinate to Kenney. In the Battle of Leyte, MacArthur attempted to move forward beyond the range of <b>land-based</b> aircraft. A long battle of attrition then began {{on the ground and}} in the air, as the Fifth Air Force struggled to gain the upper hand with inadequate numbers of aircraft that could be based on Leyte. Gradually, Whitehead gained the upper hand. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 5 June 1945.|$|E
5|$|WilliamI {{inherited}} the Anglo-Saxon {{system in which}} the king drew his revenues from: a mixture of customs; profits from re-minting coinage; fines; profits from his own demesne lands; and the system of English <b>land-based</b> taxation called the geld. William reaffirmed this system, enforcing collection of the geld through his new system of sheriffs and increasing the taxes on trade. William was also famous for commissioning the Domesday Book in 1086, a vast document which attempted to record the economic condition of his new kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Allied air {{and naval}} attacks against Japanese {{shipping}} in the South China Sea were expanded during early 1945 as additional USAAF units moved into {{bases in the}} Philippines and other demands on these forces permitted. <b>Land-based</b> patrol aircraft and medium bombers operated over the sea from liberated areas of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies from February. While Allied submarines and these aircraft failed to prevent the escape of the Ise-class battleships when they sailed for Japan during Operation Kita in mid-February, the medium bombers were sinking large numbers of Japanese merchant ships {{by the end of}} the month. Medium and heavy bombers also raided Japanese-held ports across the South China Sea area. As a result of the air and submarine attacks, the Japanese ceased sending ships through the South China Sea in April.|$|E
5|$|Around 2 {{million tonnes}} of nickel are {{produced}} annually worldwide. The Philippines, Indonesia, Russia, Canada and Australia are the world's largest producers of nickel, {{as reported by}} the US Geological Survey. The largest deposits of nickel in non-Russian Europe are located in Finland and Greece. Identified <b>land-based</b> resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons of nickel. About 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits. In addition, extensive deep-sea resources of nickel are in manganese crusts and nodules covering large areas of the ocean floor, particularly in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Dorchester has {{a private}} school, Sunninghill Prep School, {{thirteen}} first schools, three middle schools and an upper school; the Thomas Hardye School {{was founded in}} 1569 by a merchant and in 2011 had 2,283 pupils on the role. The author Thomas Hardy was a school governor here from 1909 until shortly before his death. Nineteen schools in the Dorchester area form the Dorchester Area Schools Partnership (DASP). Kingston Maurward College is a <b>land-based</b> studies college {{on the outskirts of}} the town. It offers full-time and part-time courses, apprenticeships and university-level courses in a wide range of subjects including agriculture, horticulture, conservation, construction, countryside and wildlife management.|$|E
