5000|$|John D. Lowry (June 2, 1932 - January 21, 2012) was a Canadian film {{restoration}} {{expert and}} innovator who founded Lowry Digital Images in 1988. His film restoration company, headquartered in Burbank, California, had {{been credited with}} restoring, preserving, and, in many cases, saving early Hollywood films which may have otherwise deteriorated beyond retrieval. Lowry developed his own techniques and technology, called the <b>Lowry</b> <b>Process,</b> which, {{as defined by the}} Los Angeles Times reduces [...] "visual [...] "noise" [...] in motion pictures" [...] which then makes it possible to undertake other forms of restoration, such as removing dirt and scratches, reducing flicker. and sharpening the quality of existing images. Lowry used his process to restore and preserve more than five hundred classic films, including Singin' in the Rain, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Casablanca, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Bambi, Sunset Boulevard, and the James Bond film franchise.|$|E
40|$|The {{fixation}} {{mechanism of}} copper chrome arsenate wood preservative is investigated. Parameters examined, include: pressure, solution temperature, solution strength, second stage treatment {{with water and}} oil, initial vacuum and timber pack design. The influence of these parameters is determined by analysing; basic density, penetration, preservative retention and leaching characteristics. Legislative leachate levels are also investigated. The timber used in the trials is kiln dried, structural grade F 5 heartwood and sapwood of Pinus radiata D. Don. Radiata pine roundwood is also used. Two pilot scale treatment plants are utilised during the trials. Processes conducted, are the modified Bethell, Lowry and Alternating Pressure Method (APM). Simulated rainfall is applied to every timber pack after treatment. Significant differences between percentage leachates resulting from the timber packs, {{are determined by the}} Friedman test and multiple comparison analysis. Investigation of leachate concentrations revealed no world legislative standard. Concentration of copper leachate was suggested as a way to monitor leaching in the aquatic environment. In the soil environment, concentration of chromium leachate was recommended. Heartwood penetration was improved and leachate concentration was decreased when the treating pressure was increased. Concentration of chromium and copper leachate also appeared to decrease when the solution temperature was increased. In contrast, at the higher temperatures, the concentration of arsenic leachate increased. Chromium leachate concentration also decreased when solution strength was increased in Lowry or APM treatment of roundwood. A similar trend was noted when treated timber was subjected to a second stage treatment that involved water or oil. A plastic wrap applied to the timber pack also reduced the concentration of chromium leachate. Chromium leachate concentration and heartwood penetration were influenced by the alteration of the initial vacuum in modified Bethell treatment. Heartwood penetration was improved when low pressure treatment was conducted using the <b>Lowry</b> <b>process,</b> rather than the modified Bethell process.

40|$|It is {{established}} that rats fed diets low in protein and deficient in lipotropic substances develop fatty changes and cirrhosis of the liver. Although {{many studies have}} been made relative to the production and prevention of dietary cirrhosis in the rat, few reports {{have dealt with the}} treatment of this disease. The fact that choline prevents this form of cirrhosis suggests that it may be of value in the treatment. However, {{this may not be the}} case, since a substance which prevents hepatic injury need not necessarily promote repair and regeneration of the injured liver. Moreover, multiple factors may be involved in the reparative <b>process.</b> <b>Lowry,</b> Daft, Sebrell, Ashburn, and Lillie in 1941 (1) reported results of short term treatment in a small series of rats with nutritional cirrhosis. The addition of choline to a basal diet containing 4 per cent leached casein, or the change to a diet containing 50 per cent casein brought about the disappearance of liver fat and regeneration of liver cells, but the excess of connective tissue seemed to remain unchanged. In a later study (2) the periods of treatment were extended up to 1 yea...|$|R
