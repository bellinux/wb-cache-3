40|$|A well {{integrity}} survey {{performed by}} the Petroleum Safety Authority showed that tubing related problems are a major issue on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Caliper log runs carried out by ConocoPhillips revealed that the production tubing in a bent section contained local scars with a wall thickness reduction up to 47 %. In order to ensure a sufficient well integrity, a accurate prediction of the de- rated tubing strength is important. Today, the most common methods to estimate the de-rated burst and collapse pressures of a damaged tubing are the API models, which assume a uniform wear. In this thesis the Finite Element Method have been applied in order to investigate if the API models also are applicable for a locally worn tubing. Three different <b>local</b> <b>wear</b> shapes have been simulated, referred to as crescent, wedge and rectangular shaped. The results shows that as the wear depth increases up to 50 %, the deviation between the FEM results and the API model for burst reaches up to 71 %, 114 % and 147 %, respectively. The models for collapse showed a similar trend, but with a significantly lower deviation compared to the burst model. According to the FEM results the API models can not be applied for a tubing with a <b>local</b> <b>wear.</b> The overall results proves the need to perform a FEM based analysis for a locally damaged tubular {{in order to ensure}} sufficient well integrity...|$|E

40|$|Material wear due to {{erosion-corrosion}} in slurry {{transport equipment}} is prevalent in process {{industries such as}} the oilsands industry. Damage to equipment can cost a typical oilsands industry nearly £ 200 million annually, along with an associated health and safety risk to man and environment [6]. New materials are continuously developed in order to endure wear under adverse erosion-corrosion conditions better and laboratory testing offers a good option to test new materials prior to commission. Traditionally {{the performance of a}} set of new materials are assessed based on their overall wear behavior in a laboratory test and is ranked accordingly, with the best performing material generally used for application. However, due to differences in prevailing conditions on the material surface and geometrical variations between actual and test geometry, accurately correlating data from a laboratory test to field scenario can be highly complex. Also the ranking system is not capable of predicting wear profiles for specific conditions and hence a new wear prediction method was developed and is presented in this thesis. This method has been developed, using a combination of standard laboratory based experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations. As a starting point only wear due to erosion is considered and this thesis provides validation of such an approach. The method involves two stages in which (i) a universal wear map is generated for the material and abrasive combination in question using a standard laboratory test Uet impingement test) to generate a wear scar on a simple geometry. The <b>local</b> <b>wear</b> rate from this is interpreted using a CFD simulation of the test to generate a map giving <b>local</b> <b>wear</b> as a function of particle impact velocity and angle; (ii) a CFD solution is calculated for a series of different erosion configurations giving the particle impact data at each point on the surface. The wear map from the first stage is then used to give the <b>local</b> <b>wear</b> rate. The power of this method is that once a material-specific map has been generated then wear on any geometry can be calculated through the simulation of flow using CFD. As validation of this, wear on a typical plant geometry (1. 50 90 0 elbow bend) is undertaken and the general applicability of this method is demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract: The {{possibility}} of {{application of the}} advanced hypertrochoid curve in the inner surface of the stator of fixed displacement hydraulic vane pump, theoretically was studied in the last our work. By considering the properties of this curve, sealing action between pressure and suction sides of the pump can be improved. One of the important characteristics of a new profile must be improving of the inertial reaction of the vanes in each position where these vanes have a radial movement because it causes a smooth sliding motion of the vanes and hence, a higher performance of the pump while attaining a longer life of it. Then at this paper, {{the effect of the}} inertial force of the vanes on the performance of the pump with this curve will be studied. The regular motion of the vanes on the inner surface of the stator with smooth profile suppresses the lateral reactional force applied to the vanes and results to diminish <b>local</b> <b>wear</b> of the vanes tip and noise.

40|$|Wear is {{currently}} quantified as mass {{loss of the}} bearing materials measured using gravimetric methods. However, this method does not provide other information, such as volumetric loss or surface deviation. In this work, we validated a technique to quantify polyethylene wear in three different batches of ultrahigh-molecular-polyethylene acetabular cups used for hip implants using nondestructive microcomputed tomography. Three different configurations of polyethylene acetabular cups, previously tested under the ISO 14242 parameters, were tested on a hip simulator for an additional 2 million cycles using a modified ISO 14242 load waveform. In this context, a new approach was proposed in order to simulate, on a hip joint simulator, high-demand activities. In addition, {{the effects of these}} activities were analyzed in terms of wear and deformations of those polyethylenes by means of gravimetric method and micro X-ray computed tomography. In particular, while the gravimetric method was used for weight loss assessment, microcomputed tomography allowed for acquisition of additional quantitative information about the evolution of <b>local</b> <b>wear</b> and deformation through three-dimensional surface deviation maps for the entire cups' surface. Experimental results showed that the wear and deformation behavior of these materials change according to different mechanical simulations...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} approach ie laboratory {{life testing}} {{to examine the}} reliability of products takes long time and involves tremendous cost as samples are tested till failures. The accelerated life test (ALT) has recently been used as an alternative method. Although ALT reduces the cost of reliability testing through applying more severe environmental conditions than the normal ones, {{it is no longer}} sufficient as it does not describe the process of products’ failure explicitly and it is still highly dependent on physical testing. Consequently, novel practices need to be developed for better understanding of the products’ reliability. A novel Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model incorporating mathematical wear equations is developed in the current work and applied to polymer materials. Wear rate, a key parameter, is calculated by using a combinatorial formula that combines a conventional linear equation with a recently published exponential equation. The <b>local</b> <b>wear</b> is firstly calculated and then integrated over the sliding distance. The FEA simulation works in a loop and performs a series of simulation with updated surface geometries. The simulation is in good agreement with the physical testing result. <br /...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a numerical model {{to predict the}} wear of worm gear. This last is based on well-known Archard’swear formulation. The influence of lubrication is taken into account with a <b>local</b> <b>wear</b> coefficient, depending on the ratiobetween the minimum lubricant film thickness and the amplitude of the surface roughness. When material on a wheelflank is worn, it is then necessary to update the surface profile, consequently the contact pressure calculations. Tocompute the quasi-static load sharing and thus the contact pressures required for the wear model, the equation ofdisplacement compatibility is solved, using the influence coefficient method, which allows a fast and accurate computing. The bending deflections of the worm and wheel, and the local contact deformations of mating surfaces are included. TheBoussinesq theory is applied for calculating the local contact deformations. The bending {{is determined by the}} combinationof only one standard finite element method computation and interpolation functions. This method allows takinginto account the environment of the gear meshing, such as the actual shafts, rim, web, bearing locations, which affect thequasi-static results and thus the wear. In addition, the model allows to obtain numerous results, such as load sharing,contact pressures distribution, transmission error, stiffness, wear distribution, etc. A comparison between theoreticalwear predictions and experimental results, issued from the literature, are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{that have}} carried out fretting wear tests have presented results which show a variation (usually an increase) in the friction force during the sliding phase of individual cycles. This phenomenon {{is contrary to}} the Amontons/Coulomb model of friction which predicts a constant friction force as sliding proceeds. An in-line fretting test involving an abrupt increase in amplitude was used to show that the effect is a result of wear scar interaction effects. A pair of rotational fretting tests were then carried out to determine whether these interaction effects originate from interaction of the wear scar ends, or whether such interaction occurs throughout the nominal contact area. A new experimental rig designed to adapt conventional in-line test machines for rotational fretting was designed and built for this purpose. Results show that the friction variation occurs whether or not wear scar ends are present. After testing, the worn surface topography of each fretting pair was scanned using a focus variation microscope, and these surface images revealed the existence (and size) of many distributed local peaks and troughs distributed throughout the contact area. In conclusion, the friction variation commonly observed in the literature arises predominantly from the interaction of <b>local</b> <b>wear</b> scar features distributed over the contact region. © (2011) Trans tech publications Switzerland...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 153 Crude {{oil and gas}} {{production}} can be enhanced by multiphase pumping from the well subsea to far distant production platforms. The twin-screw pump has proven quite suitable for this application. The positive displacement principle offers efficient multiphase performance within a wide range of gas void fractions and can handle hydroabrasive conditions fairly well, too. The paper reports about modeling the hydrodynamic performance and hydroabrasive wear of twin-screw pumps. The influence of the gas void fraction on the pump capacity can be modeled by the ?disc model? and assumptions about the fluid conditions in the internal pump clearances. The model implemented into a computer program will be verified by experimental testing of various pump features with respect to performance, pressure distribution, thermodynamics, and bending deflection of the screw shafts. The phenomena of the hydroabrasive wear will be studied by the rotary clearance tribometer as well as with pump field tests with silica sand/water suspensions.
