60|$|As the {{sun rose}} {{on the morning of}} the 3d of June 171-, the report of a cannon was heard rolling along the waters of the Hudson. Smoke issued from an {{embrasure}} of a small fortress, that stood on the point of land where the river and the bay mingle their waters. The explosion was followed by the appearance of a flag, which, as it rose to the summit of its staff and unfolded itself heavily in the <b>light</b> <b>current</b> of air, showed the blue field and red cross of the English ensign. At the distance of several miles, the dark masts of a ship were to be seen, faintly relieved by the verlant back-ground of the heights of Staten Island. A little cloud floated over this object, and then an answering signal came dull and rumbling to the town. The flag that the cruiser set was not visible in the distance.|$|E
60|$|Unable {{to account}} for this change, Deerslayer could {{restrain}} his impatience no longer. Hitching his body along, with the utmost caution, he got his eye at the bullet hole, and fortunately commanded a very tolerable view of the point. The canoe, by one of those imperceptible impulses that so often decide the fate of men {{as well as the}} course of things, had inclined southerly, and was slowly drifting down the lake. It was lucky that Deerslayer had given it a shove sufficiently vigorous to send it past the end of the point, ere it took this inclination, or it must have gone ashore again. As it was, it drifted so near it as to bring the tops of two or three trees within the range of the young man's view, as has been mentioned, and, indeed, to come in quite as close proximity with the extremity of the point as was at all safe. The distance could not much have exceeded a hundred feet, though fortunately a <b>light</b> <b>current</b> of air from the southwest began to set it slowly off shore.|$|E
6000|$|With {{the crew}} {{it was a}} {{different}} matter. As soon as they had got drunk on the wines and spirits they had brought from the wreck, and then had got sober because they had drunk all the liquors up, they began to be more manageable; when their provisions ran short, and they were made to understand {{that they would not be}} allowed to plunder the fields and woods, or loot the villages for something to eat, they became almost exemplarily docile. At first they were disposed to show fight, and the principles of the Altrurians did not allow them to use violence in bringing them to subjection; but the men had counted without their hosts in supposing that they could therefore do as they pleased, unless they pleased to do right. After they had made their first foray they were warned by Cyril, who came from the capital to speak English with them, that another raid would not be suffered. They therefore attempted it by night, but the Altrurians were prepared for them with the flexible steel nets which are their only means of defence, and half a dozen sailors were taken in one. When they attempted to break out, and their shipmates attempted to break in to free them, a <b>light</b> <b>current</b> of electricity was sent through the wires and the thing was done. Those who were rescued--the Altrurians will not say captured--had hoes put into their hands the next morning, and were led into the fields and set to work, after a generous breakfast of coffee, bread, and mushrooms. The chickens they had killed in their midnight expedition were buried, and those which they had not killed lost no time in beginning to lay eggs for the sustenance of the reformed castaways. As an extra precaution with the [...] "rescued," [...] when they were put to work, each of them with a kind of shirt of mail, worn over his coat, which could easily be electrized by a metallic filament connecting with the communal dynamo, and under these conditions they each did a full day's work during the Obligatories.|$|E

6000|$|Thursday, 7th June 1866.—The other {{evening at}} the Queen’s ball [...] Mrs. Gladstone asked me as from her husband, to come to breakfast [...] this morning, {{at the same time}} that Colonel Holmes,(148) was [...] invited.... I decided to go. I found no cause to regret the [...] decision, for the company was very pleasant. The Duke and Duchess [...] of Argyll, Lord Lyttelton, Lord Houghton, Lord Frederick Cavendish [...] with his wife, and one of his uncles, and several whom I did not [...] know. I forgot Lord Dufferin. We sat at two round tables, thus [...] {{dividing}} the company; but Mr. Gladstone took ours, which made all [...] the difference in the world. His characteristic is the most [...] extraordinary facility of conversation on almost any topic, with a [...] great command of literary resources, which at once gives it a high [...] tone. Lord Houghton, if put to it, is not without aptness in [...] keeping it up; whilst the Duke of Argyll was stimulated out of his [...] customary indifference to take his share. Thus we passed from [...] politics, the House of Commons, and Mr. Mill, to English prose as [...] illustrated from the time of Milton and Bacon down to this day, [...] and contrasted with German, which has little of good, and with [...] French. In the latter connection Mr. Gladstone asked me if I had [...] read the Conscrit of Erckmann-Chatrian. Luckily for me, who have [...] little acquaintance with the <b>light</b> <b>current</b> literature, I could say [...] “Yes,” and could contrast it favourably with the artificial manner [...] of Hugo. It is a cause of wonder to me how a man like Gladstone, [...] so deeply plunged in the current of politics, and in the duties of [...] legislation and official labour, can find time to keep along with [...] the ephemeral literature abroad as well as at home. After an hour [...] thus spent we rose, and on a question proposed by Colonel Holmes [...] respecting a group of figures in china which stood in a corner, [...] Mr. Gladstone launched forth into a disquisition on that topic, [...] which he delights in, and illustrated his idea of the art by [...] showing us several specimens of different kinds. One a grotesque [...] but speaking figure in Capo di Monte, another a group of [...] combatants, two of whom were lying dead with all the aspect of [...] strained muscle stiffening; and lastly, a very classical and [...] elegant set of Wedgwood ware, certainly finer than I ever saw [...] before. This is the pleasantest and most profitable form of [...] English society.|$|E

As colored-diamond expert Stephen Hofer points out, blue diamonds similar to the Hope can be shown by colorimetric measurements to be grayer (lower in saturation) than blue sapphires. In 1996, the Gemological Institute of America's Gem Trade Lab examined the diamond and, using their proprietary scale, graded it fancy deep grayish blue. [...] Visually, the gray modifier (mask) is so dark (indigo) that it produces an [...] "inky" [...] effect appearing almost blackish-blue in incandescent <b>light.</b> <b>Current</b> photographs of the Hope Diamond use high-intensity light sources that tend to maximize the brilliance of gemstones.

50|$|In {{spite of}} his stormy, erratic, and {{possibly}} criminal life, much of his music is in the <b>light</b> <b>current</b> form of the frottola, a predecessor to the madrigal. He was a trombonist, as shown by his name, and sometimes employed in that capacity; however he apparently wrote no strictly instrumental music (or none survives). He also wrote some serious sacred music: seventeen laude, a motet and a setting of the Lamentations of Jeremiah. Stylistically, the sacred works are typical of the more conservative music of the early 16th century, using non-imitative polyphony over a cantus firmus, alternating sectionally with more homophonic textures or with unadorned plainsong. His frottolas, {{by far the largest}} and most historically significant part of his output (176 in all) are more varied than those of the other famous frottolist, Marchetto Cara, and they also tend to be more polyphonic than is typical for most frottolas of the time; in this way they anticipate the madrigal, the first collections of which began to be published near the very end of Tromboncino's life, and in the city where he lived (for example Verdelot's Primo libro di Madrigali of 1533, published in Venice). The major differences between the late frottolas of Tromboncino and the earliest madrigals were not so much musical as {{in the structure of the}} verse they set.|$|E
