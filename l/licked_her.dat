500|$|Björk premiered Biophilias songs {{during the}} Manchester International Festival with a {{residency}} {{commissioned by the}} Festival itself. The singer played in a circular stage which included custom-made instruments like computer-controlled Pendulum Harps and a Tesla Coil, an instrument called Gameleste, an hybrid between a gamelan and a celesta, and a pin Barrel organ called Sharpsichord. The stage also included a circle of projection screens. During the [...] "Mutual Core" [...] performance, the screen projected images of moving tectonic plates, which Alan Pedder of the website Wearsthetrousers likened to [...] "Jóga"'s music video, while the choir performed a sort of choreography, which included huddling at center stage during the verses and dancing during the chorus. The song was performed on every date of her Biophilia Tour. Her performance was well received by critics, which praised the whole show and project, which was called [...] "ambitious". While reviewing Björk's show at the New York Hall of Science, Will Hermes of the website PembrokeMayball stated that [...] "during 'Mutual Core', she sang of tectonic plates under a circle of projection screens illustrating the phenomena, and <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> lips after a line about how 'the Atlantic ridge drifts' like she could feel that motion tingle beneath her skin".|$|E
2500|$|Charlie Brown {{arrives at}} the rehearsal, but {{he is unable to}} control the {{situation}} as the uncooperative Peanuts kids are more interested in modernizing the play with dancing and lively music, mainly Schroeder's rendition of [...] "Linus and Lucy." [...] Lucy, angling to be the Christmas Queen, is also the Script Girl, handing out scripts. She and Snoopy would get into a fight after the latter mocked her. He slurps her and she, as was often the case when Snoopy kissed or <b>licked</b> <b>her,</b> ran off screaming that she had gotten dog germs, demanding hot water, disinfectant and iodine. She would also argue with Linus about his blanket and demands that he give it up. He uses it as a costume, which infuriates Lucy yet again.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{pointed out}} that there were some [...] "slutty" [...] {{gestures}} behind the video in which Hijazi <b>licks</b> up <b>her</b> upper lip while drinking tea, bending down her car and smoking and <b>licking</b> <b>her</b> finger.|$|R
60|$|There, not {{fifty feet}} away, was Lilly, the {{faithful}} mare Allen had fancied was {{drowned in the}} Black Rock River. Rush stood beside <b>her,</b> <b>licking</b> <b>her</b> neck affectionately.|$|R
5000|$|Poster taglines: [...] "His Mother-in-law wasn't born--she was quarried out {{of solid}} granite and could <b>lick</b> <b>her</b> weight in wildcats!""An inside comedy of the in-laws-the in-bads {{and all but}} ingratitude!" ...|$|R
60|$|Jip nestled {{closer to}} his mistress, and lazily <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> hand.|$|E
60|$|Then a dog {{ran up to}} her, and <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> face, {{and jumped}} about her.|$|E
60|$|DOCTOR. Right as rain! She {{held him}} like an angel--he just <b>licked</b> <b>her,</b> and never made a sound.|$|E
60|$|She became {{conscious}} of something touching her hand; it was softness {{and it was}} warmth. She opened her eye's, and the substance touched her face. A dog was <b>licking</b> <b>her</b> cheek.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, General sneaks {{into the}} parents' bedroom (where Amanda was sleeping) and climbs onto Amanda's stomach. He then <b>licks</b> <b>her</b> face. She {{wakes up and}} (excited to see him) cuddles him.|$|R
6000|$|Juanita {{had been}} <b>licking</b> <b>her</b> lips {{and staring at}} Carol. She {{interrupted}} her husband, [...] "Yes, I do think Harry ought to fix it up with him. You LIKE him, DON'T you, Carol??" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Go' lumme!' remarked the shepherdess, smacking her lips, 'that was somethin' like!' And she put out {{her tongue}} and <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> lips, and then breathed deeply.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've {{been very}} unfortunate of lite,' remarked Mrs. Hodges, as she <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> lips, 'this mikes the second death I've 'ad {{in the last}} ten days--women, I mean, of course I don't count bibies.' ...|$|E
60|$|He went East, and {{he found}} All-the-Cow there-was feeding in the field {{that had been made}} ready for her, and she <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> tongue round a whole forest at a time, and {{swallowed}} it and sat down to chew her cud.|$|E
50|$|Fujiya's mascot is Peko-chan, {{a girl in}} {{pigtails}} <b>licking</b> <b>her</b> lips. Peko-chan is {{a well-known}} marketing icon in Japan, where life-sized dolls of the mascot are commonly seen nationwide standing outside the chain's stores.|$|R
60|$|Nor can I paint her to you {{in words}} as I saw her then, with the long tongues of firelight <b>licking</b> <b>her</b> white neck and {{wavering}} over the rich masses of her red-gold hair.|$|R
60|$|But, {{when the}} box was lifted in the morning, Rusty bounded at one gay leap to Anne's {{shoulder}} where he began to <b>lick</b> <b>her</b> face affectionately. Never was there a cat more decidedly alive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Loose the chain," [...] said Miss Oliver, and {{to their}} vast astonishment the dog walked up to her, wagging his disreputable tail, and {{crouching}} down, <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> hands. She patted his great head gently and then turned smilingly to the boys.|$|E
60|$|But Medeia called {{gently to}} him, and he {{stretched}} out his long spotted neck, and <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> hand, and looked up in her face, as if to ask for food. Then she made a sign to Orpheus, and he began his magic song.|$|E
60|$|Miss Nipper, {{sitting down}} upon the floor, at her mistress's feet, {{laughing}} and sobbing, holding her pocket-handkerchief to her eyes with one hand, and patting Diogenes with the other as he <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> face, confessed to being more composed, and laughed and cried a little more in proof of it.|$|E
6000|$|The warning {{came too}} late. Gladys already had Snip in her arms, {{and as the}} little fellow {{struggled}} to <b>lick</b> <b>her</b> cheek in token of his desire to be on friendly terms, she said laughingly: ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} of {{this song is}} also occasionally performed by Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam during their live performances with the final lines, [...] "Liquor she wanted / <b>Lick</b> <b>her</b> I did / I don't work there anymore." ...|$|R
60|$|Saxon was melted. Tears were in {{her eyes}} as she stooped and {{gathered}} the mite of an animal in her arms. Possum was in a frenzy of agitation, whining, trembling, writhing, twisting, <b>licking</b> <b>her</b> face, all for forgiveness.|$|R
60|$|The {{first to}} enter was Aleck, who, {{following}} his custom, sprang upon Angela and <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> hand, and behind Aleck, looking somewhat confused, but handsome and happy--for his {{was one of}} those faces that become handsome when their owners are happy--came Aleck's master. And then there ensued an infinitesimal but most awkward pause.|$|E
60|$|In her {{reclining}} position {{she looked}} up to him just as in earlier times she had, when standing, looked up to a man. The animal, who was as homeless as she, respectfully withdrew {{a step or two}} when the woman moved, and, seeing that she did not repulse him, he <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> hand again.|$|E
60|$|She fell on {{her knees}} before him and washed his wounds one by one, and laid healing herbs upon them. And the lion <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> hands and thanked her, {{and asked if she}} would not stay and sit by him. But the girl said she had her pigs to watch, and she must go and see after them.|$|E
60|$|Toozle screamed with delight. It {{was almost}} too much for him. Again and again he {{attempted}} to <b>lick</b> <b>her</b> face, a familiarity which Alice gently declined to permit, so he was obliged to content himself with her hand.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{original}} script, {{the scene in}} which Angel finds Tina's dead body ends with him cradling <b>her,</b> then <b>licking</b> <b>her</b> blood from his fingers. Although creator Joss Whedon claims that moment {{was the point of}} the episode, as it shows how Angel is struggling in his goal of redemption, it was ultimately cut. [...] "It was dark enough that he didn’t save this girl," [...] says supervising producer Tim Minear. [...] "I don’t think you needed him <b>licking</b> <b>her</b> dead body." [...] A similar scene occurs in flashback in Season Four, where Angelus reveals this caused Angel to revert to the pathetic state he is in when Whistler encounters him eating rats in 1996.|$|R
60|$|Sprigs of sweet-scented marjoram, thyme, and wool-blade tastefully disposed, further {{enhanced}} the attractions of this succulent show. 'Twas {{enough to make}} the sweetest mouth water with anticipatory delight. A brown-eyed, apple-cheeked wench in paniers of brilliant red was unaffectedly <b>licking</b> <b>her</b> pretty lips.|$|R
60|$|I put Tittums in {{my pocket}} and {{returned}} to my desk. I forgot her for the moment, and when I looked I found that she had squirmed {{out of my pocket}} on to the table and was trying to swallow the pen; then she put her leg into the ink-pot and upset it; then she <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> leg; then she swore again--at me this time.|$|E
60|$|You {{can guess}} how frightened she was! But the lion seemed in such pain {{that she was}} sorry for him, and drew nearer and nearer till she saw he had a large thorn in one foot. She pulled out the thorn and bound up the place, and the lion was grateful, and <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> hand by way of thanks with his big rough tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] she said, {{and taking}} one, {{suddenly}} <b>licked</b> <b>her</b> rather full, dry red lips {{with the rapid}} tip of her tongue. It was an odd movement, suggesting a snake's flicker. She put her cigarette between her lips, and waited. Her movements were very quiet and well bred; but perhaps too quiet, they had the dangerous impassivity of the Bohemian, Parisian or American rather than English.|$|E
60|$|Nagaski {{let go of}} my trousers, but {{continued}} to growl. Adèle stooped to pick him up, and he immediately attempted to <b>lick</b> <b>her</b> face. I saw then, to my surprise, that she was very pale, and had all the appearance of having received a shock.|$|R
5000|$|... a girl {{left home}} alone hears noises {{in the night}} but doesn't go downstairs to {{investigate}} because she feels <b>her</b> dog <b>lick</b> <b>her</b> feet under the bed; when she wakes up in the morning, the intruder has left a note saying [...] "humans can lick too".|$|R
60|$|The moment I {{opened the}} door I see there was {{something}} wrong. Three times my missis <b>licked</b> <b>'er</b> lips afore she could speak. Her face 'ad gone a dirty white colour, and she was leaning forward with her 'ands on her 'ips, trembling all over with temper.|$|R
