50|$|Another use of neutron {{emitters}} is {{the detection}} of light nuclei, in particular the hydrogen found in water molecules. When a fast neutron collides with a <b>light</b> <b>nucleus,</b> it loses a large fraction of its energy.

50|$|The semi-empirical {{mass formula}} {{provides}} a good fit to heavier nuclei, and a poor fit to very <b>light</b> <b>nuclei,</b> especially 4He.

50|$|Neutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei, {{causing the}} struck nucleus to recoil. Kinematically, a neutron can {{transfer}} more energy to a <b>light</b> <b>nucleus</b> such as hydrogen or helium {{than to a}} heavier nucleus. Detectors relying on elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors. Recoiling nuclei can ionize and excite further atoms through collisions. Charge and/or scintillation light produced in this way can be collected to produce a detected signal. A major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning such signals from erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same detector.|$|E
50|$|Cluster decay {{exists in}} an {{intermediate}} position between alpha decay ({{in which a}} nucleus spits out a He4 nucleus), and spontaneous fission, in which a heavy nucleus splits into two (or more) large fragments and an assorted number of neutrons. Spontaneous fission ends up with a probabilistic distribution of daughter products, which sets it apart from cluster decay. In cluster decay for a given radioisotope, the emitted particle is a <b>light</b> <b>nucleus</b> and the decay method always emits this same particle. For heavier emitted clusters there is otherwise practically no qualitative difference between cluster decay and spontaneous cold fission.|$|E
5000|$|Calcium-48 is a scarce isotope {{of calcium}} {{containing}} 20 protons and 28 neutrons. It makes up 0.187% of natural calcium by mole fraction. Although it is unusually neutron-rich {{for such a}} <b>light</b> <b>nucleus,</b> the only radioactive decay pathway open to it is the extremely rare process of double beta decay. (Single beta decay would be energetically possible but is even more hindered.) Its half-life is about 6.4×1019 years, so {{for all practical purposes}} it can be treated as stable. One factor contributing to this unusual stability is that 20 and 28 are both magic numbers, making 48Ca a [...] "doubly magic" [...] nucleus.|$|E

5000|$|A {{strangelet}} is {{a hypothetical}} particle {{consisting of a}} bound state of roughly equal numbers of up, down, and strange quarks. An equivalent description is that a strangelet is a small fragment of strange matter, small enough {{to be considered a}} particle. The size of an object composed of strange matter could, theoretically, range from a few femtometers across (with the mass of a <b>light</b> <b>nucleus)</b> to arbitrarily large. Once the size becomes macroscopic (on the order of metres across), such an object is usually called a strange star. The term [...] "strangelet" [...] originates with Edward Farhi and R. L. Jaffe.

5000|$|Litherland and Allan Bromley were, in {{the words}} of J. C. D. [...] "Doug" [...] Milton, [...] "two of the key people working on the van de Graaff accelerators, the 3 MV home-made {{single-ended}} machine, and beginning in 1958, the world's first tandem accelerator, the EN tandem. The unprecedented precision and flexibility of the EN tandem made Chalk River the envy of physicists around the world and opened up the field of heavy-ion physics. Allan Bromley is sometimes called the father of heavy-ion physics. Litherland was honoured first of all for his work on the 3 MV machine through which, and with his insight and courage, the first proof that the collective model could be applied to a <b>light</b> <b>nucleus,</b> in this case 25Al. It led to a great simplification of our understanding of the spectra of such nuclei and directly to the Unified Model. Litherland went on to make critical contributions to nuclear structure research, primarily through the introduction, with John Ferguson, of new gamma-ray angular correlation techniques. In 1966, Litherland was recruited by the University of Toronto, and in 1967, he, along with Harry Gove and Ken Purser, realized the unique value of a tandem accelerator in measuring exquisitely minute quantities of 14C. Thus was born accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS); for his contribution the University of Toronto made him a university professor. Litherland subsequently became the director of Isotrace, a facility that leads the world in the introduction of new AMS techniques." ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{integral}} formula, {{which has}} not been compiled in any integral tables or mathematical softwares, is proposed to obtain the analytical energy-angular spectra of the particles that are sequentially emitted from the discrete energy levels of the residual nuclei in the statistical theory of <b>light</b> <b>nucleus</b> reaction (STLN). In the cases of the neutron induced <b>light</b> <b>nucleus</b> reactions, the demonstration of the kinetic energy conservation in the sequential emission processes becomes straightforward thanks to this new integral formula and it is also helpful to largely reduce the volume of file- 6 in nuclear reaction databases.
