These areas were steep, rocky land, unsuitable for farming. By 1600 at the latest, the open fields had been enlosed and given way to individual farms.

[...] Like numerous cannon before it, it was a cast iron smoothbore loaded from the muzzle. The cannon was relatively cheap to produce – the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom estimated that each cannon cost approximately £167.(2010 : £12645).

Coal from the Silkstone collieries was sporadic, as the tramway which had been authorised by the Act of Parliament was not built due to financial constraints. The Barnby Furnace mine failed in 1806, and the company found itself with no money and little traffic. It obtained a new Act of Parliament on 28 March 1808, authorising it to raise another £43,000 in share capital, and £10,000 by mortgage. They were also able to raise the tolls.|$|E

According to his obituary in The Times Birchenwood did well during the First World War when its chemical products were in demand for explosives, but in the depression that followed, the company began to struggle, but the brothers kept it going to provide employment to the people of Kidsgrove, though it returned no profit to them.|$|E

The KdUINO has been designed as a DIY (Do-It-Yourself) instrument: {{it is very easy}} to build and can be made at home. Its total cost is less than 200 Euros. Due to its low cost, researchers can use a lot of them for the price of one conventional oceanographic instrument. For this reason, the KdUINO is a perfect device to make spatio-temporal studies in costal zones. This instruments increments the marine citizen science community. There is already a small community that makes these instruments and measures data in a coastal area of Catalonia, Spain.
