5000|$|Tyrannosaurus Lex is {{a system}} Winstein {{designed}} to hide messages in documents by altering specific words, published in 1999 while Winstein {{was in high school}} at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. The system was the original work in the field of [...] "linguistic steganography." [...] However, analysis of Winstein's scheme by other researchers found that Tyrannosaurus <b>Lex</b> <b>contains</b> several vulnerabilities, allowing an eavesdropper to potentially decode hidden messages embedded using the system.|$|R

The music video for the song, directed by <b>Lex</b> Halaby, <b>contains</b> a well representation of the lyrics. The video shows the band behind various [...] "peep shows", and showing attractive women watching with pleasure. The song has been played at almost every live show since its release.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Lex</b> Aquilia <b>contained,</b> {{besides a}} penalty for adstipulatores who fraudulently {{released}} the debtor and, perhaps, a vaguely indicated procedure for multa as an alternative, {{in the case}} which does concern us, two important provisions for a civil remedy for damage to property. Its first chapter provided that anyone who unlawfully killed another's slave or beast within the class of pecus, was liable to pay the owner the highest value the thing had had within the previous year. Its third chapter provided that anyone who unlawfully damaged another's property in respects not the coming under the first chapter, by burning, breaking or destroying, was liable to pay him the value the thing had had within 30 days before. The period of time was reckoned back, not from the death, but from the injury. The third chapter did not, like the first, say the highest ("plurimi") value within the 30 days, but the lawyers read this in, {{in order to give}} the provision a meaning. So far as the main text goes a man who merely damaged the property had to pay the whole value, but, apart from the bad economics of such a rule, there is a text which implies that what he had to pay was the difference between the highest value and the value after the damage.|$|R
40|$|Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase f (PTPf/RPTP; 9) is a receptor-like protein tyrosine phos-phatase specifically {{expressed in}} the brain. Alternative splicing produces three isoforms of this molecule: PTP?-A, the full-length form of PTPf; PTP?-B, the short form of PTP?; and PTPf-S, an extracellular variant. Here, we identified all these isoforms, including PTP£-B, as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and characterized their carbohydrate modification and expression profiles in the rat brain. The level of PTPf-A expression was maintained during the prenatal period and decreased rapidly after birth. PTPf-S was expressed in a similar manner, although the postnatal decrease was gradual. In contrast, relatively constant amounts of PTP£-B were observed from embryonic day 13 (E 13) through adulthood. PTPf-A and-S were constantly expressed only as proteoglycans during development, but {{a substantial amount of}} PTPg'-B was detected in a non-proteo-glycan form at E 13 - 15. Moreover, PTPf-B did not <b>contain</b> <b>Lex,</b> HNK- 1 carbohydrate, or keratan sulfate, although PTP£-A and-S were generally modified with these carbohy-drates. L cells transfected with PTPf-A and-B cDNAs expressed these proteins as enzymatically active chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. The PTPf-A and-B in L cell...|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that the {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) O antigen of Helicobacter pylori <b>contains</b> Lewis x (<b>Lex),</b> Lewis y (Ley), or both Lex and Ley antigens. We applied a serotyping method for H. pylori by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for these antigens and the related fucosylated H type 1 (H 1) antigen. The selected MAbs recognized the Lex and/or Ley structures in the LPS of H. pylori. The agreement between the results of biochemical compositional analysis and the serological data validated our serotyping system. A total of 152 strains from different geographic origins (The Netherlands, Canada, Poland, Italy, and People's Republic of China) were examined for typeability based on the presence of Lewis antigens. One hundred twenty-nine (84. 9 %) strains were typeable, and 12 different serotyping patterns were observed; 80. 9 % of the strains <b>contained</b> <b>Lex</b> and/or Le(y) antigens, and 18. 4 % reacted with the MAb against the related H 1 antigen either alone or in combination with the Lex and/or Ley antigen. Our results show that the Lex and Ley antigens are frequently encountered in the LPS of H. pylori strains from various geographic origins. This typing method is an easy-to-perform technique, which can be used for strain differentiation in epidemiological studies of H. pylori infections...|$|R
40|$|The locus lex 2, {{comprising}} lex 2 A and lex 2 B, {{contributes to}} the phase-variable expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Haemophilus influenzae and {{was found to be}} present in 74 % of strains investigated. <b>lex</b> 2 A <b>contains</b> 5 ′-GCAA repeats which vary in number from 4 to 46 copies between strains. The locus was cloned from the serotype b strains RM 7004 and RM 153 and showed > 99 % nucleotide sequence identity between these strains and the published lex 2 sequence. Disruption of the lex 2 B gene in strain RM 7004 resulted in truncation of some LPS glycoforms, shown by gel fractionation, with only one glycoform reacting with a digalactoside-specific monoclonal antibody, 4 C 4, compared with four LPS glycoforms in the more elongated LPS of the parent strain. Mass spectrometry and NMR analyses of LPS from the lex 2 B mutant revealed loss of the terminal digalactoside as well as the second β-glucose extending from the first heptose of the inner core. The authors conclude that Lex 2 B is the β-(1 - 4) -glucosyltransferase that adds the second β-glucose to the first β-glucose as part of the oligosaccharide extension from the first heptose of the LPS of strain RM 7004. Investigation of the expression of the lex 2 locus indicated that the genes are co-transcribed and that both reading frames are required for addition of this second β-glucose in a phase-variable manner...|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} game, the {{alternate}} Aquaman initially refuses to help Batman combat against Brainiac's forces as he doesn't {{want to get}} dragged into another surface world conflict, but Green Lantern does convince Arthur to lend some of his Atlantean forces to help after Atlantis starts to become invaded by Brainiac. Eventually, Atlantis and its people become captured by Brainiac, with Aquaman managing to escape before he is caught with them. He volunteers to assist Black Adam in using the Rock of Eternity to take out Brainiac's defenses, as his trident would act as a suitable conduit to direct the Rock's power. They arrive in Kahndaq and are attacked by Grodd, who fights the two kings alongside the brainwashed Green Arrow, Black Canary, and Blue Beetle. Aquaman kills Grodd to avenge the Atlanteans abducted by Brainiac before he and Black Adam successfully lower Brainiac's defenses. On Brainiac's ship, Arthur is pleased {{to find out that}} Superman managed to restore Atlantis from Brainac's ship. In Batman and Superman's conflict over whether to spare Brainiac, he sides with Superman as he believes leaving Brainiac alive would be too risky and is fine with killing his enemies as it matches Atlantis' old fashioned sense of justice. He is defeated by Batman on the ship, as Batman puts Arthur out of commission by stabbing his leg with the Atlantean Trident. In his single player ending, Superman rises to power once again with Brainaic's death and Batman's defeat. Aquaman couldn't muster a force powerful enough to combat Superman to prevent the High Councilor from taking over Atlantis again. The Atlanteans discover a hidden Insurgency hideout underwater that <b>contained</b> <b>Lex</b> Luthor's interdimensional portal. After his scientists fix the portal, Aquaman uses it to travel to the primary universe from the first game to request their help in stopping Superman once again.|$|R

Iako je riječ o pokretninama, na prijevozna sredstva u pravilu se ne primjenjuje lex situs, već se to pitanje uređuje posebnom kolizijskom normom stvarnog statuta. Koji se pravni problemi pri tome pojavljuju i kako se pojedina prijevozna sredstva kolizijskopravno uređuju, objašnjava autor u ovom radu. This article {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the special conflict of law rule for the means of transport contained in Art. 18 (3) of the Croatian Private International Law Act (Cro-PIL-A) which, within the frame of a real statute, determines applicable law. This provision, created in the 1970 s, needs new and modern de lege lata and de lege ferenda interpretations as well. By providing a teleological interpretation of Art. 18 (3) of the Cro-PIL-A and by analysing modern comparative private international law provisions in German, Austrian, Hungarian, Swiss, Belgian, Spanish, Korean and some other legal systems, the author concludes that “the means of transport” as a legal concept and object of connection of the conflict of law rule should be interpreted more extensively. It should include not only watercraft (vessels) and aircraft, but also railway vehicles. On the other hand, motor vehicles, as is usually the case in the comparative PIL, should be submitted under the general provision of the <b>lex</b> situs rule, <b>contained</b> in Art. 18 (1) Cro-PIL-A. With respect to the modern comparative PIL provision, especially in the German and Spanish legal systems, modern trends in European law (Directive 2004 / 49 EC of 29 April 2004 on the Railway Safety), and modern traffic conventions, i. e. Arts. 3 and 4 ATMF Appendix G to the COTIF Convention of 9 May 1980 in the Version of the Protocol of Modification of 3 June 1999, the author draws the conclusion that “the means of transport” in Article 18 (3) of the Cro-PIL-A, which includes railway vehicles, should be governed by the law of the state of admission or the law of the state of registration...|$|R
