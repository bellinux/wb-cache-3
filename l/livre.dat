5|$|The {{official}} {{introduction of}} the metric system in September 1799 was unpopular in large sections of French society. Napoleon's rule greatly aided adoption of the new standard not only across France but also across the French sphere of influence. Napoleon took a retrograde step in 1812 when he passed legislation to introduce the mesures usuelles (traditional units of measurement) for retail trade—a system of measure that resembled the pre-revolutionary units but {{were based on the}} kilogram and the metre; for example the <b>livre</b> metrique (metric pound) was 500g instead of 489.5 g—the value of the <b>livre</b> du roi (the king's pound). Other units of measure were rounded in a similar manner prior to the definitive {{introduction of the}} metric system across parts of Europe {{in the middle of the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's <b>Livre</b> des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E
5|$|Louis Philippe I {{by means}} of the La loi du 4 juillet 1837 (the law of 4 July 1837) {{effectively}} revoked the use of mesures uselles by reaffirming the laws of measurement of 1795 and 1799 to be used from 1 May 1840. However, many units of measure, such as the <b>livre</b> (for half a kilogram), remained in colloquial use for many years, and to a residual extent up to this day.|$|E
50|$|Louis XIII of France stopped minting the franc in 1641, {{replacing}} it with coins based on the silver écu and gold Louis d'or. The écu and louis d'or fluctuated in value, with the écu varying between three and six <b>livres</b> tournois until 1726 when it was fixed at six <b>livres.</b> The louis was initially (1640) worth ten <b>livres,</b> and fluctuated too, until its value was fixed at twenty-four <b>livres</b> in 1726.|$|R
5000|$|The plural form des is {{normally}} reduced to de (or d&#39; if before a vowel) when {{it applies to}} a noun preceded by an adjective: « de nombreux <b>livres</b> » (many books), « d&#39;autres <b>livres</b> » (other books), but « des <b>livres</b> reliés » (bound books).|$|R
50|$|The drop {{in value}} in the money was {{accompanied}} by extraordinary inflation. The Louis d'or (gold coin), which was worth 2000 <b>livres</b> in paper money {{at the beginning of}} the Directory, increased to 3000 and then 5000 <b>livres.</b> The price of a liter of wine increased from 50 sous in October 1795 to ten francs and then thirty francs. A measure of flour worth two <b>livres</b> in 1790 was worth 225 <b>livres</b> in October 1794.|$|R
5|$|The first French Spaniel is speculated to have {{appeared}} following the Crusades of the 11th century, {{and it was}} these breeds of dogs that were described in Gaston III of Foix-Béarn's 14th-century work <b>Livre</b> de Chasse. Following the French Revolution the commoners in France were allowed to raise and keep their own hunting dogs. This in turn meant that the pre-existing French Spaniel split into several types specific to their own regions, which were classified according to physical appearance and hunting abilities.|$|E
5|$|The purest form of Limousins have {{ancestors}} {{that can}} all be traced to Full French entries in the French Limousin Herd Book (known in France as Le <b>livre</b> généalogique). These Limousins are known by different names. In the USA and Canada they are known as Fullbloods, in Australia and New Zealand as French Pure, and in European countries such as Britain as Pure Bred (also purebred) or simply Limousin.|$|E
5|$|Areas annexed by France {{during the}} Napoleonic era {{were the first}} to inherit the metric system. In 1812, Napoleon {{introduced}} a system known as mesures usuelles, which used the names of pre-metric units of measure, but defined them in terms of metric units – for example, the <b>livre</b> metrique (metric pound) was 500g and the toise metrique (metric fathom) was 2metres. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary units of measure, others such as Baden adopted {{a modified version of the}} mesures usuelles, but France kept her system of measurement intact.|$|E

5000|$|To further {{encourage}} {{the growth of}} the colony, Talon established various policies to promote marriage and bearing of children. To young women who married, the intendant gave 50 <b>livres</b> in household supplies and some provisions. According to the king’s decree, each youth who married at or before the age of twenty was entitled to 20 <b>livres,</b> called [...] "the king’s gift." [...] During the years 1665-68, 6000 <b>livres</b> were used to support the marriage of young gentlewomen without means, and another 6000 <b>livres</b> for settlement and marriage of four captains, three lieutenants, five ensigns and a few minor officers. Furthermore, family having ten children in their household were entitled to a pension of three hundred <b>livres</b> annually and four hundred <b>livres</b> were given to family with twelve children.|$|R
25|$|Bourgeois was {{ultimately}} awarded in 1608 {{a lump sum}} of 6,000 <b>livres</b> for her services as royal midwife. After the birth of Henrietta Maria, the last child, Bourgeois asked for a pension of 600 <b>livres</b> per year. King Henry IV agreed to 300 <b>livres,</b> which was considered a reasonable retirement income.|$|R
5|$|Escoffier also {{simplified}} {{and organized}} the modern menu {{and structure of}} the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his <b>Livre</b> des menus in 1912. This type of service embraced the service à la russe (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.|$|E
5|$|We {{know more}} about Lancaster's {{character}} than of most of his contemporaries through his memoirs, the <b>Livre</b> de seyntz medicines (Book of the Holy Doctors). This book is a highly personal treatise on matters of religion and piety, but it also contains details of historical interest. It, among other things, revealed that Lancaster, {{at the age of}} 44 when he wrote the book in 1354, suffered from gout. The book is primarily a devotional work though; it is organised around seven wounds which Henry claims to have, representing the seven sins. Lancaster confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, 4th Earl of Leicester and Lancaster, KG (c. 1310 – 23 March 1361), also Earl of Derby, was {{a member}} of the English nobility in the 14th century, and a {{prominent}} English diplomat, politician, and soldier. The son and heir of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, and Maud Chaworth, he became one of Edward III's most trusted captains in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War and distinguished himself with victory in the Battle of Auberoche. He was a founding member and the second Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348, and in 1351 was created duke. An intelligent and reflective man, Grosmont taught himself to write and was the author of the book <b>Livre</b> de seyntz medicines, a highly personal devotional treatise. He is remembered as one of the founders and early patrons of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, which was established by two of the guilds of the town in 1352.|$|E

5|$|The More Library is {{the main}} library for {{students}} whilst the 'House Libraries' (the Arundell, the Bay, and the Square) contain many artefacts from the Society of Jesus and English Catholicism. The Arundell Library, presented in 1837 by Everard, 11th Baron Arundell of Wardour, is the most significant; {{it is not only}} a country-house library from Wardour Castle but also has a notable collection of 250 incunabula, medieval manuscripts and volumes of Jacobite interest, signal among which is Mary Tudor's Book of Hours, which it is believed was given by Mary, Queen of Scots to her chaplain on the scaffold. The manuscript Le <b>Livre</b> de Seyntz Medicines was written in 1354 by Henry, Duke of Lancaster. To these were added the archives of the English Province of the Society of Jesus, which include 16th-century manuscript verses by St Robert Southwell SJ, the letters of St Edmund Campion SJ (1540–81) and holographs of the 19th-century poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. The Arundell Library has a copy of the Chronicles of Jean Froissart, captured at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and held the 7th-century Stonyhurst Gospel of St John before it was loaned to the British Library, as well as a First Folio of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The Tahiti rail has {{historically}} been confused with the extant Tongan subspecies of the buff-banded rail, Gallirallus philippensis ecaudatus, which was also illustrated and described by the Forsters. In his 1783 description of the Tongan bird (wherein it was named Rallus eucaudata), the English ornithologist John Frederick Miller erroneously gave its locality as Tahiti, which led the Tahiti rail {{to be regarded as}} a junior synonym of the extant bird. He based his description on Forster's illustration (plate no.127) of the Tongan bird, and Latham and Gmelin later repeated Miller's erroneous locality. The 1844 publication of Forster's description listed the Tongan bird as a variety of the Tahitian species, and similar schemes were suggested by later writers until 1953, when the New Zealand biologist Averil Margaret Lysaght pointed out Miller's locality mistake, which had been overlooked until that point, and kept the two birds separate. In spite of the clarification, the Tongan bird was placed on a list of extinct birds in the 1981 book Endangered Birds of the World, and Forster's plate of the Tahiti rail was used to illustrate the Samoan wood rail (Gallinula pacifica), a completely different species, in the 1989 book Le Grand <b>Livre</b> des Espécies Disparues.|$|E
5|$|The {{numerous}} honours and endowments that General Nansouty received {{following the}} Battle of Friedland {{seem to suggest}} the Emperor's appreciation {{and the fact that}} Napoleon did not regard the early incident during this battle as Nansouty's fault. On 11 July 1807, General of Division Nansouty was named Grand Aigle de la Légion d'Honneur, the fifth and top rank of this order, reserved for the greatest general officers. This also brought an annual revenue of 20,000 Francs. His first endowment of 12,846 Francs was offered on 30 June 1807, and was paid by the Duchy of Warsaw. On 23 September, he received another 5,882 Francs on the Empire's Grand <b>Livre.</b> A count of the Empire from 10 March 1808, Nansouty was offered two additional endowments, one of 25,000 Francs, paid by the Kingdom of Westphalia, and the second of 10,000 Francs, paid by the Zeven domain in Hannover. He also received an endowment of 100,000 Francs for the acquisition of a Parisian Hôtel particulier; Nansouty bought the Hôtel du Président Duret in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a neighbourhood inhabited by the new elite of Imperial France. Indeed, first-rate military figures such as the Viceroy of Italy Eugène, Marshals Davout and Lannes and Generals Rapp and Legrand also acquired residences in Faubourg Saint-Germain.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{while the}} initial budget was six million <b>livres,</b> {{all the work}} {{together}} would cost between 17 and 18 million <b>livres</b> of the time, 40% was advanced by the King, 40% by the province, and 20% by Riquet himself, who became the owner.

50|$|From the 16th century, {{the holder}} of the {{position}} received an annual salary of 1200 <b>livres,</b> which was a relatively small sum within the royal household.

5|$|In {{the seventh}} century, Isidore of Seville argued in his Etymologiae that {{astronomy}} described {{the movements of}} the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing {{the movements of the}} sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous. In contrast, John Gower in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions. The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people. The fourteenth century sceptic Nicole Oresme however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his <b>Livre</b> de divinacions. Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry. However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of human action by the stars on grounds of free will. The friar Laurens Pignon (c. 1368–1449) similarly rejected all forms of divination and determinism, including by the stars, in his 1411 Contre les Devineurs. This was in opposition to the tradition carried by the Arab astronomer Albumasar (787-886) whose Introductorium in Astronomiam and De Magnis Coniunctionibus argued the view that both individual actions and larger scale history are determined by the stars.|$|E
5|$|The Second Symphony, and <b>Livre</b> pour orchestre and the Cello Concerto which followed, were {{composed}} during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His {{mother died in}} 1967, and in 1967–70 {{there was a great}} deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production Dziady, which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the Cello Concerto of 1968–70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the Cello Concerto was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's première with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.|$|E
