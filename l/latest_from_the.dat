2500|$|Westervelt {{learned the}} [...] "art, trade and mystery" [...] of his {{profession}} in a most independent way—as a teenage sailor and as an apprentice to Christian Bergh, for whom {{he worked at the}} very <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> year 1817. Such was his talent that he was in Bergh's absolute confidence. Before even graduating from his apprenticeship, Westervelt accepted an offer to start business in Charleston, where he undertook the construction of two schooners, with the help of African American slaves from planters in and around Charleston (with his employer's consent). He was so successful during those few months that he continued in business there, but he found the environment too confining for his ambitions and in 1822 he returned to New York, where he formed a partnership with Robert Carnley and his old master under the name of C. Bergh & Co. Some of the ships built by Bergh and Westervelt were Hope (1825), Henry IV (1826), Charlemagne (1828), Albany (1831), Philadelphia (1832), Utica (1833), Westminster (1835), and Toronto (1835). Christian Bergh retired a wealthy man in 1837, and was succeeded by his sons Henry and Edwin Bergh, who continued the business until just after their father's death in 1843.|$|E
2500|$|When Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, who worshiped {{and taught}} Islamic studies at Dar Al-Hijrah, {{for which he}} also was a camp counselor, was charged by U.S. {{prosecutors}} with plotting with members of al-Qaeda to assassinate President George W. Bush, Abdul-Malik said in February 2005: [...] "Our whole community is under siege. They don't see this as a case of criminality. They see it as a civil rights case. As a frontal attack on their community." [...] He added: [...] "The feeling I get here on a daily basis must be {{what it was like to}} be a member of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church following the case of Rosa Parks. People always ask, 'What is the <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> courthouse?'" [...] Abdul-Malik accused the government of singling out Abu Ali to stir anti-Muslim sentiment. Abu Ali was convicted in 2005 of providing material support to the al-Qaeda terrorist network, and conspiracy to assassinate President Bush, and is serving a life sentence. [...] When in April 2005 Ali al-Timimi of Fairfax, Virginia, an American-born Muslim cleric, was convicted of inciting followers to wage war against the US just days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and of recruiting for the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the paintball terrorist cell, Abdul-Malik said: [...] "There is a view many Muslims have when they come to America that you could not be arrested for something you say. But now they have discovered they are not free to speak their minds. And if our opinions are out of vogue in the current climate, we feel we are all at risk." [...] Al-Timimi was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E

6000|$|Early in the forenoon {{parties of}} jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the {{citizens}} continued searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked {{that had never been}} visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names [...] "BECKY & TOM" [...] had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle--and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's light.|$|E
6000|$|... "The man's {{death is}} a mere incident--a trivial episode--in {{comparison}} with our real task, which is to trace this document and save a European catastrophe. Only one important thing {{has happened in the}} last three days, and that is that nothing has happened. I get reports almost hourly from the government, and it is certain that nowhere in Europe is there any sign of trouble. Now, if this letter were loose--no, it CAN'T be loose--but if it isn't loose, where can it be? Who has it? Why is it held back? That's the question that beats in my brain like a hammer. Was it, indeed, a coincidence that Lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared? Did the letter ever reach him? If so, why is it not among his papers? Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her? If so, is it in her house in Paris? How could I search for it without the French police having their suspicions aroused? It is a case, my dear Watson, where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals are. Every man's hand is against us, and yet the interests at stake are colossal. Should I bring it to a successful conclusion, it will certainly represent the crowning glory of my career. Ah, here is my <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front!" [...] He glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in. [...] "Halloa! Lestrade seems to have observed something of interest. Put on your hat, Watson, and we will stroll down together to Westminster." ...|$|E
