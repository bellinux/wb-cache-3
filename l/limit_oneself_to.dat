5000|$|Theoretical {{sampling}} is {{a process}} of data collection for generating theory whereby the analyst jointly collects codes and analyses data and decides what data to collect next and where to find them, in order to develop a theory as it emerges.

The initial decisions are not based on a preconceived theoretical framework. The researcher begins by identifying some key concepts and features which he/she will research about.

(Kolodny 2158) These three general theoretical principles are then supported by the concept of pluralism. Pluralism in this context refers to a conscious effort not to <b>limit</b> <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> a single critical approach when reading a text. Rather, the object of pluralism is {{to make use of}} multiple critical approaches and to get a fuller appreciation of the variety of meanings which can be present in a single text. Kolodny specifically refers to a feminist pluralism, which validates “multiple interpretations of various texts” (Leitch 2145) according to the usefulness of a pluralistic view of a text. This method of reading would give equality to different approaches as well as allow critical examinations of those same approaches, which in turn helps create the “broad critical awareness” (2145) advocated by Kolodny’s third principle as outlined above. The essay emphasizes the real situation of contemporary women. Kolodny believes that feminism and women’s studies should not be confined to books or classrooms. “Ideas are important because they determine the ways we live, or want to live, in the world” (Kolodny 2164); ideas are therefore not meant to exist in a vacuum. Rather, they must be taken into the world through activism.|$|E
5000|$|Within the {{continuous}} versus categorical nature of appraisal and emotion, {{there are many}} standpoints {{of the flow of}} this appraisal process. To begin, Roseman's (1996) model shows that appraisal information [...] "can vary continuously but categorical boundaries determine which emotion will occur". Motive consistency and inconsistency make up an example of this categorical framework. A positive or negative emotional response in conjunction with the affect {{has much to do with}} the appraisal and the amount of motivational consistency. To accurately understand this concept, an example of Roseman's model could come from a motive-consistent goal as it is caused by the self and someone else to reach one's objective in which a positive emotion is created from the specific appraisal event. In addition, Scherer's (1984) model shows that most appraisal falls in a continuous spectrum in which points along the way represent distinct emotional points made possible from the appraisal. Between appraisal space and number of emotions experienced, these two components are both positively correlated. [...] "According to Scherer (1984a), the major categorical labels we used to describe our emotional experiences reflect a somewhat crude attempt to highlight and describe the major or most important ways these emotional experiences vary". With so much variation and levels within one's emotions, it can be seen as injustice to the emotional experience and the appraisal process to <b>limit</b> <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> such categories. To solve the problem between categorical and continuous appraisal order, it may be a good idea to place discrete emotional categories (i.e. happiness, sadness, etc.) while continuous models represent the varieties, styles, and levels of these already defined distinct emotions.|$|E

Regarding consumption, trade allows countries to consumer more of (a larger number of) goods than it would have under autarky. In this paper we start off by looking into these very basic propositions with an emphasis on Australia's structural change in manufacturing production 1970 - 79 compared with other industrialized countries. As a result of this investigation we extended the analysis to the demand side and the ASEAN countries. Thus in sections III: 3 and IV: 1 the link between home demand and domestic manufacturing production is analysed and compared between different developed and ASEAN countries. ASEAN coutnries' situation vis-a-vis Australia is focussed upon specifically in section IV not least with regard to textile, clothing and footwear. the paper ends with a summary in section V. When investigating the validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model's predictions for trade pattern, one <b>limits</b> <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> commodities where labour and capital are principal factors of production.

The paper examines {{the ways in which}} Schulz’s lexical multilinguality is treated by his translators. Schulz’s Latinate words usually lose their original foreignizing and “outlandish” character in translation into foreign languages {{due to the nature of}} target language systems. The paper draws on examples from a number of languages to demonstrate this process, yet rather than despairing over the loss of the author’s important signature, it argues that more often than not the treatment of Latinate loanwords results from the translator’s conscious choices and their dialogue with previous translations of Schulz into their languages. Factors such as the time of publication of a given translated text and its place in the reception of Schulz’s literary output are taken into consideration, and translators’ statements on their work are quoted in order to contextualize the changes which they introduce to Schulz’s texts.
