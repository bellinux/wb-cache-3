This is {{an analysis}} of the stress distribution in the side members of commercial vehicle chassis frames under the effects of the previously little studied <b>longitudinal</b> <b>loads</b> which may act on a truck chassis through spring hanger brackets. The structure analysed is a model chassis frame consisting of channel section side members and four cross members with different joint connections. The developed theories are incorporated into a special purpose finite element program which may be used in the preliminary stages of chassis frame design. Although the program is only used for the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>load</b> case in this thesis, it is generally applicable for other chassis load cases, including torsion, bending,. [...] etc and combination of these. The theoretical results obtained from the program and the finite element analysis on complete chassis frame models are validated against experiments performed on a strain-gauged chassis frame model constructed with the same dimensions and constructional details as the finite element models with the appropriate loading and boundary conditions. Suggestions for the optimum design and attachment positions for components such as spring hanger bracket which may apply <b>longitudinal</b> <b>loads</b> to the side members of the chassis frame are discussed {{from the point of view}} of longitudinal loadings...|$|R

40|$|For {{existing}} bridges {{with large}} uncertainties, analytical methods have limitations. Therefore, to reduce these uncertainties, field testing of a bridge can be used. A type {{of such a}} field test is a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> in which a load equivalent to the factored live load is applied. If the bridge can carry this load without signs of distress, the proof <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is successful, {{and it has been}} shown experimentally that the bridge fulfils the code requirements. It should be understood that this method for assessment is different from the diagnostic <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> that are carried out in Ecuador prior to opening a bridge. The loads used for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are significantly larger. Therefore, it is important to instrument the bridge for a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> and to evaluate during the <b>test</b> that the <b>load</b> does not result in permanent damage to the bridge. To research this topic, and to develop recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests,</b> a series of proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> and a collapse test were carried out in the Netherlands. Additional laboratory testing was carried out as well. Based on this information, recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> of reinforced concrete slab bridges have been developed for the failure modes of flexure and shear. In the German and North American guidelines for <b>load</b> <b>testing,</b> <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> for shear is not permitted. However, many existing bridges do not fulfil the requirements for shear upon assessment according to the current live load models. Even though more experimental research is needed to develop proof <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> for shear in a guideline or code for the Netherlands, the currently available research results already lead to interesting conclusions with regard to the behaviour of bridges proof <b>load</b> <b>tested</b> in shear, and the required safety margin to avoid damage to the bridge.

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{believed}} that the static <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is the most reliable method to obtain the load-settlement relation of a pile. Most static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted using reaction piles as the reaction system. However, some researches {{point out that the}} influence of the reaction piles on the measured load-settlement relation may not be neglected, and that an analysis of the measured data is required to obtain a true load-settlement of the. From this point of view, the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> or the rapid <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> may not be necessarily inferior to the static <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> considering cost and time performance of the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>test</b> as well. In this study, a new computer program for analysing the stress-wave propagation phenomena in pile driving was developed using a finite difference scheme and rational soil resistance models. Verification analyses of the proposed method are conducted first, and then the developed method is applied to the dynamic and static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> on an end-bearing concrete pile...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that results of many {{instrumented}} pile <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been reported in}} the literature, it is difficult to find well-documented instrumentation procedures that can be used when planning a <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> programme.

Although the literature contains information on <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> of instrumented piles driven in either sand or clay, limited information is available regarding their axial load response in transitional soils (soils composed of various amounts of clay, silt and sand). Results are presented for fully instrumented axial <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> performed on an H pile and a closed-ended pipe pile driven into a multilayered soil profile consisting of transitional soils.

The bridge was then re-opened for full traffic shortly after the <b>load</b> <b>test.</b> It was further repaired in 2009 which included concrete patching and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) warping of 6 girders in the main span. The bridge is located {{at one of the}} busiest highways of the country with many heavy trucks passing daily. Also, reinforced concrete could deteriorate much faster than usual after the fire accident. In 2014, the Bridge Office was requested to re-test the bridge in order to re-confirm its performance.

40|$|Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) systems face {{continuously}} evolving field workloads {{in terms}} of activated/disabled feature sets, varying usage patterns and changing deployment configura-tions. These evolving workloads often have a large impact {{on the performance of}} a ULS system. Hence, continuous <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> is critical to ensuring the error-free operation of such systems. A common challenge facing performance analysts is to validate if a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> closely resembles the current field workloads. Such validation may be performed by comparing execution logs from the <b>load</b> <b>test</b> and the field. However, the size and unstructured nature of execution logs makes such a comparison unfeasible without automated support. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to validate whether a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> resembles the field workload and, if not, determines how they differ by compare execution logs from a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> and the field.
