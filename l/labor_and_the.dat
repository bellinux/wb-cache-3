5|$|<b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Coalition each won 72 {{seats in}} the 150-seat House of Representatives, four short of the {{requirement}} for majority government, resulting in the first hung parliament since the 1940 election. Labor suffered an 11-seat swing, even though it won a bare majority of the two-party vote. Both major party leaders sought to form a minority government.|$|E
5|$|The Marietta-class {{monitors}} were {{a pair of}} ironclad river monitors {{laid down}} {{in the summer of}} 1862 for the United States Navy during the American Civil War. Construction was slow, partially for lack of <b>labor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ships were not completed until December 1865, after the war was over. However the navy did not accept them until 1866 and immediately laid them up. They were sold in 1873 without ever having been commissioned.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting the delegates was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all of the delegates from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on slave <b>labor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan also faced {{difficulties}} {{on policy}} issues. Factional cracks {{began to appear}} in <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in a bind. The uranium was seen as a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on safety grounds was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but he was seen as lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named It's Grossly Improper would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.|$|E
5|$|Images {{of musical}} {{instruments}} begin {{to appear in}} Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to division of <b>labor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia. Scholars must rely on artifacts and cuneiform texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct {{the early history of}} musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier II was a proposed conversion {{project for the}} incomplete French cruiser De Grasse. The ship was laid down in November 1938 and lay incomplete in the Arsenal de Lorient shipyard when Germany invaded France in May 1940. In 1942, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine decided to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary {{aircraft carrier}} with a capacity for twenty-three fighters and dive bombers. Work ceased in February 1943, however, due to concerns with the ship's design, a severe shortage of material and <b>labor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> threat of Allied bombing raids. The ship was eventually completed as an anti-aircraft cruiser in 1956 by the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|The area's history {{begins with}} several {{indigenous}} groups, including the Powhatan. In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia {{as the first}} permanent New World English colony. Slave <b>labor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each {{played a significant role}} in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution and joined the Confederacy in the American Civil War, during which Richmond was made the Confederate capital and Virginia's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of West Virginia. Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction, both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the medal is modeled after one used for the Hero of the Soviet Union. Unlike the Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hero of the Russian Federation titles, there is no {{engraving}} on the reverse of the star. The ribbon also copies the Soviet Hero medal's ribbon, since a flag design was also {{used to make the}} ribbon of that medal. The medal is always worn in full {{on the left side of}} the breast above all other medals and orders. Chapter 4, Article 69 of Law N 288-З states that any awards and titles presented by the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR must be placed after awards from the Republic of Belarus.|$|E

5|$|The Chief Minister {{is elected}} by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers {{alongside}} him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet. Whereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor, the Liberals {{have been able to}} gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly, and were in government for just over eight of the Assembly's 25-year history, mostly during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001, when Labor won power. At the 2004 election the Australian Labor Party, headed by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, won nine of the 17 seats and formed the ACT's first majority government, but after the 2008 election was forced into minority government {{with the support of the}} Greens. Since the 2012 elections, the ACT has been governed by a coalition of <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Greens.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} malapportionment {{had grown to}} a level in excess of 3:1 in favour of rural areas, and Hall, having won the 1968 state {{election}} on 46 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote, committed himself to a fairer electoral system. Previously 39 members were elected: 13 from metropolitan Adelaide and 26 from the country. Hall's first attempt for reform was a system with 45 seats and 20 from the country; this proposal received scorn from both <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rural councillors, and was seen as not going far enough by the former and going too far by the latter. A second proposal, for 47 seats with 19 in the country, was adopted with bipartisan support in the House of Assembly, but encountered opposition in the Legislative Council. The new system would make an LCL win near-impossible at the coming 1970 state election, and Hall and the LCL were aware of it. For his weakening of rural constituencies, Hall became an enemy to those councillors who stood in defence of the previous system. Hall saw the political situation as untenable and felt the LCL needed reform {{to cope with the}} removal of an artificial situation.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} give the LM {{national}} exposure, Hall decided to stand for the Australian Senate at the 1974 federal election. Another objective was to allow Millhouse and Cameron to become more prominent at state level and dispel the established perception of the LM as a Hall party. The move was a risk as failure would have left the LM's main drawcard {{out of the spotlight}} entirely until a state election which was not due for another two years, but Hall said the party had no future unless it could gain national stature. Another possible problem was that the media could have lost interest in the LM at a state level regardless of whether Hall won a senate position. The 1975 federal election followed a double dissolution (meaning that all Senate seats, rather than half, were up for election and thus a candidate needed only roughly half of the normal percentage to gain election; Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was hoping to attain a majority in the Senate), and all ten South Australian Senate seats were contested. The battle between the LCL and the LM was not seen as {{a large part of the}} national campaign, as South Australia was only a small part of the nation and most of the marginal seats that would determine the outcome were in other states. The LM gained 9.9 per cent of the vote in the Senate and Hall was elected in his own right, without the assistance of preferences. In the House of Representatives, the LM gained 8.4 per cent of the vote across the 12 South Australian seats, ranging from a high of 18 per cent in metropolitan Boothby to 1.6 per cent in rural Angas. Fortunately for Hall and the LM, the senate election resulted in <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Liberal-Country Party coalition holding 29 seats each, and Hall was one of two crossbenchers who held the balance of power. The media made much of Hall's position as a powerbroker at federal level, and the Liberals responded to him in a hostile manner; for his part, Hall continued to persistently attack them as outmoded and lambasted them over the matter of electoral reform.|$|E
