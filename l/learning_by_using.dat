GNMT did not create its own universal interlingua but rather aimed at commonality found in between many languages, considered to be of more interest to psychologists and linguists than to computer scientists. The new translation engine was first enabled for eight languages: to and from English and French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish in 2016. In March 2017, three additional languages were enabled: Russian, Hindi and Vietnamese along with Thai for which support was added later.

The most obvious is for product innovation, in which the two earliest examples are Intel’s 21st Century Robot (an open innovation project to develop a domestic robot) and Essex University’s eDesk (a mixed-reality immersive education desk) both of which were introduced in the previous section. Beyond product innovation, Science Fiction Prototyping is also offering significant benefits to education. For example, in Canterbury Christ Church University (UK) Business School it is being used as a vehicle to introduce creative thinking in support of entrepreneurship courses. In San-Diego State University (USA) Department of Learning Design and Technology they have explored it as a means for motivating pre-university students to take up STEM studies and careers. At the University of Washington (USA), they have used it to facilitate broader contextual and societal thinking about computers, computer security risks, and security defense as part of an optional senior-level course in computer security. In the National Taiwan University (Taiwan), it is used to increase business school students' interests in science and technology for business innovation. The Business Schools of the universities of Leeds and Manchester (UK) are exploring its use in community development projects. Finally, it’s being applied to meet a significant educational need in China, where it’s mandatory for all science and engineering students to take a course in English language. In Shijiazhuang University (China) they are exploring the potential for Science Fiction Prototyping to overcome the dullness that some science students experience in language <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>using</b> it as an integrated platform for teaching Computer English, combining language and science learning.|$|E
