This extends the traditional concept of a lever representation of a planetary gear set to one that includes negative <b>lever</b> <b>ratios.</b> The resulting framework allows an exhaustive permutation of the nodes of a lever, thereby leading to all possible topological arrangements of a planetary gear train. Consequently, we achieve compact representations of large families of planetary gear trains, which would otherwise {{have to be dealt}} with on a case-by-case basis...|$|R
40|$|In many {{vertebrate}} radiations, food partitioning among {{closely related}} taxa {{is a key}} factor in both the maintenance of species diversity and the process of diversification. We compared diet composition and jaw morphology of 18 New Zealand triplefin species (F. Tripterygiidae) to examine whether species have diversified along a trophic axis. These fishes predominantly utilised small, mobile benthic invertebrates, and interspecific differences in diet composition appeared to be mainly attributable to habitat- or size-dependent feeding behaviour. Although there were differences in the relative size of the bones comprising the oral jaw apparatus between species, the majority showed an apparatus consistent with a relatively high velocity, low force jaw movement indicative of a diet of evasive prey. Phylogenetic comparative analyses showed that the evolution of jaw <b>lever</b> <b>ratios</b> and diet breadth was best explained by a non-directional model in which character changes have occurred randomly and independent of phylogeny. The mode of diet breadth evolution was gradual and the tempo has not accelerated or slowed down over time. The mode of evolution for the jaw <b>lever</b> <b>ratios</b> has been gradual for the opening but punctuated for the closing levers, suggesting that evolutionary changes have occurred rapidly for the latter trait. The tempo of trait evolution for the jaw opening levers has not accelerated or slowed down over time, while the tempo for the jaw closing levers has accelerated towards the tips of the tree, which is suggestive of species level adaptation. The lack of phylogenetic signal in diet breadth and jaw <b>lever</b> <b>ratios</b> appears most likely to be a correlated response to the marked habitat diversification in this group, and is thus the passive outcome of prey availability in species-specific habitat types. Overall, the trophic ecology of New Zealand's triplefin fauna parallels the generalist strategy typical of the family worldwide, suggesting that trophic resource partitioning has not been an important factor in the evolution of these fishes...|$|R

For the first time, a lever machine was successfully compared against deadweight machines (from PTB) at {{the high level of}} 2 MN in both tension and compression with an uncertainty in the 1 E- 4 range. Similarly, the same applies to the 55 kN machine with an uncertainty of ± 2 E- 5. For the 55 kN machine, both short-term and long-term uncertainty has been established. The machine had been the subject of an earlier comparison measurement with the PTB in the compression range. In addition, the periodic maintenance results of this 55 kN / 2. 2 MN lever deadweight force standard machine will also be discussed. To monitor the drift and stability of the force realised, a total of 5 SPRING FTS were measured according to fixed protocols over time. The lever amplification ratio was also checked at intervals using a 50 kN FTS. From an earlier maintenance check, it was discovered that there was a significant drift in the <b>lever</b> <b>ratio</b> in March 2003 (12 months after commissioning). However, the deadweight forces continued to be realised within the ± 2 E- 5 uncertainty. The <b>lever</b> <b>ratio</b> has since been adjusted back to producing loads which are magnified exactly 40 times from deadweight forces, demonstrating that it is capable of achieving ± 1 E- 4 short term uncertainty. This was confirmed by the comparison with PTB up to 2 MN in both loading directions. Subsequent measurements demonstrated that the <b>lever</b> <b>ratio</b> has been stable. The same is also true for load reproducibility and repeatability at both the deadweight and lever machine, indicating that the long-term uncertainty is now satisfactory as well. 1...|$|E

50|$|The {{middle ear}} plays {{a crucial role}} in the {{auditory}} process, as it essentially converts pressure variations in air to perturbations in the fluids of the inner ear. In other words, it is the mechanical transfer function that allows for efficient transfer of collected sound energy between two different media. The three small bones that are responsible for this complex process are the malleus, the incus, and the stapes, collectively known as the ear ossicles. The impedance matching is done through via <b>lever</b> <b>ratios</b> and the ratio of areas of the tympanic membrane and the footplate of the stapes, creating a transformer-like mechanism. Furthermore, the ossicles are arranged in such a manner as to resonate at 700-800 Hz while at the same time protecting the inner ear from excessive energy. A certain degree of top-down control is present at the middle ear level primarily through two muscles present in this anatomical region: the tensor tympani and the stapedius. These two muscles can restrain the ossicles so as to reduce the amount of energy that is transmitted into the inner ear in loud surroundings.|$|R

Aim of the analysis is the development of a validated model capable of predicting system behaviour with adequate accuracy in different operating conditions. Following a kinematic analysis to evidence the characteristics of the mechanical system, such as the automatic forks levelling, forks <b>lever</b> <b>ratio</b> and overrunning load conditions, the detailed hydraulics modelling is discussed with emphasis on overcentre valves.

40|$|African cichlid fishes have {{repeatedly}} evolved highly specialized modes of feeding through adaptations of their oral jaws. Here, we explore the molecular genetic {{basis of the}} opening and closing lever mechanisms of the cichlid lower jaw, which have traditionally been {{used to describe the}} mechanics of feeding behavior in bony fishes. Quantitative genetic analyses demonstrate that the opening and closing mechanisms are genetically modular and therefore free to evolve independently. Bmp 4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4) is one of two loci that segregate with the mechanical advantage of closing and that together account for > 30 % of the phenotypic variance in this trait. Species-specific differences in jaw shape are obvious early in cichlid larval development and are correlated with patterns of bmp 4 expression in the mandibular primordium. When bmp 4 is overexpressed in the obligate suction feeder Danio rerio, mandibular morphology exhibits specific transformations of opening and closing <b>lever</b> <b>ratios.</b> We conclude that patterns of morphological integration of the cichlid jaw reflect a balance among conflicting functional demands. Further, we demonstrate that bmp 4 has the potential to alter mandibular morphology in a way that mimics adaptive variation among fish species...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} a muscle to shorten and produce force is crucial for locomotion, posture, balance and respiration. During a contraction, myosin heads on the myosin {{filament}} propel the actin filament via ATP hydrolysis, resulting in shortening of the muscle and/or force generation. The maximal shortening velocity of a muscle fibre is largely determined by the myosin ATPase activity, while maximal force is primarily determined by the cross-sectional area. Since most muscles are pennate rather than parallel-fibred and work at different <b>lever</b> <b>ratios,</b> muscle architecture and joint-tendon anatomy {{has to be taken}} into account to obtain the force and velocity characteristics of a muscle. Additionally, the recruitment of agonistic and antagonistic muscles will contribute to the torque generated during a contraction. Finally, tendon compliance may impact on the rate of force rise and force generated if it is such that the muscle contraction proceeds in the ascending limb of the length-tension relation. Even when magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound, combined with EMG and/or electrical stimulation, have been applied to relate changes in muscle contractile properties to alterations in muscle size and architecture during ageing and resistance training, a disproportionate change in muscle strength and size remains to be explained...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the central}} goals in paleoecology is to {{understand}} the nature and consequences of biotic interactions. In marine systems, {{it has been argued that}} one of the major steps in the escalation of biotic interactions was marked by the origins of grazing fishes in the Cenozoic. Here I investigate the origins of herbivory and grazing in marine fishes using analyses of functional morphospace. Closing and opening <b>lever</b> <b>ratios</b> and relative length of the lower jaw are used to construct a plot of functional morphospace, a quantitative description of the potential feeding modes of fishes. Four fish faunas were examined, spanning the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (Triassic, Jurassic, Eocene and Recent). All three fossil faunas are from conservation Lagerstätten in the central Tethys, in the vicinity of coral reefs or coral-bearing hardgrounds. Changes in functional morphospace occupation reveal a marked shift in the Cenozoic, with the appearance of fishes with relatively small forceful jaws. In Recent faunas, this functional morphospace is occupied almost exclusively by grazing herbivores. This taxon-independent morphological signal of herbivory was lacking in the Mesozoic faunas, was first recorded in the Eocene, and persisted throughout the Cenozoic. This suggests that the Cenozoic did indeed witness the appearance and proliferation of herbivory and grazing by marine fishes. The arrival of these piscine herbivores had the potential to fundamentally alter the dynamics of benthic marine communities...|$|R
40|$|Microforming {{requires}} high-precision motion due to scaling issues. A Terfenol-D transducer {{was considered}} to provide bulk motion for micro-extrusion. Because Terfenol-D cannot practically produce the necessary 2. 5 mm displacement for this micro-extrusion experiment, a lever system was designed to amplify the output displacement. Compliant joints (flexures) were used to replace conventional bearings, resulting in a flexible, solid-state lever mechanism. By eliminating the backlash and static friction associated with conventional bearings, {{it should be possible}} to improve displacement precision as required to meet the geometric tolerance demands of microforming. A chief concern when designing flexure joints that see large amounts of axial loading is compliance, which leads to not only loss of motion but also loss of accuracy as the lever system responds differently under different loads. However, because Terfenol-D already has load-dependent response, this loss of accuracy is moot when coupled with a Terfenol-D prime mover, as it already requires load-dependent control. Preliminary FEM analysis has shown this design to have <b>lever</b> <b>ratio</b> losses of approximately 4 % from half load to full load, with lower than predicted stress...|$|E
40|$|By {{studying}} {{variation in}} feeding apparatus morphology across similar sympatric species, we can {{better understand the}} evolutionary relationships and ecological niches of these species. The most common feeding technique among vertebrates is suction feeding, in which an animal rapidly expands its buccal cavity to create negative pressure and suck in prey. Suction feeders not only open their jaws quickly; they must also close them rapidly to prevent elusive prey from escaping. In this study, we compared jaw morphology and feeding kinematics of five species of Salish Sea sculpin. We used anatomical dissection to measure differences in jaw adductor morphology and jaw leverage, and we used Sonometric crystal implantation to measure gape change and muscle strain during feeding. Although we found high conservation of body length to muscle mass ratio among species, visual inspection {{of the head and}} jaw revealed important differences. We found that the red Irish lord (Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus) possessed the fastest jaw, as demonstrated by anatomical measurement of a small <b>lever</b> <b>ratio,</b> kinematic measurement of a large gape-change to muscle-strain ratio, and behavioral observation of the red Irish lord’s ambush hunting strategy.

50|$|The {{ossicles}} are classically {{supposed to}} mechanically convert the vibrations of the eardrum, into amplified pressure {{waves in the}} fluid of the cochlea (or inner ear) with a lever arm factor of 1.3. Since the effective vibratory area of the eardrum is about 14 fold larger {{than that of the}} oval window, the sound pressure is concentrated, leading to a pressure gain of at least 18.1. The eardrum is merged to the malleus, which connects to the incus, which in turn connects to the stapes. Vibrations of the stapes footplate introduce pressure waves in the inner ear. There is a steadily increasing body of evidence that shows that the <b>lever</b> arm <b>ratio</b> is actually variable, depending on frequency. Between 0.1 and 1 kHz it is approximately 2, it then rises to around 5 at 2 kHz and then falls off steadily above this frequency. The measurement of this <b>lever</b> arm <b>ratio</b> is also somewhat {{complicated by the fact that}} the ratio is generally given in relation to the tip of the malleus (also known as the umbo) and the level of the middle of the stapes. The eardrum is actually attached to the malleus handle over about a 0.5 cm distance. In addition the eardrum itself moves in a very chaotic fashion at frequencies >3 kHz. The linear attachment of the eardrum to the malleus actually smooths out this chaotic motion and allows the ear to respond linearly over a wider frequency range than a point attachment. The auditory ossicles can also reduce sound pressure (the inner ear is very sensitive to overstimulation), by uncoupling each other through particular muscles.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{attention}} focused on mass extinction events in the fossil record, patterns of extinction in the dominant group of marine vertebrates-fishes-remain largely unexplored. Here, I demonstrate ecomorphological selectivity among marine teleost fishes during the end-Cretaceous extinction, based on a genus-level dataset that accounts for lineages predicted {{on the basis of}} phylogeny but not yet sampled in the fossil record. Two ecologically relevant anatomical features are considered: body size and jaw-closing <b>lever</b> <b>ratio.</b> Extinction intensity is higher for taxa with large body sizes and jaws consistent with speed (rather than force) transmission; resampling tests indicate that victims represent a nonrandom subset of taxa present in the final stage of the Cretaceous. Logistic regressions of the raw data reveal that this nonrandom distribution stems primarily from the larger body sizes of victims relative to survivors. Jaw mechanics are also a significant factor for most dataset partitions but are always less important than body size. When data are corrected for phylogenetic nonindependence, jaw mechanics show a significant correlation with extinction risk, but body size does not. Many modern large-bodied, predatory taxa currently suffering from overexploitation, such billfishes and tunas, first occur in the Paleocene, when they appear to have filled the functional space vacated by some extinction victims...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} as to whether the incudo-malleolar joint (IMJ) is mobile or immobile at moderate sound pressure levels (SPLs) is addressed. Referring to the mechanical properties of elastic tissue, we suggest that the IMJ is mobile at any SPL. In order to test this hypothesis, we investigated the dynamics of the IMJ in nine temporal bones by means of laser scanning doppler vibrometry. The dynamic behavior of both ossicles, malleus and incus is described by three degrees of freedom, and transfer functions (TFs) are shown for each motion component [corrected]. We show that there is indeed relative motion between the malleus and the incus. This transmission loss affects the middle ear TF and results in a frequency dependent sound transmission loss. Some characteristics of our results are in agreement with middle ear TFs described in the literature. The increasing transmission loss towards higher frequencies is caused by relative motion between malleus and incus at the IMJ. The concept that the IMJ is functionally mobile is consistent with the physical properties of elastic tissues which most likely define the mechanics of this joint. Since the IMJ is indeed mobile at moderate sound intensities and audible frequencies the theory of the <b>lever</b> <b>ratio</b> being responsible for the characteristics of the middle ear TF must be reconsidered...|$|E

This competition can be reduced if species vary in skeletal and muscular anatomy, because it changes biomechanical performance across species.

We quantified evolutionary correlations of skeletal morphology and muscle morphology by conducting phylogenetic independent contrasts using a phylogeny constructed from published molecular data. We hypothesized that skeletal leverage (mechanical advantage) and muscle architecture (gearing) could either display a positive evolutionary correlation (changing over evolutionary time to perform inversely of each other), or the features could display a negative correlation (changing over evolutionary time to perform in the same way). We found a positive correlation between evolutionary shifts of out-lever length and adductor muscle length, but no correlation between evolutionary shifts of in-lever length and adductor muscle length or adductor muscle length and <b>lever</b> <b>ratio.</b> Our results demonstrate that skeletal leverage and muscle architecture evolve independently in individual species of sculpins.

This paper discusses the design of leaf springs for a sub-class of VSAs that use variable <b>lever</b> arm <b>ratios</b> as means to change their output stiffness.

40|$|The major {{fraction}} of world oil {{is produced by}} waterflooding, where the injected water displaces oil and maintains the reservoir pressure. In addition, produced water reinjection (PWRI) is an economic and environmental-friendly option to convert waste to value with waterflooding. However, the major challenge is the drastic decline of well injectivity which has been widely reported in the literature. The main mechanisms of the injectivity decline are capture of particles from injected water in the porous rock and formation of low permeable external filter cake on the well wall followed by its stabilisation. The reliable predictive analytical model for well injectivity behaviour forecast up to the stabilisation stage is not available in the literature. So, {{the aim of this}} thesis is to develop full predictive analytical models for injectivity decline during sea water injection and PWRI. In order to achieve this aim, a new mathematical model for injectivity stabilisation using mechanical equilibrium of a particle on the cake surface accounting for all colloidal forces is developed in this thesis. It is found that the main empirical parameter of the model, highly affecting the stabilised cake prediction, is the <b>lever</b> arm <b>ratio.</b> The <b>lever</b> arm <b>ratio</b> is calculated from laboratory cross-flow filtration experiments and from well injectivity data. It is also determined from Hertz’s theory for the elastic particle deformation. Good agreement between the calculated results for the <b>lever</b> arm <b>ratio</b> validates the developed model. This thesis presents the derivation of a new analytical model for non-uniform cake thickness profile along injection wells. It is found out that, two regimes of the stabilised cake build-up correspond to low injection rates, where the cake starts from the reservoir top, and for high injection rates, where the cake is formed only on the lower well section. The sensitivity analysis shows that water injection rate, cake porosity, water salinity and Young’s modulus are the most influential parameters defining the cake thickness profile. The thesis presents the development of an analytical model for axi-symmetric two-phase flow with simultaneous deep bed filtration of injected particles, formation of external filter cake and its stabilisation due to particle dislodgement. It also introduces a seven-parameter adjustment method. It is shown that the initial injectivity increase, induced by varying two-phase mobility, adds three degrees of freedom to one-phase impedance growth model. This additional information is used to tune the models with the Corey relative permeability and the pseudo relative permeability under the viscous-dominant displacement. Good agreement between field data and model prediction validates the developed analytical model for injectivity decline during waterflooding and its adjustment method. The developed analytical model along with laboratory coreflood test data and probabilistic histograms of injectivity damage parameters are applied to predict the injectivity behaviour during produced water disposal into a thick low preamble sandstone reservoir as a field case study. Unusual convex form of impedance curve is observed in the coreflood test and well behaviour modelling; impedance grows slower during external cake formation if compared with deep bed filtration. Risk analysis method using probabilistic histograms of injectivity damage parameters is also developed and applied to well behaviour prediction under high uncertainty conditions. The above analytical models, results of laboratory studies and field cases allow recommending the developed models for full prediction of injectivity decline during waterflooding and disposal operations.

We provide new data on these important fossils and re-examine some previous suggestions of derived Neandertal features in the middle ear ossicles based on more limited evidence. The malleus shows a curved lateral margin of the manubrium and a relatively large head. The incus shows a tall articular facet, a depressed area on the medial surface of the body, a straight anterior border of the long process and a more closed angle between the processes. The stapes shows an asymmetrical configuration of the crura, with an anteriorly skewed head, and generally small dimensions, including a smaller and relatively wider stapedial footplate. These same features can also be seen in the few other Neandertal ear ossicles known, suggesting that a consistent anatomical pattern characterizes the Neandertal ossicular chain. While the phylogenetic polarity of many of these features remains to be clarified, the asymmetrical stapes and anteriorly skewed stapedial head appear to be derived Neandertal features. In addition, while the larger malleus head and incus articular facet in La Ferrassie 3 might reflect larger body mass in Neandertals, the larger stapes footplates in Homo sapiens cannot be explained by changes in body mass. Indeed, H. sapiens seems to depart from the general mammalian pattern in combining an increase in stapes footplate size with a decrease in body mass. Although the malleus/incus <b>lever</b> <b>ratio</b> in La Ferrassie 3 is similar to that in H. sapiens, Neandertals appear to be characterized by a slightly different spatial relationship and articulation of the ossicular chain within the tympanic cavity.

40|$|Semiconductor {{quantum dot}} (QD) lasers are {{competitive}} candidates for many {{applications such as}} high-speed long-haul optical communication systems. This is due to their superior lasing characteristics (compared to conventional quantum well (QW) lasers) and also their potential for high differential gain and direct modulation with negligible chirp. Recently, substantial efforts {{have been made to}} improve the modulation characteristics of QD semiconductor lasers such as enhancing the modulation efficiency and improving the overall modulation bandwidth. The gain lever effect is a method used to enhance the efficiency of amplitude modulation and optical frequency modulation at microwave frequencies by taking advantage of the sub-linear nature of the gain versus carrier density. Previously, two-section quantum well lasers have been investigated theoretically and experimentally to explore the gain lever effect. As for QD devices, which are extremely promising because of the strong gain saturation effect in dots, have not been investigated until recently. In this thesis, first the characteristics and applications of conventional two-section gain lever semiconductor lasers are presented. In related previous studies, gain levered single and multiple QW lasers have been used to enhance the modulation efficiencies in both intensity (IM) and frequency (FM) modulation. In this work, the modulation characteristics of a gain lever QD laser diode is demonstrated for the first time. In this work we report an amplitude modulation enhancement of 8 -dB for a p-doped two-section quantum dot laser and discuss the relation between the normalized 3 -dB bandwidth and the modulation section gain for different power levels. Also based on rate equations and small signal analysis, a novel modulation response equation is derived to describe the device dynamics. Using the new modulation response function the actual gain <b>lever</b> <b>ratio</b> can be measured for various power levels. For future work, the gain lever laser structure can be optimized to reduce the effect of non-linear gain suppression which directly limits the efficiency enhancement through the damping factors and relaxation oscillation frequency.

Little quantitative data exist on how ME mechanics deals with these large quasi-static pressure changes {{and because of this}} lack of data, only few efforts could be made to incorporate quasi-static behavior into computer models. When designing and modeling ossicle prostheses and implantable ME hearing aids, the effects of large ossicle movements caused by quasi-static pressures should be taken into account. We investigated the response of the ME to slowly varying pressures by measuring the displacement of the umbo and the stapes in rabbit with a heterodyne interferometer with position decoder. Displacement versus pressure curves were obtained at linear pressure change rates between 200  Pa/s and 1. 5  kPa/s, with amplitude ± 2. 5  kPa. The change in stapes position associated with a pressure change is independent of pressure change rate (34  μm peak-to-peak at ± 2. 5  kPa). The stapes displacement versus pressure curves are highly nonlinear and level off for pressures beyond ± 1  kPa. Stapes motion shows no measurable hysteresis at 1. 5  kPa/s, which demonstrates that the annular ligament has little viscoelasticity. Hysteresis increases strongly at the lowest pressure change rates. The stapes moves in phase with the umbo and with pressure, but the sense of rotation of the hysteresis loop of stapes is phase inversed. Stapes motion is not a simple <b>lever</b> <b>ratio</b> mimic of umbo motion, but is the consequence of complex changes in ossicle joints and ossicle position. The change in umbo position produced by a ± 2. 5  kPa pressure change decreases with increasing rate from 165  μm at 200  Pa/s to 118  μm at 1. 5  kPa/s. Umbo motion already shows significant hysteresis at 1. 5  kPa/s, but hysteresis increases further as pressure change rate decreases. We conclude that in the quasi-static regime, ossicle movement is not only governed by viscoelasticity, but that other effects become dominant as pressure change rate decreases below 1  kPa/s. The increasing hysteresis can be caused by increasing friction as speed of movement decreases, and incorporating speed-dependent friction coefficients will be essential to generate realistic models of ossicle movements at slow pressure change rates...|$|E
40|$|We present {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the capacitive coupling between graphene nanoribbons of various widths and gate electrodes in different configurations. We compare {{the influence of}} lateral metallic or graphene side gate structures on the overall back gate capacitive coupling. Most interestingly, we find a complex interplay between quantum capacitance effects in the graphene nanoribbon and the lateral graphene side gates, giving rise to an unconventional negative quantum capacitance. The emerging non-linear capacitive couplings are investigated in detail. The experimentally relevant relative <b>lever</b> arm, the <b>ratio</b> between the coupling of the different gate structures, is discussed. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Buildup and {{stabilization}} of external filter cake {{is a well-known}} phenomenon in several environmental and industrial applications. Significant decline of the tangential rate along thick intervals in lengthy vertical wells yields a nonuniform external filter cake profile. We derive the mechanical equilibrium equations for the stabilized cake profile accounting for electrostatic particle−rock interaction, varying permeate factor, applying the torque balance to describe cake equilibrium, and calculating the <b>lever</b> arm <b>ratio</b> using Hertz’s theory for contact deformation of cake and particles. An implicit formula for the cake thickness along the well is derived. Two regimes of the stabilized cake buildup correspond to low rates, where the cake starts from the reservoir top, and for high rates, where the cake is formed in the lower well section only. The sensitivity analysis shows that the drag and permeate forces are the competitive factors affecting cake thickness under varying Young’s modulus, rate, and salinity. The main parameters defining external cake profile are injection rate, cake porosity, water salinity, and Young’s modulus.

40|$|We trace capital {{structure}} to past market valuations. Unlevered firms {{tend to be}} those that raised funds when their valuations were high, {{as measured by the}} market-to-book <b>ratio.</b> <b>Levered</b> firms tend to be those that raised funds when their valuations were low. The results are difficult to reconcile with the tradeoff theory because temporary changes in market-to-book lead to permanent changes in {{capital structure}}. The results are also difficult to reconcile with the pecking order because temporary increases in market-to-book lead to permanent increases in cash balances. The results are consistent with the theory that capital structure is the cumulative outcome of a series of market-timing-motivated financing decisions...|$|R
