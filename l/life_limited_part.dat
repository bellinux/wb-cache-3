40|$|To sustain in {{the vibrant}} field of civil aviation, the {{aircraft}} and engine manufacturers {{are in the}} pursuit of delivering efficient systems with the best economics. In umpteen scenarios of growing interest, engine maintenance cost due to scheduled maintenance is of importance. The current research is focused on estimation of the maintenance factors, such as severity and shop visit rate to study the operational scenarios and concurrent technologies. The severity, defined as relative engine damage is estimated by blending the aircraft performance, gas turbine performance, gas turbine design and life estimation methods towards transforming the thrust variation into life estimates, reflecting the severity on critical <b>Life</b> <b>Limited</b> <b>Part</b> (LLP) of an aircraft engine. The Shop Visit Rate (SVR) is predicted based on Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) margin consumption due to gas turbine performance degradation. The severity studies reveal that Hight Pressure Turbine (HPT) blade and disc are critical, depicting engine severity. Lower thrust engine severity is dominated by cyclic damage (low cycle fatigue) and large thrust engines by steady state damage (creep). The operational factors, take-off derate and Outside Air Temperature (OAT) have more sensitivity on severity of aircraft engines. The use of climb derate, reduces the damage on large thrust engines considerably, especially for three shaft engines. Cooling effectiveness and thermal barrier coating are important technological factors for reducing the severity level. The SVR prediction on lower and large thrust engines, depict the take-off EGT as a source for shop visits, governed by operational parameters such as takeoff derate, OAT, trip length and engine wash. The engine aging curves are represented as Weibull distribution based on severity and SVR. Severity estimation and shop visit prediction methodology, demonstrated through an integrated tool will serve as a decision making element for comparing competitive engines, operational strategies and engine technologies...|$|E

The compliance work of <b>life</b> <b>limit</b> <b>parts</b> involves typical flight profile, heat transfer analysis, stress analysis, materials data, and life predict method. In this study, fatigue-creep interaction behaviors of powder metallurgy materials with inclusion have been performed with the Kachanov-Rabotnov damage law to show the life compliance. On the constant fatigue-creep loading, different types of inclusion are investigated in the work. The research shows that the type of inclusion has strong influence on the damage of matrix.

The results indicate that the flow parameters affect the probability of fracture of a gas turbine disk since they can change the distribution of stress and temperature of the disk. The failure probability of the disk rises with increasing rotation Reynolds number and Chebyshev number, but descends with increasing inlet Reynolds number. In addition, a sampling based sensitivity analysis with finite difference method is conducted to determine the sensitivities of the safety with respect to the flow parameters. The sensitivity estimates show that the rotation Reynolds number is the dominant variable in safety analysis of a rotor-stator cavity among the flow parameters...|$|R

It is based on work performed at Pratt & Whitney, a major producer of turbine engines. The author worked in the Global Materials Solutions program, Pratt & Whitney's latest business venture, in which they will provide OEM quality materials for the CFM 56 engine manufactured by CFM International. The new business venture required a forecasting method that did not rely heavily on customer input or historic demand. A forecast was developed using publicly available aircraft utilization history for the LLPs in the aircraft. In addition, a methodology was proposed for the remaining parts that will be studied in a future LFM internship. In addition, an inventory placement analysis was completed for the GMS LLP supply chain. by Joshua T. Simmons. Thesis (M. B. A.)

During this process the operator is required by law and contract requirements to show compliance with maintenance procedures.

40|$|Engine fleet {{management}} {{has always been}} one of the most challenging tasks in any airline as it requires assuring reliability and cost effectiveness of engine operation at all times. The engine maintenance expenses are quite significant and accounts for about one third of the total aircraft maintenance costs. For all airlines with “Labour & Material” type of contractual arrangement with respective OEM / MRO provider, maximizing engine’s Time On-Wing (TOW) is extremely crucial to face lower maintenance costs, while at the same time abiding by governing airworthiness standards. Engine’s TOW is generally limited due to at least one of the following reasons: performance degradation reflected by lower Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) margin, hot section hardware life monitored by regular borescope inspections and <b>Life</b> <b>Limited</b> <b>parts</b> (LLP) expiry enforced by OEM or regulatory authority. After introducing relevant aero engine maintenance concepts and terminology, this thesis will serve to provide both qualitative and quantitative assessment of how certain operational factors of flight profile influence engine performance deterioration and maintenance costs. One such factor is the thrust rating of the engine. Higher thrust gives rise to higher internal temperatures, exposing engine hardware to greater mechanical and thermal stresses and therefore leading to faster rate of degradation and earlier engine removal. This thesis will be of interest to airlines having at least two different types of aircraft models in their fleet with different average flight profiles but powered by the same engine model with the required thrust variant. A particular engine may spend some time first on the aircraft that requires higher thrust rating before being switched to the aircraft that requires lower thrust rating or vice versa. This thesis will look into the feasibility of such an operational strategy through different aspects and discuss its effectiveness in retaining the engine performance for a longer time, thereby affecting the operating fuel costs and restoration costs per flying hour expected at the time of shop visit...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} Weibull formulation to the life analysis of {{different parts of the}} engine in order to estimate the cost of maintenance, the direct operating costs (DOC) and net present cost (NPC) of future type turbofan engines. The Weibull distribution is often used in the field of life data analysis due to its flexibility—it can mimic the behavior of other statistical distributions such as the normal and the exponential. The developed economic model is composed of three modules: a lifing module, an economic module and a risk module. The lifing module estimates the life of the high pressure turbine blades through the analysis of creep and fatigue over a full working cycle of the engine. The value of life calculated by the lifing is then taken as the baseline distribution to calculate the life of other important modules of the engine using the Weibull approach. Then the lower of the values of life of all the distributions is taken as time between overhaul (TBO), and used into the economic module calculations. The economic module uses the TBO together with the cost of labour and the cost of the engine (needed to determine the cost of spare parts) to estimate the cost of maintenance and DOC of the engine. In the present work five Weibull distributions are used for five important sources of interruption of the working life of the engine: Combustor, <b>Life</b> <b>Limited</b> <b>Parts</b> (LLP), High Pressure Compressor (HPC), General breakdowns and High Pressure Turbine (HPT). The risk analysis done in this work shows the impact of the breakdown of different parts of the engine on the NPC and DOC, the importance that each module of the engine has in its life, and how the application of the Weibull theory can help us in the risk assessment of future aero engines. A detailed explanation of the economic model is done in two other works (Pascovici et. al. [6] and Pascovici et. al. [7]), so in this paper only a general overview is done...|$|R

This means that units that have a predefined lifespan are to be modeled in a scenario where all conditions are kept constant and all transients have faded out. OPUS 10 is a spare parts optimization software developed by Systecon AB. There {{is no way to}} explicitly model the life-limited units in OPUS 10, although there are different approximate models that are built on adjustments of the failure rate and repair fraction or the definition of preventive maintenance. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the usage of life-limited items in real life and to investigate what approximated models different OPUS 10 users will utilize in their modeling of life-limited units. Furthermore, the objective is to analyze the consequences of the approximated models and to investigate the possibility of an improved model. The results show that the main interest when choosing which approximated model to use is the type of <b>life</b> <b>limit.</b> There are three different types of operating time <b>life</b> <b>limits</b> investigated. Either the unit is discarded immediately after the <b>life</b> <b>limit</b> is reached, or it is instead discarded at the next failure. There is also the possibility of resetting of the <b>life</b> <b>limit</b> timer at each maintenance. In all three cases, it is shown that if choosing the most fitting approximate model, the results are very accurate. If the <b>life</b> <b>limit</b> is instead measured in calendar time, even the best approximation will give an under-estimation of the expected number of backorders. It is also shown that most of the OPUS 10 users model life-limited units as preventive maintenance with discard, which is not the best approximation in any of the types of <b>life</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R
40|$|There are {{increasing}} numbers of children living with <b>life</b> <b>limiting</b> illnesses in mainstream schools, thanks to better medical care. <b>Life</b> <b>limiting</b> illnesses in children can include (i) conditions for which curative treatment is feasible but can fail such as cancer and irreversible organ failure (ii) conditions requiring long periods of intensive treatment, but premature death is still possible such as cystic fibrosis (iii) progressive conditions without curative treatment such as Battens disease and (iv) conditions with severe neurological disability which might deteriorate unpredictably such as those with severe multiple disabilities following brain or spinal cord injuries (ACT/RCPCH, 2003). The aim of this literature-based study was to evaluate the current provision of educational support for teachers who are teaching children with <b>life</b> <b>limiting</b> illness in mainstream schools. An international literature search was carried out between February and July 2010 for academic journal articles across nine electronic data bases.

The review aimed {{to answer the following}} questions: •	What are the needs of children who have <b>life</b> <b>limiting</b> illness, and their families, when the child is in school? •	What are the needs of teachers who are teaching children with <b>life</b> <b>limiting</b> illness? •	What educational support is currently available for teachers who are teaching children with <b>life</b> <b>limiting</b> illness? •	How well does the educational support meet the needs identified {{within the context of the}} literature reviewed? The analysis identified that the needs of children with <b>life</b> <b>limiting</b> illnesses are not being well met, and there appears to be little evidence of educational support for teachers. The paper concludes that schools need to work with both the medical and social models of health/disability in order to meet the needs of children with life-limiting illness. There is some consensus that the way forward needs to include multidisciplinary working within an ecological approach that supports home, schools and the health services working together.
