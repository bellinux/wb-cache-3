50|$|The Ibanez Edge Tremolo is {{a double}} locking tremolo system for the {{electric}} guitar very similar in design to the original Floyd Rose. It {{first appeared in the}} Ibanez product line as of the 1986 model year; however, they have appeared on guitars with 1985 serial numbers. The Edge offers a number of improvements from the Original Floyd Rose, namely <b>locking</b> <b>studs</b> (for improved tuning stability, added in 1987-8), a spring retainer on the tremolo block (again, added in 1987-8) and a pop-in arm.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, {{the patent}} for the Original Floyd Rose tremolo expired. This {{coincided with the}} release of a newly {{designed}} pair of Tremolos from Ibanez, the Edge Pro and the Edge Pro II. Ibanez mistakenly figured that all the Floyd Rose patents were available for use; however, the patent on the Low Profile design was still in effect. This prompted the Edge Pro II's replacement with Edge III which fits into the parameters of the original patent and is therefore not subject to a license fee. The Edge Pro and Edge Pro II differ from the original Edge, as they are able to accept strings with the ball-ends still attached, and have no <b>locking</b> <b>studs.</b> Due to the lack of <b>locking</b> <b>studs,</b> the tremolo is in some ways inferior to the models it replaces; however, the lower profile design and ergonomic improvements mean this distinction is not clear cut. The Original and Lo-Pro Edge are still produced and are available through Ibanez Parts dealers. Positioned as top of the line locking tremolo systems, the Original and Lo-Pro Edge are among the most expensive pieces of guitar hardware in mass production, with a unit cost higher than the Floyd Rose Original and the Schaller Floyd Rose, and indeed more expensive than even a number of Ibanez guitars (including ones with lower-tier locking tremolos). The Original Edge is still being used by Ibanez for certain RG series reissues, and all 2010 Ibanez JEM and JS series guitars.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{military}} rifles of the day, the Lee was not {{fitted with a}} turning bolt. [...] Though frequently described as a straight-pull action, the M1895 Lee actually uses a camming action in which a steel wedge or locking block beneath the bolt is forced into a recessed area in the receiver. [...] Pulling the operating handle back causes the bolt to rock back and upwards, freeing a <b>locking</b> <b>stud</b> on the receiver and unlocking the bolt. [...] The firing pin cocked on final closing where the resistance would be overcome by the forward inertia of closing the action. Once the rather odd [...] "up and back" [...] bolt movement was mastered, {{and as long as}} the action was clean and well-lubricated, it worked fairly well, though the slightly inclined opening stroke proved awkward for some men when the rifle was operated from the shoulder. [...] Despite this, the Navy's Chief of Ordnance noted with approval that the Lee rifle could be fired [...] "with great rapidity", achieving a rate of fire considerably faster than most existing turn-bolt rifles of the day.|$|R
2500|$|The firearm is fed by {{lightweight}} 20-round box magazines, 30-, 10- and 5-round {{magazines are}} also available. The magazines are molded from a translucent polymer {{and can be}} <b>locked</b> together using <b>studs</b> {{in order to facilitate}} quicker reloading; Jungle style. The empty weight of a 20-round magazine is [...] and [...] for a 30-round magazine.|$|R
