They form stacks of parallel sheets {{close to the}} cytoplasmic membrane with a low packing density. The relatively large distance between the thylakoids provides space for the external <b>light</b> <b>harvesting</b> antennae, the phycobilisomes.

25|$|Once {{the leaf}} {{primordial}} cells are established from the SAM cells, the new axes for leaf growth are defined, one important (and more studied) among them being the abaxial-adaxial (lower-upper surface) axes. The genes involved in defining this, {{and the other}} axes {{seem to be more}} or less conserved among higher plants. Proteins of the HD-ZIPIII family have been implicated in defining the adaxial identity. These proteins deviate some cells in the leaf primordium from the default abaxial state, and make them adaxial. It is believed that in early plants with leaves, the leaves just had one type of surface - the abaxial one. This is the underside of today's leaves. The definition of the adaxial identity occurred some 200 million years after the abaxial identity was established. One can thus imagine the early leaves as an intermediate stage in evolution of today's leaves, having just arisen from spiny stem-like outgrowths of their leafless ancestors, covered with stomata all over, and not optimized as much for <b>light</b> <b>harvesting.</b>|$|E

2500|$|CMPs {{have been}} {{investigated}} for several applications since their discovery. Surface areas in CMPs can exceed 1000 m2/g in many cases, although related porous aromatic frameworks, which lack extended conjugation, can have much higher surface areas of more than 5500 m2/g. [...] The porosity of these materials has led to their evaluation as sorbents. Recent work has focused on their potential in terms of catalysis, for example {{in the form of}} 'metal-organic CMPs', and also for <b>light</b> <b>harvesting,</b> and supercapacitors [...] taking advantage of their highly conjugated nature.

2500|$|Plastids {{are thought}} to have {{originated}} from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. [...] This symbiosis evolved around 1.5 billion years ago and enabled eukaryotes to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. Three evolutionary lineages have since emerged in which the plastids are named differently: chloroplasts in green algae and plants, rhodoplasts in red algae and muroplasts in the glaucophytes. The plastids differ both in their pigmentation and in their ultrastructure. For example, chloroplasts have lost all phycobilisomes, the <b>light</b> <b>harvesting</b> complexes found in cyanobacteria, red algae and glaucophytes, but instead contain stroma and grana thylakoids, structures found only in plants and closely related green algae. The glaucocystophycean plastid — in contrast to chloroplasts and rhodoplasts — is still surrounded by the remains of the cyanobacterial cell wall. All these primary plastids are surrounded by two membranes.|$|E
2500|$|Conjugated {{microporous}} polymers (CMPs) are a sub-class of {{porous materials}} {{that are related to}} structures such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks, but are amorphous in nature, rather than crystalline. CMPs are also a sub-class of conjugated polymers and possess many of the same properties such as conductivity, mechanical rigidity, and insolubility. [...] CMPs are created through the linking of building blocks in a π-conjugated fashion and possess 3-D networks. Conjugation extends through the system of CMPs and lends conductive properties to CMPs. Building blocks of CMPs are attractive in that the blocks possess broad diversity in the π units that can be used and allow for tuning and optimization of the skeleton and subsequently the properties of CMPs. [...] Most building blocks have rigid components such as alkynes that cause the microporosity. CMPs have applications in gas storage, heterogeneous catalysis, light emitting, <b>light</b> <b>harvesting,</b> and electric energy storage.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{our earlier}} success in {{developing}} Si nanowire (Si NW)-based PDs [12], this paper further proposes {{a new form}} of all-Si photodetectors by integrating subwavelength metallic grating with silicon nanowires to achieve polarimetric detection in near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. To fulfill this task, the following three issues need to be resolved. First, conventional Si nanowire-based PDs work in visible wavelengths (0.4 – 0.7 [*]μm), it is essential to drive the Si nanowire detectors into NIR regime [13, 14]. Secondly, a miniaturized optical polarizer needs to be built into the detector for polarimetric detection. Thirdly, owing to the low absorption coefficient of Si in NIR, <b>light</b> <b>harvest</b> structure is desired to enhance the responsivity. To meet all these requirements, this work has developed a novel device structure in silicon, which is composed of subwavelength metallic grating as a polarizer, silicon nanowire array with certain height for <b>light</b> <b>harvest,</b> and finally, a surface plasmonic resonator for wavelength selection and for the emission and diffusion of hot electrons [15 – 20] over the Schottky barrier in the Au/silicon interface to generate an extra photocurrent under illumination. This resonant cavity-based strategy not only extends the band edge of Si into the IR regime but also broadens the bandwidth of the photoresponse with polarization-sensitive detection. This paper reports our recent progress in tackling all these issues.|$|R

It has a quality character controlled {{by a pair of}} recessive genes (nuclear gene). The partial loss of Chl b in content affects the efficiency of <b>light</b> <b>harvest</b> in a <b>light</b> <b>harvest</b> complex (LHC), thus producing the difference of the exciting energy transfer and the efficiency of photochemistry conversion between the mutant and wild-type rice in photosynthetic unit. The efficiency of utilizing light energy is higher in the mutant than that in the wildtype rice relatively. For further discussion of the above-mentioned difference and learning about the mechanism of the increase in the photochemical efficiency of the mutant, the pico-second resolution fluorescence spectrum measurement with delay-frame-scanning single photon counting technique is adopted. Thylakoid membranes of the mutant and the wild-type rice are excited by an Ar+ laser with a pulse width of 120 ps, repetition rate of 4 MHz and wavelength of 514 nm. Compared with the time and spectrum property of exciting fluorescence, conclusions of those ultrafast dynamic experiments are: 1) The speeds of the exciting energy transferred in photo-system I are faster than that in photo-system II in both samples. 2) The speeds of the exciting energy transfer of mutant sample are faster than those of the wildtype. This might be one of the major reasons why the efficiency of photosynthesis is higher in mutant than that in the wild-type rice...|$|R
