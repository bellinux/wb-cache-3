5000|$|SARs {{produce a}} {{two-dimensional}} (2-D) image. One dimension {{in the image}} is called range and {{is a measure of}} the [...] "line-of-sight" [...] distance from the radar to the object. Range is determined by measuring the time from transmission of a pulse to receiving the echo from a target. Also, range resolution is determined by the transmitted pulse width.The other dimension is called azimuth and is perpendicular to range. The ability of SAR of producing relatively fine azimuth resolution makes it different from other radars.To obtain fine azimuth resolution, a physically large antenna is needed to focus the transmitted and received energy into a sharp beam. The sharpness of the beam defines the azimuth resolution. An airborne radar could collect data while flying this distance and process the data as if it came from a physically long antenna. The distance the aircraft flies in synthesizing the antenna is known as the synthetic aperture. A narrow synthetic beamwidth results from the relatively <b>long</b> <b>synthetic</b> aperture, which gets finer resolution than a smaller physical antenna.|$|E
50|$|This {{protocol}} {{begins by}} randomly shearing the tested genomic DNA {{into a tight}} size distribution. The sheared DNA molecules are then subjected for the end repair and A-tailed treatment. The end repair treatment converts any damaged or incompatible protruding ends of DNA to 5’-phosphorylated and blunt-ended DNA, enabling immediate blunt-end ligation, while the A-tailing treatment adds an A to the 3’ end of the sheared DNA. DNA molecules with a length of 1 kb are selected by loading on the 6% TBE PAGE gel. In the next step, the DNA molecules are circularized with T-tailed 30 bp <b>long</b> <b>synthetic</b> oligonucleotides (T30), which contains two outward-facing MmeI recognition sites, and the resulting circularized DNA undergoes rolling circle replication. The amplified circularized DNA molecules are then digested with MmeI (type IIs restriction endonuclease) which will cuts {{at a distance from}} its recognition site, releasing the T30 fragment flanked by 17-18 bp tags (≈70 bp in length). The paired-tag molecules need to be end-repaired prior to the ligation of ePCR (emulsion PCR) primer oligonucleotides (FDV2 and RDV2) to their both ends. The resulting 135 bp library molecules are size-selected and nick translated. Lastly, amplify the 135 bp paired end-tag library molecules with PCR {{to increase the amount of}} library material and eliminate extraneous ligation products in a single step. The resulted DNA template consists of a 44 bp FDV sequence, a 17-18 bp proximal tag, the T30 sequence, a 17-18 bp distal tag, and a 25 bp RDV sequence.|$|E

The T-cells responded antigen-specifically, with strong secretion of IFNγ and TNFα, irrespective of patients' HLAs. The most immunogenic regions of the vaccine peptide were NY-ESO- 189 - 102 for CD 8 (+) and NY-ESO- 183 - 99 for CD 4 (+) T-cells.

To investigate these properties using a modeling and simulation method, an appropriate model based on reliable data and a precise identification method is required.

For this reason, special construction specimens with different hardness levels and which had almost no sprouted yarn were prepared, and multi-intensity multi-area impact tests and parameter identification were performed for each specimen.

40|$|Merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP 2) is a {{promising}} vaccine candidate against Plasmodium falciparum blood stages. A recombinant 3 D 7 form of MSP 2 was a subunit of Combination B, a blood stage vaccine {{tested in the}} field in Papua New Guinea. A selective effect in favour of the allelic family not represented by the vaccine argued for a MSP 2 vaccine consisting of both dimorphic variants. An alternative approach to recombinant manufacture of vaccines is the production of <b>long</b> <b>synthetic</b> peptides (LSP). LSP exceeding a length of well over 100 amino acids can now be routinely synthesized. Synthetic production of vaccine antigens cuts the often time-consuming steps of protein expression and purification short.

Here we present the evaluation of two <b>long</b> <b>synthetic</b> peptides representing both allelic families of MSP 2 as potential vaccine candidates.
