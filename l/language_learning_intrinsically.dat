The model emphasizes weaving together {{different forms of}} <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> activities {{that take place in}} different learning contexts to achieve seamless <b>language</b> <b>learning.</b> It promotes social interactions with social media about the learners’ day-to-day life using the targeted second or foreign language. The paper first identifies three key features of the <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> approach, namely, authenticity, contextualization and socialization. How these features are related to the communicative approach of <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> are subsequently explicated. This is followed by further explication on how the notion of seamless <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> could inform learning designers and learners in synergizing the desired characteristics of <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> together.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} various issues related to curriculum in foreign <b>language</b> <b>learning,</b> and in particular focuses on learning English as a foreign language (EFL). Foreign <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> is taken to mean the <b>learning</b> of a <b>language</b> other than the learner’s first language (L 1), and this language is not ordinarily used in the learner’s everyday life. Thus, foreign <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> contexts {{are very different from}} second <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> contexts, for in second <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> contexts, the <b>language</b> being <b>learned</b> is often used in the learner’s larger social context (even though it might not be always used in the learner’s immediate home or community).
