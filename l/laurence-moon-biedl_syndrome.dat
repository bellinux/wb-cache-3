40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a case of}} <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome</b> identified in a 24 -month-old boy. Significant renal involvement was present with right-sided vesicoureteral reflux, cystocele, urinary tract infections, and growth arrest of the right kidney. After the development of hypertension a left renal biopsy was performed to determine if bilateral renal disease was present. Histopathological and ultrastructural changes in the left kidney are described. These changes appear to be unrelated to pyelonephritis or hypertension and to be most consistent with the nephropathy of <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome</b> were {{reported}} with marked mental symptoms. Case 1 had mental defficiency, obesity, polydactylia and Retinitis pigmentosa, and was recognized periodic mental symptoms (repeated alternatively increased psychomotor activity and decreased psychomotor activity). Case 2 had mental defficiency, obesity, polydactylia and Retinitis pigmentosa, and was recognized constant mental symptoms (lacking in spontaneity, mutism, negativism and so on). The mental symptoms of <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{seems to be}} classified as two groups. That is, the first group has constant mental symptoms and the second group has periodic mental symptoms. Our Case 1 belongs to the second group and Case 2 belongs to the first group...|$|E
40|$|Clinical and histopathological {{studies of}} two {{patients}} with distinctly different inherited juvenile retinal dystrophies {{indicate that the}} ocular defect in mitochondrial cytopathy involves the underlying pigment epithelium, whereas in the <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome</b> the photoreceptor cells are primarily affected...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Laurence-Moon-Biedl (LMB) {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal-recessive ciliopathy with manifold symptomatology. The cardinal clinical features include retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, intellectual delay, polydactyly/syndactyly, and hypogenitalism. In this paper, the authors report on three siblings with <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with a probable pseudocycloid form of congenital nystagmus. Methods. This was a case study conducted at King Khaled Hospital. Results. The authors assert that the nystagmus in <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome</b> is essentially similar to idiopathic motor-defect nystagmus and the nystagmus seen in optic nerve hypoplasia, ocular albinism, and bilateral opacities of the ocular media. Conclusion. The data support the previous hypothesis {{that there is a}} common brain stem motor abnormality in sensory-defect and motor-defect nystagmus...|$|E

40|$|Particular {{aspects of}} plasma ACTH {{radioimmunoassay}} are examinated. The results obtained with this method in adrenocortical diseases (Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia) are reported and clinical value in etiological diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is outlined. Moreover {{the results obtained}} in other syndromes of endocrinologic interest (massive obesity, Turner's and Klinefelter's syndromes, <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome,</b> true precocious puberty, primary hypothyroidism, hypopituitary dwarphism) are reported and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} end stage renal failure {{occurring}} {{in association with}} the <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome</b> are reported. Abnormalities in renal function and morphology are increasingly recognized in these patients in whom uraemia is an important cause of morbidity and early mortality. The presence of renal impairment, occurring as frequently as any of the pentad of features that characterize the syndrome, has important implications for the prognosis and long term management of these patients...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome</b> and {{nephrotic}} range proteinuria is presented. Radiological {{investigation of the}} urinary tract revealed clubbed calyces but no evidence of obstruction or vesicoureteric reflux. Renal biopsy revealed occasional sclerotic glomeruli, extensive foot-process fusion and segmental glomerular basement membrane abnormalities with negative immunofluorescence for immunoglobulins and complement. Nephrotic proteinuria responded to steroid therapy but mild proteinuria persisted. The findings were consistent with minimal change nephropathy superimposed on the glomerular lesions of Lawrence-Moon-Biedl syndrome. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Two {{children}} with <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>syndrome</b> had radiographic evidence of cysts in the renal medulla, and one had impaired renal function and infection. The frequency of cystic disease in this syndrome implies that intravenous urography should {{be carried out}} on all patients with this syndrome. Children with renal abnormalities should be followed to avoid further damage from urinary infection, or from dehydration in those with a concentrating defect. Regular renal function tests should be carried out on other children. and full investigation should follow if abnormalities are found in order that {{the natural history of}} the often fatal renal lesion can be clarified...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{show the}} pattern of {{etiology}} of childhood obesity referred to our endocrinology clinic between December 1989 and December 1994. Subject and Methods: All the children referred to our clinic at the above stipulated dates were studied. This is a retrospective medical records review of these patients. The patients&#x 2032; height and weight were measured by trained staff of the clinic. The Quetelet index also known as Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) /height (m) 2 for each patient. Laboratory data as well as results of clinical investigations were also obtained from {{the records of the}} patients. Results: 52 patients with ages ranging between 2 years and 16 years (median 8 years) were studied. Male : female ratio was 1 : 1. 35 (67. 3 &#x 0025;) of the patients were Saudis while 17 (32. 7 &#x 0025;) were non-Saudis. The etiology of obesity among the series were nutritional 46 (88. 5 &#x 0025;), Prader-Willi Syndrome 3 (5. 8 &#x 0025;), <b>Laurence-Moon-Biedl</b> <b>Syndrome</b> 1 (1. 9 &#x 0025;), pseudohypoparathyroidism 1 (1. 9 &#x 0025;) and hypothyroidism 1 (1. 9 &#x 0025;). The study showed {{that the majority of the}} patients had simple nutritional obesity...|$|E
