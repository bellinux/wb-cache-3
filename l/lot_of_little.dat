Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh my goodness – I was so excited when I saw that I had a scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> looks and there's some playful language in how we talk to one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.' They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band's first {{performance}} in 2005 {{was at the}} Live 8 concert, Barrie, Ontario on July 2 where the song [...] "Where Are You" [...] was premiered in its final form. For this tour they were accompanied by guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian. Leading up to the album's release, they toured several small clubs in the Los Angeles area [...] "to work the bugs out" [...] and help the band get a better feel for the songs. They then toured steadily across North America, opening two shows for The Rolling Stones, until October when a family member of a band member became ill and several shows had to be canceled. The band chose to play smaller venues on this tour rather than arenas because the sound quality was better. [...] "And for us, this new record {{is one of those}} things where there are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> guitar parts happening all over the place and little textures -- and we want to hear that stuff." [...] A cross-Canadian tour continued through summer of 2006 with the final show being played at Rogers Centre in Toronto. The band entered a hiatus period after this while Maida worked on his solo album, The Hunter's Lullaby. They wouldn't play live again until mid-2008.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea for}} Pan's Labyrinth came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, {{which he says}} are filled with [...] "doodles, ideas, {{drawings}} and plot bits". He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years. At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi in London and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later. Though he originally wrote {{a story about a}} pregnant woman who {{falls in love with a}} faun, Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that [...] "for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that [...] "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head".|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper was {{extremely}} impressed, scoring the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 8.7 out of 10, {{and giving the}} game an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] award. The Xbox version was also awarded the October [...] "Xbox Game of the Month" [...] award. Roper dismissed notions that the game was simply a Grand Theft Auto clone, arguing instead that it advanced the genre; [...] "much of Scarface is based on what we've seen in Grand Theft Auto. In fact, it's fairly obvious that Radical used said series as the blueprint {{and then went back}} and re-evaluated its shortcomings. The result {{is that we have a}} game that fixes many of GTAs problematic elements." [...] He praised the basic gameplay, the storyline, the balls meter, rage mode, and the aiming system. Although he was somewhat critical of the map, arguing too many areas in the game are accessible via only one road, he concluded [...] "there are a whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> things about Scarface that make it fun, but it's the sum of its parts that make it the overall great game that it is. It does a whole lot to fix many of the problems with other games in the genre, and it does an absolutely fantastic job of bringing the world of Scarface to gamers." [...] Mark Bozon and Chris Roper scored the Wii version 8.5 out of 10, also giving it an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] award, and writing [...] "Scarface is a very impressive game, and while there isn't a ton of Wii-specific additions to the package, everything that was added makes a big difference." [...] Praising the controls, they wrote [...] "it's amazingly easy to target enemies and blow off specific body parts in the process." [...] They called it [...] "an intelligent, high-budget, astonishingly impressive game," [...] arguing [...] "Wii owners that fit in the hardcore crowd will absolutely eat this one up, as it's currently one of the deepest and most entertaining experiences on the system." ...|$|E
