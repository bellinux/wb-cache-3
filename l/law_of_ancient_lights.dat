The study <b>of</b> Roman <b>law</b> offers a possibility of historical perspective on law, enriches students’ knowledge on the theory and dogmatics <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and teaches the ways of legal thinking.

While the rights on the {{southern}} side {{ceased to be a}} problem after the owners of those rights gave concessions, the rights on the eastern side were dealt with by sloping the roof away from the street from the fourth floor up, which affected not only the floorplan of the structure but meant that the interior recording tower could not be continued up to the top floor.

50|$|Legal {{experts have}} {{suggested}} that American water law, especially the doctrine of prior appropriation, may offer a more useful precedent for sun rights. They point out that both sunlight and water are used rather than captured and sold; both may be consumed, but both are renewable. In addition, there is an equivalence between upstream and downstream in water law and the geometry of solar shadowing. But, like the Doctrine <b>of</b> <b>Ancient</b> <b>Lights,</b> {{there are problems with}} the application <b>of</b> water <b>law.</b> At the moment, Solar access laws are usually “voluntary,” meaning that a solar owner cannot require that their neighbor agree to a solar easement.|$|R
