50|$|P. jacobsoni {{females are}} able to {{recognize}} and reject conspecific females of foreign colonies; however, they will accept alien nests located {{in the same place}} as their own was. The exact location of the new nest in the position of the true nest might be a deceiving factor, but they still seem able to recognize a different brood within the nest, evidenced by higher activity of behavior in experimentally switched nests versus control nests. Nevertheless, P. jacobsoni will potentially completely accept an alien nest and an unrelated immature brood (the likelihood of this increases with the relative immaturity of the brood). This adoption of an unrelated brood may stem from a heavier investment in offspring of Stenogastrinae wasps versus other social wasps. Polistines, for example, completely destroy immature broods of alien wasps. Stenogastrinae wasps, on the other hand invest heavily with the deposition and provision of an abdominal substance, an allocation that is greater than the simple food and liquid allocation of other wasp species. As such, there is a greater investment in <b>larval</b> <b>rearing</b> for the Stenogastrinae wasp versus other wasp species. It is also possible that the female keeps the unrelated brood long enough for her to need to lay her own eggs, at which point she will eat the brood to give her an energetic boost for establishing her own brood.|$|E
40|$|Pioneering studies {{into the}} effects of {{elevated}} CO 2 on the behaviour of reef fishes often tested high-CO 2 reared fish using control water in the test arena. While subsequent studies using rearing treatment water (control or high CO 2) in the test arena have confirmed {{the effects of}} high CO 2 {{on a range of}} reef fish behaviours, a further investigation into the use of different test water in the experimental arena is warranted. Here, we used a fully factorial design to test the effect of rearing treatment water (control or high CO 2) and experimental test water (control or high CO 2) on antipredator responses of larval reef fishes. We tested antipredator behaviour in larval clownfish Amphiprion percula and ambon damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis, two species that have been used in previous high CO 2 experiments. Specifically, we tested if: (1) using control or high CO 2 water in a two channel flume influenced the response of larval clownfish to predator odour; and (2) using control or high CO 2 water in the test arena influenced the escape response of larval damselfish to a startle stimulus. Finally, (3) because the effects of high CO 2 on fish behaviour appear to be caused by altered function of the GABA-A neurotransmitter we tested if antipredator behaviours were restored in clownfish treated with a GABA antagonist (gabazine) in high CO 2 water. <b>Larval</b> clownfish <b>reared</b> from hatching in control water (496 µatm) strongly avoided predator cue whereas <b>larval</b> clownfish <b>reared</b> from hatching in high CO 2 (1, 022 µatm) were attracted to the predator cue, as has been reported in previous studies.

Treatment of high-CO 2 reared clownfish with 4 mg l− 1 gabazine in high CO 2 seawater restored the normal response to predator odour, as has been previously reported with fish tested in control water.
