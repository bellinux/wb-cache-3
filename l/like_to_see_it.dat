500|$|Following {{the main}} event at UFC 94, top welterweight {{contender}} Thiago Alves made {{his way into the}} cage to congratulate St-Pierre on the victory. After interviews with both fighters, it was announced that Alves would be next to challenge for St-Pierre's championship. This fight took place as the co-main event of the UFC 100 card. St-Pierre's dominant victory also opened up discussion for a possible [...] "superfight" [...] with UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva in 2010. Dana White stated that this bout was a possibility, and he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> St-Pierre expressed interest in the fight.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, the {{two teams}} agreed to {{schedule}} a rematch for September 6, 2010. Deborah Yow stated that, [...] "The citizens of Maryland {{have made it clear}} they want this game." [...] Alluding to the Navy athletic staff's perceived reticence, she added, [...] "We got past the Charlotte situation." [...] The delay in scheduling was attributed to the need for a three-way contract between Maryland, Navy, and the stadium tenants, the Baltimore Ravens. For this reason, a renewal as far off as 2014 was not seriously discussed. Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as an annual game, but that's not for me to decide." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 30, 2011, Sounders FC hosted their {{semifinal}} opponent, FC Dallas, {{in front}} of 4,593 at Starfire Sports Complex. [...] Both teams started their first team players for the match. [...] Seattle applied offensive pressure {{for most of the}} first half and broke through with a goal in the 40th minute. [...] Fredy Montero, who had just missed with a bicycle kick shot moments earlier, took a curling left-footed shot {{in front of}} goal for the score. [...] Dallas nearly equalized in the 49th minute when Marvin Chavez had a shot bounce hard off the goal post. [...] Dallas continued to attack for most of the second half, and Chavez again had a chance to equalize just before the final whistle, but his shot went high over the goal. [...] With a final score of 1–0, Seattle secured their third straight appearance in the U.S. Open Cup final match. [...] Following the match, Dallas coach Schellas Hyndman complained about how hosts are determined for U.S. Open Cup matches saying, [...] "for me, {{this is one of the}} best events – the Lamar Hunt Open Cup – but I'd really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> into a structure where it's not a bid system. A bid system is where one team will buy the games because they're bidding higher." [...] He continued, [...] "it could go to the higher seeds, instead of a bid system where you're spending money, or it could be pre-determined. I think that brings out all the fairness to the event." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Song Remains The Same {{is not a}} great film, but there's {{no point}} in making excuses. [...] It's just a {{reasonably}} honest statement of where we were at that particular time.

2500|$|Minister for Justice and Law Reform Dermot Ahern, {{himself from}} Louth, made known his {{condemnation}} of the violence. He attended the match. Taoiseach Brian Cowen also made known his disapproval later from New York: [...] "I didn't see what happened as the ref was leaving the pitch. But obviously none of that is justified. It was an exciting match obviously. But it doesn't justify anyone engaging {{in that sort of}} activity. So I wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> repeated anywhere". Cowen was also at the match.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, the song, and its {{corresponding}} Macarena dance, {{became popular}} {{during the same}} week as the 1996 Democratic National Convention in August that year. C-SPAN filmed Delegates dancing to the song in an afternoon session, which years later became a popular view on YouTube. Vice President Al Gore, having a reputation for stiffness, made a joke about doing the Macarena dance during his speech. He said, [...] "I would like to demonstrate for you the Al Gore version of the Macarena," [...] then remained motionless for a few seconds, and eventually asked, [...] "Would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> again?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 December 2011, The Jerusalem Post {{reported}} that a performance analysis it had obtained shows that Iron Dome was successful in downing rockets from Gaza 75% of the times it fired. It said two interceptors are usually fired at each rocket. In April 2011, for example, the system succeeded in intercepting eight of 10rockets. Following the October violence, the IDF conducted an inquiry into the Iron Dome's performance and discovered that a radar failure caused some of the interceptors to miss their targets, a problem since corrected. An officer told the Post that [...] "seventy-five percent is impressive, but we would still <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> perform better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Songs to Remember {{was finally}} {{released}} in September 1982. In several interviews {{at the time}} of the album's release, Gartside stated his dissatisfaction with Rough Trade's promotion of the record, hinting in one interview that [...] "there's still a lot of problems, as far as I'm concerned, fundamental matters of distribution and economics, promotion, marketing and a bias against their product at radio stations" [...] and in another he complained, [...] "I must say I've been badly disappointed the way RT have handled the past three singles. I dunno, but when you really need that boost, they can't give it to you... I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> generally happen with RT.

2500|$|On June 30, 2013, del Toro {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} developing Hellboy 3 at Legendary Pictures. He stated: [...] "I hate giving pieces about it, but last night, we were at dinner and Ron said, 'I would be very happy to do Hellboy again, when are we doing Hellboy 3? Thomas Tull said, 'I {{would love to see}} Hellboy 3.' He didn't say he would love to do it he just said he'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> but today, I'll ask him." [...] Ron Perlman added his support for the idea, stating: [...] "Not just anybody can make this movie. I loved working for Legendary and I know for Guillermo working on Pacific Rim was one of his greatest experiences. The reason I loved working for them is because Guillermo was so happy. I came in six months into the shoot and he seemed as fresh as a daisy, simply because he was working for someone who appreciated and supported his outlandish visions of what he wanted to put on the screen. My immediate, silent wish was, wouldn't it be great if these guys came in and helped resolve the Hellboy series." ...|$|E
2500|$|Homicide {{case against}} Italian VPD marines: Italy had {{threatened}} to leverage its influence within the Institutions of the European Union to impact relations with India over the ongoing legal wranglings regarding the case of two Italian Navy Marines who India holds responsible for shootings which lead {{to the deaths of}} two Indian fishermen. Federica Mogherini, who was the Italian foreign minister prior to becoming the EUHRVP and head of the European External Affairs Service (EEAS) told the European Parliament in January 2015 that [...] "it's good for everyone to be fully aware of how much of an impact the unresolved dispute of the two Italian Navy officials can have on relations between the EU and India. It is putting them to the test". Italian MEPs led debates in the European Parliament and obtained a resolution condemning India for alleged human-rights violations of the two Italian Navy marines. The legal squibblings over the fate of the two Italian marines compounded already tense bilateral relations following earlier investigations in Italy which revealed that Finmeccanica had made illegal payments in the procurement of a fleet of 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters by the Indian Air Force. The European External Affairs Service (EEAS) decided not respond to repeated Indian queries on dates for the Indian Prime-Minister to visit Brussels. Cesare Onestini, the Political Chargé d'Affaires of the Delegation of the European Union to India said: [...] "No date has been formally proposed to the Indian side." [...] The European Parliament's Chair for the delegation on relations with India, Geoffrey Van Orden, said: [...] "This (Italian Marines issue) should not be a matter which affects relationship between the EU and India. This (the EU-India relationship) is something far larger and wider platform to unite. That is why we have expressed disappointment that the summit has been postponed,". Van Orden added: [...] "We attach importance to imprisonment of citizens of our member states. (...) We do respect the Indian legal process, but think the case has taken too long and would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> expedited. Even so, the European parliament would be very concerned if it had any evidence that the EU-India summit delay {{had anything to do with}} the case of the marines." [...] Vice Chair, Nina Gill cautioned: [...] "I think it would be very regrettable if that (Italian Marines) issue played any part in it,". Italy's bid to prevent the case coming to trial in India (by involving the Catholic church, proposing blood money to the victims, and actively stalling legal proceedings) appears to have hardened India's stance.|$|E

There was another medal, with two clasps, that came to Bayford, and which was looked at in pensive but not unhappy silence.
