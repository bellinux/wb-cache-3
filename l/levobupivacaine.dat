25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and <b>levobupivacaine.</b> Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, <b>levobupivacaine,</b> and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac {{toxicity}} {{associated with}} overdose of intravascular injection of local anesthetic {{is characterized by}} hypotension, atrioventricular conduction delay, idioventricular rhythms, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. Although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period, bupivacaine avidly blocks the cardiac sodium channels, thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias. Even <b>levobupivacaine</b> and ropivacaine (single-enantiomer derivatives), developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects, still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function.|$|E

50|$|Compared to bupivacaine, <b>levobupivacaine</b> is {{associated}} with less vasodilation and has a longer duration of action. It is approximately 13 percent less potent (by molarity) than racemic bupivacaine and has a longer motor block onset time.|$|E

50|$|Like lidocaine, {{bupivacaine}} is an amino-amide anesthetic; the aromatic {{head and}} the hydrocarbon chain are linked by an amide bond rather than an ester as in earlier local anesthetics.

40|$|Abstract: In {{recent years}} <b>levobupivacaine,</b> the pure S (−) -enantiomer of bupivacaine, {{emerged as a}} safer {{alternative}} for regional anesthesia than its racemic parent. It demonstrated less affi nity and strength of depressant effects onto myocardial and central nervous vital centers in pharmacodynamic studies, and a superior pharmacokinetic profi le. Clinically, <b>levobupivacaine</b> is well tolerated {{in a variety of}} regional anesthesia techniques both after bolus administration and continuous postopera-tive infusion. Reports of toxicity with <b>levobupivacaine</b> are scarce and occasional toxic symptoms are usually reversible with minimal treatment with no fatal outcome. Yet, <b>levobupivacaine</b> has not entirely replaced bupivacaine in clinical practice. In anesthesia and analgesia practice, <b>levobupivacaine</b> and bupivacaine produce comparable surgical sensory block with similar adverse side effects, and equal labor pain control with comparable maternal and fetal outcome. The equipotency of the two drugs has been recently questioned, prompting clinicians to increase the dose of <b>levobupivacaine</b> in an attempt to ensure adequate anesthesia and analgesia and offsetting, therefore, the advantages of less motor block with <b>levobupivacaine.</b> In this review we aim to discuss the pharmacological essentials of the safer profi le of <b>levobupivacaine,</b> and analyze the evidence regarding the current clinical indications...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} a prospective, double-blinded study in 20 patients undergoing gynecologic surgery with lower abdominal incision, to investigate characteristics of intrathecal hyperbaric <b>levobupivacaine</b> compared with isobaric <b>levobupivacaine.</b> We randomly assigned them to receive 3 [*]mL of either isobaric or hyperbaric 0. 42 % <b>levobupivacaine</b> intrathecally. We found that hyperbaric <b>levobupivacaine,</b> compared with isobaric <b>levobupivacaine,</b> spread faster to T 10 level (2. 8 ± 1. 1 versus 6. 6 ± 4. 7 minutes, = 0. 039), reached higher sensory block levels at 5 and 15 minutes after injection (T 8 versus L 1, = 0. 011, and T 4 versus T 7, = 0. 027, resp.), {{and had a}} higher peak level (T 4 versus T 8, = 0. 040).

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of <b>levo{{bupivacaine}}</b> and bupivacaine on the contractility of isolated uterine muscle strips from pregnant and non-pregnant female rats. Methods: Full-thick myometrial strips were prepared from 18 - to 21 -day pregnant (n= 8) and non-pregnant rats (n= 7). After contractions became regular, strips were exposed to cumulative concentrations of the two drugs from 10 − 8 to 10 − 4 mol/L, amplitude and frequency of the uterine contraction was recorded. Results: Two local anesthetics caused a concentration dependent inhibition on contractility of myometrial strips from pregnant and non-pregnant rats. In the myometrium from non-pregnant rats, −logIC 					 50 of <b>levobupivacaine</b> and bupivacaine were 4. 85 and 4. 25 respectively. In the myometrium from pregnant rats, similar concentrations of <b>levobupivacaine</b> and bupivacaine were observed, −logIC 					 50 were 2. 7 and 2. 9 respectively. <b>Levobupivacaine</b> produced an increase in amplitude of contractions, while bupivacaine showed an increased trend in frequency. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that <b>levobupivacaine</b> and bupivacaine may inhibit myometrium contractility.

Ten ASA Class I volunteers were studied. Venous blood samples were analysed using a Haemoscope 2000 D TEG analyser. Whole blood, a 50 % saline control and two <b>levobupivacaine</b> solutions (2. 5 mg mL(- 1) and 2. 5 microg mL(- 1) in blood) were compared.

40|$|In {{clinical}} practice, {{using the}} lowest doses of drugs for anesthesia or analgesia {{is the main}} goal. Opioid combinations with local anesthetics can be preferable for achieving adequate anesthesia or analgesia. The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to examine possible thermal antinociceptive effects of the opioid –fentanyl and the amide local anesthetics <b>levobupivacaine</b> and lidocaine when locally administered alone or in combination. The paw withdrawal latencies to noxious thermal stimuli in rats were measured to assess the antinociceptive actions of drugs after subcutaneous intraplantar injection into the hind paw. All drugs examined in this study produced dose- and time-dependent increases in the paw withdrawal latencies. Fentanyl is approximately 125 and 500 times more potent than <b>levobupivacaine</b> and lidocaine, respectively. At the same dose, the antinociceptive potency of <b>levobupivacaine</b> was 3. 6 -fold higher than that of lidocaine. Co-injection of the lowest doses of <b>levobupivacaine</b> and lidocaine dramatically increased the paw withdrawal latency. However, in the presence of fentanyl, the effects of <b>levobupivacaine</b> and lidocaine were different. Although co-injection of <b>levobupivacaine</b> with fentanyl both enhanced and prolonged antinociceptive action, the lidocaine-fentanyl combination did not significantly change the paw withdrawal latency.

However, the efficacy of <b>levobupivacaine</b> in ABPB has not been studied much. We performed a prospective, double-blinded study to compare the clinical effect of 0. 375 % <b>levobupivacaine</b> with 0. 5 % <b>levobupivacaine</b> for ultrasound (US) -guided ABPB with nerve stimulation. Methods: Forty patients undergoing elective upper limb surgery were randomized into two groups: Group I (0. 375 % <b>levobupivacaine)</b> and Group II (0. 5 % <b>levobupivacaine).</b> All four main terminal nerves of the brachial plexus were blocked separately with 7 ml of <b>levobupivacaine</b> using US guidance with nerve stimulation according to study group.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess if perineural {{administration}} of dexmedetomidine combined with <b>levobupivacaine</b> increases the duration of the sensory and motor blockade of a sciatic peripheral nerve block in rats. MethodsForty male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 experimental groups: Group 1, sham; Group 2, perineural <b>levobupivacaine</b> (0. 2 mL of a 0. 5 % solution) and subcutaneous saline; Group 3, perineural <b>levobupivacaine</b> (0. 2 mL of a 0. 5 % solution) plus dexmedetomidine (20 µg/kg dexmedetomidine) and subcutaneous saline; Group 4, perineural saline and subcutaneous dexmedetomidine; and Group 5, perineural saline and subcutaneous saline. Pain reflexes in response to a thermal stimulus were measured at 0 and 240 minutes after drug administration by using a hot-plate and tail-flick tests. Neurobehavioral status, including sensory and motor functions, was assessed by an investigator who was blinded to the experimental groups every 30 minutes until normal functioning resumed. ResultsThe sensory and motor blockades of the rats did not increase in the treatment with dexmedetomidine plus <b>levobupivacaine</b> when compared with the treatment with <b>levobupivacaine</b> alone at all the time points (P > 0. 05). Compared with rats in Group 2, those in Group 3 showed significantly higher latency times at 30 and 60 minutes in the hot plate test (P < 0. 01). At 30 and 60 minutes, the latency times of the rats in Group 3 were longer than those in Group 2 in the tail-flick test (P < 0. 01). Furthermore, the durations of the complete sensory and motor blockade were similar when treatment with <b>levobupivacaine</b> plus dexmedetomidine was compared with treatment with <b>levobupivacaine</b> alone.

40|$|In this study, {{effects of}} the long-acting amide-type local {{anesthetic}} <b>levobupivacaine</b> on axonal conduction and excitability parameters of the rat sciatic nerve were thoroughly examined both in vitro and in vivo. In order to deduce its effects on isolated nerve conduction, compound nerve action potential (CNAP) recordings were performed using the suction method over sciatic nerves of Wistar rats before and after administration of 0. 05 % (1. 7 mmol L– 1) <b>levobupivacaine.</b> <b>Levobupivacaine</b> caused complete CNAP area and amplitude depression by blocking conduction in a time-dependent manner. To assess the influence of <b>levobupivacaine</b> on in vivo excitability properties, threshold-tracking (TT) protocols were performed at sciatic nerves of rats injected with perineural 0. 05 % (1. 7 mmol L– 1) <b>levobupivacaine</b> or vehicle alone. Charge-duration TT results revealed that <b>levobupivacaine</b> increases the rheobase and decreases the strength-duration time constant, suggesting interference of the anesthetic {{with the opening of}} Na+ channels. Twenty and 40 % threshold electrotonus curves were found for both groups to follow the same paths, suggesting no significant effect of <b>levobupivacaine</b> on K+ channels for either the fastest or relatively slow conducting fibers. Current-threshold relationship results revealed no significant effect on axonal rectifying channels. However, according to the results of the recovery cycle protocol yielding the pattern of excitability changes following the impulse, potential deviation was found in the recovery characteristics of Na+ channels from the absolute refractory period. Consequently, conduction blockage caused by <b>levobupivacaine</b> may not be due to the passive (capacitive) properties of axon or the conductance of potassium channels but to the decrease in sodium channel conductance...|$|E

40|$|The {{quest for}} searching newer and safer {{anesthetic}} agents {{has always been}} one of the primary needs in anesthesiology practice. <b>Levobupivacaine,</b> the pure S (−) -enantiomer of bupivacaine, has strongly emerged as a safer alternative for regional anesthesia than its racemic sibling, bupivacaine. <b>Levobupivacaine</b> {{has been found to be}} equally efficacious as bupivacaine, but with a superior pharmacokinetic profile.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was designed as a prospective randomised double-blind study enrolling a total of 60 female patients (age group- 20 - 40 years) belonging to ASA grade I and II. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 30 patients in each group. The Group-LF received <b>levobupivacaine</b> 10 mg (2 mL) + fentanyl 20 mcg (0. 4 mL) and Group-LN received <b>levobupivacaine</b> 10 mg (2 mL) + normal saline (0. 4 mL). Characteristics of spinal block, Apgar score, vital parameter variations and complications were recorded. RESULTS In Group LF, onset of action was faster in relation to sensory and motor blockade as compared to Group LN. Two segment regression of sensory block and duration of motor block were prolonged with addition of fentanyl to <b>levobupivacaine.</b> Addition of fentanyl to intrathecal <b>levobupivacaine,</b> prolonged duration of sensory and motor block with faster onset of sensory and motor block with better quality as compared to <b>levobupivacaine.</b> Statistically, no significant difference was observed in mean Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes.

Lower doses of <b>levobupivacaine</b> and bupivacaine had opposite effects on NMDA-induced seizures. At doses of 5 mg/kg, <b>levobupivacaine</b> increased the latency to partial seizures and prevented the occurrence of generalized seizures, whereas bupivacaine decreased the latency to partial seizures and did not influence the development of generalized seizures. in in vitro experiments, we exposed primary cultures of mouse cortical cells, containing both neurons and astrocytes, to 100 mu M NMDA for 10 min for the induction of excitotoxic neuronal death. This treatment killed 70 - 80 % of the neuronal population, as assessed 24 h after the excitotoxic pulse. In this particular model, both <b>levobupivacaine</b> and bupivacaine were neuroprotective against NMDA toxicity. However, neuroprotection by <b>levobupivacaine</b> was seen at lower concentrations (with respect to bupivacaine) and was maintained at concentrations of 3 mM, which are {{much higher than the}} plasma security threshold for the drug in vivo. In contrast, no protection against NMDA toxicity was detected when 3 mM concentrations of bupivacaine were applied to the cultures. Our data show a better neurotoxic profile of <b>levobupivacaine</b> as compared to racemic bupivacaine, and are indicative of a safer profile of <b>levobupivacaine</b> in clinical practice.

40|$|Background: <b>Levobupivacaine</b> is an {{effective}} local anesthetic agent with less systemic toxicity than racemic bupivacaine, but it has short postoperative analgesic duration. Dexmedetomidine and fentanyl are promising adjuncts to provide excellent and prolonged postoperative caudal analgesia. This study compared the effects of caudal <b>levobupivacaine</b> plus dexmedetomidine and <b>levobupivacaine</b> plus fentanyl for postoperative analgesia and sedation in children undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery. Patients and Methods: Ninety children, whose age ranged from 1 to 7 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II, undergoing orthopedic lower limb surgery under general anesthesia received caudal block for postoperative analgesia. The children were randomly allocated into three groups: Group L (control) received 0. 75 ml/kg <b>levobupivacaine</b> 0. 25 % diluted in saline; Group LD received 0. 75 ml/kg <b>levobupivacaine</b> 0. 25 % with dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg; and Group LF received 0. 75 ml/kg <b>levobupivacaine</b> 0. 25 % with fentanyl 1 μg/kg. Following {{the administration of the}} drugs; hemodynamic variables, the total anesthesia time, sedation score, Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability score, duration of analgesia, and side effects were recorded. Results: Demographically, all the groups were comparable, both the baseline and the intraoperative hemodynamic profile were similar in all groups. The mean duration of analgesia and the mean sedation score in the Group LD were significantly greater as compared to both the other groups. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine may be a better additive to <b>levobupivacaine</b> than fentanyl for caudal postoperative analgesia, arousable sedation with comparable hemodynamic and side effect profile in children...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. We {{aimed to}} assess the effects of <b>levobupivacaine</b> and of <b>levobupivacaine</b> + {{adrenaline}} administered during pediatric tonsillectomy on the postoperative period. Methods. A total of 90 patients {{between the ages of}} five and twelve were divided randomly into two groups before tonsillectomy: <b>levobupivacaine</b> only (0. 5 %) 0. 4 [*]mg·kg− 1 or <b>levobupivacaine</b> (0. 5 %) 0. 4 [*]mg·kg− 1 + adrenaline (1 [*]:[*] 200. 000) administered by means of peritonsillar infiltration. Primary outcomes were postoperative pain scores recorded at various intervals until 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), time to first oral intake, time to the first administration of analgesics and total consumption of analgesics, and the amount of bleeding for all children. Results. In both groups, patients had the same postoperative pain scores and PONV rates, and equal amounts of analgesics were consumed up to 24 hours postoperatively. The two groups also had the same time until first oral intake, recovery time and time to the first analgesic request, and amount of bleeding. Conclusions. Perioperative <b>levobupivacaine</b> infiltration on its own is a valid alternative to the combination of <b>levobupivacaine</b> + adrenaline for perioperative and postoperative effectiveness in pediatric tonsillectomy.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundFollowing {{maternal}} administration, {{local anesthetics}} pass into breast milk. In the present study, we aimed {{to compare the}} passage of <b>levobupivacaine</b> and bupivacaine into breast milk following epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. MethodsA total of 20 women undergoing elective cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia were randomized to receive either 0. 5 % <b>levobupivacaine</b> or 0. 5 % racemic bupivacaine via an epidural catheter. Immediately before and 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after administration of epidural local anesthetic, maternal blood and breast milk samples were taken simultaneously. Drug concentrations in plasma and milk were determined via high-performance liquid chromatography. The infant’s drug exposure was determined by calculating milk/plasma ratios of <b>levobupivacaine</b> and bupivacaine. ResultsBoth <b>levobupivacaine</b> and bupivacaine were detected in breast milk 30 min after epidural administration. Concentrations of both agents showed constant and similar decreases in milk and plasma and were nearly undetectable at 24 h. The milk/plasma ratios were 0. 34 ± 0. 13 for <b>levobupivacaine</b> and 0. 37 ± 0. 14 for bupivacaine. ConclusionsBoth <b>levobupivacaine</b> and bupivacaine pass into breast milk following epidural administration. The concentration of both drugs was approximately three times lower in breast milk than in maternal plasma...|$|E
