The {{document}} includes <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> from panel chairman Lloyd Evans to TAC Chairman, Ralph Cummings, and from Cummings to the Chairman of the CGIAR. A summary of TAC comments and recommendations is appended. The report was discussed at TAC's Twenty first meeting in February 1979, and by the CGIAR in May of that year. The report discussed {{the mandate of the}} center, and each of its programs: cereals (sorghum and millet), pulses (chickpea and pigeon pea), groundnuts, farming systems, and economics. It also analyzed supporting programs, training activities cooperative programs in India and Africa, technology transfer, and the management of the center. The panel made a number of recommendations, including giving higher priority to yield improvement rather than protein content and quality; strengthening the sorghum program in West Africa; adoption of a long term objective of helping India develop its national program in chickpea research; integration of pigeon pea research into the Indian program; closer collaboration with IITA on soils research, and training for African scientists; and the formulation of a long term plan for ICRISAT's African activities...|$|R

Whether millions or billions <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> DNA, its <b>transmission</b> across generations confers the principal medium for inheritance of organismal traits. Several emerging areas of research demonstrate that this definition is an oversimplification. Here, we explore ways in which a deeper understanding of genomic diversity and cell physiology is challenging the concepts of physical permanence attached to the genome as well as its role as the sole information source for an organism...|$|R
50|$|The NoMo1 link was {{initially}} named Tunny (for tunafish), a name which {{went on to}} be used both for the Lorenz SZ40/42 machines and for the Bletchley Park analogues of them. The NoMo1 link was subsequently renamed Codfish. A large number of Tunny links were monitored by the Y-station at Knockholt and given names of fish. Most of these were between the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command, OKW) in Berlin and German army commands throughout occupied Europe. Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher at Bletchley Park, assisted initially by a machine called Heath Robinson and later by the Colossus computers yielded {{a great deal of}} valuable high-level intelligence.Tunny decrypts provided high-grade intelligence in an unprecedented quality. Walter Jacobs, a US Army codebreaker who worked at Bletchley Park, wrote in an official report on the operation to break Tunny that in March 1945 alone 'upward <b>of</b> five million <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> current <b>transmission,</b> containing intelligence <b>of</b> the highest order, were deciphered'.|$|R

Second, if {{the size of the}} alphabet of the covertext source and its minentropy tend to infinity then the the number of bits of hidden text per <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> covertext tends to log(n!) /n where n is the (fixed) size of blocks used for hidden text encoding.

40|$|The <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> credit as {{a method}} of {{smoothing}} international payment is a conditional security and obligation to pay the customer bank (issuing bank) to seller (applicant). For this purpose, the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit may be considered as the most usual method of payment of goods price in international trade. The classic form <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit is the commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit whose financial obligation is rooted in the documents that demonstrates the making of transaction by the beneficiary and it is used as a mechanism of payment and financial security in international transaction of goods.
