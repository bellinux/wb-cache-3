40|$|Working with <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men is {{a largely}} {{neglected}} area {{of social work}} practice. This book provides social workers and other professionals with an overview {{of a number of}} key challenges and concerns that play a significant part in the lives of <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men. Despite positive changes in legislation, social work can still fail {{to meet the needs of}} <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men, <b>and</b> remains a marginalised area in practice, research and teaching. This book promotes an understanding of these issues and proposes ideas for social work practice that are inclusive of <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men in assessment and the provision of services...|$|R
40|$|Attitudes towards <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> {{men have}} become {{important}} issues both politically and socially as {{the topic of}} sexual orientation becomes less taboo throughout society.

5|$|The {{news media}} split in its {{reaction}} to Manning's request; some organizations used the new name and pronouns, and others {{continued to use}} the former ones. Advocacy groups such as GLAAD, the National <b>Lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gay</b> Journalists Association, and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) encouraged media outlets to refer to Manning by her self-identified name and pronoun.|$|E
5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E
5|$|In Hall's time, Paris {{was known}} for having a {{relatively}} large and visible gay and lesbian community– in part because France, unlike England, had no laws against male homosexuality. Marcel Proust's novels continued in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, {{at the urging of}} her friend Jonathan Brockett– who may be based on Noël Coward– she has not yet spoken about her inversion to anyone. Brockett, acting as tour guide, hints at a secret history of inversion in the city by referring to Marie Antoinette's rumoured relationship with the Princesse de Lamballe.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E

40|$|The {{legacy of}} the first twenty years of the Charter for <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men is a {{contradictory}} one of victories and defeats. At the level of doctrine, strategy, and politics, both the victories and defeats have been precarious and contradictory. While gaining formal equality rights, <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men {{have not been able}} to secure rights to sexual freedom. And while formal equality has displaced the heteronormativity that denied legal recognition <b>and</b> subjectivity to <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men, this formal equality has come at a cost. <b>Lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men are being reconstituted in law: some are being newly constituted as legal citizens while others are being re-inscribed as outlaws. The first twenty years of the Charter is a legacy of transgression and normalization; these new legal subjects are both challenging dominant modes of legal subjectivity and its insistence of heterosexuality, while being absorbed into them...|$|R
