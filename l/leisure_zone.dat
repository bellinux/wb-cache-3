40|$|Dissertação de mestrado integrado em Arquitectura (área de especialização em Cidade e Território) This present work {{emerged from}} the {{ambition}} to propose an architectural intervention in the remarkable landscape of Ermelo, {{mainly because of the}} potentialities of contemplation and enjoyment that its outstanding character offers to any project that intents to enclosure in it, but also for the personal unrest motivated by the way that it’s being currently appropriated. Consequently, when associating the new tourist trend of demanding natural places for leisure to the increasing knowledge and search of one of the biggest Europe waterfalls found on the village in question, it appeared to be coherent the conclusion that this landscape needed an intervention adjusted to its character as a way to prevent certain future discontents. Despite its inclusion in a natural park, the selected area is described as a strongly humanized landscape that lost its ancestral supremacy, gathering today a population mainly senior. Its proximity to urban centers intensifies the damaging human concentration, that tends to be aggravated as it becomes more known and its accesses are improved. These are facts that had defined the tourist activity in rural space as a subject to be developed. Therefore as an approach to support the visitation, on the <b>leisure</b> <b>zones</b> that suffer a bigger concentration during summertime a few structures were proposed and on the urban area some constructions were redirected to the practice of Tourism in rural space. Both these complementary parts react to the number of visitors who travel to appreciate and enjoy the beauty of a landscape that is integrated in a protected area and intent to contribute to the usefulness of this chosen territory in a disciplined and particular approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) {{has taken a}} leap in the past decade. Under strong influence of improved Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industries, automotive suppliers and scientific institutes have put much effort on developing a range of ICT based applications for vehicles to drive safer, more comfortable, to make more efficient use of current and future infrastructure and to manage fleets more accurately. These improvements in transport services might improve the attractiveness of nearby locations. These locations (office, residential, <b>leisure</b> <b>zones</b> etcetera), might attract more activity as they appear to benefit from increased accessibility. Therefore, the expectation that ITS concepts will, in the long term, have significant spatial effect on the location pattern of, in particular, office keeping organisations, is plausible. This paper focuses {{on the impact of}} ITS concepts on location preferences of office keeping organisations. To measure this impact a stated preference experiment has been conducted in the Netherlands and involves office keeping organisations in selected city regions. The paper describes the first results of a model describing the attractiveness of location profiles, which are based on location preference attributes, and the role of ITS in these profiles. Three ITS concepts, which are selected and based on previous research are introduced as ‘new’ attributes within the location profiles. The estimated model was used to test two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that the introduction of these ITS attributes will change the preferences of office keeping organisations regarding locations. The second hypothesis is that if preferences will change, the ITS attributes have a significant contribution to the preference model; at least for some categories of organisations. Further, the paper describes in what cases we should accept or reject these hypotheses. Finally, some conclusions are drawn on the role of ITS in location attractiveness and the validation tools which are available to validate the preference model. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{intensive}} {{process of}} metropolization in the Northeast of Brazil {{is associated with}} the attendance of demand for leisure activities in coastal areas.

5000|$|The term Disaster Tourism is {{used for}} <b>leisure</b> travels to <b>zones</b> whipped by natural {{disasters}} or traumatic events known as [...] "traumascapes". Some scholars argue that these sites offers a message to visitors and tourists {{in order for them}} to interpret their own life. Disaster tourism offers a pedagogical instrument to community to accelerate the time in post recovery process. Rodanthi Tzanelli, lecturer at University of Leeds called the attention to the needs to articulate trans-disciplinary research to understand Thana Tourism or Disaster Tourism. Recently, philosopher Maximiliano Korstanje coined the term Thana-Capitalism to refer to a climate of social Darwinism aimed at fostering the Survival of the Strongest. In this climate of struggle, only few win and the rest loses. It explains our obsessions for consumers' news or images related to terrorism attacks, trauma-scapes, disasters and so forth. Korstanje writes that the society of risk has set the pace to a new society Thana Capitalism, where the main commodity is death. Not only we consume death everywhere in cultural entertainment industry, but we reinforce our superiority by witnessing the others' suffering. This allegory is based on the myths of Noah's ark which is considered by Korstanje as the first genocide. In this mythical event God divided the world in two, victims and witnesses. This logic of supremacy of those who live over deads is reinforced by Christ's crucifixion. Nowadays, a new segment of tourists travel to zones of mass death known as areas of Dark or Thana Tourism. Since in secularized societies death is a sign of weakness, consuming the other´s death alludes to hopes for visitors to be in trace towards “the hall of chosen peoples”.|$|R

The (1) main road, (2) Ta-Kang # 1 hiking trail, (3) public facilities, (4) and properties of residents were damaged. The objectives {{of this study}} were to (1) explore the environmental and human factors influencing the occurrence of soil and water disasters, (2) investigate the watershed conservation problems and propose countermeasures for reducing the possibility of the disaster occurrence in the future. This study investigated soil erosion, landslide, road construction, and slope conservation problems and propose countermeasures aimed at these problems in accordance with sustainable development guiding. Then, analyzing the future vision of watershed sustainable development and propose suitable landuse planning. Local residents can be trained to help soil and water conservation projects. This will allow them to make efforts to protect their own homes, at the same time achieve the objective of promoting community awareness. The secondary agricultural roads can use permeable pavement design. Slopeland conservation measures include (1) set up irrigation reservoirs to avoid water waste, (2) reduce improper landuse problems in accordance with the slope conservation and the soil and water conservation laws, (3) remove the abandoned farmhouse and planting vanilla herbs on the abandoned agricultural land to reduce the mosquito nuisance and also control provide education opportunities of vanilla herbs, (4) set up artificial wetlands and grasslands ditch to achieve effective water purification. Four landuse zones were planned for Tu-Di-Gong Creek Watershed sustainable development strategies. These four landuse zones are (1) Agricultural Production <b>Zone,</b> (2) <b>Leisure</b> Agriculture <b>Zone,</b> (3) Hydrophilic Activities and Ecological Teaching Zone, (4) Natural Forests and Ecological Tourism Zone.

40|$|In {{recent years}} Vauxhall in south London has been {{transformed}} and rebranded as an urban <b>leisure</b> <b>zone</b> for gay men. Disused railway arches and warehouses have been converted into nightclubs and a significant night-time economy has developed rivalling Soho's existing gay village. However, with its commodified forms of public sex {{and high levels of}} recreational drug use, Vauxhall's club scene looks rather different from the British gay villages of the 1990 s. This article examines how the area's nightlife entrepreneurs have capitalised on the recent liberalisation of licensing laws while drawing on the historical associations with the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens (1660 - 1859) in attempts to market the area as a site of embedded hedonism. Overall, the aesthetic and cultural themes of Vauxhall's club scene seem to contradict earlier assumptions about the desexualisation and sanitisation of contemporary gay culture. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} CCTV (closed circuit television) in the surveillance, policing and control of public space in urban and rural locations, specifically {{in relation to the}} use of public space by young people. The use of CCTV technology in public spaces is now an established and largely uncontested feature of everyday life in a number of countries and the assertion that they are essentially there for the protection of law abiding and consuming citizens has broadly gone unchallenged. With little or no debate in the U. K. to critique the claims made by the burgeoning security industry that CCTV protects people {{in the form of a}} ‘Big Friend’, the state at both central and local levels has endorsed the installation of CCTV apparatus across the nation. Some areas assert in their promotional material that the centre of the shopping and <b>leisure</b> <b>zone</b> is fully surveilled by cameras in order to reassure visitors that their personal safety is a matter of civic concern, with even small towns and villages expending monies on sophisticated and expensive to maintain camera systems. It is within a context of monitoring, recording and control procedures that young people’s use of public space is constructed as a threat to social order, in need of surveillance and exclusion which forms a major and contemporary feature in shaping thinking about urban and rural working class young people in the U. K. As Loader (1996) notes, young people’s claims on public space rarely gain legitimacy if ‘colliding’ with those of local residents, and Davis (1990) describes the increasing ‘militarization and destruction of public space’, while Jacobs (1965) asserts that full participation in the ‘daily life of urban streets’ is essential to the development of young people and beneficial for all who live in an area. This paper challenges the uncritical acceptance of widespread use of CCTV and identifies its oppressive and malevolent potential in forming a ‘surveillance gaze’ over young people (adapting Foucault’s ‘clinical gaze’c. 1973) which can jeopardise mental health and well being in coping with the ‘metropolis’, after Simmel, (1964). ...|$|E
40|$|Studio Capital Region {{focuses on}} the {{challenges}} in the urban nodes of global networks, which {{could be part of}} centralized, decentralized or distributed structures. Despite its immediate association to governmental/administrative cities, Capital Region is a framework to undertake a comprehensive research into the spatial issues in the leading, transforming and/or emergent urban centres with their hinterland in the globalized networks of growth, sprawl, accumulation and even counter-urbanization. Within this framework, the city {{is considered to be a}} fundamental object of architecture. Hence, architectural production is considered to be a projection to the “project of the city” at large. The studio aims at investigating the latencies of architectural strategies by focusing on the site-specific situations conditioned by the mentioned complexity of capital regions. ” Within this framework of the design studio, the case of State Farm founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1925 portrays an actual urban potential that currently lies in the very centre of capital city of Turkey, Ankara. The State Farm was meant to portray the ambitions of modernization project of the country by creating an epitome of scientific agricultural production, industry and leisure annexed to the newly founded capital city’s urban desires. However, the idealism of nature as a complimentary binary to the urban order of the city was shattered by the pressure of rapid growth of the city starting from 1950 ’s. Because of the migration of masses of labour to the city after 1950 ’s and especially 1980 ’s, the city that was planned for 600. 000 inhabitants has reached the population of 4, 5 million in a couple of decades. Consequently, the State Farm Land also lost its role by becoming literally surrounded by urban settlements and being fragmented by land speculations. However, with the critical framework reflecting on the utopian basis of the project of modernity, I see the actual condition of the State Farm as a temporal projection on its initial ambitions, as it needs to be realigned with the changing demands of the society and the conditions of urban growth. Yet, it’s also fact that the city of Ankara also needs a review of those initial desires of urban speculation and growth to be brought in harmony with the urgency of re-establishing an urban ecology, which is also jeopardized by the degeneration of the public space due to the dominance of the transportation system by heavy prominence of private cars in the traffic. In Ankara, the changes in the economical and political patterns have resulted in an extremely fast growth of the population, which has manifested itself in a monotone urban sprawl, lacking diverse public program. The traditional idea of the city with its dense public centre with dwelling around is not valid anymore. The city needs accessible, low threshold public spaces and programs, as a line through the city. The state farm was the first example of transformation of agriculture by using scientific methods and modern technology. But today this area does not fulfil its purpose anymore, and has lost its meaning. Its purpose was to create a new society by bringing together, modern agricultural and industrial production techniques, combining them with leisure activities and developing an urban farm. This idea didn’t last very long, because of the changing society, behaviours and economy. The temporality of this vision is obvious when we look at the current state of the city. It has lost the quality of living in harmony with nature and also the idea of conquering nature and making it part of daily life. The city, which was meant to be a garden city, finally became a car city. This is why it’s meaningful to focus on the natural artefacts and re-qualify these. The main theme of the project is Utopia as a temporal projection. In my opinion it’s only valid for a certain period of time because of the changing society and the changing needs. It’s an illusion to think that a utopian projection lasts forever; therefore, I propose a model for temporal desires. The theme of temporality is translated into a spine of urban ecology that can facilitate many public and infrastructural programs in combination. One of the strategies applied to provide low threshold public spaces and improve the life quality in Ankara was to utilize the Ankara River as the armature or the spine of my proposal to enhance the public life on the green grounds of State Farm in the middle of the Anatolian steppe land. The unfolding of public programs on this spine will provide the city with an integral backbone of <b>leisure</b> <b>zone</b> stretched out along the east-west core of the city. Ankara River is a small river that runs through the city. Because of long time exposure to sewage and industrial pollutants, it is no longer viable as a water source for irrigation. The river splits Ankara almost in half and crosses through many neighbourhoods and the city’s lowlands. There are many bridges built over it throughout the city and in some instances it is completely covered and encased in a tunnel. The proposed plan is to re-qualify the riverbed of Ankara and adopt it as a backbone of diverse public programs to utilize it both as a social and ecological infrastructure for the city. Therefore, the scarce resource of water is used as the main organizing element for providing diverse programming to the city. This is done by widening the river for more infiltration and by installing a geo-membrane on the riverbed so the water doesn’t sink into the ground and stops the flow. Along the river, constructed wetlands need to be created to clean the water of the river, and the storm water. The constructed wetlands function as decentralized water treatment plants which constantly clean the water of the river and decrease substantially the pollution by the city. The clean water will then be used to create lakes. The lakes are combined with different public programs. For example the first lake, which is closest to the city centre is combined with a beach as the main program. Like the river, the beach has been approached as a spine with different programs connected to it. This ecology functions as a concert beach, with a rock centre as the main program; because of the many emerging rock bands and the lack of a suitable place where they can perform. Similar to the urban proposal and the beach, the design of the rock centre is conceived as a compact and functional armature, which allows for diverse spatial quality of the design. This building works as the proof of concept of architecture as the generator of social events and also exhibits the pursuit to create architectural singularities within the urban program. The goal of this way of dealing with the project of the city is to create a master plan for improving the quality of the public life as well as the water quality and ecological diversity of the city.
