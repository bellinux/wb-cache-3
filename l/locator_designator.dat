5000|$|The {{principal}} {{equipment on}} the FISTV is the Ground/Vehicular Laser <b>Locator</b> <b>Designator</b> (G/VLLD), pronounced [...] "glid". This device obtains precise range {{information to a}} lased target. When combined with directional control from an inertial navigation system and vehicle coordinates from the Global Positioning System, the system is able to obtain precise coordinates of a designated target.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, Simulaser Corporation {{was founded}} by two {{entrepreneur}} engineers and began operations near Los Angeles to develop [...] "Advanced MILES" [...] training systems. Under initial contracts from Sandia National Labs, Simulaser produced standard MILES replacement laser transmitters and man-worn detector systems as well as [...] "Advanced MILES" [...] devices that incorporated player identification and scoring systems. These Advanced MILES systems made use of the CMOS 146800-series embedded controllers that had just become available at that time. The systems interleaved unique player identification codes within the weapon code bits transmitted by the laser, which were then stored by the receiver system of any player that was hit. Those systems utilized a controller gun to initialize each player, thus preventing players from [...] "resurrecting" [...] themselves by re-inserting the yellow weapon key. Each player's data was stored in memory until downloaded by the controller unit {{at the conclusion of}} the training exercise. Simulaser made use of hybrid microcircuits to reduce the size of certain components and eliminated the electronic module on the back of the helmet to improve player comfort. Simulaser also manufactured laser detector components and systems for vehicle applications sold to Sandia Labs and EG&G Inc., the operations and maintenance contractor at Kirtland AFB for use in training guards and couriers. Simulaser was acquired by Applied Solar Energy Corp. (ASEC, City of Industry, CA), its major supplier of silicon detectors, in 1984. Later, under contract from Fairchild-Weston Systems, Simulaser produced the laser and detector systems for the AGES/ADII (Air-to-Ground Engagement System/Air Defense II) program for the US Army, outfitting a number of helicopters with training systems and producing laser simulators for the HGSS/GVLLD (Hellfire Ground Support System Simulator/Ground-based Vehicle Laser <b>Locator</b> <b>Designator).</b> Simulaser also produced the early low rate of production run of MITS (Multiple Independent Target System) and in 1989 won a development contract from the US Army for STOM (Shoot-through Obscuration Miles) that utilized long-wavelength lasers instead of semiconductor lasers in order to penetrate battlefield obscurants. Late in 1989, Simulaser was awarded a $35 million production contract for standard MILES gear, subsequently increased to $44 million, following which Loral Electro-Optical Systems, Inc., acquired the business of Simulaser from ASEC in October 1989, after which Simulaser ceased to exist..|$|E
