40|$|There is {{a long-standing}} {{debate on the}} role of genetic factors {{influencing}} homosexuality. Recently, CamperioCiani, Corna, and Capiluppi (2004) suggested that genetic factors that are partly <b>linked</b> to the <b>X-chromosome</b> and that influence homosexual orientation in males are not selected against because they increase fecundity in female carriers, thus offering a solution to the Darwinian paradox and an explanation of why natural selection does not progressively eliminate homosexuals. Since then, newdata have emerged suggesting not only an increase inmaternal fecundity but also larger paternal family sizes for homosexuals. This study examined the family trees of 250 male probands, of which 152 were homosexuals. The results confirmed the study of Camperio Ciani et al. (2004). We observed a significant fecundity increase even in primiparous mothers, which was not evident in the previous study. No evidence of increased paternal fecundity was found; thus, our data confirmed a sexually antagonistic inheritance partly <b>linked</b> to the <b>X-chromosome</b> that promotes fecundity in females and a homosexual sexual orientation in males...|$|R

The embryonic tolerance of C 57 BL/ 6 J is greater than and dominant to that of A/J; two or three loci, possibly with independent effects, appear to explain the variability.

Neither antigen receptor (Ig) crosslinking nor stimulation of B-cells with phorbol ester or H 2 O 2 affected Btk/PKCμ interaction. GST precipitation analysis revealed association of the Btk pleckstrin/Tec homology domain with PKCμ. Transient overexpression of PKCμ deletion mutants as well as expression of selected PKCμ domains in 293 T cells revealed that both the kinase domain and the regulatory C 1 region are independently capable of binding to the Btk PH-TH domain.

40|$|Background: Fabry {{disease is}} a rare <b>X-chromosome</b> <b>linked</b> disease. Due to gene mutation, {{activity}} of enzyme α galactosidase A is lowered or absent and sphingolipids are deposited in different organ cells. All males with gene mutation are affected but females too, due to X chromosome inactivation, can frequently be affected as well, although usually to a lesser extend.

Although the knowledge of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms is still at an early stage, a modulation of endothelial cell (EC) activity has already been proven to comprise a key element in the therapeutic effects of LD-RT [6]. For instance, a hampered adhesion of peripheral blood mononuclear (monocytes, lymphocytes) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulo-cytes) to EC was shown to result from an elevated secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth fac-tor β 1 (TGF-β 1), elevated levels of <b>X-chromosome</b> <b>linked</b> inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) DNA-binding and tran-scriptional activity [7 - 10].

40|$|Whilst {{many studies}} show sex {{differences}} in cerebral asymmetry, their mechanisms are still unknown. This report describes {{the potential impact of}} sex hormones and sex chromosomes by comparing MR data from 39 male and 47 female controls and 33 men with an extra X-chromosome (47,XXY) Methods: Regional asymmetry in grey and white matter volumes (GMV and WMV) was calculated using voxel based moprhometry (SPM 5), by contrasting the unflipped and flipped individual GMV and WMV images. In addition, structural volumes were calculated for the thalamus, caudate, putamen, amygdala, and hippocampus, using the FreeSurfer software. Effects of plasma testosterone and estrogen on the GMV and WMV, as well on the right/left ratios of the subcortical volumes were tested by multi-regression analysis. Results: All three groups showed a leftward asymmetry in the motor cortex and the planum temporale, and a rightward asymmetry of the middle occipital cortex. Both asymmetries were more pronounced in 46,XY males than 46,XX females and 47,XXY males, and were positively correlated with testosterone levels. There was also a rightward asymmetry of the vermis and leftward asymmetry in the cerebellar hemispheres in all groups. Notably, cerebellar asymmetries were larger in 46,XX females and 47,XXY males, but were not related to sex hormone levels. No asymmetry differences between 46,XX females and 47,XXY males, and no overall effects of brain size were detected. Conclusion: The asymmetry in the planum temporale area and the occipital cortex seem related to processes associated with testosterone, whereas the observed cerebellar asymmetries suggest a <b>link</b> with <b>X-chromosome</b> escapee genes. Sex differences in cerebral asymmetry are moderated by sex hormones and X-chromosome genes, in a regionally differentiated manner...|$|R
40|$|Physiological and {{pathophysiological}} stress attenuates global translation via phosphorylation of eIF 2 α. This in turn {{leads to}} the reprogramming of gene expression that is required for adaptive stress response. One class of cellular messenger RNAs whose translation {{was reported to be}} insensitive to eIF 2 α phosphorylation-mediated repression of translation is that harboring an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). IRES-mediated translation of several apoptosis-regulating genes increases in response to hypoxia, serum deprivation or gamma irradiation and promotes tumor cell survival and chemoresistance. However, the molecular mechanism that allows IRES-mediated translation to continue in an eIF 2 α-independent manner is not known. Here we have used the <b>X-chromosome</b> <b>linked</b> Inhibitor of Apoptosis, XIAP, IRES to address this question. Using toeprinting assay, western blot analysis and polysomal profiling we show that the XIAP IRES supports cap-independent translation when eIF 2 α is phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo.

Specifically, male M-cell pathway dominance is connected back to motion mediated activities like hunting and the throwing of projectiles. Female P-cell dominance is tied to foraging for plants, a task requiring discrimination between colors and memory of form. Color is particularly important in foraging, as discrimination between colors aids in identifying a ripe piece of fruit from the greenery around it.

Distinct cell types differ in the mechanisms by which the 'death receptor' FAS triggers their apoptosis. In type I cells, such as lymphocytes, activation of 'effector caspases' by FAS-induced activation of caspase- 8 suffices for cell killing, whereas in type II cells, including hepatocytes and pancreatic beta-cells, caspase cascade amplification through caspase- 8 -mediated activation of the pro-apoptotic BCL- 2 family member BID (BH 3 interacting domain death agonist) is essential. Here we show that loss of XIAP (<b>X-chromosome</b> <b>linked</b> inhibitor of apoptosis protein) function by gene targeting or treatment with a second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC, also called DIABLO; direct IAP-binding protein with low pI) mimetic drug in mice rendered hepatocytes and beta-cells independent of BID for FAS-induced apoptosis.

40|$|AbstractEarlier {{research}} on phenotype/genotype relationships in color vision has shown imperfect predictability of color matching from the photopigment spectral sensitivities inferred from molecular genetic analysis. We previously observed {{that not all}} of the genes of the <b>X-chromosome</b> <b>linked</b> photopigment gene locus are expressed in the retina. Since sequence analysis of DNA does not necessarily reveal which of the genes are expressed into photopigments, we used ERG spectral sensitivities and adaptation measurements to assess expressed photopigment complement. Many deuteranomalous subjects had L, M, and L–M hybrid genes. The ERG results showed that M pigment is not present in measurable quantities in deutan subjects. Using these results to determine gene expression improved the correlations between inferred pigment separation and color matching. Furthermore, we found a subject who had normal L and M genes and normal proximal promoter sequences, yet he had a single photopigment (M) by ERG and tested as a protanope. These results demonstrate the utility of ERG measurements in studies of molecular genetics of color vision deficiencies, and further support the conclusion that not all genes are expressed in color deficient subjects. In particular, deuteranomaly requires a presently unknown mechanism of selective expression which excludes normal M genes and allows expression of L–M hybrid genes in one cone type, and the normal L in another...|$|R

We have recently identified two families in which choroideremia is inherited with mental retardation and deafness. In family XL- 62, an interstitial deletion in Xq 21 is visible by cytogenetic analysis and two linked anonymous DNA markers, DXYS 1 and DXS 72, are deleted. In the second family, XL- 45, an interstitial deletion was suspected on phenotypic grounds but could not be confirmed by high-resolution cytogenetic analysis. We used phenol-enhanced reassociation of 48,XXXX DNA in competition with excess XL- 45 DNA to generate a library of cloned DNA enriched for sequences that might be deleted in XL- 45. Two of the first 83 sequences characterized from the library were found to be deleted in probands from family XL- 45 as well as from family XL- 62. Isolation of these sequences proves that XL- 45 does contain a submicroscopic deletion and provides a starting point for identifying overlapping genomic sequences that span the XL- 45 deletion.

Treatment with rGel/BLyS induced down-regulation of the phosphorylation of inhibitory subunit of NF-κB (IκB-α), inhibition of NF-κB DNA-binding activity, and accumulation of IκB-α.

However, Bcgr allele, in comparison with Bcgs allele, determined more effective suppression of an early multiplication in spleens of H 37 Rv mycobacteria after a low dose (5 × 104 colony-forming units (CFU)) injection. CBA/N mice, which are not protected efficiently against tuberculous challenge by BCG vaccination, were characterized by a decreased in vitro proliferation of immune lymph node cells, both spontaneous and stimulated with mycobacterial antigens.

The goal of the gene therapy was to utilize and activate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the hopes of combating the progression of the immune deficiency. The methodology of the experiment involved using retroviral vectors to stimulate the HSCs, which had been implicated in potential treatment for several communicable and non-communicable diseases. SCID was rare in its prevalence and involved a complex mechanism that involved harmful lymphocytic differentiation. The test subjects for this experiment were 11 children of various ages who presented with SCID and were admitted into Necker Hospital. Initially, after the therapy was administered to the children, some showed signs of improved conditions. One child, a three year old, became the face of the experiment's success, as the symptoms of his once life-threatening disease began to diminish. Indeed, this was a breakthrough in the application capabilities of gene therapy in treating various morbidities.|$|R
40|$|Inherited {{abnormalities}} of thyroid hormone-binding proteins {{are not uncommon}} and can predominate in some ethnic groups. They alter the amount of iodothyronines present in serum and, although the concentration of free hormones remains unaltered, routine measurement can give erroneous results. With a single exception, inherited defects in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), are <b>X-chromosome</b> <b>linked</b> and thus, the full phenotype is expressed mostly in males. Partial TBG deficiency is more common than complete efficiency. High frequency of variants TBGs {{have been identified in}} African Blacks, Australian Aborigine and Eskimos. Most defects producing TBG deficiency are caused by mutations in the structural gene. However, inherited X-linked partial deficiency can occur as the consequence of mutations of a gene enhancer. Inherited forms of TBG excess are all cases by gene duplication or triplication. Mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene producing a molecule with increased affinity for T 4 are relatively rare. A variant TTR produces transient hyperthyroxinemia during non-thyroidal illness. Mutations of the human serum albumin (HSA) gene produce increased concentration of serum T 4, a condition known as familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (FDH). They are relatively more common in individuals of Hispanic origin. They cause an increase in serum T 4 owing to increased affinity for this iodothyronine but high concentrations in free T 4 observed in direct measurement by some commercial methods are erroneous. A variant with increased affinity for T 3 has been also identified...|$|R
40|$|Ornithine transcarbamylase {{deficiency}} (OTCD) is an <b>X-chromosome</b> <b>linked</b> urea cycle disorder (UCD) {{that causes}} hyperammonemic episodes leading to white matter injury and impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and motor planning. This study aims to investigate differences in functional connectivity of two resting-state networks [...] default mode and set-maintenance [...] between OTCD patients and healthy controls. Sixteen patients with partial OTCD and twenty-two control participants underwent a resting-state scan using 3 T fMRI. Combining independent component analysis (ICA) and region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, we identified the nodes that comprised each network in each group, and assessed internodal connectivity. Group comparisons revealed reduced functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) of OTCD patients, particularly between the anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/mPFC) node and bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL), {{as well as}} between the ACC/mPFC node and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) node. Patients also showed reduced connectivity in the set-maintenance network, especially between right anterior insula/frontal operculum (aI/fO) node and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), {{as well as between}} the right aI/fO and ACC and between the ACC and right SFG. Internodal functional connectivity in the DMN and set-maintenance network is reduced in patients with partial OTCD compared to controls, most likely due to hyperammonemia-related white matter damage. Because several of the affected areas are involved in executive functioning, it is postulated that this reduced connectivity is an underlying cause of the deficits OTCD patients display in this cognitive domain...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis, is {{the main}} type of cell death that occurs in ageing and {{neurodegenerative}} disease, such as glaucoma. This study therefore characterises the expression profile of caspases (pro-apoptosis) and inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs; anti-apoptosis) during maturation of the Brown Norway rat retina between 6 weeks and > 24 weeks and also examines concomitant changes in expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF 2). The expression profiles of caspases (initiator caspases 8, 9 and effector caspases 6, 7, 3) and inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (Neuronal IAP), cellular IAP 1 and 2 (cIAP 1 / 2), <b>X-chromosome</b> <b>linked</b> IAP (XIAP), Survivin, Bruce and Livin) were examined in retinae from 6 weeks and > 24 weeks old BN rats using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluoroscence analysis. Caspase expression was not altered significantly during the study interval. IAP expression showed a general reduction during maturation of BN retina, which was statistically significant for cIAP 1. cIAP 1 reduction was confirmed by Western blotting and immunoflouroscence and was restricted to cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL). Accumulation of TRAF 2 was observed in the RGCL accompanying the down-regulation of cIAP 1 observed. Our results suggest that cells in the mature RGCL may have a greater susceptibility to cell death compared to their younger counterparts {{and this may be}} due in part to a reduction in activation of survival pathways involving IAPs and TRAF...|$|R
40|$|Color {{vision in}} {{marsupials}} has recently {{emerged as a}} particularly interesting case among mammals. It appears that there are both dichromats and trichromats among closely related species. In contrast to primates, marsupials seem to have evolved {{a different type of}} trichromacy that is not <b>linked</b> to the <b>X-chromosome.</b> Based on microspectrophotometry and retinal whole-mount immunohistochemistry, four trichromatic marsupial species have been described: quokka, quenda, honey possum, and fat-tailed dunnart. It has, however, been impossible to identify the photopigment of the third cone type, and genetically, all evidence so far suggests that all marsupials are dichromatic. The tammar wallaby is the only Australian marsupial to date {{for which there is no}} evidence of a third cone type. To clarify whether the wallaby is indeed a dichromat or trichromatic like other Australian marsupials, we analyzed the number of cone types in the "dichromatic" wallaby and the "trichromatic" dunnart. Employing identical immunohistochemical protocols, we confirmed that the wallaby has only two cone types, whereas 20 - 25 % of cones remained unlabeled by S- and LM-opsin antibodies in the dunnart retina. In addition, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that the rod photopigment (rod opsin) is expressed in cones which would have explained the absence of a third cone opsin gene. Our study is the first comprehensive and quantitative account of color vision in Australian marsupials where we now know that an unexpected diversity of different color vision systems appears to have evolved...|$|R
