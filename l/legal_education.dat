5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of <b>legal</b> <b>education</b> or practice, except that {{students}} were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of <b>Legal</b> <b>Education</b> was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{continued}} to prosper {{during the reign}} of James I (1603–1625) and the beginning of that of Charles I, when over 100 students per year were recorded as joining. The outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 {{during the reign of}} Charles I disrupted the systems of <b>legal</b> <b>education</b> and governance at the Inns of Court, shutting down all calls to the Bar and new admissions, and Gray's Inn never fully recovered. Fortunes {{continued to}} decline after the English Restoration, which saw the end of the traditional method of <b>legal</b> <b>education.</b> Although now more prosperous, Gray's Inn is today the smallest of the Inns of Court.|$|E
5|$|The period saw the {{establishment}} of a regular system of <b>legal</b> <b>education.</b> In {{the early days of the}} Inn, the quality of <b>legal</b> <b>education</b> had been poor—readings were given infrequently, and the standards for call to the Bar were weak and varied. During the Elizabethan age readings were given regularly, moots took place daily and barristers who were called to the Bar were expected to play a part in teaching students, resulting in skilled and knowledgeable graduates from the Inn.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, law {{was taught}} in the City of London, {{primarily}} by the clergy. During the 13th century, two events happened that destroyed this form of legal education; firstly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of <b>legal</b> <b>education</b> could exist in the City of London, and secondly a papal bull was issued in 1254 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law. As a result, the existing system of <b>legal</b> <b>education</b> fell apart. The common lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, the nearest place to the law courts at Westminster Hall that was outside the City.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{marked the}} end of <b>legal</b> <b>education</b> at the Inns, and the class of Readers went into decline. The last Readers were {{appointed}} in 1677, and the position of the Readers as heads of the Inn and members of Pension was taken by the Benchers.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First English Civil War led to a complete suspension of <b>legal</b> <b>education,</b> and from November 1642 until July 1644 no Pension meetings were held. Only 43 students were admitted during the four years of the war, and none were called to the Bar. Meetings of Pension resumed after the Battle of Marston Moor but the education system remained dormant. Although Readers were appointed, none read, and no moots were held. In 1646, {{after the end of}} the war, there was an attempt to restore the old system of readings and moots, and in 1647 an order was made that students were required to moot at least once a day. This failed to work, with Readers refusing to read, and the old system of <b>legal</b> <b>education</b> completely died out.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{typology}} for rethinking {{the case for}} mandatory <b>legal</b> ethics <b>education</b> in the English law degree, by considering <b>legal</b> ethics <b>education</b> in other common law jurisdictions alongside the fundamental role which is played by legal culture, values and ethics in international commercial arbitration. Traditional undergraduate and post-graduate <b>legal</b> ethics <b>education</b> is often focused {{on the law of}} lawyering: the professional regulation of lawyer conduct, legal practice and legal services. However the field of international arbitration (IA), which is increasingly dominated by lawyers, helps to illustrate why legal ethics has arguably become a substantive body of legal knowledge in its own right. It deserves separate critical study due to increasing demands for a heightened sensitivity to cross-cultural values in all law graduates who are moving into transnational legal and non-legal professional environments, within and beyond the field of IA. A new paradigm for <b>legal</b> ethics <b>education</b> may thus be relevant for all jurisdictions...|$|R
5|$|In July 1866, Willamette University's {{trustees}} {{formed a}} committee to explore {{the possibility of a}} legal department. At that time, <b>legal</b> <b>education</b> was traditionally taught as an apprenticeship in which those wishing to be lawyers would study under an existing attorney for several years before being allowed to pass the bar. Although the school did not begin a legal department in 1866, Willamette did confer a Doctor of Laws degree on Matthew P. Deady, who later helped establish the University of Oregon School of Law, Oregon’s second law school.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{reorganization}} of <b>legal</b> <b>education</b> in Ontario in the mid-1950s, Queen's Faculty of Law opened in 1957 in the newly built John A. Macdonald Hall. Other construction projects at Queen's in the 1950s included the construction of Richardson Hall to house Queen's administrative offices, and Dunning Hall. By {{the end of the}} 1960s, like many other universities in Canada, Queen's tripled its enrolment and greatly expanded its faculty, staff, and facilities, {{as a result of the}} baby boom and generous support from the public sector. By the mid-1970s, the number of full-time students had reached 10,000. Among the new facilities were three more residences and separate buildings for the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Biology and Psychology, Social Sciences and the Humanities.|$|E

The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's <b>Legal</b> <b>Education</b> and Action Fund (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon.|$|E

5|$|Barnard's Inn, {{originally}} {{known as}} Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, {{was established in}} 1454 as an Inn of Chancery. A large Inn, Barnard's had 112 students a year {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence. When it was an institute of <b>legal</b> <b>education,</b> it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he got something wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year, who was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.|$|E
5|$|In 1733 the {{requirements}} for {{a call to the}} Bar were significantly revised in a joint meeting between the Benchers of Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, revisions accepted by Lincoln's Inn and Middle Temple, although they were not represented. It is not recorded what these changes were, but after a further discussion in 1762 the Inns adopted a rule that any student with a Master of Arts or Bachelor of Laws degree from the universities of Oxford or Cambridge could be called to the Bar after three years as a student, and any other student could be called after five years. An attempt was made to increase the quality of <b>legal</b> <b>education</b> at Gray's Inn; in 1753 a barrister, Danby Pickering, was employed to lecture there, although this agreement ended in 1761 when he was called to the Bar.|$|E
