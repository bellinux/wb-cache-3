The <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis</b> states that in cells with multiple X chromosomes, all but one are inactivated during mammalian embryogenesis.

40|$|The 64 Cu {{incorporation}} into fibroblast clones obtained from three obligate and three suspected Menkes disease heterozygotes was studied. For each obligate heterozygote, two clonal cell populations were observed, {{one with a}} Menkes phenotype and one with a normal phenotype, as predicted by the <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> The cloning results suggested a heterozygous state {{in two of the}} suspected carriers.

40|$|A 63 -year-old female with slowly {{progressive}} asymmetrical {{muscle weakness}} {{was diagnosed as}} a manifesting carrier of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). She had family history of DMD, and serum creatine kinase was elevated. Electromyography showed myopathic changes, and computed tomography showed patchy involvement of skeletal muscles. Immunohistochemical study of dystrophin in biopsied muscles showed a mosaic of fibers with and without dystrophin. This mosaic staining pattern is characteristic of a carrier of DMD. She had normal female sex chromosome pattern with 46 XX normal karyotype. The mechanism of the occurrence of this case would be explained with <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a procedure for testing iduronate sulfatase, the enzyme deficient in Hunter syndrome, in single hair roots. Beta-Hexosaminidase {{was used as the}} reference enzyme. The ratio of iduronate sulfatase to beta [...] hexosaminidase, expressed in arbitrary units of activity, is near zero for Hunter patients and greater than 0. 6 in almost all roots of normal individuals. Hair roots of Hunter heterozygotes show a characteristic continuum of activity ratios, ranging from totally deficient up to and including the normal range. The results are consistent with the origin of hair roots from a small number of progenitor cells which obey the <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> The proportion of roots with low activity can be used to discriminate between normal and heterozygous individuals...|$|E
40|$|Fibroblast {{cultures}} {{derived from}} the skin of three Hunter heterozygotes have been examined for iduronate sulfatase deficiency primarily by measurement of [35 S]-mucopolysaccharide accumulation in the presence and absence of Hunter corrective factor. For each heterozygote, two populations of clones were observed: normal and enzyme deficient, as predicted by the <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> However, the phenotype of the uncloned cultures was usually normal, presumably because of cross-correction, even after storage in liquid N 2. Mixing experiments indicate {{that the presence of}} a majority of cells with the Hunter phenotype may be obscured as the result of correction by the minority population of normal cells in the mixture. Variability in the ability to cross-correct was also demonstrated. The unpredictable behavior of uncloned cultures make them unsuitable for diagnosing the Hunter carrier state...|$|E
40|$|Cell culture {{offers a}} means by which the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses (1) may be studied since both {{cellular}} metachromasia and intraceUular mucopolysaccharide content provide reliable genetic markers in cultures of skin fibroblasts from affected individuals and heterozygous carriers (2, 3, 4). As the phenotype is evident at the cellular level in cultures from both the autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive forms, the activity of the autosomal and X-linked genes controlling the expression of the Hurler syndrome (1) can be studied. The <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis</b> (5) postulates that random inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in normal mammalian female cells occurs early in embryogenesis. Support for this hypothesis has been obtained by Davidson et al. (6), who have demonstrated the existence of two distinct populations of cells in clones of skin fibroblasts derived from females heterozygous for two electrophoretically distinguishable mutants of the X-llnked glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase locus. It has been suggested (7) that certain autosomal loci ma...|$|E
40|$|Expression {{of the two}} X-linked loci glucose- 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD; EC 1. 1. 1. 49) and hypoxanthine:guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT; EC 2. 4. 2. 8) was {{studied in}} single hair follicles of two females who were heterozygous for both of these genes (double heterozygotes). The coupling phase for these two loci {{was known to be}} g 6 pd A and hyprt- on the maternal X chromosome and g 6 pd B and hgprt+ on the paternal X. Three phenotypic classes of hair follicles were observed in both double heterozygotes: G 6 pd A follicles with deficient HGPRT activity, G 6 pd B follicles with normal HGPRT activity, and G 6 pd AB follicles with intermediate HGPRT activity. These data directly demonstrate one of the predictions of the <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that for two X-linked loci, those genes in cis position are turned on or off in a cell and its clone, while in trans only one gene or the other is expressed...|$|E
40|$|Fabry {{disease is}} an X-linked {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{resulting from the}} deficiency or absence of the enzyme alpha galactosidase A; this defect leads to the systemic accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and its metabolites. Organic involvement in men is well known, but in women it is controversial, mainly due to the random X-chromosome inactivation in each of their cells (<b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis).</b> This would explain why women (heterozygotes) present a wide variability in the severity of their phenotype. The manifestations are multisystemic and begin in early childhood, reaching a severe compromise in adulthood. Typical acroparesthesia in hands and feet, gastrointestinal symptoms, angiokeratomas, dyshidrosis, hearing loss, arrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular accidents, and renal failure can be observed. Nephropathy {{is one of the}} major complications of Fabry disease. Glomerular and vascular changes are present before progression to overt proteinuria and decreased glomerular filtration rate, even in pediatric patients. A case of incipient renal involvement in a girl with classic Fabry disease is reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{sex-linked}} {{gene for}} tabby (Ta) in the mouse, {{in addition to}} its effects on fur and skin, has a characteristic dental syndrome (Griineberg, 1965). Some tabby heterozygotes have a spectacular mixture of molar teeth, some of which are normal, others which are tabby, and some which combine features of both. This prima facie evidence in favour of the single-active X-chromosome hypo-thesis of Lyon (1961) can be turned into a more exacting quantitative test of that concept. An autosomal mimic of tabby, called crinkled (cr; linkage group 14), with the same dental syndrome, offers opportunities for further tests of the hypothesis. It will be seen that, contrary to first impressions, the quantitative study reveals a situation which is not in agreement with the <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> THE MOLARS OF TABBY HEMIZYGOTES AND HOMOZYGOTES With the exception of 29 animals obtained from Dr D.

40|$|The {{intercellular}} adhesiveness of skin fibroblasts {{from patients}} and carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and control subjects {{has been determined}} using couette viscometers. The values for 12 DMD patients (mean = 1. 38, SEM = 0. 1, n = 32) were significantly lower than for ten control subjects (mean = 3. 17, SEM = 0. 2, n = 22). According to the <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> carriers of DMD should be mosaics of cells expressing the normal and DMD phenotypes, and their cultured skin fibroblasts should have intercellular adhesiveness intermediate between that for normal and DMD cells. Cells from three obligate heterozygotes and five individuals {{at high risk of}} being carriers had normal values (in both groups mean = 2. 82) in contrast to artificial 1 : 1 mixtures of normal and DMD cells that had intermediate values (mean = 2. 22, SEM = 0. 2, n = 15). This unexpected finding is probably the result of "correction" of the DMD cells by normal gene product from the cells expressing the normal gene...|$|E
40|$|Clones of skin {{fibroblasts}} {{from normal}} individuals, patients with different mucopolysaccharidoses, and certain of their relatives {{have been examined}} for cellular metachromasia and cellular uronic acid. All the clones derived from affected individuals and heterozygous carriers in families with the autosomal forms of Hurler's syndrome showed marked metachromasia and increased cellular uronic acid. Since only one cell population was demonstrated in clones derived from heterozygous carriers, no evidence for autosomal inactivation was obtained. Clones derived from affected individuals with the X-linked recessive form of Hurler's syndrome contained uniform populations of metachromatic staining cells which demonstrated increased cellular uronic acid. Clones derived from the noncarrier fathers showed no cellular metachromasia or increased cellular uronic acid. Clones derived from the heterozygous mothers and sisters showed two populations both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the average, 72 % of these clones were metachromatic and demonstrated an increased uronic acid content; 28 % of the clones showed no metachromasia and the uronic acid content {{was similar to that}} found in normal individuals. The appearance of two distinct cell populations in clones derived from females heterozygous for the X-linked recessive form of Hurler's syndrome provides evidence in favor of the <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chronic granulomatous {{disease in}} males is {{familial}} and its transmission is is usually clearly x-linked. The mode of inheritance in females with the syndrome is unknown and the carrier state difficult to identify. Defective polymorphonuclear leukocyte bactericidal activity in this disease {{is associated with}} an absence of the respiratory burst generated in stimulated phagocytes and may be detected by the chemiluminescence assay. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes from three of four females with chronic granulomatous disease had extremely low chemiluminescence production, their asymptomatic mothers had intermediate values, and their fathers were normal. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils of two affected males in these kinships generated no chemiluminescence, whereas two of seven female relatives had intermediate values, and all nonaffected males had normal values. In the three families in which leukocytes were studied by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, two populations of neutrophils were demonstrated for the female patients and/or their mothers. The wide phenotypic variability for clinical disease, evidence of two leukocyte populations in the patients or their mothers, and low but detectable leukocyte chemiluminescence in the affected females {{is consistent with the}} <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of x-chromosome inactivation in these families. The findings suggest an x-linked inheritance in these females with chronic granulomatous disease...|$|E
40|$|A {{malignant}} tumor {{is thought}} to represent the proliferation of a clone of cells arising from a single transformed cell (1). Evidence for this concept has come from three different approaches: karyotype analysis, isoenzyme patterns, and immunoglobulin expression. All of these approaches have limitations, but when they have been employed, they have generally supported the concept of malignant growth being monoclonal. The only exceptions to this rule have been the tumors arising {{as a result of}} a dominant genetic trait, such as neurofibromatosis or trichoepitheliomata, where it is thought that multiple primary tumors exist side by side within the same tumor nodule (2, 3). Karyotype analyses of tumor cells have occasionally disclosed a stable chromosome marker that can serve to identify a particular clone of cells (4, 5). Isoenzyme patterns of tumor cells have been examined in patients who are female and heterozygous for an X-linked enzyme, such as glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase. Since, according to the <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis</b> (6), each somatic cell expresses only one X chromosome, normal tissues of heterozygotes are composed of mosaics of cells expressing alternate forms of the enzyme. The finding of uniform expression of a single isoenzyme within a tumor cell population indicates tha...|$|E
40|$|THE X-linked {{condition}} hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency may {{be either}} gross or moderate in degree and is invariably associated with overproduction of urate in the hemizygote 1, 2. In addition, however, the gross deficiency state (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) 3 also manifests with mental deficiency, choreoathetosis, spasticity and self-mutilation. Fibroblasts from heterozygotes for the gross deficiency state display mosaicism, some having normal HGPRT activity and others the reduced HGPRT activity {{characteristic of the}} hemizygote 4. However, HGPRT activity in erythrocyte lysates from such heterozygotes is normal. Heterozygotes for the moderate HGPRT deficiency state, on the other hand, have HGPRT activity in erythrocyte lysates ranging between 20 % of normal and completely normal values 5. To elucidate this, we have developed an autoradiographic procedure to show HGPRT activity in individual erythrocytes. In families with moderate HGPRT deficiency, in whom erythrocytes of the hemizygote were not significantly labelled by this procedure, heterozygotes showed two erythrocyte populations, one deficient in HGPRT and one containing HGPRT activity. On the other hand, in families whose HGPRT deficiency was gross and manifested as the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, heterozygotes showed only the normal pattern of labelling. Thus, mosaicism was present in erythrocytes from heterozygotes for moderate, but not for gross, HGPRT deficiency. The former finding supports the <b>Lyon</b> <b>hypothesis</b> 6 whereas, the latter finding suggests that either the X chromosome carrying the mutant HGPRT gene is preferentially inactivated, or the X chromosome is randomly inactivated with later selection against the erythrocyte precursors containing the mutant HGPRT enzyme...|$|E
