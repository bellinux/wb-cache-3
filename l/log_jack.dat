50|$|Red Squirrel Road was {{originally}} created in 1965 by the Johns-Manville company to <b>log</b> <b>jack</b> pine {{on the sand}} flats just north of Ferguson Bay at {{the northern end of}} Lake Temagami. As the flats were cleared the logged jack pine was towed down Red Squirrel Road towards Highway 11. During 1970, Red Squirrel Road became longer to log the jack pine through the Sharp Rock Portage near Diamond Lake. Red Squirrel Road became abandoned to the public until around 1972 and subsequently, the road has been used by the public. In 1985, plans were broadcast to expand Red Squirrel Road and this became a rallying point for environmental preservation. In 1988, the Ontario Minister of Natural Resources, Vince Kerrio approved the expansion of the Red Squirrel logging road, directly through Anishnabe territory. This prompted a series of roadblocks by the Teme-Augama Anishnabai and by environmentalists in 1988-1989.|$|E
50|$|The town {{started with}} 15 houses. The Canadian Northern Railway built a large sawmill, {{west of the}} station, {{equipped}} with a pulp barker, planing mill, and a powerhouse. This mill, although owned by the railway, operated under the name Eastern Lands Division. Lumber was sold wholesale to railway employees, for home construction. A lumber yard was also established at Capreol. The Eastern Lands Co. built their main office here. They cut white pine, red pine, spruce pulp <b>logs,</b> and <b>jack</b> pine axe ties.|$|R
50|$|The group {{finds the}} raft just as Jack finds the blood orchids, hanging precariously above a pit {{in which a}} ball of male anacondas are mating with the queen. Jack shoots Bill in the arm and forces the party to {{accompany}} him to the orchids. He has Sam cross the pit via a thin log to fill a backpack with orchids. As she returns, the <b>log</b> cracks. <b>Jack</b> orders her to throw him the backpack, but Sam threatens to drop the flowers into the pit unless he drops the gun. The log breaks, and she falls, landing halfway down the pit. As the others help her climb out, Jack attempts to retrieve the backpack. The spider he used to paralyze Gordon escapes from its jar and bites him. Jack falls into the pit and is devoured as Sam and the others escape.|$|R

Soon a sheriff arrives looking for a missing girl who was supposed to have been delivering a package. Paul says that he hasn't seen the girl but attempts to scream out a message, causing Jack to run out and shoot the sheriff. Paul locks him out of the house and barricades the windows to protect himself and Laura. When Jack drives the sheriff's car away they attempt to run through the woods to catch the hourly train but Laura trips over a <b>log</b> and <b>Jack</b> catches them.|$|R
