5|$|According to some sources, {{the church}} could be {{identified}} with San Salvatore de Bordonia; a bordone was the staff borne by pilgrims coming to St. Peter's. These would have <b>left</b> <b>their</b> staffs in San Giacomo before entering Saint Peter, exactly as they did after completing the Way of St. James, and this fact would explain also the late dedication to Saint James.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{control of}} the Atlantic meant German meteorologists had less {{information}} than the Allies on incoming weather patterns. As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris was predicting two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders <b>left</b> <b>their</b> posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet with Hitler to try to obtain more Panzers.|$|E
5|$|As a group, {{the house}} martins cannot easily be {{confused}} with any other swallows. Four species of the genus Tachycineta have white rumps and underparts, but they have bright metallic green or blue-green upperparts, longer tails, and are restricted to Central and South America. The variable plumages of the South Asian species and a confused taxonomic history has <b>left</b> <b>their</b> distribution ranges in doubt.|$|E

On January 11, 1912, textile mill workers in Lawrence <b>left</b> <b>their</b> jobs in protest of lowered wages. Within a week, twenty thousand workers were on strike. The IWW already had a presence in Lawrence and assumed leadership of the strike.|$|E

5|$|Decades, and in {{some cases}} centuries, of British rule and {{emigration}} have <b>left</b> <b>their</b> mark on the independent nations that arose from the British Empire.

5|$|Fort Sill was {{established}} in 1869 after the American Civil War by Major General Philip Sheridan, who was leading a campaign in the Indian Territory to stop raids into Texas by American Indian tribes. In 1874, the Red River War {{broke out in the}} region when the Comanche, Kiowa, and Southern Cheyenne <b>left</b> <b>their</b> Indian Territory reservation. Attrition and skirmishes by the US Army finally forced the return of the tribes back to Indian Territory in June 1875.|$|E
5|$|From 1979 to 2009, 440youngsters have <b>left</b> <b>their</b> {{homes and}} {{families}} {{to stay at}} the academy.

5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were issued}} along the coast, while Coast Guard personnel went door-to-door on Grand Isle urging residents {{to leave the}} area. From there through the coast of southwestern Florida, small craft were advised to remain near shore due to rough seas. Offshore, workers were removed from oil rigs. Many Mississippi citizens, having experienced the destruction of Hurricane Camille just five years earlier, quickly <b>left</b> <b>their</b> coastal homes.|$|E
5|$|Many Texas {{residents}} {{disagreed with}} the convention's perception. As the message spread across Texas, settlers <b>left</b> <b>their</b> homes and assembled in Gonzales, where Colonel James Fannin was due to arrive with the remaining Texian Army troops. On February 27 one group of reinforcements impatiently set out on their own; as a result 32 additional Texians entered the Alamo. Research by historian Thomas Ricks Lindley indicates that an additional 50 or 60 men reinforced the Alamo on March 4.|$|E
5|$|On 15 Aug 1952 {{the area}} was {{declared}} a National Monument by the South West African administration. Despite its early recognition, the site was left unguarded until 1986 when the entire area was declared a nature reserve. As a result, many of the petroglyphs were damaged or removed. Additionally, visitors have <b>left</b> <b>their</b> own graffiti on the sandstone slabs.|$|E

5|$|On 25 March 1669, Pivljanin, {{living in}} Stoliv (near Kotor), was {{recorded}} in Kotor as having acknowledged a debt of 62.5 real (40 groschen being 1 real) to Gierolamo Cazalieri. In early April 1669 Pivljanin and Puhalović raised and looted in Herzegovina, and retreated towards Šipan. According to legend, he burnt down a mosque in Nevesinje, and another one in Počitelj. There are accounts recorded by the anthropologist Jevto Dedijer that several Muslim families <b>left</b> <b>their</b> homes after cruel treatment by Pivljanin; the Šehović left Korjenići and moved to south Herzegovina after he and Limun burnt down their house; the Kajtaz and Rorić left Nevesinje and moved to Mostar, {{and a large number}} of the families of Slivlja <b>left</b> <b>their</b> homes. The war ended with Ottoman victory in 1669, with Venice being forced to relinquish all of the territory taken over by the uskoks and hajduks during the war, with only Klis becoming a new Venetian possession. The Venetian–Ottoman border delineation act was signed on 30 October 1671.|$|E

Workers were so frightened by the riots that they <b>left</b> <b>their</b> machinery in the open in an attempt to limit additional damage. Around the same time, the River Kennet (along the north side of the estate) was made navigable between Reading and Newbury.|$|E
