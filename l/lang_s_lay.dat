40|$|At {{the time}} of writing, more than 20 novels have been written that deal {{directly}} or indirectly with the events of 9 / 11. In broad outlines, they fall under four categories: the novel of recuperation, the novel of first-hand witnessing, the great New York novel, and the novel of the outsider. It is the last category of novels written by non-Americans that demonstrates {{the extent to which}} 11 September has penetrated deep into the European psyche and thus has become a European event.

Even Luc <b>Lang</b> <b>s</b> onze septembre mon amour, a strident anti-American screed, is characterized by a sense of solidarity for the victims and for an alternative America, antithetical to the official one.

40|$|Amongst glycolipidid biosurfactants, rhamnolipids {{have drawn}} {{particular}} attention {{as they have}} several interesting biological properties such as antimicrobial, antiphytoviral, zoosporicidal and plant defense elicitor activities [1 - 3]. It is generally recognised that these activities must {{be linked to the}} interaction of these molecules with constituents of biological membranes [4] but the detailed mechanism is far from being fully understood. The objective of this work is double. First, it aims to investigate a new strategy of synthesis for the production of novel rhamnolipids [5] that could exhibit properties as promising for industrial and environmental applications as their natural counterparts while avoiding the use of the pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa for their production. Secondly, their basic surface properties (critical aggregation concentration, surface tension at CAC and interfacial behaviour of their monolayer) and their interaction with model membranes are investigated in relation with their structure in order to give insight about the mechanism of their biological actions.
