25|$|The {{services}} of a midwife were not inexpensive; this fact that suggests poorer women who could not afford the {{services of}} a professional midwife often had to make do with female relatives. Many wealthier families had their own midwives. However, the vast majority of women in the Greco-Roman world very likely received their maternity care from hired midwives. They may have been highly trained or possessed only a rudimentary knowledge of obstetrics. Also, many families had a choice of whether or not they wanted to employ a midwife who practiced the traditional folk medicine or the newer methods of professional parturition. Like a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> factors in antiquity, quality gynecological care often depended heavily on the socioeconomic status of the patient.|$|E
25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now.
