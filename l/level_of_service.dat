5|$|On {{its opening}} the Met {{operated}} the trains on the District, receiving 55 per {{cent of the}} gross receipts for a fixed <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Extra trains required by the District were charged for and the District's share of the income dropped to about 40 per cent. The District's level of debt meant that the merger was no longer attractive to the Met and did not proceed, so the Met's directors resigned from the District's board. To improve its finances, the District gave the Met notice to terminate the operating agreement. Struggling under the burden of its very high construction costs, the District was unable {{to continue with the}} remainder of the original scheme to reach Tower Hill and made a final extension of its line just one station east from Blackfriars to a previously unplanned City terminus at Mansion House.|$|E

5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E
40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{competition}} in the German water and sewerage sector. According to economic theory <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> can be expected to be inefficient. I will check this hypothesis and therefore {{take a closer look at}} various categories <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> In analysing the internet pages of main German water and sewerage companies I exclusively work with those indicators <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> which do not need much capital investment in order to be improved. Most of these indicators are similar to those used in England. Therefore it is possible to compare the performances in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in these two countries. I come to the conclusion that service offered by English companies is significantly better and in most cases more efficient than service offered by German ones. I therefore deduce that the main reason for that difference is in fact the existence of more competition in the English water and sewerage sector.
