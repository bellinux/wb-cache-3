5000|$|Chaplin {{came across}} a {{traction}} driven lawn and <b>leaf</b> <b>sweeper,</b> and realized that if made larger it would offer a solution for sweeping non-ferrous debris. He invented the Fodbuster RockSweeper in 1987. A towable, traction driven sweeper with brush drive mechanism geared to its wheels, the Fodbuster was brought to market to serve military and civilian airfields. [...] Soon after the RockSweeper introduction, the company embarked on an expansion of their product offerings to meet the growing requirements of the aviation industry. New lines were added, including walk-behind vacuum sweepers, small parts organizers, debris deposal containers, and promotional and awareness training materials such as posters, decals and downloadable PowerPoint training presentations. [...] In 2004 Chaplin published [...] "MAKE IT FOD FREE, The Ultimate FOD Prevention Program Manual”. Following the MAKE IT FOD FREE book” project, FODNews.com was launched as a free online news publication. Specializing in news and information about FOD control methods and FOD related issues, it includes links to news articles, instructional materials, research reports, photos, and videos.|$|E
