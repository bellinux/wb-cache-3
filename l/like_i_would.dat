500|$|The barons {{captured}} Ladislaus in the Szepesség in January 1288. Although his partisans soon liberated him, he acquiesced in concluding {{an agreement}} with Archbishop Lodomer. The archbishop absolved Ladislaus on condition that the king would live in accordance with Christian morals. However, Ladislaus broke his promise. He abducted his sister, Elizabeth, prioress of the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island, and gave her in marriage to a Czech aristocrat, Zavis of Falkenstein. According to Archbishop Lodomer, Ladislaus even stated, [...] "If I had 15 or more sisters in as many cloistered communities as you <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> snatch them from there to marry them off licitly or illicitly; in order to procure through them a kin-group who will support me by all their power in the fulfillment of my will".|$|E

I improvise <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> when I play music." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2016, Marvel {{announced}} that writer Kelly Thompson, who co-wrote A-Force vol. 2, #2, {{will take over}} the series with artist Ben Caldwell starting with issue 5. Thompson stated that while she respects the way Wilson built the team, {{in a world where}} women are the primary heroes, she does not intend on making stories that are [...] "unique to women". Thompson explained, [...] "It's a comic about super heroes saving the day, plain and simple, and I approach writing them <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> writing anyone. These ladies are heroes just like any of their male colleagues." ...|$|E

2500|$|Agip {{obtained}} {{an exclusive}} concession for {{gas and oil}} exploration within the national territory, {{and was able to}} retain the profits. Political views were divided: the leftists supporting him, and the conservatives (together with the industrialists), opposing him. At this time Mattei is alleged to have widely used unofficial financial resources of Agip for extensive bribery, especially of politicians and journalists. He used to say of political parties: [...] "I use them <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> use a taxi: I sit in, I pay for the trip, I get out". Agip gained control of hundreds of companies in all economic fields in the country. Mattei paid great attention to the press, and Agip soon took possession of several newspapers and two agencies.|$|E
2500|$|Modrić's {{skill in}} the game was {{recognized}} early by Dragan Stojković (Piksi), who stated, [...] "I saw a small blond boy who played exactly <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> Ideas he was showing then on the terrain were fascinating". Piksi considered him, along with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, as the most intelligent player. Predrag Mijatović said Modrić became [...] "Madrid's best player, with Ronaldo". Johan Cruyff said Modrić's quality and influence on the game depend on the freedom he gets. Paul Scholes, who played several times against Modrić, {{said in an interview}} with the Manchester Evening News in 2011, [...] "Of the three (Samir Nasri and Wesley Sneijder), Modrić, has been the one I have been most impressed with, [...] whenever we played Tottenham, he was the one who stood out". In 2014, Zinedine Zidane included Modrić in his best XI currently playing the game. In 2017, Robert Prosinečki considered Modrić along Šuker as the best Croatian player in the history.|$|E
2500|$|Roberts co-wrote {{every song}} on the album, with the {{exception}} of The Korgis song [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime" [...] which she covered for the record. The songwriting partnership was important to Roberts, who said [...] "I had to feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say and mean every single one of these lyrics" [...] and explained that she wouldn't want to release something that wasn't her own as she had been given an opportunity where she [...] "put every last bit of heart and soul into it". In an interview with Rolling Stone Roberts was questioned on her concept for the record, where she stated that she wished to avoid a record produced under guidelines of regular pop music. She found that producing an [...] "electro" [...] record helped her produce an innovative record, she found that after working with the Girls Aloud producer Xenomania that she was used to [...] "breaking pop rules" [...] something which she continued with during the production of Cinderella's Eyes. Vocally she also wanted to produce something that could {{come as a surprise to}} those who hadn't heard her [...] "full range before". The title of the album derives from a track of the same name from the album. The song [...] "Cinderella's Eyes" [...] was written in the early stages of the album recording, with lyrics telling a story similar to several fairy tale characters. Roberts described [...] "Cinderella's Eyes" [...] as [...] "a song on my album that I wrote about a year ago… It's about a girl called Sleeping Beauty who wakes up and wonders what life has instore [...] for her… “Will she meet any baddies or goodies and will she lay with any Princes or Hoodies”… She asks Cinderella [...] "Are you happy with your fella and your nice home", and tells girls “They have to do it for themselves as cards are so randomly dealt.” I think it represents my views on happy endings." ...|$|E

Can you speak French?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Muriel {{rose and}} laid her hand solemnly on his arm. [...] "You will!" [...] she answered, boldly. [...] "You can! You must! I know I can trust your promise for that. This moment, if you <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not shrink. But {{you will never}} let me fall alive {{into the hands of}} those wretches. Felix, from your hand I could stand anything.

6000|$|... "Go to, then," [...] {{replied the}} keeper; [...] "if a stag {{may have come}} to mischance in my walk, it was {{no way in the}} course of dishonesty, but merely to keep my old dame's pan from rusting; but for silver porringers, tankards, and such <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> as soon have drunk the melted silver, as stolen the vessel made out of it.

He always says he's glad I wasn't there, and he pities the poor fool women more than he despises his father. Or I ortn't to say despise; Joey don't despise anybody; he's all good, through and through; I don't know where he gets it. He's like Laban, and yet he ain't any kin to Laban." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{not always}} {{as bad as}} this, John," [...] he said; [...] "the jolting of your confounded roads has been too much for me.

She did make it--and made mother and Gertrude drink it--but I {{went back to my}} room and shut my door and locked it, and I knelt by my window and cried--just as Gertrude did when her great news came.|$|E
