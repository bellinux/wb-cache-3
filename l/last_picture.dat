5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album {{to sound like a}} soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, in an effort to replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 Peter Bogdanovich, {{with whom}} Fields {{had worked on}} Targets, {{recruited}} her to edit What's Up, Doc? (1972); Bogdanovich had edited his previous films himself. The film was very successful, and is now considered as the second of Bogdanovich's 'golden period' that commenced with The <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show (1971). What's Up, Doc? established Fields as an editor on studio films. She subsequently edited Bogdanovich's final golden period film, Paper Moon (1973), {{as well as his}} less successful film Daisy Miller (1974).|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{initially}} expected to work {{only through the}} Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} space probe taking one <b>last</b> <b>picture</b> of Earth. He pointed out that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, {{but it could have been}} meaningful nevertheless as a perspective on our place in the universe.|$|E

5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} start right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going to}} get someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|Peter Bogdanovich, whose The <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show {{impressed}} McQueen {{and producer}} David Foster, was originally hired {{as the director}} of The Getaway. Thompson came on board to write the script of his crime novel's film adaptation. Creative differences ensued between Thompson and McQueen and the author was fired along with Bogdanovichthey were replaced with Hill and Peckinpah. Principal photography commenced on February 7, 1972, on location in Texas. During production, McQueen and MacGraw began an affair, and McQueen and Peckinpah were involved in heated arguments due to the latter's increasing alcohol intake. Originally scored by Peckinpah collaborator Jerry Fielding, McQueen became unimpressed with Fielding's soundtrack and, at his behest, hired Quincy Jones to rescore it. Jones was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for his work.|$|E
5|$|Until 19 August {{the weather}} was {{unsuitable}} for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie's mother was persuaded to visit her sister's for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, Frances and the Leaping Fairy, Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, Fairy offering Posy of Harebells to Elsie, shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took the <b>last</b> <b>picture,</b> Fairies and Their Sun-Bath.|$|E
50|$|His <b>last</b> <b>pictures</b> were ‘The White Mouse,’ {{exhibited}} in 1834 at Suffolk Street, and the ‘Children of Sir E. Cust,’ {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy. He was a very successful painter of children, and his portraits were popular; but he was ambitious for fame as a painter of imaginative subjects and as a student of Correggio.|$|R
50|$|Although Munkácsy, who {{was very}} {{conscious}} about earthly comfort and social prestige, became a celebrity, he was always unsure and always questioning his own talent. By the 1890s, his depression grew into a severe mental illness which was probably intensified by the syphilis which he contracted in his youth. His <b>last</b> <b>pictures</b> are troubled and sometimes even bizarre (e.g. Victim of Flowers, 1896).|$|R

25|$|Cloris Leachman (born April 30, 1926) is an American {{actress and}} comedian.

25|$|Beverly also {{painted to}} exhibit, with {{watercolour}} being his preferred medium. He showed at the Royal Manchester Institution, in the 1820s and 1830s, {{and again in}} later life. Between 1865 and 1880 he exhibited 29 pictures at the Royal Academy, most of them seascapes. His <b>last</b> <b>picture</b> seen there was Fishing Boats going before the Wind: Early Morning, was exhibited in 1880. His work {{has been compared to}} that of Richard Parkes Bonington.|$|E
50|$|In January 1945, he {{recorded}} the funerals {{held for the}} victims of the massacre at Bande in Belgium. One of Richards <b>last</b> <b>pictures,</b> painted in February 1945, shows the bridge at Gennep built by Allied sappers across the flooded River Maas. It was in this area that Richards was killed on 5 March 1945 when his jeep drove over a landmine. He is buried at Milsbeek War Cemetery, near Gennep.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{completion}} of his tour Advincula {{was assigned to}} Parris Island, SC from April 1970 until January 1975 at which time he was once again stationed on Okinawa. It was during this period, on May 1, that Kichiro Shimabuku opened his Kinaka dojo and hosted a Grand Opening.

60|$|Among the <b>last</b> <b>pictures</b> that I {{looked at}} was Hogarth's March to Finchley; and surely {{nothing can be}} covered more thick and deep with English nature than that piece of canvas. The face of the tall {{grenadier}} in the centre, between two women, both of whom have claims on him, wonderfully expresses trouble and perplexity; and every touch in the picture meant something and expresses what it meant.|$|R
25|$|Leachman won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her {{performance}} in The <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show (1971), {{based on the}} bestselling book by Larry McMurtry. She played the high school gym teacher's neglected wife, with whom Timothy Bottoms' character has an affair. Director Peter Bogdanovich had predicted during production that she would win an Academy Award for {{her performance}}. The part was originally offered to Ellen Burstyn, but Burstyn wanted another role in the film.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} small walls to climb, {{but they may}} all be outflanked {{on the right side}} if the {{conditions}} are good. From the Western summit the flank seems nearly as forbidding as the wall itself, but at a close distance it is not too difficult and no equipment should be necessary. However, on poor conditions, the Talus may be very loose and great caution is advised. On days with fresh snow, like the <b>last</b> <b>picture,</b> equipment will probably be necessary on all routes.|$|E
25|$|Bogdanovich {{followed}} up The <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show {{with the popular}} comedy What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal, a screwball comedy indebted to Hawks's Bringing Up Baby (1938) and His Girl Friday (1940). Despite his reliance on homage to bygone cinema, Bogdanovich solidified his status {{as one of a}} new breed of A-list directors that included Academy Award winners Francis Ford Coppola and William Friedkin, with whom he formed The Directors Company. The Directors Company was a generous production deal with Paramount Pictures that essentially gave the directors carte blanche if they kept within budget limitations. It was through this entity that Bogdanovich's Paper Moon (1973) was produced.|$|E
40|$|In late 2012 a {{communications}} satellite called EchoStar XVI launched into space from Kazakhstan where it {{remains in a}} geostationary orbit around Earth. The satellite contains artist and geographer Trevor Paglen’s The <b>Last</b> <b>Pictures,</b> a collection of one hundred images, sourced from libraries and artists, microetched onto a gold-plated disc. Paglen’s project is both a continuation of, and a critical response to, {{the notion of the}} time capsule as a means of delivering, either to a terrestrial future or to some extraterrestrial destination, an abbreviated representative sample of “civilization. ” The utopianism that motivates many time-capsule projects, whether it is articulated through a belief in the power to communicate with a distant future or with some cosmically remote intelligence, is also a manifestation, this article argues, of progressive modernity’s commitment to timekeeping—to the successful capture and command, interpretation and anticipation, of past and future times. Paglen’s project is considered here as a retort to the repressions and exclusions that underwrite the optimism of the conventional capsule; The <b>Last</b> <b>Pictures</b> is the futureless call of the Anthropocene...|$|R

25|$|Mathis {{had been}} romantically linked to George Walsh and Rex Ingram; however, she {{returned}} from Italy engaged to an Italian cinematographer named Sylvano Balboni (sometimes spelled as Silvano Balboni). The couple married on December 20, 1924, at the Mission of St. Cecilia, in Riverside, California. After her return, First National hired her as editorial director. She also scripted several successful Colleen Moore pictures including Sally, The Desert Flower, and Irene. Mathis remained at First National for two years, but left over limitations and signed with United Artists; {{with her husband}} she made one picture for them, The Masked Woman. The Magic Flame (1927) would be her <b>last</b> <b>picture,</b> {{and one of her}} best, due in part to Ronald Colman's performance and Henry King's direction.|$|E
25|$|Both films occasioned major {{disputes}} between Bogdanovich, who still demanded {{a measure of}} control over his films, and the studios, which controlled the financing and final cut of both films. Mask was released with a song score by Bob Seger against Bogdanovich's wishes (he favored Bruce Springsteen), and Bogdanovich has often complained that the version of Texasville that was released was not the film he had intended. A director's cut of Mask, slightly longer and with Springsteen's songs, was belatedly released on DVD in 2006. A director's cut of Texasville was released on laserdisc, and the theatrical cut was released on DVD by MGM in 2005. Around {{the time of the}} release of Texasville, Bogdanovich also revisited his earliest success, The <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show, and produced a slightly modified director's cut. Since that time, his recut has been the only available version of the film.|$|E
500|$|Fields {{then left}} American Graffiti. It took {{another six months}} of editing to create a shorter, 110-minute version of the film, but upon its release in 1973 American Graffiti was {{extremely}} successful both with critics and at the box office. Shortly after its release, Roger Greenspun described the film and its editing: [...] "American Graffiti exists {{not so much in}} its individual stories as in its orchestration of many stories, its sense of time and place. Although it is full of the material of fashionable nostalgia, it never exploits nostalgia. In its feeling for movement and music and the vitality of the night—and even in its vision in white—it is oddly closer to some early Fellini than to the recent American past of, say, The <b>Last</b> <b>Picture</b> Show or Summer of '42." ...|$|E
