It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E

5|$|Later Myst titles {{improved}} on {{the integration}} of live action sequences in the prerendered environments of the games. s developers filmed all the scenes using standard definition cameras, which producer Dan Irish would <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on as a mistake; without using high definition video cameras, the video did not look crisp at high resolutions.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{the performance of}} dingoes (Canis dingo) on the rope-pulling task, previously used by Miklo´si et al. (Curr Biol 13 : 763 – 766, 2003) to highlight a key distinction in the problem-solving behaviour of wolves compared to dogs when {{in the company of}} humans. That is, when dogs were confronted with an unsolvable task, following a solvable version of the task they <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> or gazed at the human, whereas, wolves did not. We replicated the rope-pulling task using 12 sanctuary-housed dingoes and used the Miklo´si et al. (Curr Biol 13 : 763 – 766, 2003) definition of <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> behaviour to analyse the data. However, at least three different types of <b>look</b> <b>backs</b> were observed in our study. We, then developed a more accurate operational definition of <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> behaviour that was task specific and reanalysed the data. We found that the operational definition employed greatly influences the results, with vague definitions potentially overestimating the prevalence of <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> behaviour. Thus, caution must be taken when interpreting the results of studies utilising <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> as behaviour linked to assistance seeking during problem solving. We present a more stringent definition and make suggestions for future research...|$|R

5|$|The {{album was}} {{critically}} well received {{but was not}} a chart success, which led to frustration within the band and David Sinclair's departure. Nevertheless, it has remained in print and sold steadily, and been recommended by critics as a good introduction to the Canterbury Scene genre. The band <b>look</b> <b>back</b> favourably on the album and several of its tracks have remained fixtures in Caravan's live repertoire. It has been reissued several times, including a comprehensive 40th anniversary remix package by British musician and producer Steven Wilson in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 can <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on {{a varied}} life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but not close terms with his neighbours; his Roman Catholicism sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E
5|$|One day, the Magic Mirror {{informs the}} Queen that Snow White {{is now the}} fairest in the land. The jealous Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, {{revealing}} the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee {{into the woods and}} never <b>look</b> <b>back.</b> Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.|$|E
5|$|The Hungry Saw is {{the seventh}} studio album by British {{alternative}} band Tindersticks, released on 28 April 2008 by Beggars Banquet Records. Following {{the release of}} the band's sixth album, Waiting for the Moon in 2003, Tindersticks had entered an extended hiatus before reconvening to perform at the Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> event in September 2006. This concert marked the final performance of the original line-up of the band, and three members left the group shortly afterwards. The remaining members of Tindersticks felt reinvigorated by the performance, and relocated to France to begin working on new material in the summer of 2007, recording and producing the album at their own Le Chien Chanceaux studio in Limousin. The Hungry Saw was the first new Tindersticks material in five years.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{achieved}} {{another breakthrough}} in 1987, {{when she had}} leading roles in two television miniseries: Fortunes of War, a World War II drama co-starring Kenneth Branagh, and Tutti Frutti, a dark-comedy about a Scottish rock band with Robbie Coltrane. For these performances, Thompson won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. The following year, she wrote and starred in her own sketch comedy series for BBC, Thompson, but this was poorly received. In 1989, she and Branagh—who had formed a romantic relationship—starred in a stage revival of <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> in Anger, directed by Judi Dench and produced by Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company. Later that year, the pair starred in a televised version of the play.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not <b>look</b> <b>back</b> to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{differences}} {{had come}} to a head during the recording of Tindersticks' previous album Waiting for the Moon in 2003, and the band entered an extended hiatus. Island Records issued remastered and expanded versions of the band's first four studio albums and the Nénette et Boni soundtrack, along with a compilation album that documented Tindersticks time with Island entitled Working for the Man, in 2004. Singer Stuart Staples started the Lucky Dog record label and released his debut solo album, Lucky Dog Recordings 03–04, in 2005 and the Leaving Songs album in 2006, while violinist Dickon Hinchcliffe recorded the score to the 2005 Ira Sachs film Forty Shades of Blue. The original six members of Tindersticks reconvened for one final time in September 2006 to play their second album Tindersticks in its entirety for the Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> series of concerts, after which three band members left the group.|$|E
5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at the early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his {{point is that the}} human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E
