40|$|Our work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} accurately extracting <b>manhole</b> <b>covers,</b> one specific type of road fixture, from a large volume of mobile {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) data. We propose an efficient, step-wise <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> extraction method. First, road surface points are extracted and interpolated to generate two-dimensional geo-referenced feature (GRF) images. Next, the method segments <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> candidates by applying distance-dependent thresholding and multi-scale tensor voting to the GRF images. Finally, distance-based clustering and a morphological operation are used to extract <b>manhole</b> <b>covers.</b> Experiments were carried out to qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the performance of our <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> extraction method...|$|R

5000|$|A round <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> has {{a smaller}} surface than a square one, thus less {{material}} {{is needed to}} cast the <b>manhole</b> <b>cover,</b> meaning lower cost.|$|R
50|$|<b>Manhole</b> <b>covers</b> have {{different}} weight classes {{depending on their}} application. For example, a Class A15 (cast iron) <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> can withstand a maximum weight of 1.5 tonnes. It would typically be restricted to light duty applications, such as in pedestrian areas, gardens, patios and driveways; whereas a F900 class <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> would typically be used in docks, airports and other extreme heavy-duty applications.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Manhole</b> <b>cover</b> theft is the {{phenomenon}} of <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> being stolen, usually for resale as scrap. Long {{considered to be a}} childish prank or simple vandalism, this type of theft is often expensive to municipalities, and dangerous to their residents. [...] In recent years, the theft of <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> for financial reasons (i.e., to sell them when scrap metal prices are high) has also become more common.|$|R
50|$|The blasts {{were fairly}} small, except when <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> were involved. At these points, {{the access to}} oxygen fueled towering flames that erupted through the <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> onto city streets. The covers {{themselves}} were blown high into the air.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{management}} the <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> effectively, the <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> intelligent monitoring terminal (MCIMT) {{based on}} dual frequency RFID and acceleration sensor was proposed in this paper. Through hardware designing, alarm algorithm designing, program debugging and packaging, we developed the MCIMT. The key performance testing and demonstration system operation shown the following results. Firstly, the MCIMT communication distance can achieve 800 meters under the open conditions and 300 meters under the occluded environment reliably. Secondly, the MCIMT embedded special state estimate algorithm can output the correct scene sate of <b>manhole</b> <b>cover.</b> Thirdly, the MCIMT could operation 3 years in <b>manhole</b> <b>cover.</b> Lastly, the demonstration {{system based on}} the MCIMT can alarm accurately and timely...|$|R

50|$|Because {{of their}} {{aerodynamic}} design, some modern racing cars create enough vacuum {{to lift a}} <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> off its recess. During races on city streets, <b>manhole</b> <b>covers</b> must therefore be welded or locked down to prevent injury. In 1990, during the Group C World Sportscar Championship race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve (located in a public park in Montréal, Quebec), a Brun Motorsport Porsche 962 struck a <b>manhole</b> <b>cover</b> that was lifted by the ground effect of the car he was following, a Courage C24 Porsche. This caused the trailing Porsche to catch fire, and safety issues ended the race shortly afterwards.|$|R
