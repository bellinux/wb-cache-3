40|$|The {{bearings}} of {{a contact}} system on transport, electric lines take up substantial horizontal loads both from wires and constructions holding them {{and also from}} wind, dynamic and other extraordinary influences (wire breakage, emergency situations, etc.). In case of using contact bearers with sole bases {{it is necessary to}} have sufficient strength and strain capacity reserve. For this aim solepieces with different constructive schemes are applied. The effectiveness of their application depending on their location, depth and length has not been thoroughly researched. In the article the authors offer a calculation method for horizontally <b>loaded</b> <b>bearings</b> with solepieces presented as horizontally laid beams, which are used in order to raise the deformational stability of horizontally <b>loaded</b> <b>bearings.</b> The results of comparative calculations are presented for horizontally <b>loaded</b> sole <b>bearings</b> with beams, installed in the upper and lower compressed zones of soil. The calculation results showed the efficiency of solepieces application with the aim of deformation reduction of horizontally <b>loaded</b> <b>bearings</b> as well as the possibility to optimally assign their size in order to reduce costs for their production...|$|R

25|$|Traditionally shophouses {{were built}} with {{structural}} (i.e. <b>load</b> <b>bearing)</b> timber beams which carried {{the weight of}} the roof and floors. Floor were similarly made of timber planks, often with narrow gaps in between them to allow air to filter through and to help the building (and its inhabitants) to 'breathe' better. The use of timber beams and floor boards was very much in line with local building traditions. Modern shophouses, on the other hand, use reinforced concrete beams and slabs.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a nunerical technique for the computational analysis of ruptured liquid films in both steadily and dynamically <b>loaded</b> <b>bearings.</b> The approach is based on the principle of oil flow continuity. A cavitation algorithm, proposed by H. G. Elrod, was implemented for studies of hydrodynamic lubrication in infinitely long cylinder/plane bearings (i. e. non-conformal contacts) under combined sliding, rolling and normal motion. Difficulties involved in the implementation of this algorithm were investigated in great depth. A new 'improved' method of solution, which is well-suited to the computational analyses of steadily and dynamically <b>loaded</b> <b>bearings,</b> was developed. The improved technique involves the solution of the hydrodynamic lubrication problem for oil film pressures or degrees of lubricant filling in the full film and cavitated regions of a bearing. Detailed studies of cylinder/plane under conditions of both instantaneous and sinusoidal normal motion were performed. The improved solution was shown to facilitate the implicit implementation of the Jakobsson-Floberg- 011 son boundary conditions (i. e. the inclusion of 'oil film history' phencinena) in dynamically <b>loaded</b> <b>bearing</b> analyses. Detailed comparisons between the oil film history and classical solutions, and published experimental studies were made. Computer programs based on the classical Reynolds equation and the improved method of solution were developed for the analysis of circuTiferentially grooved, finite journal bearings operating under steady-state and dynamic loading conditions. The improved method of solution produced more realistic predictions of performance characteristics, particularly oil film extent, oil flow and bearing power loss. Comprehensive comparisons with published theoretical and experimental studies were made. Encouraging agrenent was obtained between the oil flow continuity analyses and experiments. Journal centre orbit analyses of dynamically <b>loaded</b> <b>bearings,</b> typically found in reciprocating engines, indicated that the oil film history solution may reveal a nunber of new features of time-varying performance characteristics not previously predicted by the classical Reynolds solution...|$|R

25|$|Tired of {{administrative}} work, which kept {{him away from}} his research, Pegram asked Butler to relieve him {{of the position of}} dean in 1930. This request was accepted, in spite of Pegram's demonstrated ability as an administrator. His achievements included the construction of the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Pegram was intimately involved in its design, insisting on a structure without <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> internal walls, so that it could be reconfigured over time, and with large two-storey lecture theatres. He attempted to expose his physics students to ideas from Europe, inviting Hendrik Lorentz, Larmor, Planck, Max Born and Werner Heisenberg to visit Columbia.|$|E

Major advances introduced {{with the class}} included cab air conditioning, onboard toilet, Trimount type high adhesion bogies, and Super Series wheel creep control to enable heavier loads to be hauled. The locomotives were designed to be of minimum mass, allowing a higher fuel load. The body consists of two side trusses with <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, roofbows and integral cabs.

25|$|In {{many parts}} of {{developing}} countries such as Pakistan, Iran and China, unreinforced {{or in some cases}} reinforced masonry is the predominantly form of structures for rural residential and dwelling. Masonry was also a common construction form {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, which implies that a substantial number of these at-risk masonry structures would have significant heritage value. Masonry walls that are not reinforced are especially hazardous. Such structures may be more appropriate for replacement than retrofit, but if the walls are the principal <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements in structures of modest size they may be appropriately reinforced. It is especially important that floor and ceiling beams be securely attached to the walls. Additional vertical supports in the form of steel or reinforced concrete may be added.|$|E
25|$|Of pod and boom layout the Ogar has a T-tail on a tubular Aluminium alloy tubular boom {{extending}} from the keel of the fuselage pod, which houses the cockpit and engine.

The wings are of wooden single spar construction skinned with plywood and covered with glass-fibre. The engine is mounted {{at the rear of}} the fuselage pod, aft of the wing trailing edge at the same level and driving a pusher propeller. The undercarriage consists of a semi-retractable mainwheel fitted with a disc brake, steerable tailwheel and optional outrigger wheels on flexible struts at the wing-tips.

25|$|The {{design of}} the Akron-class did away with the {{traditional}} cruciform tail and altered the shape and position of the stabilizers. The ship's stabilizers were originally designed to be secured on the hull at three main ring points, but this was changed by shortening them to have them secured at only two points, with the leading edge only attached to the intermediate frame rather than the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure. This design change came about following an incident involving the German passenger airship Graf Zeppelin, which, when taking off in 1929, had almost struck a set of power lines with its lower fin, {{which could not be}} seen from the ship's control gondala. In order to make the lower fin visible, the design was changed to shorten the fin. This proved to be a design flaw that eventually was a major contributory factor to the loss of Macon in 1935.|$|E
500|$|Cob, {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "monolithic adobe", is a natural building material made from soil that includes clay, sand or small stones and an organic material such as straw. Cob walls are usually built up in courses, have no mortar joints and need 30% or more clay in the soil. Cob can be used as in-fill in post-and-beam buildings, but is often used for <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> walls, and can bear up to two stories. [...] A cob wall should be at least [...] thick, and the ratio of width to height should be no more than one to ten. It will typically be plastered inside and out with a mix of lime, soil and sand. Cob is fireproof, and its thermal mass helps stabilize indoor temperatures.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{internal}} clearance on radially loaded deepgroove ball and cylindrical roller <b>bearing</b> <b>load</b> distribution and fatigue life was determined for four clearance groups {{defined in the}} bearing standards.

Relationships were found between bearing life and internal clearance {{as a function of}} ball or roller diameter, adjusted for load.
