50|$|For many years, {{people could}} climb the {{circular}} steel {{steps to the}} top of the glass tower, at one time the city's tallest building, and see the view of Myrtle Beach from the roof. The cost was $1 as of 2000. However, persons unable to find their name on the wall of bicycle license plates could climb up without charge. <b>Liability</b> <b>and</b> <b>insurance</b> claim concerns put an end to the practice of climbing the tower in 2006.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{after many}} plans {{had been sold}} to other amateur constructors, the ladder {{manufacturer}} refused to sell its products for this purpose, due to concerns about <b>liability</b> <b>and</b> <b>insurance.</b> The aircraft was then redesigned to replace the ladders with rectangular-section aluminium tubes (100 x 50 mm), becoming the Pouchel II, with a Rotax 447 engine and an empty weight of about 150 kg. Subsequently, the Pouchel II was superseded by the APEV Pouchel Light, with an empty weight of about 100 kg. A closely related aircraft {{in the same family}} is the APEV Demoichelle. Plans and kits are distributed by the APEV (Association pour la Promotion des Echelles Volantes, or in English, Association for the Promotion of Flying Ladders).|$|E
50|$|The P-Rade {{begins on}} Nassau Street, enters the campus through FitzRandolph Gate {{in front of}} Nassau Hall, then {{proceeds}} through Cannon Green. Until the early 1990s, the route continued across McCosh Walk, through 1879 Arch, down Prospect Avenue, and finished on the baseball field. However, because of escalating public <b>liability</b> <b>and</b> <b>insurance</b> costs, the University moved the P-Rade route to stay only on the private property of the University. Some think the University also felt that too many alumni would stop off at their eating clubs on Prospect Avenue before finishing the P-Rade, and so it changed (and shortened) the route {{so that it does}} not leave campus. Currently, after crossing Cannon Green, the P-Rade proceeds down Elm Drive through the center of campus, and onto Poe Field. The Classes are arranged {{on both sides of the}} entire route, so that each cheers its elders, then falls in line to march past those younger. The P-rade ends as the graduating seniors race onto Poe Field under review of the President of the University, and are then formally welcomed as alumni/ae.|$|E

5000|$|Andy {{spelled out}} his {{approach}} to life - dubbed [...] "slacklife" [...] - in a November 2010 interview with Brenden Gebhart. Slacklife is: “A concept adopted by slackliners who live a life consistently and continually inspired by slacklining. Slacklining is not considered a sport by society. There is no slackline magazine. There are no set rules. No set definitions. No standardized equipment. No statistics. Most importantly, there are no true professionals. In fact there is pretty much no reason to slackline except {{for the sake of}} slacklining itself. That is the slacklife. Rules and regulations involved in the habitual and ridiculous effort to remove RISK entirely from society has made living the slacklife inside of society damn near impossible. <b>Liability</b> <b>and</b> <b>insurance</b> are the two words crippling the sport of slacklining today. “Slackers,” living the “slacklife,” instead; travel the globe in search of the most inspiring places to practice slacklining. Tricklining, longlining, highlining, and free solo are all separate facets of slacklining. Training all of these facets is an incredibly positive way to stay physically and mentally fit. This training is becoming a pseudo-religion amongst the community of slackliners; otherwise called the “slacklife.” Living in the moment, being immersed in the wilderness, challenging your body, developing your mind, confronting, controlling, and conquering one’s fear of death, and pursuing the pure, true, and honest unbridled feeling of freedom {{to do what you want}} is the foundation supporting the Slacklife.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, the Delaware Supreme Court passed one of {{its most}} debated judgments, Smith v Van Gorkom. The {{directors}} of TransUnion, including Jerome W. Van Gorkom, were sued by the shareholders for failing to adequately research the corporation's value, before approving a sale price of $55 per share to the Marmon Group. The Court held that to be a protected business judgment, [...] "the directors of a corporation have acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was {{in the best interests of}} the company." [...] Failing to act on an informed basis, if it caused loss, would amount to gross negligence, and here the directors were liable. The decision triggered a panic among corporate boards which believed they would be exposed to massive <b>liability,</b> <b>and</b> <b>insurance</b> firms who feared rising costs of providing directors and officers liability insurance to corporate boards. In response to lobbying, the Delaware General Corporation Law was amended to insert a new §102(b)(7). This allowed corporations to give directors immunity from liability for breach of the duty of care in their charter. However, for those corporations which did not introduce liability waivers, the courts subsequently proceeded to reduce the duty of care outright. In 1996, In re Caremark International Inc. Derivative Litigation required [...] "an utter failure to attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting system exists", and in 2003 In re Walt Disney Derivative Litigation went further. Chancellor Chandler held directors could only be liable for showing [...] "reckless indifference to or a deliberate disregard of the whole body of stockholders" [...] through actions that are [...] "without the bounds of reason". In one of the cases that came out of the Global Financial Crisis, the same line of reasoning was deployed in In re Citigroup Inc Shareholder Derivative Litigation. Chancellor Chandler, confirming his previous opinions in Re Walt Disney and the dicta of Re Caremark, held that the directors of Citigroup could not be liable for failing to have a warning system in place to guard against potential losses from sub-prime mortgage debt. Although there had been several indications of the significant risks, and Citigroup's practices along with its competitors were argued to have contributed to crashing the international economy, Chancellor Chandler held that [...] "plaintiffs would ultimately have to prove bad faith conduct by the director defendants". This suggested that Delaware law had effectively negated any substantive duty of care. This suggested that corporate directors were exempt from duties that any other professional performing services would owe. Itt remained unclear, with a change in the Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court in 2014, whether this position would remain.|$|E

40|$|I {{construct}} {{a theoretical framework}} to study how the degree of judicial inde-pendence affects both the form and the efficiency of private contracts. I show that ”common law ” systems of judicial autonomy foster the use of contingent contracts while codified “civil law ” systems induce the parties to adopt rigid contracts, pro-tecting them against worst-case scenarios. The benefit of independence is that it leads judges to use more information, its cost is {{that they tend to}} be too inter-ventionist. Discretion is valuable when the quality of information is good and the preferences of decision-makers are not polarized.

40|$|Background: Synthesis of {{evidence}} on the efficacy and safety of Avastin for AMD Method: Assessment of three head-to-head RCTs on Avastin for AMD Results: Since the publication of now three head-to-head randomised clinical studies / RCTs (CATT, IVAN, MANTA), evidence meeting the highest methodological requirements is available. The efficacy is regarded – not least by these RCTs – as proven. According to CATT, IVAN and MANTA, {{a discussion about the}} equivalence is no longer necessary, but probably about the monthly vs. needs-oriented administration strategy, since with the latter the intravitreal injections have to be administered considerably less frequently. Conclusion: A legal regulation is urgently pending in Austria in order to place evidence-based, off-label application on a legal foundation (with regard to <b>liability</b> <b>and</b> <b>insurance</b> laws) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} {{the development of}} a private launch industry. Under international space law, in particular the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, States shall supervise and authorize the activities of their nationals, including private launch companies, in Outer Space. In the United States, a substantial set of regulations has been elaborated to exercise this control over the activities of the private launch industry. This thesis analyzes, in a first chapter, the evolution which led to these regulations. The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 and the subsequent regulations issued by the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, regarding the licensing process are dealt with in the second chapter. The third chapter examines the most important practical legal issue relating to private launch services, namely <b>liability</b> <b>and</b> <b>insurance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Beginning {{with the}} seminal work by Williams and Nagel, moral {{philosophers}} have used auto accident hypotheticals to illustrate the phenomenon of moral luck. Moral luck {{is present in the}} hypotheticals because (and to the extent that) two equally careless drivers are assessed differently because only one of them caused an accident. This Article considers whether these philosophical discussions might contribute to the public policy debate over compensation for auto accidents. Using <b>liability</b> <b>and</b> <b>insurance</b> practices in the United States as an illustrative example, the Article explains that auto liability insurance substantially mitigates moral luck and argues that, as a result, the moral luck literature is unlikely to make a significant contribution to this public policy debate. The debate would benefit more from philosophical analysis of victims’ luck, which is not as substantially mitigated by liability insurance...|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{is designed}} largely for the landowner, farmer, rancher, non-farmer or potential guide {{who is not}} trained or experienced in operating a recreation business.
