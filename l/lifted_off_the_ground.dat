5|$|In Oregon, {{two teenage}} boys (Gary and Richie) are {{exploring}} {{the crash site}} when they encounter Deputy Miles, who denies any crash or the fire that {{was reported in the}} area. While they go through the area on their own, Gary is <b>lifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and shaken like a rag doll by an invisible force, and Richie, although he stands within a few feet of him, can't see him. Meanwhile, in Washington, Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy Miles, an abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior. The younger Miles tells him about Hoese's disappearance, and his concern that the abductions have begun again.|$|E
5|$|Early on the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, March1, at 1:08pm CST (19:08 UTC), a destructive tornado first developed near the Enterprise Municipal Airport. The tornado <b>lifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> briefly before returning to the ground as an even stronger storm. It quickly slammed into Enterprise, Alabama, at 1:12pm CST (19:12 UTC). The tornado left severe damage throughout a large section of the city. The most severe damage took place at Enterprise High School, where a section of the school was destroyed {{during the middle of the}} school day. Eight students were killed at the school and 50 other people were taken to local hospitals. Some early reports suggested that there had been as many as 15 deaths at Enterprise High School and 18 deaths statewide, which was found to be an over-estimation. It was the first killer tornado at a US school since the Grand Isle, Louisiana tornado in 1993, and the deadliest tornado-related school disaster since one in Belvidere, Illinois in 1967. One other death was reported in Enterprise at a nearby private residence when a woman's living room window was shattered by the tornado.|$|E

The following year, Schwartzwalder again led the Mules to a 9-1 record, with the only loss coming by one point to Temple. However, the Mules declined {{an invitation to the}} Tangerine Bowl.|$|E
25|$|EF3 (T6-T7) {{damage is}} a serious risk to life and limb and {{the point at which}} a tornado {{statistically}} becomes significantly more destructive and deadly. Few parts of affected buildings are left standing; well-built structures lose all outer and some inner walls. Unanchored homes are swept away, and homes with poor anchoring may collapse entirely. Small vehicles and similarly sized objects are <b>lifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and tossed as projectiles. Wooded areas will suffer almost total loss of vegetation, and some tree debarking may occur. Statistically speaking, EF3 is the maximum level that allows for reasonably effective residential sheltering in place in a first floor interior room closest {{to the center of the}} house (the most widespread tornado sheltering procedure in America for those with no basement or underground storm shelter).|$|E
500|$|Between [...] and [...] {{down the}} runway, the {{aircraft}} reached take-off speed, <b>lifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and began climbing normally as the crew retracted the landing gear. Upon climbing through , the aircraft began banking to the right. The climbing bank {{continued to increase}} at a rate which alarmed witnesses, and soon after the aircraft rolled through 90° (at which point the wings were vertical to the ground). At a height of around , with all four engines producing take-off thrust, the nose began to fall. Moments later the right wing and nose impacted the ground, causing the fuselage to cartwheel over, before the aircraft came to rest, with the correct side up. It was immediately engulfed in flames. All {{three members of the}} flight crew were instantly killed. Although emergency services at Long Island MacArthur promptly responded to the crash, the aircraft was destroyed by the post-crash fire.|$|E

5000|$|A {{roof flap}} is an {{aerodynamic}} feature on race cars, mainly stock cars, which functions {{as an emergency}} spoiler to prevent <b>the</b> vehicle from <b>lifting</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> flaps are stowed during normal vehicle operation; however, in certain situations, e.g., if the vehicle goes into a spin, particularly if it is facing backwards, the flaps deploy to disrupt the air flow over the roof and reduce the lift force on the vehicle.|$|R
500|$|At 6:03p.m.CDT (2303UTC), a large tornadic wall cloud {{formed and}} touched down, {{initially}} {{in the form}} of several smaller sub-vortices, [...] west-southwest of El Reno. The tornado ultimately attained EF3 intensity during its existence, according to ground surveys. As the tornado passed south of El Reno across Highway 81, it grew to an unprecedented width of , becoming the widest known tornado ever recorded in the United States. At 6:28p.m.CDT (2328UTC), the storm began moving into more densely populated areas of Canadian County while maintaining its intensity. This prompted the National Weather Service office in Norman to issue a tornado emergency for Yukon, Richland, Wiley Post Airport, Bethany, The Village, and eastern El Reno, as the tornado was projected to track towards western portions of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. Within minutes, the tornado turned northeast and soon passed directly over Interstate 40 at around 6:42p.m.CDT (2342UTC). Shortly thereafter, the tornado <b>lifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> as it neared Banner Road. Overall, the tornado was on the ground for 40 minutes along a [...] path.|$|E
500|$|Stela 6 {{is located}} {{on the south side of}} the Main Plaza in Group C, just north of the South Pyramid. It was {{discovered}} in 1988 and had been broken into many pieces, although the base of the stela was still in situ. Two other large fragments were lying on the surface and more than 100 smaller fragments were collected. The stela appears to have shattered when it fell, some time after Motul de San José had been abandoned. The north and south faces of the stela bore sculpted designs, the remaining butt of the stela has the left foot of a human figure worked in profile on the south side. The sculpture on the north side has been pieced together in part and appears to have shown the figure of a ruler of the city dressed in rich clothing and regalia. The figure was positioned performing a dance, with one foot half <b>lifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> In his right hand the ruler held a God K sceptre. The prelimanry reconstruction of the sculpture indicates that the figure of the king measured between [...] high. Stela 6 is very similar to Stela 1 from Dos Pilas with both depicting the ruler in an identical position. The stela appears to have been a relatively late addition to the plaza and dates to the Late Postclassic period.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 1:00 am CST (0700 UTC), {{the broken}} squall line that had affected Oklahoma and Missouri entered {{the state of}} Alabama. Individual supercell storms began to develop ahead of the squall line along the AlabamaMississippi border due to the strengthening of the upper level jet stream. A supercell that developed over Starkville, Mississippi, and tracked over Lamar, Marion and Fayette Counties in Alabama spawned a tornado in Lawrence County, Alabama, at 3:02 am CST (0902 UTC). The tornado touched down south of Moulton near the William B. Bankhead National Forest. Many houses were damaged or destroyed, and a church was leveled. Three fatalities, all from a single family, were reported north of Aldridge Grove. A large, brick, two story home was completely leveled to the ground at one location, and a truck was thrown more than 100 yards into a field. Fence posts anchored in concrete were ripped {{out of the ground}} and thrown up to 100 feet away in different directions. Numerous large trees were snapped, uprooted, and denuded along the path as well. In addition to the other three fatalities, an elderly woman was also killed in the destruction of her mobile home, and 23 others were injured. The tornado was initially classified as an EF3, although it was upgraded to EF4 in later analysis. The hardest hit communities were the rural communities of Wren, Speake, Pin Hook and Five Points. The tornado moved into Morgan County and threatened the Decatur area, leading the NWS in Huntsville to issue a tornado emergency (the fifth for the outbreak) for Morgan County and southern Limestone County. [...] The tornado <b>lifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> before reaching Decatur. The same supercell moved over the Huntsville Metro area, though no tornadoes were reported.|$|E
5000|$|Décollage is now {{commonly}} used in the French language in regard to aviation (as when an aeroplane <b>lifts</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground).</b> More recently <b>the</b> term {{has been used in}} space flight; the web page for ESA indicates its use equivalent to [...] "We have lift-off!" [...] at a NASA launch center.|$|R
50|$|Excessive roll stiffness, {{typically}} {{achieved by}} configuring an anti-roll bar too aggressively, can make <b>the</b> inside wheels <b>lift</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> during hard cornering. This {{can be used}} to advantage: many front wheel drive production cars lift a rear wheel when cornering hard in order to overload the opposite wheel, limiting understeer.|$|R

2500|$|EF2 (T4-T5) tornadoes are {{the lower}} end of [...] "significant", and yet are {{stronger}} than most tropical cyclones (though tropical cyclones affect a much larger area and their winds take place for a much longer duration). Well-built structures can suffer serious damage, including roof loss, and collapse of some exterior walls may occur at poorly built structures. Mobile homes, however, are totally destroyed. Vehicles can be <b>lifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and lighter objects can become small missiles, causing damage outside of the tornado's main path. Wooded areas will have a large percentage of their trees snapped or uprooted.|$|E
2500|$|Orthostatic tremor is {{characterized}} by fast (>12Hz) rhythmic muscle contractions {{that occur in the}} legs and trunk immediately after standing. Cramps are felt in the thighs and legs and the patient may shake uncontrollably when asked to stand in one spot. [...] No other clinical signs or symptoms are present and the shaking ceases when the patient sits or is <b>lifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The high frequency of the tremor often makes the tremor look like rippling of leg muscles while standing. Orthostatic tremor may also occur in patients who have essential tremor, and there might be an overlap between these categories of tremor.|$|E
2500|$|Wright's fifth studio record Never Love You Enough (2001) {{reached the}} top 10 of the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Both the title track and [...] "Jezebel" [...] were top 30 hit singles on the country songs chart. After {{releasing}} an extended play, Wright launched her sixth studio album in February 2005, The Metropolitan Hotel. She took a five-year hiatus between the latter and her seventh studio album <b>Lifted</b> <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ground</b> (2010). Spending 13 weeks on the country albums chart, it peaked at number 32 and also charted within the Billboard 200. Chely Wright has sold over one million records according to Nielsen Soundscan.|$|E
50|$|Karts do {{not have}} a {{differential}}. The lack of a differential means that one rear tire must slide while cornering; this is achieved by designing the chassis so that the inside rear tire lifts up slightly when the kart turns the corner. This allows the tire to lose some of its grip and slide or <b>lift</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> completely.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the next}} match {{was made at}} the request of Kane, and had its roots in both a shift in {{character}} for Kane and a match at the previous year's Survivor Series. Kane's storyline brother, The Undertaker, challenged Vince McMahon to a Buried Alive match. Kane, who had adopted a much more sadistic persona since being forced to unmask back in June 2003, interfered in the match and buried his brother under several tons of dirt, apparently killing him. On the November 20 episode of SmackDown, Kane appeared to give the eulogy for his brother, claiming that The Undertaker was no longer his brother and had died a long time before that as he no longer embraced his dark side. This rewarded him a title match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Armageddon (2003) which it was won by Triple H in a triple threat match also involving Goldberg. Two months later, Kane participated in the Royal Rumble and was eliminated by Booker T after the bell from The Undertaker's old theme music began playing just to upset and distracted him. Over the following weeks, Kane repeatedly insisted that The Undertaker was [...] "dead", only to be met with various paranormal incidents such as a rainstorm localized over the ramp on which he stood. On the last episode of Raw, Kane appeared to the ring and saw an empty Casket standing in the ring but as he opened it, he saw an urn inside of it. He then grabbed the microphone and asked if that's what he's been looking forward to. He also stated it's going to take more than an empty casket and an urn to intimidate and beat him. He then stated that the Undertaker's legacy, his 11–0 WrestleMania streak and his life {{is coming to an end}} as he said [...] "it's back to the grave for you for good". As he claimed that It's over and that he's not afraid of the Undertaker. The lights turned out but this time, the 10,000 pound wrestling ring <b>lifted</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> with Kane standing in it and tilted side ways, which would be the final message sent from the Undertaker before their match at WrestleMania XX.|$|E

25|$|Riders {{take a seat}} {{in one of the}} 15 {{carriages}} which hold 2 riders each (for a {{total of}} 30 riders). There is no seat belt or restraint system on the ride, only a cage to hold on to during the ride as when the ride is in operation, gravity will keep the rider in place. Once the ride operators give the all clear, the ride begins to spin in a circle constantly picking up speed. It can take about 20 to 25 seconds for the ride to reach its top speed and <b>lift</b> <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> After <b>the</b> ride <b>lifts</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>the</b> ride keeps rising eventually coming to an almost-vertical position.
