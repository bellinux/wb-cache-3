Based on data that {{released}} in 2009 by Directorate General of Housing Ministry of Public Works Republic of Indonesia, the rate <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water at national level have reached 37 %. This figure has much influence {{to the ability of}} MW to supply water to the consumers. The more <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water occur, the more the ability of MW to supply water slackens. The objective of this research is to make model <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water as well as to know about the volume <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water. WB-EasyCalc 1. 07 software was used to analyze model. Analysis has been done by reading the graph of water balance resulted from the model. In addition, the ratio between value of non-revenue water that available in the past and reliable field data has also needed. Field data was taken from observation and by using questioner method, where as respondent was the technician of MW and the consumers. The result of the model was a water balance. Based on 2009 water balance, Semarang has 57. 4 % non-revenue water and <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water were 30. 55 % and represent the higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water.
