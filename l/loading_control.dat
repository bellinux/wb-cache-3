40|$|This article {{presents}} a design of pilot-assisted <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve with <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and fast opening feature based on static and dynamic modeling. Traditional <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valves {{do not have}} the <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve to achieve <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve achieve <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time. Static modeling method based on force balance and Bernoulli orifice pressure-flow equation is used to design the <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability of the valve. Dynamic modeling method based on Newton’s second law and fluid continuity equation is used to optimize the parameters to give the proposed <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve a fast opening feature. An actual <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve was developed according to the above methods and the test results show both good <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and fast opening feature of the design, which validates the potentiality of the proposed design in many applications...|$|R

40|$|Frequency {{regulation}} and generation-load balancing are key issues in power transmission networks. Complementary to generation <b>control,</b> <b>loads</b> provide flexible and fast responsive sources for frequency regulation, and local frequency measurement capability of loads offers {{the opportunity of}} decentralized control. In this paper, we propose an optimal <b>load</b> <b>control</b> problem, which balances the load reduction (or increase) with the generation shortfall (or surplus), resynchronizes the bus frequencies, and minimizes a measure of aggregate disutility of participation in such a <b>load</b> <b>control.</b> We find that, a frequency-based <b>load</b> <b>control</b> coupled with the dynamics of swing equations and branch power flows serve as a distributed primal-dual algorithm to solve the optimal <b>load</b> <b>control</b> problem and its dual.

CSF protein biomarkers identified by high-throughput methods, however, require further validation. While Western blotting (WB) is well-suited to this task, the lack of a validated <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> for CSF WB limits the method's accuracy. New methodWe investigated the use of total protein (TP) as a CSF WB <b>loading</b> <b>control.</b> Using iodine-based reversible membrane staining, we determined the linear range and consistency of the CSF TP signal. We then spiked green fluorescent protein (GFP) into CSF to create defined sample-to-sample differences in GFP levels that were measured by WB before and after TP loading correction. Levels of CSF complement C 3 and cystatin C measured by WB with TP loading correction and ELISA in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and healthy control CSF samples were then compared. ResultsCSF WB with the TP <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> accurately detected defined differences in GFP levels and corrected for simulated loading errors. Individual CSF sample Western blot and ELISA measurements of complement C 3 and cystatin C were significantly correlated and the methods showed a comparable ability to detect between-groups differences. Comparison with existing methodCSF TP staining has a greater linear dynamic range and sample-to-sample consistency than albumin, a commonly used CSF <b>loading</b> <b>control.</b> The method accurately corrects for simulated errors in loading and improves the sensitivity of CSF WB compared to using no <b>loading</b> <b>control.</b> ConclusionsThe TP staining <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> improves the sensitivity and accuracy of CSF WB results...|$|E
40|$|Western blot of {{synovial}} fluid {{has been widely}} used for osteoarthritis (OA) research and diagnosis, {{but there is no}} ideal <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> for this purpose. Although β-actin is extensively used as <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> in western blot, it is not suitable for {{synovial fluid}} because it is not required in synovial fluid as a cytoskeletal protein. A good <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> for synovial fluid in OA studies should have unchanged content in synovial fluids from normal and OA groups, because synovial fluid protein content can vary with changes in synovial vascular permeability with OA onset. In this study, we explore the potential of using α 1 -antitripsin (A 1 AT) as <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> for OA synovial fluid in western blot. A 1 AT level is elevated in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Unlike RA, OA is a non-inflammation disease, which does not induce A 1 AT. In this study, we identified A 1 AT as an abundant component of synovial fluid by Mass Spectrometry and confirmed that the level of A 1 AT is relative constant between human OA and normal synovial fluid by western blot and ELISA. Hence, we proposed that A 1 AT may be a good <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> for western blot in human OA synovial fluid studies provided that pathological conditions such as RA or A 1 AT deficiency associated liver or lung diseases are excluded...|$|E

Its mechanical characteristic is so complicated and anisotropic that the performance is quite different between the single-axis loading and the double-axis loading. So the experimental results with the single-axis loading will usually lead to unexpected results. With the development and widely application of membrane materials, the double-axis property experiment plays an increasingly important role all around the world. Considering the situation mentioned above, a double-axis electro-hydraulic proportional <b>loading</b> <b>control</b> system with intelligent dual-PID is proposed in this paper, which controls four cylinders respectively {{with the help of}} four electro-hydraulic proportional directional valves.
