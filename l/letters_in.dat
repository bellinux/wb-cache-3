5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer the <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> their name over other <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> the alphabet. Whether subjects are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out {{of a set of}} two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.|$|E

5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E
5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E
