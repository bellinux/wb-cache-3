Population {{growth in}} the United States is {{currently}} fueled by immigrants {{and the children of}} immigrants (Olmedo, 2004). This is especially true of the metropolitan area of Miami-Dade which holds one of the largest populations of foreign-born residents at 1. 2 million (U. S. Census, 2003) in the United States. The ability of the school systems and social service agencies to absorb and serve these new arrivals is important for the future economic and social health of this region. In this paper we analyze the school readiness results of a cohort of immigrant children living in Miami and receiving childcare subsidies. The school readiness measures used, the DECA, a measure of social and emotional development, and the <b>LAP-D,</b> a comprehensive developmental battery, demonstrated that these children of immigrants, as a whole, are not significantly behind in school readiness compared to their non-immigrant peers attending the same preschools. This suggests that poverty, not immigration status, is what puts children at risk. Being an immigrant may even afford some advantages, especially in predicting healthy social and emocional development. These results can help change the perception of the larger community on how the immigrant experience shapes the young learner...|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Past {{findings}} have established how the faster growth, greater reproductive output and/or longer survival {{that are associated}} with heterosis and genomic diversity measured as multi-locus heterozygosity stem from slower intensities with which proteins are renewed and replaced (=protein turnover). Slower turnover results in lower energy requirements and reduced metabolic sensitivity to environmental change, representing a mechanistic basis for evolutionary consequences of genetic polymorphism. To determine the genetic and functional basis of differences in whole-body protein turnover, we have begun to resolve different proteolytic pathways, searching for genetic polymorphisms with a direct effect upon proteolysis, and assessing the metabolic and physiological consequences of those genetic influences in the mussel Mytilus edulis. Our recent work has established the physiological importance of lysosomal enzymes under normal conditions of basal proteolysis, and shown that associated effects on energy flux may vary according to functional differences between separate enzymes. Data are presented here which compare metabolic consequences of polymorphism in the lysosomal aminopeptidases <b>Lap-</b> 1 and <b>Lap-</b> 2. Findings establish that metabolic and phenotypic effects of genetic polymorphism result directly from genetic variation at the loci coding for these peptidases, rather than from linked loci. They also illustrate the complexity of interrelations that ultimately influence the evolutionary consequences of genomic diversity, including associated influences of both <b>Lap-</b> 1 and <b>Lap-</b> 2 on energy requirements and animal condition. We impress that energy requirements for protein turnover may represent a functional basis for epistasis, including associations whereby advantages of genetic polymorphism are greatest at loci that code for enzymes acting in both protein catabolism and energy provision...|$|R

40|$|Leucine {{aminopeptidase}} (LAP) {{could be}} used to remove the bitterness of peptides. The majority of Escherichia coli overexpressed Aspergillus oryzae LAP formed inclusion bodies while using pQE 30 expression system. To promote the solubility of LAP in E. coli, lap gene was constructed into pET 32 a and expressed in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3). About 95 % of thioredoxin-LAP (Trx-LAP) fusion protein was overexpressed in soluble form. However, the relative activity of Trx-LAP was only 12 mU/mg, which decreased over 10, 000 folds comparing with purified native A. oryzae LAP (relative activity 136 U/mg). The most suitable substrate of Trx-LAP was Leu-p-nitroanilide. Incubation at 23 ℃ for 2 days led to about 40 fold increase in the activity of Trx-LAP. Removal of thioredoxin from Trx-LAP by enterokinase could also increase LAP activity. Meanwhile, the hydrolytic activity toward Lys-p-nitroanilide was improved. After the removal of thioredoxin, the substrate specificities of the enzyme are similar with A. sojae LAP owing to the hydrolytic activity to Phe-p-nitroanilide increased to 51. 9 % (compared with Leu-p-nitroanilide). Both native A. oryzae and A. sojae LAPs have the highest activities to Leu-p-nitroanilide, but difference in the activities to other substrates. Only four residues are different (at positions 152, 183, 192, and 248) between the two LAPs. Each of the four residues were changed by site-directed mutagenesis. The Gly- 192 -Ser mutant lost the LAP activity completely, while the other mutants showed indifference on substrate specificities. The activities of Ser- 152 -Phe, Ser- 248 -Leu, and Asp- 183 -Asn decreased 80, 60, and 50 %, respectively. These mutated genes had already been transformed into A. oryzae. The enzyme activities will be determined in the future. The lap gene was highly expressed by starch as carbon source and soybean as nitrogen source at pH 8. 0. Whereas ammonium down regulated the LAP expression. The expression of LAP was not influenced by the carbon source while soybean was used as nitrogen source. Obviously, nitrogen source play a more important role than carbon source in the regulation of lap expression. A. oryzae argB- harboring pDHG-lap could express LAP in the CD medium contaning 2 % maltose. The LAP activity of A. oryzae argB [...] <b>lap-</b> 3 reached 688 mU/ml which was 90 - and 30 - fold highler than those of untransformed cell A. oryzae NCHU 1002 and A. oryzae argB-, respectively.

Approximately 27 % of embryos in P. pumila seeds had P. sibirica paternal contribution, and 8 % of haplotypes in effective pollen pool combined alleles typical for P. pumila and P. sibirica, and therefore were classified as pollinated by the hybrids. About 83 % of embryos in seeds from the hybrids most likely originated from fertilization by P. sibirica pollen, 14 % from P. pumila and 3 % from hybrid trees. This result favours the view that hybrids make {{both male and female}} contributions to the reproductive output of the population and confirm the presence of backcrosses and F 2 hybrids. </span...|$|R
40|$|Seventeen clones of Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus, 1758), 14 of R. maidis (Fitch, 1856), {{and two of}} R. insertum (Walker, 1849), {{representing}} {{a wide range of}} host plants and geographic distribution, were examined electrophoretically to determine intra and interspecific variation. Twenty-one enzyme systems were tested using starch-gel techniques. The electromorph variation within species was low, as expected for parthenogenetic organisms. Frequency of heterozygotes was also relatively low for most populations. The percentage of polymorphic loci ranged from 0 % to 27. 3 % in R. padi, but it was lower (0 % to 18. 2 %) in the completely an holocyclic R. maidis. No consistent correlation between band patterns and host plant or geographic origin could be established for R. padi and R. maidis. The distinction between R. padi and R. insertum was made by Est- 1, <b>Lap-</b> 2, Pgm, Got- 1,and &# 945;-gpdh. The enzymes Est- 2, G- 3 pdh, Sdh, and Got- 2 were useful to separate R. maidis from R. padi, while Est- 1, <b>Lap-</b> 2, Got- 1, and &# 945;-gpdh, in addition to the first three mentioned above, separated R. maidis from R. insertum. However, many other loci shared only one electromorph and had another that was useful to partially distinguish the species. The utilization of starch-gel electrophoresis as a taxonomic tool in distinguishing populations and species of aphids and its combination with other taxonomic methods are briefly discussed...|$|R
25|$|He {{went on to}} win for {{the second}} year in a row in Belgium at Spa-Francorchamps. The {{following}} race, the , saw Alonso clinch the Drivers' Championship after finishing third behind Montoya and Räikkönen. In the penultimate race of the year, at the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, Räikkönen took his 7th victory of the season after starting 17th on the grid (as rain, and an engine failure for Räikkönen, had mixed up the qualifying grid). The win was secured when he overtook Renault driver Fisichella (who had started third on the grid, and had led most of the race) on the final <b>lap–</b> which Formula One journalist Peter Windsor thought the most impressive move of the race.|$|R
30|$|The rate of {{conversion}} to laparotomy was 4.3 % in this series. It compares favourably with previous reports [24, 31, 32] and {{is consistent with the}} conversion rates reported for single-centre studies (< 10 %) [15, 20, 23] Unexpectedly, the recently published <b>LAP-</b> 2 multicentric randomised controlled trial (RCT) [32] reported a conversion rate of 26 %. This surprisingly high rate {{of conversion}} is probably more representative of the reality, without the bias of a specialised centre. However, it may be influenced by the higher prevalence of obesity among women in the USA compared with Europe [50] and the need for comprehensive surgical staging (including pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy) to meet the study protocol [32].|$|R
5000|$|Regazzoni {{got past}} Reutemann {{on the third}} lap, and the order {{by the start of}} the fourth lap was Lauda, Depailler, Pace, Regazzoni, Reutemann, and Hunt. Lauda and Depailler battled and began to pull away from the other front-runners, and this battle raged on until the 7th lap, when Depailler had a {{puncture}} and went into the pits to repair his rear suspension; he went out again, but had lost a <b>lap-</b> which at the old Nürburgring, was more than 7 minutes of lost time. Pace went off with a puncture and damaged his suspension, he retired near the Karrusell on the 6th lap, and Scheckter- who had climbed to 6th, crashed out on the 7th lap.|$|R
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. All teams, including Mercedes used the softer tyre compound during the first session (Q1). Jenson Button, who had problems with his car all during practice, was unable to set a time when his car broke down on his out lap. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, with Valtteri Bottas in second. Along with Button, both Manor Marussia cars were eliminated in Q1, as well as Daniil Kvyat– who made a mistake during his final <b>lap–</b> and Pastor Maldonado. Fernando Alonso was the first driver to reach a second qualifying session for McLaren {{over the course of the}} season.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if preschoolers with pre-writing deficits who received additional small group exposure to the Pre-K Handwriting Without Tears® (HWT) - Get Set for School TM (GSS) program would improve more in their fine motor and pre-writing skills than similar students who only received whole class Pre-K HWT® - GSS handwriting instruction. Pre and post-test data were collected using the Shore Handwriting Screening (Shore), the HWT® Check Readiness screen, the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, 2 nd Edition (BOT- 2 Fine Motor Composite), and the Learning Accomplishment Profile, 3 rd Edition (<b>LAP-</b> 3 Pre-Writing Domain). The ten lowest scoring students on the SHORE were rank ordered and paired. This cohort was chosen because of their potential for greatest benefit from additional exposure to HWT® - GSS. From each pair, students were randomly assigned to either control or experimental groups. The entire class received HWT® instruction twice weekly while the experimental group received additional exposure to the handwriting program twice weekly over a five month period. At the conclusion of the study, there were no statistically significant differences in fine motor and pre-writing skills between control and experimental groups, when assessed using the BOT- 2, <b>LAP-</b> 3, and the HWT® - GSS Check Readiness. However, the Shore did suggest pre-writing skill improvement of the control group (p-value = 0. 053) as compared to the experimental group. In conclusion, twice weekly HWT® - GSS, implemented on a whole class basis using occupational therapy support, was beneficial in enhancing handwriting readiness in preschoolers at Head Start. Additional small group exposure to the HWT® - GSS program was not needed for handwriting readiness, but may produce additional benefits in a targeted subset of fine motor skills.   M. S...|$|R
30|$|The work in [20] {{proposed}} {{a novel approach}} for top-k query. The basic idea of it is to use filters for each node, which can filter the unnecessary sensor updates. Silberstein et al. [19] studied the optimizing top-k queries in wireless sensor networks. The authors proposed to use samples of past sensor readings, which can reduce energy significantly. The work in [18] focuses on the location aware peak value query in sensor networks. It consider the top-k values’ location which is not considered the traditional top-k query. The authors defined <b>LAP-</b> (D,k) query which can find top-k values and the distance between any two values is larger than D. However, these papers only consider peak values. In face, besides peak values, the extremum and inflection points are also critical points.|$|R
