25|$|A UK DfES report {{suggested}} that Waldorf and state schools could <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> other's strengths: in particular, that state schools {{could benefit from}} Waldorf education's early introduction and approach to modern foreign languages; combination of block (class) and subject teaching for younger children; development of speaking and listening through an emphasis on oral work; good pacing of lessons through an emphasis on rhythm; emphasis on child development guiding the curriculum and examinations; approach to art and creativity; attention given to teachers’ reflective activity and heightened awareness (in collective child study for example); and collegial structure of leadership and management, including collegial study. Aspects of mainstream practice which could inform good practice in Waldorf schools included: management skills and ways of improving organizational and administrative efficiency; classroom management; work with secondary-school age children; and assessment and record keeping.|$|E
25|$|Camp Bucca {{has been}} {{described}} as playing an important role in shaping the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The detention of large numbers of Jihadists and ex-Ba’athists during the Iraqi insurgency provided them with the opportunity to forge alliances and <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> other, combining the ideological fervour of the former with the organizational skills of the latter. Former Camp Bucca detainees who went on to become leaders in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant include Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, detained between 2005 and 2010 during the Iraq conflict and who is now an ISIS senior leader, its chief spokesman and is said to be running the entire country of Syria. Al-Adnani, in 2014, called for lone wolf attacks throughout the world and is thought to be the inspiration for terrorist attacks throughout France. He was killed in an airstrike in Northern Syria on 31 August 2016. Others include Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the ISIL; Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, al-Baghdadi's deputy; Haji Bakr, who spearheaded ISIL's expansion into Syria; Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi, the military leader responsible for planning the seizure of Mosul; and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another senior military leader. Abu Mohammad al-Julani, who founded the Syrian Al Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, was also a Camp Bucca detainee.|$|E

25|$|Master of Magic splits spells {{into six}} schools of magic: Life Magic, which heals and protects; its antithesis Death Magic, which drains life and creates undead; Chaos Magic, which warps targets and spews {{destructive}} energies; Nature Magic, which controls {{the weather and}} turns it against the enemy; Sorcery, which manipulates the air and subverts {{the effects of the}} other schools; and Arcane Magic, which is a general school and free for all. Players select spellbooks from desired schools, allowing them to research and cast spells from those schools. The number of spells a wizard could <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> school was dependent upon the number of books taken for that school. Additionally, the player could select traits instead of additional spellbooks. These traits would provide a special bonus throughout the game. There are global spells that can affect targets all across the world. Unit or city enhancement spells can boost the potential of its target, such as increasing the movement and attack speed of units, enabling them to regenerate wounds, and increasing the power of their attacks. Wizards can summon fantastic creatures related to their schools. The player can research combat spells, which include direct attacks, debuffs and traps. The final spell learned is the Arcane Spell of Mastery, which takes enormous resources to research and cast but instantly wins the game for the casting player.|$|E

Fry met Adolf Hitler who greeted him with a Nazi salute which he returned with a Nazi salute of his own. He failed to persuade von Ribbentrop that Nazi Germany should take up cricket to Test level. Some members of the Hitler Youth were welcomed at TS Mercury, and Fry was still enthusiastic about them in 1938, just prior to the outbreak of war. Fry's laudatory statements about Hitler persisted through his autobiography's third impression in July 1941 but appear to have been purged in the fourth impression (1947).|$|E

2500|$|Dolphy and John Coltrane {{knew each}} other long before they {{formally}} played together, having met when Coltrane was in Los Angeles with Miles Davis. They would often exchange ideas and <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> other, and eventually, after many nights sitting in with Coltrane's band, Dolphy was asked to become a full member. Coltrane had gained an audience and critical notice with Miles Davis's quintet, but alienated some jazz critics {{when he began to}} move away from hard bop. Although Coltrane's quintets with Dolphy (including the Village Vanguard and Africa/Brass sessions) are now well regarded, they originally provoked Down Beat magazine to brand Coltrane and Dolphy's music as 'anti-jazz'.

2500|$|There are {{rigorous}} {{procedures in}} place to minimise the risk of accidental overexposure of radiation therapy to patients. However, mistakes do occasionally occur; for example, the radiation therapy machine Therac-25 was responsible {{for at least six}} accidents between 1985 and 1987, where patients were given up to one hundred times the intended dose; two people were killed directly by the radiation overdoses. From 2005 to 2010, a hospital in Missouri overexposed 76 patients (most with brain cancer) during a five-year period because new radiation equipment had been set up incorrectly. Although medical errors are exceptionally rare, radiation oncologists, medical physicists {{and other members of the}} radiation therapy treatment team are working to eliminate them. ASTRO has launched a safety initiative called [...] that, among other things, aims to record errors nationwide so that doctors can <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> and every mistake and prevent them from happening.

2500|$|The head of story, Don Hall, {{described}} the plot as {{a fairy tale}} [...] "twisted enough that it seems new and fresh", with a kingdom that is a modern city, a handsome prince that is a [...] "knuckleheaded playboy" [...] and {{a variation on the}} fairy godmother with Mama Odie. Co-writer Rob Edwards also said The Princess and the Frog was [...] "a princess movie for people who don't like princess movies". As the writers thought Tiana's character motivation of simply dreaming of having her own restaurant was not appealing enough, they expanded so it was her father's as well, with the extra philosophy of [...] "food bringing people together from all walks of life". Musker and Clements stated that while Tiana already starts as a sympathetic character, the events of the plot make her [...] "understand things in a deeper level" [...] and change people around her. Both protagonists would <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> other— Naveen to take responsibilities, Tiana to enjoy life— as well as figuring from Ray's passion for Evangeline that the perfect balance is brought by having someone you love to share the experience.
