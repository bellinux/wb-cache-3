The architecture of the stem vascular system of zinnia cv Envy contains three anatomically distinct vascular bundles {{at different stages of}} development. Juvenile vascular strands of the subapical region develop into mature vascular strands with <b>leaf</b> <b>trace</b> segments and stem segments. Characteristic patterns of gene expression in juvenile, <b>leaf</b> <b>trace,</b> and stem bundles are revealed by a molecular marker, a RING domain-encoding gene, ZeRH 2. 1, originally isolated from a zinnia cDNA library derived from differentiating in vitro cultures. Using RNA in situ hybridization, we show that ZeRH 2. 1 is expressed preferentially in two specific cell types in mature zinnia stems. In <b>leaf</b> <b>trace</b> bundles, ZeRH 2. 1 transcript is abundant in xylem parenchyma cells, while in stem bundles it is abundant in phloem companion cells.

The stem has vascular bundles that are encircled by a bi-layered sheath and has a ground tissue consisting of thicker-walled and thinner-walled parenchymatous cells and dispersed nests of sclerenchymatous cells. Two sclerenchymatous strands occur between neighboring stelar cycles, with this species lacking a peripheral sclerenchyma sheath and possessing a "chrysanthemum"-shaped sclerenchyma strands in the adaxial bay of the peripheral vascular bundles.

Cortex is not differentiated into an inner parenchymatous and outer sclerenchymatous zone characteristic {{of members of the}} Osmundaceae, and possesses longitudinally elongated cells and large secretory cells. Leaf traces are numerous (> 100) and adaxially curved, with two endarch protoxylem strands upon departing the stele, increasing to more than four protoxylem strands as the trace passes the cortex, all distributed along the adaxial side of the <b>leaf</b> <b>trace.</b> Leaf traces have more-or-less incurved lateral tips, and are encircled by a vascular bundle sheath. A mass of thick-walled, longitudinally elongated cells occur in the adaxial concavity of the <b>leaf</b> <b>trace.</b> Adventitious roots arise singly from the abaxial and lateral margin of individual departing leaf traces, and extend in a sinuous manner horizontally and longitudinally. Abundant tyloses-like contents occur in cells of the cortex and represent the first account of these within fossil Osmundales, but unlike other plant groups in which they occur within xylem, fibre-tracheids and lactifers, in T. yunnanense they occur in longitudinally elongated cortex cells where they presumably impeded fungal hyphae growth. Radially aligned ‘secondary’ parenchyma within the stem appears to represent a wound reaction in the cortex in the living plant. Due to its siphonostele without leaf gaps, Tiania is interpreted as an evolutionary intermediate between the protostelic thamnopterids and the more advanced dictyostelic osmundaleans.

40|$|Ontogenetic {{changes in}} the primary {{vasculature}} of Anagallis shoots are strictly related to phyllotaxis. During the ontogeny of Anagallis, whorled and spiral phyllotactic patterns appear alternately in a regular sequence. The initial decussate phyllotaxis is transformed into the spiral Fibonacci, and then further into trimerous pattern. This in turn may change into the spiral Lucas phyllotaxis. Sporadically the immediate transition from the decussate to trimerous phyllotaxis takes place. The vascular system in Anagallis is always closed, despite that both whorled and spiral phyllotaxes are present. Also the number of vascular traces diverging to the leaf is constant. In {{the course of a}} single phyllotactic transition, there is {{an increase in the number}} of vascular sympodia and in the number of <b>leaf</b> <b>traces</b> present in the vascular cylinder. Usually only one single sympodium and one or two traces are added to the system. The immediate addition of two sympodia occurs only during infrequent transition from the decussate to trimerous pattern. The increase in the number of sympodia is most often simultaneous with the phyllotactic transition, however, when the trimerous pattern is transformed into the spiral Lucas, the increase is delayed, sometimes for as much as ten plastochrons. In shoots with changing phyllotaxis, a sector within the vascular cylinder can be distinguished, in which the <b>leaf</b> <b>traces</b> are arranged as if the previous phyllotactic pattern continued, whereas rearrangement of traces takes place at the same level but in the complementary sector.

40|$|Palms lack {{secondary}} growth so their primary vascular system is long-lived {{and must be}} minimally vulnerable to dysfunction. For water movement, the axial xylem must be well defended against cavitation. Climbing palms can be very long and represent a maximum solution to transport problems. How is this demonstrated in their anatomy? This article contrasts stem vascular anatomy in a canelike 2 ̆ 2 tree palm 2 ̆ 2 (Rhapis excelsa) with that in the American climbing palm Desmoncus and the Old World rattan genus Calamus. Rhapis, representing the basic classical palm vasculature, has a continuously integrated vascular system determined by branching of the axial (stem) system to produce <b>leaf</b> <b>traces,</b> bridges, and continuing axial bundles. Axial transport is favored over appendicular structures because leaves are irrigated solely by narrower protoxylem tracheids. Maximum stem vessel length is inherently limited by the leaf contact distance (LCD). Desmoncus is very similar except that interconnections involve more numerous bridges and axial continuity is less obvious. Both Rhapis and Desmoncus retain scalariform perforation plates in their stem vessels. However, Calamus lacks axial continuity because axial bundles extend distally into leaves as <b>leaf</b> <b>traces</b> but end blindly in a basipetal direction. The only interconnection is via narrow transverse commissures (not bridges). Calamus stem metaxylem vessels have simple perforation plates. Resistance to water transport can be calculated, based on axial changes in metaxylem vessel diameter and is very high in the climbing palms. The unique features of Calamus may relate to safety of the hydraulic system as much as its efficiency, with Desmoncus an intermediate condition more clearly based on the classical model of palm vasculature. Calamus may have also evolved to mitigate the limitation of vessel length determined by LCD. Further anatomical solutions to the climbing habit in palms are briefly discussed...|$|R
