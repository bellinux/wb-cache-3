5|$|From 1921 to 1923 Wilson taught {{music at}} Bedales School, an {{appointment}} {{that left him}} time to take singing engagements all over the United Kingdom. In 1924 he left the English Singers and furthered his singing studies abroad, first in Nice with Jean de Reszke (1924–25), with whom he learned the roles of Otello, Parsifal and Tristan; he then took <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> Sir George Henschel (1925–28), and studied 17th- and 18th-century music with Wanda Landowska in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Music {{is part of}} {{the core}} {{curriculum}} for first to third forms. Pupils take <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> peripatetic music staff within different disciplines. There is a symphony orchestra composed of students, along with several other smaller classical ensembles. In addition to classical music, there are also a number of jazz and rock bands within the school as well, and to recognise this in addition to the four main music prizes awarded each year, there is an additional contemporary music prize.|$|E

5|$|After her graduation, Simone {{spent the}} summer of 1950 at the Juilliard School, as a student of Carl Friedberg, {{preparing}} for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Her application, however, was denied. As her family had relocated to Philadelphia in the expectation of her entry to Curtis, the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy, and she suspected that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice. Discouraged, she took private piano <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> Vladimir Sokoloff, a professor at Curtis, but never re-applied to the institution. She {{took a job as}} a photographer's assistant, but also found work as an accompanist at Arlene Smith's vocal studio and taught piano from her home in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some <b>lessons,</b> <b>with</b> the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E

5|$|In 1831, Wagner {{enrolled}} at the Leipzig University, where he {{became a member of}} the Saxon student fraternity. He took composition <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> the Thomaskantor Theodor Weinlig. Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner's musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons. He arranged for his pupil's Piano Sonata in B-flat major (which was consequently dedicated to him) to be published as Wagner's Op. 1. A year later, Wagner composed his Symphony in C major, a Beethovenesque work performed in Prague in 1832 and at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1833. He then began to work on an opera, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding), which he never completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded private <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Louise had artistic {{training}} from childhood, {{first with}} Susan Durant from 1864, then Mary Thornycroft from 1867, and further <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> Edgar Boehm. She also then attended National Art Training School, or NATS, which {{marks the first}} time a member of the British royal family attended a public education institution. Like many women artists in the nineteenth century, Louise had to make do with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists. There was no training from the nude model, as there was for male art students.|$|E

5|$|Music {{was not a}} {{priority}} at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Synge {{was educated}} privately at schools in Dublin and Bray, and later studied piano, flute, violin, music theory and {{counterpoint}} at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. He travelled {{to the continent}} to study music, but {{changed his mind and}} decided to focus on literature. He was a talented student and won a scholarship in counterpoint in 1891. The family moved to the suburb of Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) in 1888, and Synge entered Trinity College, Dublin, the following year. He graduated with a BA in 1892, having studied Irish and Hebrew, as well as continuing his music studies and playing with the Academy Orchestra in the Antient Concert Rooms. Between November 1889 and 1894 he took private music <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> Robert Prescott Stewart.|$|E
5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made a conscious effort to try to illustrate moral <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E

5|$|The Sitwells {{looked after}} their protégé both {{materially}} and culturally, giving him {{not only a}} home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher {{and the founder of}} the Second Viennese School.|$|E
5|$|According to its May 1853 {{advertisement}} in the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser, {{the institute}} provided instruction {{to the following}} grades during its summer session: fifth grade for $5, fourth grade for $8, third grade for $10, second grade for $12, and first grade (its highest grade) for $15. Boarding, including laundry, meals, and lighting, was $45, and music <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> use of the piano were $25. An additional fee of 25 cents was charged if a student was suspended. The fifth grade was taught by the institute's Primary Department, and lessons included spelling, reading and elementary arithmetic. The fourth grade was taught by the institute's Junior Department and included courses in writing and preparatory English grammar and geography. The third grade was instructed by the English Department and offered studies in geography and English; and the second grade was also taught by the English Department with courses in history and natural philosophy. The school's highest grade, first grade, was instructed by the Classical and Mathematical Department and offered studies in Greek, Latin, French, geometry, algebra, trigonometry, surveying, mensuration, navigation, astronomy, and bookkeeping.|$|E
5|$|After Kieswetter's {{retirement}} from cricket, his father {{suggested that he}} {{take a break and}} play some golf. He had done so during his youth in South Africa, playing in provincial tournaments. After some <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> David Leadbetter, who suggested that he try to become a professional golfer, Kieswetter began to enter amateur tournaments. After performing well in those events, he set himself a target of becoming a professional, and playing regularly on the European Tour. In late 2016, he took part in a couple of PGA EuroPro Tour tournaments and one on the MENA Golf Tour. In early 2017, he turned professional and in March played in the MENA Golf Tour qualifying school in Morocco, finishing tied for 31st place and earning a card for the 2017 season. He played regularly on the Tour during 2017 and in September won his biggest prize of the season, winning US$360 in the Dubai Creek Open after finishing tied for 38th place.|$|E

30|$|I {{was excited}} {{to be given the}} {{opportunity}} to co-teach the revised <b>lesson</b> plan <b>with</b> Kenny. There was some level of uncertainty on whether the lesson would turn out well. I acknowledged that even though the hands-on activities had proven to engage my students, it may not produce a similar outcome with Kenny’s students. In addition, following through the co-planned <b>lesson</b> <b>with</b> coteaching was something different from my past teaching experience when I usually taught a lesson independently. Having the privilege to co-teach the revised <b>lesson</b> <b>with</b> Kenny enabled me to experience first-hand responses of the students towards a lesson that had been revised based upon students’ suggestions. The in-class responses from the students could suggest the success of the lesson.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the idea}} of {{becoming}} a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes {{to pursue a career}} as an actor, since {{he would have had to}} wait two years to audition for their acting program. Franco instead chose to take acting <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian until working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial ("McDonald’s was there for me when no one else was").|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} his weekly <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.|$|E
5|$|Erik Chisholm {{was the son}} of John Chisholm, master house painter, and his wife, Elizabeth McGeachy Macleod. He left Queen's Park School, Glasgow, at {{the early}} age of 13 due to ill-health but showed a talent for music {{composition}} and some of his pieces were published during his childhood. He had piano <b>lessons</b> <b>with</b> Philip Halstead at Glasgow's Athenaeum School of Music, now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and later studied the organ under Herbert Walton, the organist at Glasgow Cathedral. By the time he was 12 he was giving organ recitals including an important one in Kingston upon Hull. The pianist Leff Pouishnoff then became his principal teacher and mentor. In 1927 he travelled to Nova Scotia, Canada, where he was appointed the organist and choirmaster at the Westminster Presbyterian Church, New Glasgow, and director of music at Pictou Academy.|$|E
