500|$|Phoebe-Lou Adams of The Atlantic gave a {{negative}} review and criticized the [...] "enormous, gigantic, monstrous historical novel" [...] for containing a protagonist who [...] "suffers and suffers and suffers while innumerable soap-opera types minuet about in fancy dress. The period is early eighteenth century, {{and the research}} underlying the gallimaufry is thorough {{beyond the call of}} duty." [...] In response to some bad attention her novel received, which she said [...] "hurt like hell," [...] Koen noted the persistence of [...] "in-fighting" [...] within the publishing industry. [...] "Who reviews your book has a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> kind of review you get," [...] she said.|$|E

"When I {{was writing}} it, I {{was sitting in}} a fourth-floor walk-up on Avenue-B, and there was this {{gorgeous}} Puerto Rican boy sitting across me that I wanted {{to go out on a}} date with, and I just wanted to get the song over with. I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E

500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] {{and that it}} would be wrong to record new {{material}} under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... I think that has a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way he would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Sire Records had marketed the [...] "Everybody" [...] single as if Madonna {{was a black}} artist. This {{misconception}} {{was cleared}} by {{the release of the}} music video for the song. Regarding the importance of shooting a music video for the song, Madonna commented that, [...] "If I didn't have a video, I don't think all the kids in the Midwest would know about me. It takes the place of touring. Everybody sees them everywhere. That really has a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> success of my album." [...] She invited Sire Records executives, including Stein and Rosenblatt, to the New York nightclub Danceteria. She performed [...] "Everybody" [...] on the dancefloor, wearing a top hat and tails. On the night of the performance, Madonna's friend Haoui Montaug introduced her to the 300 strong audience. Cheered by them, Madonna and her dancers performed their choreographed dance moves, later described as a 'disco act backed by avant-garde dancers.' Seeing the performance, they also realised that Madonna appeared visually stunning. They ordered an in-house video of [...] "Everybody" [...] to be sent to the clubs around the country which used dance videos.|$|E
500|$|New York Dolls {{features}} 10 original {{songs and}} 1 cover—the 1963 Bo Diddley song [...] "Pills". Johansen described the album as [...] "a little jewel of urban folk art". Rundgren, {{on the other}} hand, said the band's sensibilities were different from [...] "the urban New York thing" [...] {{because they had been}} raised outside Manhattan and drew on carefree rock and roll and Brill Building pop influences such as the Shangri-Las: [...] "Their songs, as punky as they were, usually had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same old boy-girl thing but in a much more inebriated way." [...] Johansen quoted the lyric [...] "you'd best believe I'm in love L-U-V" [...] from the Shangri-Las' [...] "Give Him a Great Big Kiss" [...] (1964) when he opened [...] "Looking for a Kiss", which tells a story of adolescent romantic desire hampered by peers who use drugs. On [...] "Subway Train", he used lyrics from the American folk standard [...] "Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah". In the opinion of critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the album's rowdy hard rock songs also revamped riffs from Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones, resulting in music that sounded edgy and threatening in spite of the New York Dolls' wittingly kitsch and camp sensibilities. [...] "Personality Crisis" [...] featured raunchy dual guitars, boogie-woogie piano, and a histrionic pause, while [...] "Trash" [...] was a punky pop rock song with brassy singing.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson stated [...] "Of course {{everyone}} wants to sell records and be number one. And I think that's important. But {{for a lot of}} artists today, it's all about the money as opposed to the art. What happened to artists creating this wonderful body of music that touches people and changes their lives?" [...] In response to boycotted promotion, Jackson stated [...] "A lot of people said they didn't even know the project was out, and I think that had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> response. Yet a lot of fans in Europe came up to me saying they absolutely felt it was my best album. There were all kinds of reactions to the album, and there was obviously a lot of drama surrounding that album as well." [...] Productions deadlines also caused Jackson to rush, saying [...] "Deadlines are hard for me; I don't like being forced to do things when you know you're not ready; when you're on the right path but you know you haven't gotten to the place you want to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We don't play {{anything}} really different—we play melodically and rhythmically", {{he said in}} a 1965 interview. [...] "I think that's why the [...] Stones {{have made}} it. They don't do anything really fantastic but they have good taste, and good taste is more important than speed." [...] Sal Valentino praised Elliott's vocal style, saying that [...] "Ron had a great low register. He knew how to write in the best keys for me." [...] Valentino added, [...] "From the time I started singing in bands, I didn't really sing too many other people's songs other than Ron's. Being able to sing just one person's writing, who was a pretty able writer with ability to adjust to what he's working with, had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> way I sang." [...] Valentino also credited Sly Stone's input for the band's early success. [...] "He {{had a lot to do}} with making our music relatable and anticipating how our records would sound on the radio, particularly on the bottom, rhythm end.

2500|$|The {{result of}} these changes was that the lyrics on the album {{moved away from the}} overtly {{political}} lyrics of the early Scritti Politti EPs towards those that explored linguistics as a means of expressing personal politics and deconstructing the traditional love song. As Gartside explained, [...] "The problematic of language is present on the LP as an essential filter to each of the songs, dealing as most of them do with love and sexuality". He described [...] "The 'Sweetest Girl'" [...] as [...] "the tendency for things to fall apart in the light of political awareness", or as he put it more directly in another interview, [...] "It's got a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> promise and the myth and the cliché of the sweetest girl", or how the male idealised vision of the perfect girl was a myth, hence the inverted commas around the song's title (a subject and a grammatical trick he would later return to on the 1986 hit single [...] "The Word 'Girl'"). The song also alludes to [...] "the sickest group in all the world", which Gartside would later admit referred to the former bandmates and collaborators he had jettisoned from the early squat-punk collective days of Scritti Politti: [...] "We were a sick group for some time. I used to read and write a lot, which was the only thing I did apart from being debauched... we were always pretty poorly".|$|E

2500|$|Shoemaker also {{addressed}} an AA group in Charlotte, North Carolina, June 17, 1962 saying:To {{set the record}} straight, that there has gotten going in AA, a kind of rumor, that I had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 12 steps. I didn't have anymore {{to do with those}} 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience {{in such a way that}} you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it." [...] Praise be to God for it, and for the life of that fellow and all those who where with him in the beginnings of this incredible movement.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Direck was {{introduced}} as a travelling American gratified {{to see a}} typical English country house, and Lady Homartyn in an habituated way ran over the points of her Tudor specimen. Mr. Direck was not accustomed to titled people, and was suddenly in doubt whether you called a baroness [...] "My Lady" [...] or [...] "Your Ladyship," [...] so he wisely avoided any form of address until he had a lead from Mr. Britling. Mr. Britling presently called her [...] "Lady Homartyn." [...] She took Mr. Direck and sat him down beside a lady whose name he didn't catch, but who had had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British Embassy at Washington, and then she handed Mr. Britling over to the Rt.
