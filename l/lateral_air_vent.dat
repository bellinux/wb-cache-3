40|$|The {{performance}} of steep slope (> 30 o) orifice spillway aerators by varying <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> size and ramp angles were experimentally studied. Three <b>air</b> <b>vents</b> {{of different sizes}} and five ramps with different angles were tested on a physical model of Bunji dam spillway, which was constructed at Irrigation Research Station Nandipur, Gujranwala. In each case, the cavity length, cavity pressure, flow velocity and water depth at the aerator were measured by changing operating conditions. Non-dimensional jet length (), air entrainment co-efficient (ß) and non-dimensional cavity pressure (Pn) were computed to evaluate the {{performance of}} the aerator against ramp angle and <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> size. Results noted an improvement in the performance of aerator with the increase of <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> size. However, the ramp initially improved {{the performance of the}} aerator but at higher reservoir level with large gate opening, no significant improvement in the performance of the aerator was noted, rather negative impact was observed due to reduction in cavity pressure...|$|R

However, despite {{a large number of}} studies, there is still a significant lack of knowledge regarding the physical processes involved. The present paper aims to address this issue by comprehensive laboratory tests. Two configurations were analysed and both air release valves and orifices were used for <b>air</b> <b>venting.</b> In the first configuration, the <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> was fitted at the downstream end of the pipeline, and the transient showed significant pressure surges consequent to the high velocity impact of the water column on the orifice (or the valve). In the second configuration, the <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> was fitted at an intermediate high point of the pipe profile. In this case, the transient showed very low velocity of the water column at the impact and, consequently, generally negligible pressure surges. © 2016 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research...|$|R

40|$|Revascularization with a {{vein graft}} is a {{mandatory}} method {{for treatment of}} dissecting or pseudoaneurysms of the internal carotid artery. We report the necessity for an <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> from the vein graft and explain its use in our two cases. In Case 1, we searched for a great saphenous vein around its junction with a femoral vein during the harvest of vein graft. An accessory branch of that great saphenous vein was also found around the junctional region with a femoral vein, and was temporarily ligated. At first, anastomosis was completed on both the distal and proximal sides. After the proximal side of a vein graft was opened and the ligation of the branch was loosened, an <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> could be made through the branch of the vein graft. Multiple air bubbles and a large quantity of white microemboli were discharged through this branch. The postoperative course was uneventful. In Case 2, the <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> was omitted to shorten ischemia. During {{the opening of the}} vein graft, the migrated air was observed to move to the middle cerebral artery. A computed tomography scan demonstrated that brain infarction and dysarthria occurred postoperatively. The <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> of the vein graft is essential in extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery, because the air bubbles or microthrombi are easily trapped around the valve and cause cerebral infarction. An <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> can be easily made if the branch of a vein graft exists in the outflow pathway, because intraluminal air or thrombus can be washed out through the branch at the final stage of surgery...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>vent</b> {{systems are}} {{designed}} to protect hydropower penstocks and reservoir outlets under various operating conditions. During an emergency closure of an upstream gate the hydraulic jump that forms downstream of the gate is not stationary and may advance downstream potentially increasing the total air demand. A lab-scale physical model of a general outlet works piping configuration was constructed at Reclamation’s Hydraulics Laboratory in Denver, CO to observe hydraulic jump behavior during emergency gate closures. Parameters including gate discharge, gate closure rate, <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> size, and downstream pipe pressure were tested at two different pipe slopes. Results indicate that the hydraulic jump travel speed is dependent on <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> size as well as gate closure rate, both of which affect the internal pressure in the pipe near the vent connection. For a shallow-sloped pipe, the jump speed remains steady throughout the entire pipe length if the air supply is sufficient. However, if air flow is significantly reduced due to an undersized <b>air</b> <b>vent,</b> unsteady travel speeds and pressure surges were observed. This {{was not the case}} for a steep-sloped pipe which produced steady jump speeds for all vent sizes. Once completed, these results are expected to be applicable for prediction of hydraulic jump travel speed and its effects on <b>air</b> demand for <b>vent</b> sizing considerations based on hydraulic operating conditions...|$|R
