40|$|Conventional design {{guidelines}} for buried pipelines {{are based on}} the assumption that soil is either dry or fully saturated. In unsaturated soils, such an assumption may lead to underestimation of load from externally imposed ground movement. Such loads are generated because the water meniscus between soil particles creates an additional inter-particle force due to suction, which in turn makes the soil stiffer and stronger. This paper presents a methodology for predicting lateral <b>loads</b> on <b>pipelines</b> in unsaturated sandy soils by investigating soil-pipe interaction with full-scale tests and characterizing unsaturated soil behaviour with properties from triaxial tests. A constitutive model was developed, and finite element (FE) simulations were performed and compared with the full-scale test results to validate the modelling process. Additional FE simulations were conducted to assess the maximum lateral <b>load</b> on <b>pipelines</b> buried in different Class II (ASTM, 2011) unsaturated sands. The full-scale tests and FE simulations show that increased strength and stiffness associated with soil suction increases lateral <b>loads</b> on <b>pipelines</b> and thus needs to be considered when designing pipelines for externally imposed ground movement. The modelling procedures and results can be used to predict lateral <b>loads</b> on underground <b>pipelines</b> subjected to construction and earthquake-induced ground movements, landslides, and subsidence. Because most pipelines are buried in unsaturated soil, the results have widespread relevance in design and construction...|$|R

An original method of a formation of an integral-differential equation in terms of displacements, gained from the full system of equations of viscoelasticity theory for the plane axisymmetric orthotropic case in polar coordinates, allows discovering and exploring such phenomena as stress relaxation in the bandage and their growth in the pipeline section. The developed approach also lets solve obtained boundary value problem analytically. The proposed set of boundary and conjugation conditions reflects different repair and operational modes. An analytical model enables to consider and examine an influence of the prestress conditions in the pipe on a stress-strain state kinetics as well as a change of contact stress due to viscoelatic properties of fiberglass and different values of an initial pressure. ? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????????-???????????????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ??? ?????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ? ??????? ????????? ???????? ? ????????????. ?????? ??????? ????????? ?????? ?????????????? ??? ???????????? ????????? ??????? ? ???????-????????????????? ????????? ? ????????????, ? ????????? ????? ??? ???????. ???????? ?????? ?? ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ????? ????????????? ? ???????? ? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ???????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ??????????????...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThis thesis work is {{performed}} {{to study and}} understand the pipeline global response {{as a result of}} trawl gears pull-over loads triggering lateral buckling on high temperature/high pressure subsea pipeline. The external interference from trawl gears pull-over loads may create substantial imperfection or out-of-straightness on the pipeline to trigger lateral buckling. The pull-over loads also may induce excessive bending moments and strains in the buckle region. To be able to understand the global response of the <b>pipeline</b> under pull-over <b>loading</b> condition, a finite element analysis is carried out based on DNV OS F 101 [1], DNV RP F 110 [2] and DNV RP F 111 [1]. The analysis is carried out using general finite element analysis software ANSYS v 13. Nonlinear-transient analysis is used to incorporate the non-linear effects, such as the nonlinearities of pipeline material, and the response of a structure under the action of pull-over time-dependent loads. The finite element analysis covers two period of duration i. e. during pull-over loads duration and after pull-over loads duration. The analysis during pull-over loads duration deals with the pipeline global response as a result of trawl gears pull-over <b>loads.</b> The <b>pipeline</b> is subjected to substantial horizontal and vertical pull-over forces from the trawl gears. The pull-over forces are applied based on force-time history as recommended in DNV RP F 111 [3]. This thesis work also study the pipeline post buckling condition. After pull-over <b>loads</b> duration, the <b>pipeline</b> global response may be different. The analysis is carried out for additional 5 seconds from the end of pull-over loads duration. In this period, the pull-over loads are no longer applied. The pipeline may expand further more caused by temperature and pressure <b>loads</b> on <b>pipeline.</b> There are four (4) types of trawl gear considered in the analysis i. e. polyvalent and rectangular trawl gear, industrial v-board, beam trawl and clump weight. All the trawl gears data are taken from DNV RP F 111 [3]. The thesis work calculates the pull-over loads and durations from all type of trawl gears. In the finite element analysis, only the pull-over loads from polyvalent and rectangular trawl gear are used as this is considered to adequately represent the cases. The finite element analysis of trawl gear pull-over shows the trawl gears pull-over loads induces lateral buckling on pipeline. The pipeline deform laterally at the pull-over loads location. High bending moments and strain occur at the apex of the buckle. The DNV displacement condition code check shows that the integrity of the pipeline is not satisfy the safety level hence the pipeline cannot withstand the trawl gears pull-over loads. The analysis with variation of operating temperature and pressure should be carried out as further works. The further works shall also take into account a full comparison of lateral and axial soil friction combination. This way, a more accurate result can be obtained and better conclusion can be verified...|$|R

This third stage was {{a continuation of the}} on-site monitoring of full-scale pipe jacks during construction. Four schemes were monitored in different ground conditions: London clay, dense fine sand below the water table, stiff glacial till and soft alluvial clay. Pipe sizes ranged from 1000 mm to 1800 mm internal diameter and excavation methods included hand tools, slurry machines and an open face tunnel boring machine. The main objective was to collect information on jacking loads and stresses at the pipe-soil interface to provide a better basis for future designs. This was achieved by building twelve stress cells -capable of measuring total normal stresses, shear stresses and pore pressures - into the wall of a standard concrete jacking pipe that could be inserted anywhere in the pipe string. Jacking loads and forward movement of the pipe string were simultaneously recorded and the results were correlated against site activities, including lubrication operations, and tunnel alignment surveys. Another objective was to monitor the ground response by measuring displacements around the tunnel and ground pressures above the perpendicular to the intended line. Ground movements were measured using conventional surveying techniques for surface settlements, and inclinometer access tubes for sub-surface deformation. On one scheme, electro-levels were employed in a near-horizontal tube to measure centre line settlement as the tunnel bore advanced. Push-in spade cells and pneumatic piezometers were installed on two schemes to measure the change in horizontal pressures {{with the passage of the}} shield. Because of the myriad data collected, it has only been possible to present a summary of the results obtained. Jacking force records from all the monitored schemes - including the previous fieldwork stage - are presented. The pattern of jacking load build up and the magnitude of frictional resistance can differ significantly according to the type of ground and use of lubricants. Stress measurements at the pipe-soil interface show that the interaction between jacking <b>loads,</b> <b>pipeline</b> misalignment, stoppages, lubrication, excavation technique etc, is highly complex.

Furthermore, such models are widely popular in the community for modelling the behaviour of soils due to their relative simplicity and only requiring the basic soil properties (such as friction and dilation angles). The current study focuses on the application of such standard models to analyse laterally moving pipeline under plane strain condition.
