25|$|Third-rail {{systems can}} be {{designed}} to use top contact, side contact, or bottom contact. Top contact is less safe, as the <b>live</b> <b>rail</b> is exposed to people treading on the rail unless an insulating hood is provided. Side- and bottom-contact third rail can easily have safety shields incorporated, carried by the rail itself. Uncovered top-contact third rails are vulnerable to disruption caused by ice, snow and fallen leaves.|$|E
25|$|Light rail is {{generally}} powered by electricity, usually {{by means of}} overhead wires, but sometimes by a <b>live</b> <b>rail,</b> also called third rail (a high voltage bar alongside the track), requiring safety measures and warnings to the public not to touch it. In some cases, particularly when initial funds are limited, diesel-powered versions have been used, {{but it is not}} a preferred option. Some systems, such as AirTrain JFK in New York City, are automatic, dispensing with the need for a driver; however, such systems are not what {{is generally}} thought of as light rail, crossing over into rapid transit. Automatic operation is more common in smaller people mover systems than in light rail systems, where the possibility of grade crossings and street running make driverless operation of the latter inappropriate.|$|E
2500|$|In the French city of Bordeaux, the tramway {{network is}} powered by a third rail in the city centre, where the tracks are not always {{segregated}} from pedestrians and cars. The third rail (actually two closely spaced rails) is placed {{in the middle of the}} track and divided into eight-metre sections, each of which is powered only while it is completely covered by a tram. This minimises the risk of a person or animal coming into contact with a <b>live</b> <b>rail.</b> In outer areas, the trams switch to conventional [...] overhead wires. The Bordeaux power system costs about three times as much as a conventional overhead wire system, and took 24 months to achieve acceptable levels of reliability, requiring replacement of all the main cables and power supplies. Operating and maintenance costs of the innovative power system still remain high. However, despite numerous service outages, the system was a success with the public, gaining up to 190,000 passengers per day.|$|E
50|$|The first {{electric}} trains on {{the route}} were the joint Great Western Railway and Metropolitan Railway trains, between the connection from the Hammersmith & City line near Latimer Road, and Kensington. This started {{at the end of}} 1906 on the four-rail system. The <b>live</b> <b>rails</b> continued south as far as Lillie Bridge Depot.|$|R

50|$|Although {{initially}} the trains {{of what is}} now the London Underground were drawn by steam engines, virtually all metro trains, both now and historically, use electric power and are built to run as multiple units. Most trains ride on steel wheels running on two steel rails, as in a conventional railway, although some use other methods. Power for the trains, referred to as traction power, is commonly supplied by means of a single <b>live</b> third <b>rail</b> (as in New York). The current powering the trains is generally in the range of 600 to 750 volts, although some systems, such as the ones in London and Milan, use two <b>live</b> <b>rails,</b> one positive and one negative. The practice of sending power through rails on the ground is mainly due to the limited overhead clearance of tunnels, which physically prevents the use of overhead wires.|$|R

50|$|The {{electric}} current {{is drawn from}} a two-tiered electric rail that is aligned with {{the side of the}} track. The top rail is ground, with the <b>live</b> <b>rail</b> suspended beneath it.|$|E
50|$|Platform 2 {{serves the}} same track as Platform 1 but {{passengers}} {{are not able}} to join or alight as the doors open only on the Platform 1 side. This is due to the <b>live</b> <b>rail</b> being on the side nearest to Platform 2.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Live</b> <b>Rails</b> is {{an album}} by {{musician}} Steve Hackett. It was recorded during the tour around {{the release of}} Out of the Tunnel's Mouth. It is also the first of Hackett's official live releases since The Tokyo Tapes to feature {{a significant number of}} Genesis songs. Their inclusion foreshadows the Genesis Revisited tours that would occur several years later. A related release to this one is the Fire and Ice DVD, also recorded around the same time, which includes more emphasis on Genesis-era tracks.|$|R
50|$|Modern trams {{generally}} use overhead {{electric contact}} wires, {{from which they}} draw current through a pantograph, a bow collector (less commonly) or the now-rare trolley pole (the pantograph is most common and used on new tram designs). There are other methods of powering electric trams, sometimes preferred for aesthetic reasons since poles and overhead wires are not required. The old tram systems in London, Manhattan (New York City), and Washington, D.C., used <b>live</b> <b>rails,</b> like those on third-rail electrified railways, but in a conduit underneath the road, from which they drew power through a plough. It was called Conduit current collection. Washington's {{was the last of}} these to close, in 1962. Today, no commercial tramway uses this system. More recently, a modern equivalent to the old stud systems has been developed which allows for the safe installation of a third rail on city streets, which is known as surface current collection or ground-level power supply; the main example of this is the new tramway in Bordeaux.|$|R
50|$|The first Class 230 {{service to}} carry {{passengers}} operated on 21 and 22 June 2017 when the prototype (230001) {{was used to}} operate a shuttle service from Honeybourne to the <b>Rail</b> <b>Live</b> exhibition at the Quinton Rail Technology Centre.|$|R
50|$|Platforms 6 and 7 are on {{opposite}} sides of the same single line. Automatic train doors only open on the platform 6 side. Today doors are not opened on platform 7 due to the <b>live</b> <b>rail</b> being on that side, hence rendering that platform disused. Platform 6 is signalled for bi-directional working - trains may approach from either direction.|$|E
50|$|The line used {{electric}} traction at 500 V DC. {{with a central}} <b>live</b> <b>rail,</b> and had only two stations: Waterloo, and City (later renamed Bank). It {{opened to the public}} on 8 August 1898. Through tickets and season tickets from LSWR surface stations were (as they are) available. The LSWR operated it, and later absorbed it.|$|E
50|$|Most MUs are powered {{either by}} {{traction}} motors, receiving their power through a <b>live</b> <b>rail</b> or overhead wire (EMU), or by a diesel engine driving the wheels through a gearbox or hydraulic transmission (DMU). Diesel-electric multiple units (DEMUs) have a diesel engine that drives a generator producing electricity to drive traction motors {{in a similar}} fashion to a diesel-electric locomotive.|$|E

The Coalition for Affordable Housing and Transit advocates for residents of all incomes so they can afford to <b>live</b> near <b>rail</b> transit stations and bus hubs in Durham.|$|R
50|$|During the Passover holiday, David {{encounters}} {{some older}} truant children who {{force him to}} accompany them and drop a piece of zinc onto a <b>live</b> trolley-car <b>rail.</b> The electrical power released from this becomes associated in David's mind {{with the power of}} God and Isaiah's coal. Albert has taken a job as a milk delivery man. David, accompanying his father one day, sees Albert brutally whip a man who attempts to steal some of the milk bottles, possibly killing him.|$|R
25|$|At {{the closed}} stations, barbed wire fences were {{installed}} {{to prevent any}} would-be escapees from East Berlin from accessing the track bed, and the electrically <b>live</b> third <b>rail</b> served as an additional and potentially lethal deterrent. An alarm was triggered if anyone breached one of the barriers. As for the entrances, the signage was removed, walkways were walled up and stairways were sealed with concrete slabs. Police stations were built into the windowed platform service booths, from which the whole platform area could be monitored.|$|R
50|$|The old twin-track centre-slew bridge {{remained}} in service during the installation and {{trials of the}} new bridge until the date the <b>live</b> <b>rail</b> was diverted over the new bridge. The closure and removal of the old bridge in end of February 1987, was during the river's closure to navigation for the bridge replacement, provided for under a specific act of UK Parliament.|$|E
50|$|This {{collapse}} {{seems to}} have been followed by a boom, for in 1882 45,270 tons were carried, generated a profit of £1,206. This buoyancy enabled the replacement of the original locomotive Pentewan with a new, similar, machine, named Trewithan in 1886. At the same time there were renewed proposals to extend the line northwards and to electrify it, using a central <b>live</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Volks Electric Railway, {{the first}} {{electric}} passenger railway in Britain, opened in 1883 as a short 2 ft gauge electric railway running for 1/4 mi in Brighton. At first electrical power at 160 V DC was supplied {{to a small}} car using the two running rails, {{but it was not}} long before a third <b>live</b> <b>rail</b> was added, a sliding shoe making contact to the top.|$|E
50|$|Aldershot {{railway station}} has the three-letter code AHT. This code is used, for example, to locate Aldershot when using National <b>Rail</b> <b>Live</b> Departure Boards.

Its breeding habitat is marshes from Nova Scotia to Southern British Columbia, California and North Carolina, and in Central America. It often coexists with Soras.|$|R
50|$|Mayapore, {{although}} not {{the capital of}} the province, is a relatively large city, with a significant British presence in the cantonment area, where native Indians are not permitted to <b>live.</b> Across the <b>rail</b> lines lies the “black town,” where the native population resides. There is also a Eurasian Quarter, the residence of the mixed-race (Anglo-Indian) population of the city.|$|R

50|$|Third-rail {{systems can}} be {{designed}} to use top contact, side contact, or bottom contact.

Uncovered top-contact third rails are vulnerable to disruption caused by ice, snow and fallen leaves.|$|E
50|$|As with {{overhead}} wires, {{the return}} current usually flows through {{one or both}} running rails, and leakage to ground is not considered serious. Where trains run on rubber tyres, as on parts of the Paris Métro, Mexico City metro and Santiago Metro, and {{on all of the}} Montreal Metro, a <b>live</b> <b>rail</b> must be provided to feed the current. The return is effected through the rails of the conventional track between these guide bars (see rubber-tyred metro).|$|E
30|$|The multinomial {{logistic}} model measures {{difference from the}} likelihood for each racial, ethnic and income group to <b>live</b> in <b>rail</b> transit accessible zones (Zone 1, 2, and 3) to the likelihood to live in inaccessible zone (Zone 4). To enable the multiple comparisons, multinomial logit estimation automatically generates three {{logistic model}}s. That said, the three dependent variables are the likelihood difference between Zone 1 and Zone 4 (Π 1 –Π 4), the difference between Zone 2 and Zone 4 (Π 2 –Π 4) {{and the difference between}} Zone 3 and Zone 4 (Π 3 –Π 4). Since the models are all derived from one model (Eq.  1), their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC[*]=[*] 1895.95) are all equal. Thus, the goodness of fit of the three models is equal, which means comparing the fitness is unnecessary. In the analysis using the multinomial logit model, the magnitude of coefficients itself does not tell much information as the dependent variable is likelihood difference between categories rather than likelihood itself. What we need to pay attention the sign of coefficients. As we mention in the sect.  4.3, the positive coefficient indicates higher likelihood for a group to <b>live</b> in <b>rail</b> transit accessible zones than to the likelihood to live in inaccessible zone. The negative estimator means that the demographic group is less likely to live in accessible zones than in inaccessible zone. For example, the coefficient for Latino to predict the difference between Zone 2 and 4 (Π 2 –Π 4) is −[*] 0.852. The interpretation is that Latino community is less likely to live in Zone 2 than in Zone 4.|$|R
5000|$|The Underground's staff safety regimen {{has drawn}} criticism. In January 2002 it was fined £225,000 for {{breaching}} safety standards for workers. In court, the judge reprimanded {{the company for}} [...] "sacrificing safety" [...] to keep trains running [...] "at all costs." [...] Workers had been instructed {{to work in the}} dark with the power <b>rails</b> <b>live,</b> even during rainstorms. Several workers had received electric shocks as a result.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{recorded}} permanent settlers were John and William Van Voor Haze (Voorhees), who purchased [...] {{of land in}} the area in 1720. Other early settlers (mostly Dutch) included the Van Horns, Terhunes, Ackermans, Quackenbushes, Pulises, and Vanderhoffs. In 1940 the population was just under 4,000 consisting of roughly 100 families with 30% of the land devoted to farming. By 1969 the number of farms had dropped to 13 covering , 6% of the township. By 2012, only two farms remain: Abma's Farm and Goffle Road Poultry Farm, which is Bergen County's only remaining <b>live</b> market. <b>Rail</b> service by the New Jersey Midland Railway began in 1870. That service was purchased by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway, which abruptly ended passenger service in 1966.|$|R
50|$|Another was by John Joseph Wright, {{brother of}} the famous mining {{entrepreneur}} Whitaker Wright, in Toronto in 1883. Earlier installations proved difficult or unreliable. Siemens' line, for example, provided power through a <b>live</b> <b>rail</b> and a return rail, like a model train, limiting the voltage that could be used, and providing electric shocks to people and animals crossing the tracks. Siemens later designed his own method of current collection, from an overhead wire, called the bow collector.|$|E
5000|$|The {{third rail}} is an {{alternative}} to overhead lines that transmit power to trains by means of pantographs attached to the trains. Whereas overhead-wire systems can operate at 25 kV or more, using alternating current (AC), the smaller clearance around a <b>live</b> <b>rail</b> imposes a maximum of about 1500 V (Line 4, Guangzhou Metro, Line 5, Guangzhou Metro, Longgang Line, Shenzhen Metro), and direct current (DC) is used. Trains on some lines or networks use both power supply modes (cf. below, [...] "Compromise systems").|$|E
50|$|The {{most popular}} {{solution}} is Alstom's proprietary ground-level power supply (APS, first used in Bordeaux and subsequently in Angers, Reims, Orleans, Tours, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, {{and in the}} future, Sydney), consisting of a third rail which is only powered while it is completely covered by a tram {{so that there is}} no risk of a person or animal coming into contact with a <b>live</b> <b>rail.</b> On the networks in France and in Sydney, the trams switch to conventional overhead wires in outer areas, but the Dubai vehicles are the first to employ APS for its entire passenger length (although they are still equipped with pantographs for use in the maintenance depot).|$|E
25|$|Certain costly inefficiencies were {{inherent}} {{in the process of}} transporting <b>live</b> animals by <b>rail,</b> particularly {{due to the fact that}} some sixty percent of the animal's mass is composed of inedible matter. Many animals weakened by the long drive died in transit, further increasing the per-unit shipping cost. Swift's ultimate solution to these problems was to devise a method to ship dressed meats from his packing plant in Chicago to the East.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2002, WNTY made {{broadcast}} history, {{when the}} station {{served as the}} master control home station for a live broadcast from a moving train, as the nationally syndicated Travel World Radio Show with hosts Stephen Pickford and Willem Bagchus did their show <b>live</b> from Via <b>Rail's</b> world-famous transcontinental Train No.1, [...] "The Canadian," [...] westbound between Edmonton and Hinton, AB.
