40|$|Fifty-four Rotterdam {{patients}} {{in which a}} primary infection with Campylobacter jejuni had been detected (index patients) were compared with 54 control subjects {{with regard to the}} consumption and preparation of foods 7 days before onset of illness and the keeping of pet animals. Significantly more index patients than controls had eaten chicken meat (47 v. 29; P = 0. 0002), particularly at barbecues (14 v. 2; P = 0. 0015). Marginally more index patients had eaten pork (47 v. 39; P = 0. 048) or inadequately heated meat (13 v. 8), though in the last case numbers were too small to be statistically significant. The consumption of beef or mutton and outdoor eating (other than at barbecues) were essentially the same in both groups. There was no significant association with the keeping of pet animals, although a few more index patients had cage birds than controls (18 v. 12). Twenty-one (15 %) of 136 household contacts of index patients also suffered from diarrhoea during the same period. Circumstantial evidence pointed to a common source of infection with the index patient in 13 instances (nine households) and probable intrafamilial spread of infection in six instances. Campylobacters were isolated from one of 110 swabs of kitchen work surfaces and eight of 107 swabs taken from <b>lavatory</b> <b>bowls</b> in index households...|$|E
30|$|According to {{surveyed}} studies, toilet flushing consumes between 25 and 35 % of {{the total}} house consumption so; it occupies the first place in domestic consumption. A traditional <b>lavatory</b> <b>bowl</b> has a fixed S-shape outlet passage by which its exit level is elevated than the entrance level to guarantee sealing. The level difference is called seal depth. Without sealing, generated and accumulated awful gases are leaked from the sanitary system inside toilets.|$|R
500|$|In {{the right}} panel, Dyer is shown {{with his eyes}} shut, {{vomiting}} into a hand basin. In the two outer frames his figure is shadowed by arrows, pictorial devices that Bacon often used to place a sense of energy into his paintings. In this work, the arrows point to a man about to die, and according to Tóibín they scream [...] "Here!", [...] "Him!". The arrow of the right panel, according to Tóibín, points to a [...] "dead figure on the <b>lavatory</b> <b>bowl,</b> as though telling the Furies where to find him". The triptych is centralised by the lightbulb, and {{by the fact that}} Dyer faces inwards in the two outer canvasses. The triptych's composition and setting are poised to suggest instability, and the doors in each side panel are splayed outwards as if to look into the darkness of the foreground.|$|R
500|$|In each panel, Dyer {{is framed}} by a doorway, and set against a flat, {{anonymous}} foreground coloured with black and brown hues. In the left frame, he is seated on a toilet with his head crouched between his knees as if in pain. Although his arched back, thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic Colm Tóibín, [...] "lovingly painted", Dyer is by now clearly a broken man. The central panel shows Dyer sitting on the toilet bowl in a more contemplative pose, his head and upper body writhing beneath a hanging lightbulb which throws a large bat-like shadow formed {{in the shape of}} a demon or Eumenide. The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer's flesh, [...] "life seems to visibly drain... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him". Dyer's posture suggests he is seated on a <b>lavatory</b> <b>bowl,</b> though the object is not described. Schmied has proposed that in this frame the blackness of the background has enveloped the subject, and it [...] "seems to be advancing forward over the threshold, threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws." ...|$|R
