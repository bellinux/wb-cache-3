50|$|As to solicitors, Ross v. Caunters 1979 3 AER 580, {{holds that}} lawyers can owe a {{duty of care}} both to their clients and to third parties who suffer loss or damage. In that case, the solicitors failed to prevent a {{beneficiary}} from attesting the will. They admitted negligence but denied that they were liable to the claimant, contending (i) that a solicitor was liable only to his client and then only in contract and not in tort and could not, therefore, be liable in tort to a third party, (ii) that for reasons of policy, a solicitor {{ought not to be}} liable in negligence to anyone except his client, and (iii) that in any event, the Plaintiff had no cause of action in negligence because the damage suffered was purely financial. Applying the principles in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd and Donoghue v Stevenson 1932 AC 562, a solicitor who is instructed by a client to carry out a transaction that will confer a benefit on a third party owes a duty of care towards the third party in carrying out that transaction, in that the third party is a person within his direct contemplation as someone who is likely to be so closely and directly affected by his acts or omissions that he can reasonably foresee that the third party is likely to be injured by those acts or omissions. This was confirmed in White v Jones 1995 1 AER 691 which applied Caparo Industries plc v Dickman 1990 1 AER 568 holding that there is a close and direct relationship characterised by the law as proximity or neighbourhood; and the situation is one where it is fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose the duty of the given scope upon the one party {{for the benefit of the}} other. But in Carr-Glynn v Frearsons 1997 2 AER 614 the solicitor admitted uncertainty as to whether the will as drawn would be effective. The testatrix undertook to seek out the information needed to clarify the issue. She died more than three years later without verifying the will. White v Jones was distinguished because the testatrix had assumed the duty of care, but the court was critical of the failure of the solicitors to send a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>reminder.</b> The case law also indicates the necessity for firms of solicitors to keep detailed attendance notes.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} career paths of doctors who {{completed}} vocational training in the west of Scotland between 1968 and 1987 and {{their views on the}} hospital component of their training. DESIGN [...] Retrospective analysis of the experience and opinions of vocationally trained doctors obtained from a postal questionnaire. SETTING [...] West of Scotland. SUBJECTS [...] 1255 Doctors identified from Glasgow University records who had been vocationally trained in the west of Scotland between 1968 and 1987. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Personal details; employment; jobs held currently; additional professional commitments; importance of hospital posts held in various specialties to respondents currently in general practice; and retrospective choice of hospital posts, based on subsequent experience. RESULTS [...] 619 Responses were received, 543 initially and 76 after a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>reminder,</b> from a possible total of 974 (excluding 153 questionnaires returned by the post office and 128 returned because of misunderstanding between the name and address); the overall response rate was therefore 64 %. 607 / 619 (98 %) Respondents were employed {{at the time of the}} study, of whom 517 / 607 (85 %) were in general practice. A third (202 / 609) had been unemployed at some point, significantly more of them women (122 / 243, 50 % v 80 / 376, 21 %; chi 2 = 54. 8, p less than 0. 001). 510 / 563 (91 %) Respondents held one postgraduate qualification or more, and 284 / 612 (46 %) had additional professional commitments. The hospital posts most commonly held were in obstetrics and gynaecology, psychiatry, paediatrics, and medicine. Medicine, obstetrics, paediatrics, and dermatology were considered to be the most relevant hospital specialties by those who had experience of them and were now in general practice. Although ophthalmology and ear, nose, and throat were not rated highly by these doctors, other respondents wished that they had held posts in these specialties (32 and 40 respectively). During the hospital training 354 / 475 (75 %) respondents thought that they were looked on as a junior hospital doctor and not as a trainee for general practice. CONCLUSIONS [...] Most of those who had entered vocational training were in employment, and most were in general practice. According to them, the most beneficial hospital posts for vocational training are medicine, obstetrics, paediatrics, and dermatology. Trainees should be encouraged to attend clinics in gynaecology, ear, nose, and throat, and ophthalmology...|$|E
40|$|We {{reviewed}} the annual blood utilisation data at our institution {{for the past}} 6 years. The number of packed red blood cell units for allogeneic transfusions gradually increased from 3, 989 (in 2004) to 4, 762 (in 2008) : a 19 % increase. This exceeded the 7 % increase in annual admissions of patients {{during the same period}} (from 20, 470 in 2004 to 21, 908 in 2005). MATERIALS AND METHODS:In 2009, we introduced new transfusion guidelines ("triggers"), essentially adopting the recommendations of the Society for the Advancement of Blood Management. Most importantly, we reduced the trigger of blood transfusions in normovolaemic symptomatic chronic anaemia patients from 8 to 7 g/dL haemoglobin. At the same time, we created a new trigger of 9 g/dL haemoglobin for high-risk patients (e. g. those with cardiovascular and/or chronic pulmonary disease as well as those undergoing chemotherapy). RESULTS:We monitored the indications for blood transfusions during 2009 (2, 717 consecutive orders) and sent out <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the new guidelines to our clinicians if criteria were not met (a total <b>of</b> 102 <b>letters,</b> representing 4 % of the reviewed orders). Our annual blood utilisation in 2009 showed some improvement (4, 648 units) compared to the previous year (4, 762 units) despite the increase in admissions of patients (from 21, 908 to 22, 734) : this represents a 6 % decrease in blood utilisation when corrected for the admissions of patients. If this trends holds up, the predicted blood utilisation for 2010 based on the January to November data (4, 280) promises to show a further improvement (an 11 % decrease compared to 2008). DISCUSSION:We conclude that blood utilisation may be improved in a community hospital setting by combining new, evidence-based transfusion triggers with physicians' educatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective The {{purpose of}} this project was to conduct an {{overview}} of existing systematic reviews {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> in changing professional behavior in clinical settings. Materials and methods Relevant systematic reviews <b>of</b> <b>reminder</b> interventions were identified through searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, DARE and the Cochrane Library in conjunction with a larger project examining professional behavioral change interventions. Reviews were appraised using AMSTAR, a validated tool for assessing the quality of systematic reviews. As most reviews only reported vote counting, conclusions about effectiveness for each review were based on a count of positive studies. If available, we also report effect sizes. Conclusions were based on the findings from higher quality and current systematic reviews. Results Thirty-five reviews were eligible for inclusion in this overview. Ten reviews examined the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> generally, 5 reviews focused on specific health care settings, 14 reviews concentrated on specific behaviors and 6 reviews addressed specific patient populations. The quality of the reviews was variable (median[*]=[*] 3, range[*]=[*] 1 to 8). Seven reviews had AMSTAR scores > 5 and were considered in detail. Five of these seven reviews demonstrated positive effects <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> in changing provider behavior. Few reviews used quantitative pooling methods; in one high quality and current review, the overall observed effects were moderate with an absolute median improvement in performance of 4. 2 % (IQR: 0. 5 % to 6. 6 %). Discussion The results support that modest improvements can occur with the use <b>of</b> <b>reminders.</b> The effect size is consistent with other interventions that have been used to improve professional behavior. Conclusion Reminders appear effective in improving different clinical behaviors across a range of settings. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Computer-based {{decision}} support systems are a promising method for incorporating research evidence into clinical practice. However, evidence is still scant on how such information technology solutions work in primary healthcare when support is provided across many health problems. In Finland, we designed a trial where a set <b>of</b> evidence-based, patient-specific <b>reminders</b> was {{introduced into the}} local Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system. The aim was to measure the effects <b>of</b> such <b>reminders</b> on patient care. The hypothesis was that the total number <b>of</b> triggered <b>reminders</b> would decrease in the intervention group compared with the control group, indicating an improvement in patient care. Methods From July 2009 to October 2010 all the patients of one health center were randomized to an intervention or a control group. The intervention consisted <b>of</b> patient-specific <b>reminders</b> concerning 59 different health conditions triggered when the healthcare professional (HCP) opened and used the EPR. In the intervention group, the triggered reminders were shown to the HCP; in the control group, the triggered reminders were not shown. The primary outcome measure was {{the change in the}} number <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> triggered over 12 months. We developed a unique data gathering method, the Repeated Study Virtual Health Check (RSVHC), and used Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) for analysing the incidence rate ratio, which {{is a measure of the}} relative difference in percentage change in the numbers <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> triggered in the intervention group and the control group. Results In total, 13, 588 participants were randomized and included. Contrary to our expectation, the total number <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> triggered increased in both the intervention and the control groups. The primary outcome measure did not show a significant difference between the groups. However, with the inclusion of patients followed up over only six months, the total number <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> increased significantly less in the intervention group than in the control group when the confounding factors (age, gender, number of diagnoses and medications) were controlled for. Conclusions Computerized, tailored reminders in primary care did not decrease during the 12 months of follow-up time after the introduction of a patient-specific {{decision support}} system.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{synthesise}} current {{evidence for}} the influence on clinical behaviour of patient-specific electronically generated reminders {{available at the time}} of the clinical encounter. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane library of systematic reviews; Science Citation Index Expanded; Social Sciences Citation Index; ASSIA; EMBASE; CINAHL; DARE; HMIC were searched for relevant articles. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We included controlled trials <b>of</b> <b>reminder</b> interventions if the intervention was: directed at clinician behaviour; available during the clinical encounter; computer generated (including computer generated paper-based reminders); and generated by patient-specific (rather than condition specific or drug specific) data. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials published since 1970. A random effects model was used to derive a pooled odds ratio for adherence to recommended care or achievement of target outcome. Subgroups were examined based on area of care and study design. Odds ratios were derived for each sub-group. We examined the designs, settings and other features <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> looking for factors associated with a consistent effect. RESULTS: Altogether, 42 papers met the inclusion criteria. The studies were of variable quality and some were affected by unit of analysis errors due to a failure to account for clustering. An overall odds ratio of 1. 79 [95 % confidence interval 1. 56, 2. 05] in favour <b>of</b> <b>reminders</b> was derived. Heterogeneity was high and factors predicting effect size were difficult to identify. LIMITATIONS: Methodological diversity added to statistical heterogeneity as an obstacle to meta-analysis. The quality of included studies was variable and in some reports procedural details were lacking. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: The analysis suggests a moderate effect of electronically generated, individually tailored reminders on clinician behaviour during the clinical encounter. Future research should concentrate on identifying the features <b>of</b> <b>reminder</b> interventions most likely to result in the target behaviour. © Society of General Internal Medicine 2012...|$|R
40|$|Missed {{appointments}} are an {{avoidable cost}} and resource inefficiency which {{impact upon the}} health of the patient and treatment outcomes. Health care services are increasingly utilizing reminder systems to manage these negative effects. This study explores the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>reminder</b> systems for promoting attendance, cancellations, and rescheduling of appointments across all health care settings and for particular patient groups and the contextual factors which indicate that reminders are being employed sub-optimally. We used three inter-related reviews of quantitative and qualitative evidence. Firstly, using pre-existing models and theories, we developed a conceptual framework to inform our understanding of the contexts and mechanisms which influence reminder effectiveness. Secondly, we performed a review following Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines to investigate the effectiveness of different methods of reminding patients to attend health service appointments. Finally, to supplement the effectiveness information, we completed a review informed by realist principles to identify factors likely to influence non-attendance behaviors and the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>reminders.</b> We found consistent evidence that all types <b>of</b> <b>reminder</b> systems are effective at improving appointment attendance across a range of health care settings and patient populations. Reminder systems may also increase cancellation and rescheduling of unwanted appointments. “Reminder plus”, which provides additional information beyond the reminder function may be more effective than simple reminders (ie, date, time, place) at reducing non-attendance at appointments in particular circumstances. We identified six areas of inefficiency which indicate that reminder systems are being used sub-optimally. Unless otherwise indicated, all patients should receive a reminder to facilitate attendance at their health care appointment. The choice <b>of</b> <b>reminder</b> system should be tailored to the individual service. To optimize appointment and reminder systems, health care services need supportive administrative processes to enhance attendance, cancellation, rescheduling, and re-allocation of appointments to other patients...|$|R
