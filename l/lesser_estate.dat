5000|$|A {{reversion}} {{in property}} {{law is a}} future interest that is retained by the grantor after the conveyance of an estate of a lesser quantum that he has (such {{as the owner of}} a fee simple granting a life estate or a leasehold estate). Once the <b>lesser</b> <b>estate</b> comes to an end (the lease expires or the life estate tenant dies), the property automatically reverts (hence reversion) back to the grantor.|$|E
5000|$|Merger also {{refers to}} the {{doctrine}} whereby [...] "a fee simple estate, once fragmented into present and future interests, can thereafter be reconstituted. 'Merger is the absorption of a <b>lesser</b> <b>estate</b> by a greater estate, and takes place when two distinct estates of greater and lesser rank meet in the same person or class of persons {{at the same time}} without any intermediate estate.'" [...] Similarly, a merger doctrine extinguishes an easement by necessity to a landlocked piece of property once that property is sold to one of the adjoining owners, thus extinguishing the necessity. The lack of any property interest removes the necessity and the easement.|$|E

50|$|Casimir's {{extensive}} {{cooperation with}} the church also provided him with security against the ambitions of his neighbors; however, this only served to protect Racibórz: the lands of Opole were {{in conflict with the}} Lower Silesian duke Henry I the Bearded; and the <b>Lesser</b> Polish <b>estates</b> of Siewierz, Bytom and Oświęcim were disputed by the Seniorate in Kraków. During his rule, Duke Casimir moved his residence to Opole and emulated the ruling model of his cousin Henry the Bearded to encourage German settlers (Ostsiedlung) in his lands. He started the process of urban locations under German town law in Leśnica (Leschnitz) in 1217 and in the episcopal lands of Ujazd bishops in 1222. Further city foundations included Biała (Zülz) and Gościęcin (Kostenthal) in 1225, as well as Olesno (Rosenberg) in 1226. The settlement process contributed measurably to the economic development of Casimir's duchy; it did not develop to a great extent, however, as in Lower Silesia.|$|R

After Perényi died in 1567, Sigismund served in the royal fortresses of Eger and Szendrő. The royal chamber mortgaged him several estates to compensate him for unpaid salaries. He received Szerencs in 1580, which enabled him to engage in the lucrative Tokaji wine trade. He took possession of the large estates of András Mágóchy's minor sons as their guardian, and the second husband of their mother Judit Alaghy, in 1587.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between the structure of a bank’s board of directors and the bank’s loan portfolio choice (holdings of agricultural, real estate, consumer, and commercial and industrial loans). The board of directors has the responsibility to monitor the loan policy of the bank; therefore, the structure of the board seems likely to influence the portfolio of loans that the bank has outstanding. However, financial institutions are unique in that they have additional external regulatory agencies that also monitor managerial behavior and actions. By means of this logic, bank boards should not influence loan policy. Using a sample of over 300 bank holding companies in 1997, we show evidence consistent with both arguments. First, growth in C&I loans as a percent of total assets is inversely related to the proportion of outsiders on the BHC board. Second, both proportion of outsiders and a board strength index are directly related to growth in consumer loans as a percent of total assets. Third, farm, and to a <b>lesser</b> extent, real <b>estate,</b> loan holdings are not related to bank board structure. Fourth, changes in consumer and C&I lending does not consistently explain the BHC’s future performance...|$|R
5000|$|Development {{along the}} Old Harford Road of today {{and that of}} the past {{mirrored}} that which occurred along other major roads in the area. From the late 18th century through much of the following one, [...] "development" [...] consisted primarily of the estates of merchants and other wealthy individuals of Baltimore. For example, the estates of both Revolutionary War hero General Samuel Smith, and Baltimore benefactor Johns Hopkins were located on that part of today's Harford Road near Hillen Road. Interspersed between these and other, <b>lesser</b> gentleman <b>estates</b> were the truck farms that supplied fruit, vegetables, and dairy products to Baltimore city. The term [...] "truck" [...] referred {{to the fact that the}} farm products quickly had to be moved to avoid spoilage. [...] By the late 1800s, truck farming had come to dominate growth and development patterns in the region. Villages arose along (Old) Harford Road as well as along the nearby York, Belair, and Philadelphia Roads to support the growing needs of the farmers. Beginning with the extension of streetcar service from Herring Run to Hamilton in 1898, and its subsequent extension to Carney in 1904, the southernmost portions of Old Harford Road saw development as a [...] "streetcar suburb" [...] during the first three decades of the 20th century. The earliest of these were situated on acre or near acre-size lots. But by the 1920s, developers subdivided the truck farms and other larger properties into smaller lots, onto which were built many [...] "bungalow"-style homes that were within easy walking distance of the extended streetcar line. Such construction spread as far north along Old Harford as the Harford Park community near Taylor Avenue (see http://www.harfordpark.org/). The next major surge in development occurred in the two decades following World War II. During this period, much of the remainder of today's Old Harford Road experienced the post-war building boom in the form of moderately-priced ranch and two story homes (see images below). A limited amount of modern [...] "in-fill" [...] construction continues today north of Joppa Road in Carney (e.g., the [...] "Old Harford Ridge" [...] subdivision near Proctor Lane).|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the above}} interpretations and as the {{qualifying}} figure was not uplifted or based on backdated valuations (to take account of inflation as in Scotland, where to be a shire elector required ownership of land worth forty shillings of old extent) the number of qualified voters gradually expanded. Tempering this extension to the franchise were laws proposed by objectors (such as King William IV in 1832) who deemed the non-landowning office holders and smallest landowners/investors as a dangerously large franchise. [...] Taxpaying qualifications {{in connection with the}} freehold franchise were first required in 1712. In that year the exercise of the franchise became contingent upon the assessment(emphasis added) of the land or tenements, in respect of which the vote was conferred, (10 Anne, c. 31). In 1781 the right to vote in counties was made dependent upon a charge, laid within six months of the election, [...] "toward some aid granted or to be granted to His Majesty by a land-tax or an assessment, {{in the name of the}} person claiming to vote," [...] (20 George III, c. 17)...When the question of voting rights came up in 1832, general sentiment in the House of Commons favoured retaining the qualification in counties, notwithstanding the well known desire of the King who regarded this franchise as too democratic and would have liked to see it raised to £10 value, if it were not to be entirely replaced. Royal wishes did not however coincide with the interests of either party. The electoral strength of the Whigs in many county constituencies depended upon the freeholder vote of large urban communities, whereas the Tories, on the other hand, looked to the support of the small freeholder in the country districts. Neither party favoured the abolition or the increase in value of the freeholder qualification; instead the Commons voted for a continuation of the 40 s. franchise and agreed to impose limitations upon it: freehold <b>estates</b> <b>lesser</b> than inheritedestates were to confer the vote only under certain conditions; and when the estate was for life (or lives) only, there must be actual and bona fide occupation for it serve as a qualification. The wider interpretation of the meaning of freehold, which admitted as qualifications such holdings as pew rights, annuities and church offices, was not restricted by the Act of 1832. Seymour ...|$|R
5000|$|The chronicles of {{the region}} of Poland, though {{sometimes}} shrouded by the mists of time reveal the ancient origins of the Pobog Clan. Careful research by professional analysts using such references as [...] "Herbarz Polski" [...] by Kaspar Niesiecki, [...] "Herbarz Polski" [...] by Adam Boniecki, [...] "Herby Rodów Polskich" [...] and [...] "Rycerstwo polskie wieków średnich" [...] by Professor F. Piekosinski reveal that the Pobóg Clan early origins trace back to the forming of tribal clan of families system, founded probably by Goths in 150 AD. The system was associated with ancient Slavonic family's community's structure and Sarmatian family system. In the struggles for control over agricultural soil, the feudal clan system evolved as the best defense against hordes of invaders sweeping in from {{the east and west}} over the countries.According to legend strongly supported by Professor F. Piekosiński, the Pobog-Pobodze clan is a junioral branch of the Popielid dynasty, rulers of Poland from the 7th through 9th centuries, before the era of Bolescic-Piast dynasty (9th to 14th centuries) another junioral branch of the Popielid dynasty. The junioral branch of Popielids - Pobóg clan is a part of senioral branch of Popielid dynasty the clan of Ogończyk. This legend was popularized by Professor F. Piekosinski research in a matter of Polish clans history of. So all myth has contained some truth.In all probability the name of Pobóg was formed from the proclamation Pobodze, call [...] "wishing" [...] in old Polish Po Bodze (may God keep you in His care). In oldest judicial records it is found in that form precisely. Proclamation Pobóg appear in family in 16th century. Other historians claim that the name Pobóg derived from the name of this Bug River. In this statement Pobóg means: after Bug. They placed the Pobóg clan's ancient territory around the river Bug in North-East Malopolska (<b>Lesser</b> Poland). So, <b>estates</b> in Malopolska were just one portion of the clan territories. The great families of the Pobog clan reached noble status for their services to prince, faith and community as warriors and scholars. They later become even more prominent as numerous branches of the same house acquired distant estates, some of which were located in other countries. From the 12th century onwards, this ancient clan was identified with the great social and economic evolution which made this territory a landmark contributor {{to the development of the}} nation in the 14th century. Pobog clan participated in the victorious crusade against pagan Prussians and Yotvingians tribes in 1190 under the command of prince Casimir II the Just. One clan member became famous for personally taking pagan commander prisoner. In 1331 the Pobóg clan participated in a victorious battle at Płowce against Teutonic Order. In 1359, at Ploniny (Plonini) against Moldavian army. In 1410 Pobóg clan participated under its own colours in the biggest and most famous battle in Europe at this time, at Grunwald (Tannenberg), where the Polish and Lithuanian armies were victorious against the Teutonic Order. The families' warriors were led by Jakub of Koniecpole, palatinus of Sieradz. In 1413 in Horodło (during the signing of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Union), Pobóg clan represented by Jakub of Koniecpol and Piotr of Popow had adopted Lithuanian boyar Rało.|$|R
