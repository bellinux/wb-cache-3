The Maku Tree is killed in the past on Veran's orders; <b>Link</b> uses a time portal to travel to the past to prevent this. The Maku Tree tells <b>Link</b> he will need the eight Essences of Time to defeat Veran. <b>Link</b> sets out to retrieve the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Labrynna's past and present. After getting the sixth Essence, <b>Link</b> is told he has the opportunity to save Nayru. He invades Queen Ambi's castle and removes Veran's spirit from Nayru, but Veran then possesses Queen Ambi. <b>Link</b> gathers the remaining Essences and brings them to the Maku Tree, who uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed that allows <b>Link</b> to enter Veran's Black Tower. <b>Link</b> ascends the tower and defeats Veran. He rescues Queen Ambi, and Nayru tells him that all has returned to normal. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that Veran has lit the Flame of Sorrow.|$|E

5|$|Many {{elements}} {{first introduced}} {{in this game}} have remained in the series. For instance, non-player characters (NPCs) were present in The Legend of Zelda, but their role was rather limited. Starting with The Adventure of <b>Link,</b> Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal roles in Link's quests. Zelda II {{was also one of}} the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas, giving the world a life of its own rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold. The use of metered magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games. The Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The Adventure of <b>Link</b> and plays an important role in later Zelda games, as it is strongly associated with <b>Link.</b> Dark <b>Link</b> is a version of Link's Shadow which appears in , a similar <b>Link</b> clone called Shadow <b>Link</b> appears in , and yet another appears in , as well as in A <b>Link</b> Between Worlds.|$|E

While <b>Link</b> attempts to follow her, he slips and falls into the ocean. Washed ashore on an island, <b>Link</b> is awakened by Ciela, a fairy. Exploring the island, <b>Link</b> finds the Phantom Hourglass, filled with the Sands of Hours, and meets an old man named Oshus, who wants to help <b>Link</b> find the Ghost Ship and reunite with Tetra. To aid him in his quest, <b>Link</b> enlists the help of Captain Linebeck and his ship, the S.S. Linebeck, which <b>Link,</b> Ciela, and Linebeck use to visit islands across the Great Sea. While Linebeck was initially reluctant to team up with the two, Ciela makes mention of a huge treasure, prompting him to agree to help them.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: A <b>Link</b> Between Worlds is an action-adventure game {{presented}} in stereoscopic 3D polygonal graphics, with gameplay predominantly experienced from a top-down perspective. Players control {{a young boy}} named <b>Link,</b> who embarks on an adventure to rescue the Seven Sages and defeat Yuga, the game's primary antagonist. The game is set in two kingdoms—Hyrule and Lorule—both of which bear an open world structure and similar layout, but contrast in style and tone. A <b>Link</b> Between Worlds {{is seen as a}} successor to the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System title , and is similar in many aspects. The worlds of Hyrule and Lorule in A <b>Link</b> Between Worlds are analogous to A <b>Link</b> to the Pasts depiction of Hyrule and the Dark World.

Changing the season to summer causes vines to flourish, which <b>Link</b> can use to scale cliffs. When <b>Link</b> obtains the rod, he initially cannot use it.

5|$|When {{not in a}} dungeon, <b>Link</b> {{explores the}} overworld. In Seasons, the overworld {{consists}} of Holodrum and the subterranean world of Subrosia.

In either game, some areas of one world are accessible only from portals from the other and vice versa. Holodrum, Subrosia, and Labrynna contain optional side quests and upgrades for <b>Link</b> and his equipment. One such side quest is ring collection; rings provide <b>Link</b> with various bonuses and abilities, such as improved defense. Some rings {{do not have any}} practical uses, e.g. rings that weaken Link's attack or defense, or transform <b>Link</b> into an enemy creature, or are awarded when certain criteria are met but do not have any effect.

Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A <b>Link</b> Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A <b>Link</b> to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A <b>Link</b> Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E

When <b>Link</b> and Zelda flee from the collapsing castle, they meet Vaati as he again changes form for the final battle of the game. After the battle, Ezlo returns to his original form.

When <b>Link</b> asks Oshus where to find the Spirit of Courage, Oshus explains that it is in fact Ciela, after which she transforms into her true form. Now in possession of the three Spirits, <b>Link,</b> along with Ciela and Oshus, locate the Ghost Ship and find Tetra on board, who has been turned to stone. While <b>Link</b> determines how to save Tetra, Oshus reveals that he is the Ocean King and that he and Ciela had to change their appearances to hide from Bellum, a life-eating monster that <b>Link</b> must destroy to save Tetra. Oshus also mentions that Bellum was the one who created the Ghost Ship and turned Tetra into a statue, and that he has taken residence deep in the Temple of the Ocean King. Linebeck quickly readies to abandon their quest; outraged at the lack of treasure to be found. However, his loyalties instantly return when Oshus promises the captain one wish in return for his continued aid.|$|E

30|$|Assuming {{that calls}} and Facebook {{activity}} (i.e., online communication) correspond to strong social ties, {{the capability of}} proximity <b>links</b> to predict those ties can be assessed by calculating the fraction of <b>links</b> in the former two networks that are covered by the strongest physical <b>links.</b> This is shown in Figure  1 c. The most striking observation is that once around 5, 000 of the strongest proximity <b>links</b> are considered (≈ 7 % and 24 % of <b>links</b> in the ambient and intimate networks, respectively), the contribution of additional <b>links</b> is comparably small (even negligible in case of call <b>links).</b> That is, almost none of the remaining <b>links</b> correspond to <b>links</b> found in the Facebook or call networks. Again, we see that call <b>links</b> can be captured more efficiently by proximity <b>links</b> than Facebook interactions. However, even {{in the case of}} the intimate network, the strongest 1, 000 <b>links</b> (around 5 % of the intimate proximity <b>links)</b> cover only 58 % of all call <b>links,</b> meaning that although a large fraction of digital communication <b>links</b> are also included in the proximity networks (see Figure  1 a), these <b>links</b> are not the necessarily the strongest physical <b>links,</b> and the ordered set of social ties are separated by many strong proximity <b>links</b> that are not represented by phone calls. In other words, many high-frequency physical <b>links</b> correspond to passive and socially less significant interactions. As the inset of Figure  1 c illustrates, the strongest call <b>links</b> are distinct from the strongest Facebook interactions, indicating that the <b>links</b> characterized by the most intense communication on Facebook constitute separate group from that of the most frequent mobile calls. In other words, individuals tend to avoid mixing the two channels and limit the maintenance of relationships to one of them. In the Appendix, we include further evaluation of how well proximity <b>links</b> can predict those of communication <b>links.</b>|$|R
