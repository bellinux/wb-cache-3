40|$|Literature {{suggests}} that preferences, as denoted by taste parameters and consideration sets, may evolve {{over time in}} response to changes in demographic and situational variables, psychological, sociological and biological constructs, and available alternatives and their attributes. However, existing representations typically overlook the influence of past experiences on present preferences. This study develops, applies and tests a hidden Markov model with a discrete choice kernel to model and forecast the evolution of individual preferences and behaviors over long-range forecasting horizons. The hidden states denote different preferences i. e. modes considered in the choice set, and sensitivity to level-of-service attributes. The evolutionary path of those hidden states is hypothesized to be a first-order Markov process. The framework is applied to study the evolution of travel mode preferences, or modality styles, over time, {{in response to a}} major change in the public transportation system. We use <b>longitudinal</b> <b>travel</b> diary from Santiago, Chile. The dataset consists of four one-week pseudo travel diaries collected before and after the introduction of Transantiago, a complete redesign of the public transportation system in the city. Our model identifies four modality styles in the population: drivers, bus users, bus-metro users, and auto-metro users. The modality styles differ in terms of the travel modes that they consider and their sensitivity to level-of-service attributes. At the population level, there are significant shifts in the distribution of individuals across modality styles before and after the change in the system, but the distribution is relatively stable in the periods after the change.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{theoretical}} engine noise prediction, using such techniques as finite element modelling, is highly {{dependent upon the}} understanding of the various mechanisms of noise generation in the running engine. The forcing mechanism of an operating engine is complicated as it involves a large number of forces taking place simultaneously or in rapid succession at various positions in the structure. A number of test methods have been developed to simulate individually each one of these loading mechanisms on non-running engines. These test methods are reviewed in this thesis with an objective judgement on their representation of the actual forcing on the running engine. A new hydraulic test method has been successfully developed to simulate various forms of loading mechanisms on the non-running engine like the gas force on top of the piston, main bearings axial and vertical loading, and piston slap force. This test method is shown to be more comprehensive, realistic, practical and representative than previous simulation techniques, especially with respect to the level of forcing which corresponds well with that of the running engine. The structural sensitivity of the engine has been evaluated for different representative loading, the most sensitive input being that of the axial force at the main bearings. The damping characteristics of a large six cylinder diesel engine block has been calculated and the crank shaft is shown to affect it as well as affecting the wave propagation through the structure. The simulation technique has also allowed the detailed study of the various forms of wave propagation in a diesel engine load carrying structrue and this has shown the importance of both bending and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>travelling</b> waves in noise radiation. It is shown that bending waves provide the maximum amplitudes of vibration, whereas longitudinal wave propagation allows for the fast transfer of energy through the structure which can then convert into bending waves with high noise radiation potential. Analysis of the results has shown that some doubt must be placed on the normal mode method for predicting the response in the lower frequency range, and an alternative model based on highly damped travelling bending waves is visualized to be suitable to model the crank case wall but not the stiff upper...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{failure rate}} of {{electric}} {{overhead travelling crane}} supporting structures across the world is unacceptably high. Failures occur even when the supporting structures are designed within the relevant design codes. This demonstrates {{a lack of understanding}} of the dynamic behaviour of cranes in many design codes. The current South African loading code is simplistic with respect to crane supporting structure design, relying on empirical factors to determine the correct loads. While these factors lead to predicted forces in the correct range of values, the Eurocode’s methods are more scientifically based. In recognition of this the draft South African code predominantly incorporates the methods used by the Eurocode to calculate design forces for crane supporting structures. The purpose of this thesis was to use an existing numerical model to determine the wheel loads induced by a crane into the crane supporting structure through hoisting, normal <b>longitudinal</b> <b>travel,</b> skewing and rail misalignment. The numerically obtained forces were then compared with the design forces estimated in the current South African code and the Eurocode, in order to determine whether the factors and methods used in the codes are accurate. The current empirically based South African code was found to be highly conservative. In contrast the scientifically based design forces from the Eurocode were close to the numerically calculated forces, only failing to predict the behaviour of the crane in the case of skewing. Further work needs to be completed in the estimation of forces induced during this load case. Once this is achieved it is hoped that the better understanding of the crane forces adapted from the Eurocode into the draft South African code will lead to a reduction in failures of electric overhead travelling crane supporting structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) is energetically demanding. Finding patchily distributed food throughout the Southern Ocean varies between populations and individuals. Uniquely marked (Pistorius et al. 1999) underyearling (n= 4) and yearling (n= 11) southern elephant seals were instrumented with satellite transmitters from 2001 2006. Their movements were analysed and overlaid onto bathymetric (GEBCO) {{maps of the}} surrounding regions. Both age groups displayed an east to west path of travel with small variance in latitudinal travel and high variance in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>travel.</b> Eight of the 15 tracks were of 200 days or more, describing the movements of these seals from their first winter haul-out to the moult. The remaining 8 tracks describe a dispersal phase {{from east to west}} and terminate just before the animals were due to return to the island. Under-yearling and yearling elephant seals from Marion Island are shown to make two mid-winter trips. The seals travel exclusively along the South-West Indian Ridge in a westerly direction, directing their movements over areas of high bathymetric heterogeneity. All the under-yearling seals travelled to and from the island along the Andrew Bain fracture zone, seldom passing 25 ºE. Yearling elephant seals showed varied dispersal strategies. Four yearlings displayed similar movements to under-yearlings. Five yearlings showed a tendency to move along the South-West Indian ridge up to 10 ºE, most animals spent extended periods {{in the vicinity of the}} Meteor Rise and Sea- Mounts. One individual went as far as 5 ºW, following the South-West Indian ridge until reaching the mid-Atlantic ridge. The strong relationships between bathymetric features and dispersal of juvenile elephant seals from Marion Island may be due to the interaction of varied bottom topography with overlying water bodies to generate areas of high turbulence resulting in high primary productivity...|$|E
40|$|Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) in {{pipeline}} steel {{occurs when}} an aggressive environment and tensile stresses act on a susceptible microstructure. Typically, SCC in gas pipelines tends to travel {{perpendicular to the}} hoop stresses in the through-wall direction. Studies conducted on the TransCanada pipeline, where a rupture had occurred, revealed the incidence of SCC cracks, whose crack path deviated at an angle from the normal. These unusual inclined cracks have also been found in an Australian pipeline, resulting in {{a need for a}} more comprehensive understanding of inclined SCC. As a result, this study has been undertaken to investigate SCC in Australia, in particular the morphology of inclined SCC and together with the many inclined crack features and crack interactions and anomalies (inclusions) in the pipe steel. This study revealed that 81 % of SCC cracks investigated were inclined. The majority of cracks analysed were over 4 mm in length, which corresponded to the calculated critical crack length according to industry guidelines. Inclined cracks morphologically presented with a straight section before they inclined away from the perpendicular direction. The straight section tended to be between 200 - 900 μm and the inclination angle varied between 30 - 60 °. This inclination angle increased as the crack grew deeper into the pipe wall, resulting in long cracks travelling a considerable distance in the hoop direction (3. 8 mm travel for a 51 mm longitudinal surface SCC crack). In two cases (out of 120 cracks), subsurface longitudinal crack travel was observed to be approximately 1. 5 mm. In most other cases, no subsurface <b>longitudinal</b> <b>travel</b> was observed. Observed crack interactions did not breach current industry guidelines used for SCC threat assessment. Hence, procedures currently employed for critical crack assessment are still deemed valid and conservative enough for Australian operations. Thesis (M. Phil.)

Available data with which to adequately understand learner travel behaviour, and its significance for developing effective plans and strategies to address road safety and traffic congestion problems, is insufficient. This paper reviews the findings of recent learner travel surveys in parts of Cape Town which extend the available data, and enable an improvement of current knowledge of learner travel behaviour and of the prospects of intervening effectively in this segment of the passenger market. These studies {{take the form of a}} learner travel survey conducted amongst 14 secondary schools in Mitchells Plain and two other similar, but less extensive, surveys undertaken in Khayelitsha and Blaauwberg, which enable insights into the relationship between socio-economic grouping and travel behaviour. The paper presents a summary of the findings of these surveys, and reflects upon the need for, and prospects of, establishing a <b>longitudinal</b> learner <b>travel</b> database. The paper illustrates a clear relationship between household socio-economic grouping and learner mode use, with walking the dominant mode amongst lower income learners and car travel the dominant mode amongst higher income learners. The most common travel difficulties identified by the learners surveyed include personal safety, travel time and road safety. It is argued that there are benefits to be derived from learners who currently walk long distances switching to cycling, and that the available data suggests that greater potential for switching to cycling exists amongst learners in secondary schools. The benefits of establishing a <b>longitudinal</b> learner <b>travel</b> database, drawn from a variety of sources including census data and past and future ad hoc learner travel surveys, are argued to be improved data quality and validation to better inform the formulation of plans and strategies directed at addressing the travel problems experienced by learners, and an ability to monitor behavioural changes in response to the implementation of these plans and strategies over time.

40|$|Macroscopic {{changes in}} the urban {{environment}} and in the built transportation infrastructure, as well as changes in household demographics and socio-economics, can lead to spatio-temporal variations in household travel patterns and therefore regional travel demand. Dynamics in travel behavior may also simply arise from the randomness associated with values, perceptions, attitudes, needs, preferences and decision-making process of the individual travelers. Most urban travel behavior models and analysis seek to explain variations in travel behavior in terms of characteristics of the individuals and their environment. Spatial extents and temporal variation in an individual’s travel pattern may represent {{a measure of the}} individual’s spatial appetite for activity and the variability-seeking nature on his/her travel behavior. The objective of this dissertation effort is to develop a methodology to predict activity participation using revealed spatial extents and temporal variability as variables that represent the spatial appetite and variability-seeking nature associated with individual household. Activity participation is defined as a set of activities in which an individual or household takes part, to satisfy the sustenance, maintenance and discretionary needs of the household. To accomplish the goals of the dissertation, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>travel</b> data collected from the Commute Atlanta Study are used. The raw Global Positioning Systems (GPS) data are processed to summarize trip data by household travel day and individual travel day data. A methodology was developed to automatically identify the activity {{at the end of each}} trip. Methods were then developed to estimate travel behavior variability that can represent the variability-seeking nature of the individual. Existing methods to estimate activity space were reviewed and a new Modified Kernel Density area method was developed to address issues with current methods. Finally activity participation models using structural equation modeling methods were developed and the effects of the variability-seeking nature and spatial extent of activities were applied to the models. The variability-seeking nature was presented in the activity participation model as a latent variable with coefficient of variation of trips and distance as indicator variables. The dissertation research found that inclusion of activity space variables can improve the activity participation modeling process to better explain travel behavior. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Objective: With {{the rise}} of Smartphone use, a new method of travel {{behaviour}} data acquisition arises as well. The Smartphone, carrying numerous sensors including GPS, may allow for registered data acquisition instead of reported data from the traditional travel diary surveys. In this research, we use an automated trip registration procedure via a Smartphone application in contrast to self-registration. This survey design may cater for a reduction in under registration of trips in comparison to self-registration and therefore provides a benchmark {{for the quality of}} the traditional travel diary surveys. However, the use of Smartphone’s in the acquisition of travel behaviour data is still in an emerging phase and the potential is still largely unclear. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the potential of using a Smartphone in the process of data acquisition of travel behaviour by evaluating the accuracy of measurement, battery life and participant burden in a pilot study. Methodology: To assess the potential of using the Smartphone in travel behaviour data acquisition, we will evaluate the functionality and the user experience of the MoveSmarter-application during the pilot study of the Dutch Mobile Mobility Panel (DMMP). This panel, containing over 500 individuals, will be monitored for 4 weeks and are paid for their cooperation. We provide some non-smartphone-users in the sample group with a Smartphone with the MoveSmarter-application installed. The application uses the data from the GPS-sensor in the Smartphone to recognize trips of an individual. After processing the data, information per trip can be extracted such as distance travelled, time spent, (average) speed, modality used and travel purpose. Furthermore, the respondents are asked roughly twice per week to verify and, if needed, to correct the processed trip information using a web interface to ensure the accuracy of the trip overview. Moreover, the respondents are asked to answer some additional questions about their travel choices as well. On a daily basis the respondents are asked if there were any circumstances that influenced their travel choices (e. g. weather conditions and delays in the transport system). Results: The results of the pilot study will show the potential of using Smartphone for the acquisition of travel behaviour data. The results will be analyzed from an accuracy, technical and usability viewpoint. Firstly, the data gathered should accurately reflect the travel behaviour of the participants. All trips made should be detected and an accurate estimation of the trip purpose and modality should be made. Secondly, the Smartphone’s and measurement application should not use too much of the Smartphone’s resources to ensure sufficient battery life (i. e. recharging only once per day). Finally, participating in a travel behaviour study as such should not come with a large burden on the respondent. The evaluation of the pilot study will reflect on the balance between these three elements in using Smartphone’s for travel behaviour research and will provide suggestions for future application in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>travel</b> behaviour research in combination or eventually as a substitute for the widely-used cross-sectional one-day travel surveys...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{simultaneous}} modeling system for dichotomous endogenous variables is developed and applied empirically to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>travel</b> demand data of modal choice. The reported research {{is motivated by}} three factors. First, the analysis of discrete data has become standard practice among geographers, sociologists, and economists. In the seventies {{a number of new}} tools were developed to handle multivariate discrete data (Bishop, et al., 1975; Fienberg, 1980; Goodman, 1972). However, while these methods are invaluable in studying empirical relationships among sets of discrete variables, they have a limited ability to reveal the underlying causal structure that generated the data. Second, in travel demand analysis and housing market modeling, attention has been focused largely on single-equation models. It can be argued that this scope is too limited. Human decisions are usually not taken in isolation but in conjunction with other decisions and events. There may be complex feedback relations, recursive, sequential, and simultaneous decision structures that cannot be adequately described in a single equation. This has been a major motivation in the seventies in sociology {{for the development of a}} new modeling approach: linear structural equations with latent variables. Such models combine the classical simultaneous equation system model with a linear measurement model. Original developments, particularly the LISREL model (Joreskog, 1973, 1977), did not allow for discrete dependent variables. More recently, Muthen (1983, 1984, 1987) and others (e. g., Bentler, 1983, 1985) developed models that incorporate various types of non-normal endogenous variables, including censored/truncated polytomous and dummy variables. This paper explores the possibilities of this method for simultaneous equation models in dynamic analysis of mobility. A third motivation for the present research is the rapid growth of longitudinal data sets. In recent years many longitudinal surveys have become available for geographical, economic, and transportation analyses. In labor and housing market analysis the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID, 1984) has played an important role (Heckman and Singer, 1985; Davies and Crouchley, 1984, 1985). In consumer behavior, the Cardiff Consumer Panel has been a major motivation for the development and testing of dynamic discrete choice models (Wrigley, et al., 1985; Wrigley and Dunn, 1984 a, 1984 b, 1984 c, 1985; Dunn and Wrigley, 1985; Uncles, 1987). In the Netherlands a large general mobility panel has been conducted annually since 1984 (J. Golob, et al., 1985; van Wissen and Meurs, 1989). Here analyses have focused on discrete data on modal choice (T. Golob, et al., 1986), as well as on dynamic structural modeling (Golob and Meurs, 1987, 1988; Kitamura, 1987; Golob and van Wissen, 1988; Golob, 1988). The present paper is an extension of this line of research to incorporate dynamic structural models of modal choice, using data from the Dutch Mobility Panel. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 the basic methodology is developed. In Section 3 the simultaneous equation system of dummy variables is compared with the conditional logistic model, which is derived from, and equivalent to, the familiar log-linear model. In the fourth section, both models are applied to a dynamic data set of train and bus usage. Some major conclusions regarding the above are drawn in the final section...|$|E

In contrast, the level of self-containment of Bundang new town is relatively low among five new towns. On the other hand, Bundang new town’s centrality of commuting network is relatively higher than other new towns, indicating that Bundang new town functions as the central place of employment beyond its administrative boundary. In addition, the relationship between the new town and original town in the same administrative boundary indicates that original town’s dependency to newtown has increased over time except Jungdong.

40|$|Transit {{times of}} <b>longitudinal</b> pulses that <b>travel</b> near {{reinforcing}} steel bars are usually smaller than in plain concrete. Chung first, and then Bungey, demonstrated {{the importance of}} including bar diameters in the correction factors when pulses propagating parallel and near to the bars can not be avoided. Besides the influence of geometric dispersion and mode conversion on pulse propagation, there is an effect due to a specific pattern of radial variation of longitudinal wave velocities {{from the surface of}} the embedded steel bar. Wall effects produce a region (a sheath) of concrete surrounding the steel bar, with smaller longitudinal pulse velocities in comparison with the velocity farther away from the bar. Then the acoustic energy travels trapped in a kind of composite leaky waveguide with a velocity less than the compression (P) wave velocity in steel and in concrete but greater than the extensional wave velocity in steel. A mathematical model of the propagation of a longitudinal wave-packet is constructed, taking into account both attenuation and dispersion effects. An asymptotic analysis of pulse propagation and the introduction of a threshold of detection in the receiving transducer, allows the derivation of an approximate analytical formula for transit times. Then the meaning of transit times in NDT of concrete is discussed. The abovementioned formula is used to study the effects of the reinforcing bar radius, the propagatio...|$|R
40|$|From {{the moment}} {{e-shopping}} emerged, there are speculations {{about the impact}} that would have on personal mobility. Questions {{about the impact of}} e-shopping on mobility increase due to media coverage on the sharp increase in turnover of Internet purchases and the increasing number of consumers that shops via the Internet. The increase in Internet shopping does not only occur in the Netherlands, but worldwide. The global online retail market showed an 14. 8 % average annual growth from 2007 to 2012, while the total retail growth was just a 0. 9 % over the same period (Cushman & Wakefield, 2013). In Europe almost one out of three have purchased goods and services over the Internet in 2013 (Ecommerce Europe, 2013). The questions is whether the overall personal shopping mobility indeed decreases {{as a result of the}} increase in e-shopping. A fair amount of research has already been carried out on Internet shopping itself, but much less on its consequences for transportation. Rotem-Mindali & Weltreveden (2013) made an overview of the available studies on a e-shopping and the impact of that on both personal and freight transport. These studies differ in definition of e-shopping, in data collection approach, in analysis approach, etc. Different hypothesis varying from a likely decrease, to no or only a small decrease or even an increase in personal mobility have been formulated and have been empirically tested over the last two decades. In this paper, we will provide insights into how shopping via the Internet changes shopping travel behaviour, rather than estimate the total impact of e-shopping on total personal shopping-induced mobility in the Netherlands. More specifically: we will unravel the different constituent processes of e-shopping, which are looking for, choosing, buying, retrieving and returning products, and argue what the impact on personal mobility of each of these stages of e-shopping is. we will discuss the results of fitting a regression model that we have developed and estimated in which the reported number of shopping trips is explained from personal, household and spatial characteristics as well as e-shopping behaviour (e. g. e-shopping frequency). The same will be done for the travel distance as well as the travel time related to these shopping trips. we will present a mode choice model in order to study what determines mode choice for shopping trips and whether, and if so, to which extent e-shopping influences this mode choice behaviour. The above mentioned contributions will be made using data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (in Dutch: MobiliteitsPanel Nederland (MPN)). The MPN is a state-of-the-art household panel which main objectives are to determine short-run and long-run dynamics in travel behaviour of individuals and households, and to determine how changes in personal and household characteristics and in other travel-related factors (e. g. economic crisis, reduced taxes on sustainable transport, changes in land-use or the increased availability and use of ICT) correlate with changes in travel behaviour (Hoogendoorn-Lanser et al., 2014). In the scope of the MPN, in 2013, respondents 12 years and older from 2, 500 complete households recorded their travel data using a three-day travel diary. Over the next four years, this will be repeated at least yearly with the same respondents. At the same time, different questionnaires were filled out offering a large amount of background information on respondents and their households. Additionally, a questionnaire was filled out that provides us with detailed information on respondents' e-shopping behaviour and the consequences for their personal shopping-related mobility. Besides the frequency with which they purchase different types of products via the Internet, for the last purchased item(s) the processes of looking for, choosing, buying, retrieving and returning products are mapped in detail, and the way in which both the Internet and physical stores play a role in each of these stages. It is the unique combination of reported shopping trips in the 3 -day travel diary, the large amount of personal and household characteristics combined with the detailed information from the e-shopping questionnaire that enables us to perform the above mentioned research. Looking at some of the first insights stemming from our analyses, we found that consumers rarely collect Internet purchases at the dedicated collection points or at physical stores of web shops, which were generally put in place to reduce delivery transport. The large majority of purchased items is still delivered at home or received digitally. Types of products that have shown the largest growth in number of sales are often those products that do not need to be delivered physically, but find their way to consumers digitally. The sharp increase in e-shopping revenues does therefore not imply an equal growth in delivery transport - although this is often assumed. If products need to be collected or returned, people use generally the same transport modes: 51 % uses car, 31 % goes by bike and 12 % go on foot. The share of public transport for collecting and returning products is minimal. For 65 % of the items that need to be collected, the travel distance is less than 5 km. Our analyses furthermore show that e-shopping frequency influences the number of reported shopping trips in a different way than it does the travel distance and travel time related to shopping. E-shopping frequency has a significant impact on the number of shopping trips made by respondents. Although e-shopping frequency has a significant impact on the distance travelled to shops, this impact is smaller. Level of urbanisation of the respondent's residential area and the number of cars in the household turn out to be equally important. This is a likely explanation that - although people report to make less shopping trips due to online shopping - the decrease in total yearly shopping related mobility in the Netherlands is minimal. For specific subpopulations differences can be observed in total shopping mobility between those who frequently or infrequently buy products via the Internet. Men and elderly people make more shopping trips per person per day, travel longer and/or further for shopping purposes. For people living in rural areas and people that have a low or high income the opposite is true. For them, shopping mobility decreases with an increase in e-shopping frequency. When people are asked directly how e-shopping influences their shopping mobility, one third mentions their shopping-induced mobility has not changed since the also shop via the Internet. Two third however state that change have occurred. Over 30 % nowadays makes fewer shopping trips; while 11 % indicate that they travel more often for shopping. Cushman & Wakefield.

40|$|The {{transportation}} system is undergoing major technological and infrastructural changes, {{such as the}} introduction of autonomous vehicles, high speed rail, carsharing, ridesharing, flying cars, drones, and other app-driven on-demand services. While the changes are imminent, the impact on travel behavior is uncertain, as {{is the role of}} policy in shaping the future. Literature shows that even under the most optimistic scenarios, society’s environmental goals cannot be met by technology, operations, and energy system improvements only – behavior change is needed. Behavior change does not occur instantaneously, but is rather a gradual process that requires years and even generations to yield the desired outcomes. That is why we need to nudge and guide trends of travel behavior over time in this era of transformative mobility. We should focus on influencing long-range trends of travel behavior to be more sustainable and multimodal via effective policies and investment strategies. Hence, {{there is a need for}} developing policy analysis tools that focus on modeling the evolution of trends of travel behavior in response to upcoming transportation services and technologies. Over time, travel choices, attitudes, and social norms will result in changes in lifestyles and travel behavior. That is why understanding dynamic changes of lifestyles and behavior in this era of transformative mobility is central to modeling and influencing trends of travel behavior. Modeling behavioral dynamics and trends is key to assessing how policies and investment strategies can transform cities to provide a higher level of connectivity, attain significant reductions in congestion levels, encourage multimodality, improve economic and environmental health, and ensure equity. This dissertation focuses on addressing limitations of activity-based travel demand models in capturing and predicting trends of travel behavior. Activity-based travel demand models are the commonly-used approach by metropolitan planning agencies to predict 20 - 30 year forecasts. These include traffic volumes, transit ridership, biking and walking market shares that are the result of large scale transportation investments and policy decisions. Currently, travel demand models are not equipped with a framework that predicts long-range trends in travel behavior for two main reasons. First, they do not entail a mechanism that projects membership and market share of new modes of transport into the future (Uber, autonomous vehicles, carsharing services, etc). Second, they lack a dynamic framework that could enable them to model and forecast changes in lifestyles and transport modality styles. Modeling the evolution and dynamic changes of behavior, modality styles and lifestyles in response to infrastructural and technological investments is key to understanding and predicting trends of travel behavior, car ownership levels, vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and travel mode choice. Hence, we need to integrate a methodological framework into current travel demand models to better understand and predict the impact of upcoming transportation services and technologies, which will be prevalent in 20 - 30 years. The objectives of this dissertation are to model the dynamics of lifestyles and travel behavior through: •	Developing a disaggregate, dynamic discrete choice framework that models and predicts long-range trends of travel behavior, and accounts for upcoming technological and infrastructural changes. •	Testing the proposed framework to assess its methodological flexibility and robustness. •	Empirically highlighting the value of the framework to transportation policy and practice. The proposed disaggregate, dynamic discrete choice framework in this dissertation addresses two key limitations of existing travel demand models, and in particular: (1) dynamic, disaggregate models of technology and service adoption, and (2) models that capture how lifestyles, preferences and transport modality styles evolve dynamically over time. This dissertation brings together theories and techniques from econometrics (discrete choice analysis), machine learning (hidden Markov models), statistical learning (Expectation Maximization algorithm), and the technology diffusion literature (adoption styles). Throughout this dissertation we develop, estimate, apply and test the building blocks of the proposed disaggregate, dynamic discrete choice framework. The two key developed components of the framework are defined below. First, a discrete choice framework for modeling and forecasting the adoption and diffusion of new transportation services. A disaggregate technology adoption model was developed since models of this type can: (1) be integrated with current activity-based travel demand models; and (2) account for the spatial/network effect of the new technology to understand and quantify how the size of the network, governed by the new technology, influences the adoption behavior. We build on the formulation of discrete mixture models and specifically dynamic latent class choice models, which were integrated with a network effect model. We employed a confirmatory approach to estimate our latent class choice model based on findings from the technology diffusion literature that focus on defining distinct types of adopters such as innovator/early adopters and imitators. Latent class choice models allow for heterogeneity in the utility of adoption for the various market segments i. e. innovators/early adopters, imitators and non-adopters. We make use of revealed preference (RP) time series data from a one-way carsharing system in a major city in the United States to estimate model parameters. The data entails a complete set of member enrollment for the carsharing service for a time period of 2. 5 years after being launched. Consistent with the technology diffusion literature, our model identifies three latent classes whose utility of adoption have a well-defined set of preferences that are statistically significant and behaviorally consistent. The technology adoption model predicts the probability that a certain individual will adopt the service at a certain time period, and is explained by social influences, network effect, socio-demographics and level-of-service attributes. Finally, the model was calibrated and then used to forecast adoption of the carsharing system for potential investment strategy scenarios. A couple of takeaways from the adoption forecasts were: (1) highest expected increase in the monthly number of adopters arises by establishing a relationship with a major technology firm and placing a new station/pod for the carsharing system outside that technology firm; and (2) no significant difference in the expected number of monthly adopters for the downtown region will exist between having a station or on-street parking. The second component in the proposed framework entails modeling and forecasting the evolution of preferences, lifestyles and transport modality styles over time. Literature suggests that preferences, as denoted by taste parameters and consideration sets in the context of utility-maximizing behavior, may evolve over time in response to changes in demographic and situational variables, psychological, sociological and biological constructs, and available alternatives and their attributes. However, existing representations typically overlook the influence of past experiences on present preferences. This study develops, applies and tests a hidden Markov model with a discrete choice kernel to model and forecast the evolution of individual preferences and behaviors over long-range forecasting horizons. The hidden states denote different preferences, i. e. modes considered in the choice set and sensitivity to level-of-service attributes. The evolutionary path of those hidden states (preference states) is hypothesized to be a first-order Markov process such that an individual’s preferences during a particular time period are dependent on their preferences during the previous time period. The framework is applied to study the evolution of travel mode preferences, or modality styles, over time, in response to a major change in the public {{transportation system}}. We use <b>longitudinal</b> <b>travel</b> diary from Santiago, Chile. The dataset consists of four one-week pseudo travel diaries collected before and after the introduction of Transantiago, which was a complete redesign of the public transportation system in the city. Our model identifies four modality styles in the population, labeled as follows: drivers, bus users, bus-metro users, and auto-metro users. The modality styles differ in terms of the travel modes that they consider and their sensitivity to level-of-service attributes (travel time, travel cost, etc.). At the population level, there are significant shifts in the distribution of individuals across modality styles before and after the change in the system, but the distribution is relatively stable in the periods after the change. In general, the proportion of drivers, auto-metro users, and bus-metro users has increased, and the proportion of bus users has decreased. At the individual level, habit formation is found to impact transition probabilities across all modality styles; individuals are more likely to stay in the same modality style over successive time periods than transition to a different modality style. Finally, a comparison between the proposed dynamic framework and comparable static frameworks reveals differences in aggregate forecasts for different policy scenarios, demonstrating the value of the proposed framework for both individual and population-level policy analysis. The aforementioned methodological frameworks comprise complex model formulation. This however comes at a cost in terms of prolonged computation and estimation times. Due to the non-convex nature of the objective function, direct maximization of the likelihood could become difficult and highly unstable. An alternative approach would be to use the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm instead of traditional gradient descent algorithms. This particular statistical learning technique is more stable, and requires fewer iterations to converge by taking advantage of the conditional independence structure of the model framework. This dissertation will provide rigorous derivation, formulation and application of the EM algorithm for mixture models and hidden Markov models with logit kernels, which constitute the building blocks of the generalized dynamic framework. Using such a statistical learning technique, i. e. the EM algorithm, model estimation time will be reduced from the order of many hours to minutes. The line of work initiated throughout this dissertation is critical in this era of transformative mobility in terms of developing a generalized model that accounts for adoption styles and dynamic modality styles. The proposed dynamic, disaggregate discrete choice framework models the evolution of travel and activity behavior over time in addition to the adoption and diffusion of new transportation services. The proposed framework can be integrated with current travel demand models through the construct of adoption styles and modality styles, which shall provide a deeper understanding of behavioral dynamics and trends of travel behavior in an attempt to better inform long-range policy making. This dissertation provides the building blocks to advance the field of travel demand modeling in order to guide transformative mobility into the envisioned sharing economy future...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. In {{structural}} engineering practice the actions imposed by {{overhead travelling cranes}} onto the supporting structure are defined as static forces amplified by dynamic coefficients and applied as pseudo-static forces without taking the interaction between crane and supporting structure into account. To investigate the validity of this approach, the forces generated at the wheels of an experimental crane are measured, as the crane traverses on the supporting structure. The interaction at {{the wheels of the}} crane is also visually recorded. These wheel load results will also be used by other researchers, to calibrate a numerical model of the experimental system. A full-scale 5 ton electric overhead travelling crane (EOTC) running on top of rails and a supporting structure, was designed and erected for research purposes. The crane has a span of 8. 3 m and wheel spacing of 4 m, which can be modified. The supporting structure consists of three simply supported mono-symmetric plate girders on each side, with a total length of 13. 8 m. This is supported by columns with a height of about 3. 5 m. This paper describes the calibration of this system for measurement purposes. A data acquisition system was implemented to capture forces, strains, deflections and accelerations at various points on the crane and the supporting structure as well as to measure the velocity of the crane. The forces at the crane wheels are measured through strain gauges on the end carriage load measuring system. The calibrated facility is used to investigate the behaviour of the crane and the supporting structure under regular and exceptional wheel loads, which are classified as follows: - Regular wheel loads occur during normal payload hoisting and lowering, <b>longitudinal</b> crane <b>travel</b> with payload and lateral crab travel with payload. - Exceptional wheel loads occur during eccentric payload hoisting (payload outside normal operational area), impact forces on end-stops, maximum hoisting of the payload, failure of a longitudinal drive mechanism of the crane, misalignment of the supporting structure and skewing of the crane. The maximum values of these experimentally determined wheel loads and the dynamic response of the system is used to help describe the behaviour of the electric overhead travelling crane and its supporting structure...|$|R
40|$|Greater {{environmental}} considerations {{and the desire}} to reduce pollution overflows to watercourses are requiring engineers to develop {{a better understanding of the}} processes involved in pollution transport through sewer networks. Furthermore, developments in modelling techniques and computer power are allowing urban drainage modellers to increase the complexity of their software and so demand additional data that can be incorporated. Presently, an important aspect is quantifying the retention time and dispersion of pollutants entering an urban drainage system. Manholes provide a means of sewer access for maintenance and inspection. Under storm flow conditions they are liable to surcharge above the level of the pipe soffit. This creates a storage volume that has an impact on the <b>longitudinal</b> dispersion and <b>travel</b> time of soluble pollutants in sewer systems. A laboratory investigation has been completed to quantify these effects for various manhole configurations. These include step heights between the inlet and outlet pipes, benching and extreme high surcharge conditions. In addition, re·analysis of previously acquired data has allowed variations in manhole diameter to be considered. Numerical modelling using computational fluid dynamics, combined with laser light sheet visualisation of the flow structures within manholes, has provided greater insight into the processes causing longitudinal dispersion. The coefficients required for two existing longitudinal dispersion models, the advection dispersion equation and the aggregated dead zone model, have been determined by means of an optimisation process. This has been undertaken with computer software specifically written for the purpose. The technique adopted for optimisation is fully detailed. Final conclusions regarding the longitudinal dispersion due to surcharged manholes are presented...|$|R
50|$|The Figure 1 {{illustration}} depicts {{three important}} details worth discussing. The {{first is the}} Rayleigh line, the peak which has been suppressed at 0 cm-1. This peak {{is a result of}} Rayleigh scattering, a form of elastic scattering from the incident photons and the sample. Rayleigh scattering occurs when the induced polarization of the atoms, resulting from the incident photons, does not couple with possible vibrational modes of the atoms. The resulting emitted radiation has the same energy as the incident radiation, meaning no wavenumber shift is observed. This peak is generally quite intense and is not of direct interest for Brillouin spectroscopy. In an experiment the incident light is most often a high power laser. This results in a very intense Rayleigh peak which has the ability to wash out the Brillouin peaks of interest. In order to adjust for this, most spectrum are plotted with the Rayleigh peak either filtered out or suppressed. The second noteworthy aspect of Figure 1 is the distinction between Brillouin and Raman peaks. As previously mentioned, Brillouin peaks range from 0.1 cm-1 to approximately 6 cm-1 while Raman scattering wavenumbers ranges from 10-10000 cm¬-1 (Polian, 2003). As Brillouin and Raman spectroscopy probe two fundamentally different interaction regimes this is not too large of an inconvenience. The fact that Brillouin interactions are such low frequency however creates technical challenges when performing experiments for which a Fabry-Perot interferometer must be used in order to overcome. A Raman spectroscopy system is generally less technically complicated and can be performed with a diffraction grating spectrometer.Figure 1 also highlights the difference between Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. Stokes scattering, positive photon creation, is displayed as a positive shift in wavenumber. Anti-Stokes scattering, negative photon annihilation, is displayed as a negative shift in wavenumber. The locations of peaks are symmetric about the Rayleigh line because they correspond to the same energy level transition but of a different sign (Muller et al., 2005). In practice six Brillouin lines, of interest, are generally seen in a Brillouin spectrum. Acoustic waves have three polarization directions one longitudinal and two transverse directions each being orthogonal to the others, Figure 2. Solids can be considered nearly incompressible, within an appropriate pressure regime, as a result longitudinal waves, which are transmitted via compression parallel to the propagation direction, can transmit their energy through the material easily and thus travel quickly. The motion of transverse waves, on the other hand, is perpendicular to the propagation direction and is thus less easily propagated through the medium. As a result, <b>longitudinal</b> waves <b>travel</b> more quickly through solids than transverse waves. An example of this can be seen in quartz with an approximate acoustic longitudinal wave velocity of 5965 m/s and transverse wave velocity of 3750 m/s. Interestingly, fluids cannot support transverse waves. As a result, transverse wave signals are not found in Brillouin spectra of fluids. Equation 3 shows the relationship between acoustic wave velocity, V, and phonon wavenumber, Ω (Polian, 2003).|$|R
60|$|Tendrils revolve by the {{curvature}} of their whole length, excepting the sensitive extremity and the base, which parts do not move, or move but little. The movement {{is of the}} same nature {{as that of the}} revolving internodes, and, from the observations of Sachs and H. de Vries, no doubt is due to the same cause, namely, the rapid growth of a <b>longitudinal</b> band, which <b>travels</b> round the tendril and successively bows each part to the opposite side. Hence, if a line be painted along that surface which happens at the time to be convex, the line becomes first lateral, then concave, then lateral, and ultimately again convex. This experiment can be tried only on the thicker tendrils, which are not affected by a thin crust of dried paint. The extremities are often slightly curved or hooked, and {{the curvature}} of this part is never reversed; in this respect they differ from the extremities of twining shoots, which not only reverse their curvature, or at least become periodically straight, but curve themselves in a greater degree than the lower part. In most other respects a tendril acts as if it were one of several revolving internodes, which all move together by successively bending to each point of the compass. There is, however, in many cases this unimportant difference, that the curving tendril is separated from the curving internode by a rigid petiole. With most tendril-bearers the summit of the stem or shoot projects above the point from which the tendril arises; and it is generally bent to one side, so as {{to be out of the}} way of the revolutions swept by the tendril. In those plants in which the terminal shoot is not sufficiently out of the way, as we have seen with the Echinocystis, as soon as the tendril comes in its revolving course to this point, it stiffens and straightens itself, and thus rising vertically up passes over the obstacle in an admirable manner.|$|R
