40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} mobile-phone-emitted ra-diation on the oxidant/antioxidant balance in corneal and <b>lens</b> <b>tissues</b> and to observe any protective effects of vitamin C in this setting. Methods: Forty female albino Wistar rats were {{assigned to one of}} four groups containing 10 rats each. One group received a standardized daily dose of mobile phone radiation for 4 weeks. The second group received this same treatment along with a daily oral dose of vitamin C (250 mg/kg). The third group received this dose of vitamin C alone, while the fourth group received standard laboratory care and served as a control. In corneal and <b>lens</b> <b>tissues,</b> malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and ac-tivities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) were measured with spectrophotometric methods. Results: In corneal tissue, MDA level and CAT activity significantly increased in the mo-bile phone group compared with the mobile phone plus vitamin C group and the control group (p 0. 05).

30|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissues,</b> as a mean and standard deviation, was 63.0 [*]±[*] 6.4 °C (n[*]=[*] 3) with saline pretreatment; 53.0 [*]±[*] 0.8 °C and 56.3 [*]±[*] 2.7 °C (n[*]=[*] 3), respectively, with 100 and 1000  mM trehalose pretreatment; 56.0 [*]±[*] 1.6 °C and 55.8 [*]±[*] 1.1 °C (n[*]=[*] 3), respectively, with 100 and 1000  mM maltose pretreatment; 60.0 [*]±[*] 8.8 °C and 59.2 [*]±[*] 6.3 °C (n[*]=[*] 3), respectively, with 100 and 1000  mM cyclic tetrasaccharide pretreatment.

The {{glass transition temperature}} of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissues</b> with trehalose pretreatment appeared more noticeable on the thermogram, compared with other pretreatments.|$|R
30|$|The {{reason why}} the {{pretreatment}} with trehalose did not change the glass transition temperature of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> remains unknown at present. Based on our previous study to determine the melting temperature, the ratio of glass transition temperature over melting temperature (Tg/Tm) of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> falls in the range between 0.5 and 0.75 of the ratio of Tg/Tm of most polymers, {{as a rule of}} thumb in materials science. In our previous study, the melting temperature of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> was elevated by about 10 °C with trehalose pretreatment (Sun et al. 2011). The elevation of melting temperature, combined with no change in glass transition temperature of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> with trehalose pretreatment in this study, indicates that the tissue would stay in the glassy state for a wider range of temperature under the presence of trehalose. These facts might explain the protective effect of trehalose on the tissues or cells in desiccation. A rise in melting temperature by trehalose for lyophilized proteins in a preceding study also supports this line of reasoning (Attanasio et al. 2007).|$|E
30|$|We chose maltose as {{a control}} {{ingredient}} for the pretreatment before drying of the <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> since maltose is another disaccharide with different bonding sites between two glucose molecules, compared with trehalose. We also chose cyclic tetrasaccharide as the pretreatment because we used this substance in the measurement of melting temperature of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> in the previous study (Sun et al. 2011). The pretreatment with trehalose {{did not lead to}} significant changes in the glass transition temperature, compared with saline pretreatment or pretreatment with maltose or cyclic tetrasaccharide. No significant change in the glass transition temperature of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> with trehalose pretreatment in the present study is in marked contrast with the elevation in the melting temperature by trehalose pretreatment in the previous study (Sun et al. 2011).|$|E

In this study, we measured the glass {{transition temperature}} by differential scanning calorimetry of dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissues</b> {{as a model of}} a whole biological tissue to know the effect of pretreatment by trehalose and other sugars. [METHODS] Isolated porcine lenses were incubated with saline, 100 or 1000 mM concentration of trehalose, maltose, or cyclic tetrasaccharide dissolved in saline at room temperature for 150 minutes. The solutions were removed and all samples were dried at room temperature in a desiccator until no weight change. The dried tissues were ground into powder and placed in a measuring pan for differential scanning calorimetry. [RESULTS] The glass transition temperature of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissues,</b> as a mean and standard deviation, was 63. 0 [*]±[*] 6. 4 °C (n[*]=[*] 3) with saline pretreatment; 53. 0 [*]±[*] 0. 8 °C and 56. 3 [*]±[*] 2. 7 °C (n[*]=[*] 3), respectively, with 100 and 1000 mM trehalose pretreatment; 56. 0 [*]±[*] 1. 6 °C and 55. 8 [*]±[*] 1. 1 °C (n[*]=[*] 3), respectively, with 100 and 1000 mM maltose pretreatment; 60. 0 [*]±[*] 8. 8 °C and 59. 2 [*]±[*] 6. 3 °C (n[*]=[*] 3), respectively, with 100 and 1000 mM cyclic tetrasaccharide pretreatment.

30|$|As a {{first step}} to {{understand}} the mechanism underlying the protection of a biological tissue by trehalose, we measured the melting temperature of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> under the presence or the absence of trehalose or cyclic tetrasaccharide {{in our previous study}} (Sun et al. 2011). That study was unique in that the melting temperature of a biological tissue as a whole, even in the dried condition, was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (Sun et al. 2011). In that study, the presence of trehalose, but not cyclic tetrasaccharide, led to an elevation of the melting temperature of the dried <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> (Sun et al. 2011). As an ideal condition of experiments, the melting temperature should be measured in the natural state of a biological tissue with water.

40|$|Posterior capsule {{opacification}} (PCO) is {{a vision}} impairing condition that arises {{in some patients}} following cataract surgery. The fibrotic form of PCO is caused by myofibroblasts that may emerge in the lens years after surgery. In the chick embryo lens, myofibroblasts are derived from Myo/Nog cells that are identified by their expression of the skeletal muscle specific transcription factor MyoD, the bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor Noggin, and the epitope recognized by the G 8 monoclonal antibody. The goal {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that depletion of Myo/Nog cells will prevent the accumulation of myofibroblasts in human <b>lens</b> <b>tissue.</b> Myo/Nog cells were present in anterior, equatorial and bow regions of the human lens, cornea and ciliary processes. In anterior <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> removed by capsulorhexis, Myo/Nog cells had synthesized myofibroblast and skeletal muscle proteins, including vimentin, MyoD and sarcomeric myosin. Alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) was detected in a subpopulation of Myo/Nog cells. Areas of the capsule denuded of epithelial cells were surrounded by Myo/Nog cells. Some of these cell free areas contained a wrinkle in the capsule. Depletion of Myo/Nog cells eliminated cells expressing skeletal muscle proteins in 5 -day cultures but did not affect cells immunoreactive for beaded filament proteins that accumulate in differentiating lens epithelial cells. Transforming growth factor-betas 1 and 2 that mediate an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, did not induce the expression of skeletal muscle proteins in lens cells following Myo/Nog cell depletion.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAccording to the Helmholtz {{theory of}} {{accommodation}} {{the loss of}} accommodation amplitude {{is caused by the}} growing sclerosis of the crystalline lens, whereas the ciliary muscle and the lens capsule are mainly uneffected by age. A permanent treatment method for presbyopia which offers a dynamic accommodation ability is a recent field of study. The concept followed in this paper uses femtosecond laser pulses to potentially overcome the loss of deformation ability of the crystalline lens by creating gliding planes inside the <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> to improve its flexibility. MethodsThe aim of the study is to show that the flexibility of human donor lenses can be increased by applying tightly focused near infrared femtosecond laser pulses into the <b>lens</b> <b>tissue.</b> Thereby the tissue is separated by the photodisruption effect. A certain pattern of gliding planes is cut inside the tissue of 41 human donor lenses and the deformation ability of the lenses are compared using the Fisher spinning test before and after laser treatment. ResultsThe laser treatment results in an increased deformation ability of the crystalline lens. The lens a–p thickness increases on average by 97 μm± 14 μm after the treatment. The Fisher spinning test shows an increase of 16 % in deformation ability of the lens at a rotational speed of 1620 rpm. ConclusionThe creation of gliding planes with a fs laser inside the crystalline <b>lens</b> <b>tissue</b> can change the deformation ability of the lens.

The large variation of the glass transition temperature, measured in the condition of saline or cyclic tetrasaccharide pretreatment, might be attributed to the difference in residual water content among the dried tissue samples. Preceding studies on thermal analysis of isolated proteins also mentioned that trehalose would keep moisture in lyophilized proteins and might influence the measurement of glass transition temperature (Mazzobre and Buera 1999; Hedoux et al. 2009).|$|R
30|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature of isolated porcine lens as a biological tissue in the dried condition could be measured by differential scanning calorimetry.

The presence of trehalose in the drying condition might lead to more regular alignment of biological macromolecules, and thus, would result in more apparent detection of the glass transition temperature. Thermal analysis of the whole tissue, such as the lens in this study, by differential scanning calorimetry, would lead to the elucidation of mechanism for cataract formation (Biro et al. 2006) and also to the development of methods to preserve cells and tissues in the drying or frozen condition (Wolkers et al. 2001, 2002; Li et al. 2007; Orlien et al. 2003; Lynch et al. 2011).|$|R
