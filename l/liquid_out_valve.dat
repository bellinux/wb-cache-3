5000|$|A {{very common}} {{application}} is in sump pumps and condensate pumps where the switch detects the rising {{level of liquid}} in the sump or tank and energizes an electrical pump which then pumps <b>liquid</b> <b>out</b> until {{the level of the}} liquid has been substantially reduced, at which point the pump is switched off again. Float switches are often adjustable and can include substantial hysteresis. That is, the switch's [...] "turn on" [...] point may be much higher than the [...] "shut off" [...] point.

50|$|The used cossettes, or pulp, {{exit the}} {{diffuser}} at about 95% moisture, but low sucrose content. Using screw presses, the wet pulp is then pressed down to 75% moisture.

The pressed pulp is dried and sold as animal feed, while the <b>liquid</b> pressed <b>out</b> of the pulp is combined with the raw juice, or more often introduced into the diffuser at the appropriate point in the countercurrent process.

50|$|A ladle (dipper) {{is a type}} of spoon {{used for}} soup, stew, or other foods. Although designs vary, a typical ladle has a long handle {{terminating}} in a deep bowl, frequently with the bowl oriented at an angle to the handle to facilitate lifting <b>liquid</b> <b>out</b> of a pot or other vessel and conveying it to a bowl. Some ladles involve a point {{on the side of the}} basin to allow for finer stream when pouring the liquid; however, this can create difficulty for left handed users, as it is easier to pour towards one's self.

Unlike the hummingbirds of America, honeyeaters do not have extensive adaptations for hovering flight, though smaller members of the family do hover hummingbird-style to collect nectar from time to time. In general, honeyeaters prefer to flit quickly from perch to perch in the outer foliage, stretching up or sideways or hanging upside down at need. Many genera have a highly developed brush-tipped tongue, frayed and fringed with bristles which soak up liquids readily.
