5|$|The person’s throat {{is first}} swabbed {{to collect a}} sample of mucus. In most RSTs, this mucus sample is then exposed to a reagent {{containing}} antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen. A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction. There are three major types of RST: First, a latex fixation test, which was developed in the 1980s and is largely obsolete. It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present. Second, a <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> test, which is currently the most widely used RST. The sample is applied to a strip of nitrocellulose film and, if GAS antigens are present, these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies. Third, optical immunoassay is the newest and more expensive test. It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies and then with a special substrate on a film which changes colour to signal {{the presence or absence of}} GAS antigen.|$|E
5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{and oxygen}} {{isotopes}} also work as tracers for water budget in terrestrial reservoirs, including lakes, rivers, groundwater and soil water. For a lake, both {{the amount of}} water in the lake and the isotopic composition of the water are determined by a balance between inputs (precipitation, stream and ground water inflow) and outputs (evaporation, stream and ground water outflow). The isotopic composition of lake water can often be used to track evaporation, which causes isotope enrichment in the lake water, as well as a δD-δ18O slope that is shallower than the meteoric water line. The isotopic composition of river water is highly variable and have complicated sources over different timescales, but can generally be treated as a two-endmember mixing problem, a base-flow endmember (mainly ground water recharge) and an overland-flow endmember (mainly storm events). The isotope data suggest that the long-term integrated base-flow endmember is more important in most rivers, even during peak flows in summer. Systematic river isotope data were collected across the world by the Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR).The isotopic composition of groundwater {{can also be used to}} trace its sources and flow paths. An example is a groundwater isotope mapping study in Sacramento, California, which showed <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> of river water with a distinct isotope composition into the groundwater that developed a significant water table depression due to pumping for human use. The same study also showed an isotopic signal of agricultural water being recharged into the giant alluvial aquifer in California's Central Valley. Finally, the isotopic composition of soil water is important for the study of plants. Below the water table, the soil has a relatively constant source of water with a certain isotopic composition. Above the water table, the isotopic composition of soil water is enriched by evaporation until a maximum at the surface. The vertical profile of isotopic composition of soil water is maintained by the diffusion of both liquid and vapor water. A comparison of soil water and plant xylem water δD can be used to infer the depth at which plant roots get water from the soil.|$|E

Therefore, the largely inclined mixing-vanes promoted the cross flow only in the neighborhood of the spacer; the swirling flow inside a subchannel could reach farther downstream than the cross flow. ...|$|R

Here, we asses these differences by combining a 24 -day hillslope sprinkling experiment with a spatially explicit hydrologic model analysis. We focused our work on Watershed 10 at the H.  J.  Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon. Celerities estimated from wetting front arrival times were generally much faster than average vertical velocities of δ 2 H. In the model analysis, this was consistent with an identifiable effective porosity (fraction of total porosity available for mass transfer) parameter, indicating that subsurface mixing was controlled by an immobile soil fraction, resulting in the attenuation of the δ 2 H input signal in <b>lateral</b> subsurface <b>flow.</b> In addition to the immobile soil fraction, exfiltrating deep groundwater that mixed with <b>lateral</b> subsurface <b>flow</b> captured at the experimental hillslope trench caused further reduction in the δ 2 H input signal. Finally, our results suggest that soil depth variability {{played a significant role}} in the celerity–velocity responses. Deeper upslope soils damped the δ 2 H input signal, while a shallow soil near the trench controlled the δ 2 H peak in <b>lateral</b> subsurface <b>flow</b> response.

40|$|Streamflow {{generation}} in the semiarid, seasonally snow-covered, and forested mountain catchments of the Valles Caldera, New Mexico, was investigated using chemical tracers. Samples {{were collected from}} snow, subsurface flow from hillslopes, and streamflow at Redondo and La Jara Creeks from December 2004 to July 2005. A new modeling procedure was developed by combining diagnostic tools of mixing models and end-member mixing analysis to evaluate the assumptions of mixing models. This procedure was successfully used to determine conservative chemical tracers, identify the number of end-members that contribute to streamflow, and evaluate eligibility of end-members.

40|$|Ponencia de introducción a la sesión sobre Ecología Terrestre desarrollada en la Societat Catalana de Biología el 13 de Diciembre de 1979. Theoretical {{development}} in terrestrial ecology found major difficulties in following the advances of aquatic ecology, particularly {{as a result}} of the relative terrestrial ecosystems staticism and complexity and heavier history weigh on them. Some concepts can not easily be applied, i. e, diversity has in them a better expression as structure richness and complexity than as specific variety; in any local succession, growth of biocenose-controlled volume and the transportways complexity are more relevant than the specific diversity increase but we do not have simple parameters quantifying these ideas. The r and K strategies constitute a not entirely satisfactory simplification, because a third one, stress resistance, seems almost so important. Plant demography development is far from that of animal demography, and this is a significant point {{as a result of}} plant dominancy in terrestrial ecology. So, descriptive aspects are overwhelming on dynamic and functional approaches, specially in the Mediterranean area, where edaphic and lithologic factors are sometimes so relevant as climate and where the heterogeneity is also increased - greatly by history. Heterogeneity make necessary a lot of inventory and description work and reduces data extrapolation possibilities. A lot of work has been made during the last 20 years in an intensive experimental plot approach in forest ecology, using highly sophisticated material for energy flows and nutrient cycling studies. Attention is born to vertical transport phenomena, but <b>lateral</b> <b>flows</b> are very important also in nature ecosystems as they are coupled with relief as an energetic subsidies way system.

At this large scale, catchments may have complex hydrological response because of strong surface/groundwater interactions, calling to the development of new methods to investigate stream water gains and losses from and to karst units. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} understand better the hydrogeology of large karstic catchment using a routing hydrological model that quantifies <b>lateral</b> <b>flows</b> across stream network. The model used is the diffusive wave flood routing model able to simulate the dynamic of uniformly distributed <b>lateral</b> <b>flows</b> on river reach between two gauging stations. The application was conducted on the karstic catchment of the upper Loue River (1900 km²) in the French Jura Mountains during highest flood events for 30 years on hourly data. Simulations on four reaches show globally a high spatial variability of lateral gains and losses according to hydro-meteorological conditions. First, a model application on a losing reach allows quantifying the discharge losses which were interpreted as the localised recharge of a binary karst aquifer. Second, an application on gaining reaches shows that the spatial variability of karst contributions to the stream reflects the main groundwater drainage axes identified by spring’s location and artificial tracer tests. Finally, the karst contribution decreases downstream where surface runoff is favoured locally on marly areas. Our results suggest that a distributed representation of surface/groundwater interactions can improve the understanding of how the stream signal is controlled by karst units at large scale.
