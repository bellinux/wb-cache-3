5|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Upminster in 1926. Gas main supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas street <b>lighting.</b> <b>The</b> area was served by good spring water, with mains supply provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the sewerage system began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E

5|$|In this period, {{there has}} also been {{widespread}} cosmetic changes to stations, including the restoration of historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the <b>lighting.</b> <b>The</b> renovations on Line B have been met with criticism for destroying parts of the line's historical patrimony, which dates back to the 1930s.

To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1903 {{with a total}} {{generating}} capacity of 970 kilowatts, the electricity generated being used to power a tram system, and provide local households and streets with electric <b>lighting.</b> <b>The</b> station ceased generating electricity in 1919, however the structure was retained {{for use as a}} sub-station until 1946 when the tram line closed. The station was partially demolished in 1949, but has since been made a locally listed building and is now owned by construction company Nortland Construction. In March 2012 Norland applied to Newcastle City Council for permission to demolish the building on the grounds of it being at risk of collapse.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, efforts {{began to}} turn a city dump into a landmark. The project was to {{construct}} a municipal stadium (now called Modern Woodmen Park). The project was financed by bonds, and cost more than $150,000. Special features included reserved seats, box seats, and night <b>lighting.</b> <b>The</b> stadium was home to the Saint Ambrose University football games, and boxing matches. Today the stadium {{is home to the}} Quad Cities River Bandits baseball team. By 1932, thousands of Davenporters were on public relief due to the Great Depression. A shantytown grew in the west end of the city along the Mississippi River. Sickness, hunger, and unsanitary living conditions plagued the area. Through county and municipal government, the federal Civil Works Administration gave employment to thousands of men. They worked to extend the seawall along the riverfront. More than 200 jobs were created by the construction of Lock and Dam 15 project, in 1932. Hundreds of state employees worked on completing the Kimberly Road Outerbelt Bypass in 1936.|$|E
