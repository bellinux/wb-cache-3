5|$|To fly {{non-stop}} {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean, Concorde required the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft. This {{was achieved by}} a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds, a slender fuselage with high fineness ratio, and a complex wing shape for a high <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio. This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity, and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lift-to-drag</b> {{ratio of}} Buran is cited as 6.5, {{compared}} to a subsonic L/D of 4.5 for the Space Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|Efficiency: For maglev systems the <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio can exceed that of {{aircraft}} (for example Inductrack can approach 200:1 at high speed, {{far higher than}} any aircraft). This can make maglev more efficient per kilometer. However, at high cruising speeds, aerodynamic drag is much larger than lift-induced drag. Jets take advantage of low air density at high altitudes to significantly reduce air drag. Hence despite their <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio disadvantage, they can travel more efficiently at high speeds than maglev trains that operate at sea level.|$|E
25|$|A wing {{is a type}} of fin that {{produces}} lift, while moving through air or some other fluid. As such, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as an airfoils. A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio. The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing. A high <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.|$|E
25|$|In {{cruising}} flight, the thrust-to-weight {{ratio of}} an aircraft is the inverse of the <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio because thrust is the inverse of drag, and weight is the inverse of lift.|$|E
25|$|Otto Lilienthal used a {{rotating}} arm to do measure accurately wing airfoils with varying angle of attacks, establishing their <b>Lift-to-drag</b> ratio polar diagram, but was lacking {{the notions of}} induced drag and Reynolds numbers.|$|E
25|$|Leading edge {{extensions}} {{and body}} lift are incorporated to enhance {{performance in a}} canard layout. This combination is said by the designer to generate 1.2 times the lift of an ordinary canard delta, and 1.8 times more lift than an equivalent sized pure delta configuration. The designer claims such a combination allows {{the use of a}} smaller wing, reducing supersonic drag without compromising transonic <b>lift-to-drag</b> characteristics that are crucial to the aircraft's turn performance.|$|E
25|$|With 41 deposits, it {{was named}} 7X in November with first flight {{slipping}} from late 2004 to early 2005 and certification planned for mid-2006. With a simplified structure to reduce cost and weight, the optimised high-transonic wing improves by more than 10% the <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio over the supercritical-section wing of the Falcon 50 shared by previous Falcons. The cabin is 2.4m (8ft) longer than the 900 and have a lower 6,000ft (1,800m) cabin altitude. the 6,100lb-thrust (21.7kN) PW307A was finally selected, among other risk-sharing partners: Honeywell for avionics architecture, auxiliary power unit, air management system; with Parker Hannifin for the power generation system and wheels brakes; and TRW Aeronautical Systems for the hydromechanical flap and airbrake systems.|$|E
500|$|Lilienthal {{had made}} [...] "whirling arm" [...] tests on {{only a few}} wing shapes, and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings, which had a {{different}} shape. The Wrights took a huge step forward and made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 wings of many shapes and airfoil curves, followed by detailed tests on 38 of them. The tests, according to biographer Fred Howard, [...] "were the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so short a time with so few materials and at so little expense". An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings: in aeronautical terms, wings with a larger aspect ratio (wingspan divided by chord—the wing's front-to-back dimension). Such shapes offered much better <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio than the broader wings the brothers had tried so far.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{thorough}} redesign {{was of the}} wing, the objective being to match {{the performance of the}} cancelled AV-16 while retaining the Pegasus engine of the AV-8A. Engineers designed a new, one-piece supercritical wing, which improves cruise performance by delaying the rise in drag and increasing <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio. Made of composites, the wing is thicker and has a longer span than that of the AV-8A. Compared to the AV-8A's wing, it has a higher aspect ratio, reduced sweep (from 40° to 37°), and an area increased from [...] to [...] The wing has a high-lift configuration, employing flaps that deploy automatically when maneuvering, and drooped ailerons. Using the leading edge root extensions, the new wing allows for a 6,700lb (3,035kg) increase in payload compared with the first-generation Harriers after a 1,000ft (300m) takeoff roll. Because the wing is almost exclusively composite, it is [...] lighter than the AV-8A's smaller wing.|$|E
2500|$|Gliders were {{developed}} from the 1920s for recreational purposes. As pilots began {{to understand how to}} use rising air, gliders {{were developed}} with a high <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio. [...] These allowed longer glides to the next source of 'lift', and so increase their chances of flying long distances. This gave rise to the popular sport known as gliding although the term {{can also be used to}} refer to merely descending flight. Such gliders designed for soaring are sometimes called sailplanes.|$|E
2500|$|The airframe, largely made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, and Kevlar, weighed 939 pounds (426kg) when empty. With {{the engines}} included, the unladen {{weight of the}} plane was 2250lb (1020.6kg). However, when it was fully loaded before the {{historic}} flight, it weighed 9,694.5 pounds (4,397kg) due to {{the large amount of}} fuel required for the long-distance flight. The aircraft had an estimated <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio (L/D) of 27. [...] The canard and wing airfoils were custom-designed, and the aircraft was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. [...] Vortex generators were added to the canard to reduce sensitivity to surface contamination.|$|E
2500|$|The X-37's {{aerodynamic}} {{design was}} derived from the larger Space Shuttle orbiter, hence the X-37 has a similar <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio, and a lower cross range at higher altitudes and Mach numbers compared to DARPA's Hypersonic Technology Vehicle. [...] An early requirement for the spacecraft called for a delta-v of [...] to change its orbit. [...] An early goal for the program was for the X-37 to rendezvous with satellites and perform repairs. [...] The X-37 was originally designed to be carried into orbit in the Space Shuttle's cargo bay, but underwent redesign for launch on a Delta IV or comparable rocket after it was determined that a shuttle flight would be uneconomical.|$|E

In 1972, a Lynx broke the world speed record over 15 and 25km by flying at [...] It also {{set a new}} 100km closed circuit record shortly afterwards, flying at [...] In 1986, the former company demonstrator Lynx, registered G-LYNX, was specially modified with Gem 60 engines and British Experimental Rotor Programme (BERP) rotor blades. On 11 August 1986 the helicopter was piloted by Trevor Egginton when it set an absolute speed record for helicopters over a 15 and 25km course by reaching an official record with the FAI it currently holds. At this speed, it had a <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio of 2, and its BERP blade tips had a speed of Mach 0.97.|$|E
2500|$|The Il-18 was {{developed}} to meet Aeroflot's need for a high-altitude, long-range aircraft to fly its long-haul national and international routes. It was conceived as a cantilever low-wing monoplane, powered by four Charomskii ACh-32 diesel engines, as initially used in the Ilyushin Il-12, with a tricycle landing gear. To improve the wing's <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio and the aircraft's maximum speed, the wing was given a very high aspect ratio of 12. It was intended to operate from both paved and unpaved runways with a length of less than [...] Its main wheels were larger than normal to handle the rough surfaces. The pressurized fuselage was circular in cross-section, which provided room for cargo and baggage compartments under the cabin floor. A variety of seating plans were under consideration, ranging from 66 seats to 27 sleeping berths, but no decision had been made before it was canceled.|$|E

50|$|Wingtip devices {{increase}} the lift generated at the wingtip (by smoothing the airflow across the upper wing near the tip) {{and reduce the}} lift-induced drag caused by wingtip vortices, improving <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio. This increases fuel efficiency in powered aircraft and increases cross-country speed in gliders, in both cases increasing range. U.S. Air Force studies indicate that a given improvement in fuel efficiency correlates directly with the causal increase in the aircraft's <b>lift-to-drag</b> ratio.|$|E
