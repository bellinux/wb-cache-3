5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{regarded}} as an ideal location for air training {{for a number of}} reasons. It was far from the hostilities, firmly pro-British and had excellent weather throughout the year. The British Air Ministry resolved to outsource training to the colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after EATS took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> going in Canada. The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so {{for the first time in}} November 1940.|$|E

25|$|He {{held the}} record for the longest time taken to score a duck in Test cricket as well as taking a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off the mark, but was {{dismissed}} for duck– 77 balls and 101 minutes for New Zealand versus South Africa in 1999. Though his record for longest time for a duck, but his record for longest time for no runs was held until March 2013, when England cricketer Stuart Broad batted for 103 minutes against New Zealand before scoring a run.|$|E
25|$|He {{was a bit}} late {{coming into}} {{international}} cricket. He was already into his thirties when he first played for the national side. However, having waited for a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his chance, he was quick to seize the opportunity presented to him. At Faridpur, playing for the Central Zone side, he took 3/24 against the MCC in 1980–81. With Obaidul Haq Azam taking 7/18, the tourists were bundled out for a 79 in their first innings. For Azhar, even bigger success came in three-day match at Rajshahi. By taking 6 wickets for 48 runs, he restricted the MCC side to 255.|$|E
25|$|After Hurricane {{production}} ended, CanCar {{looked for}} new work and secured with a {{contract from the}} U.S. Navy to build Curtiss SB2C Helldivers. This production did not go nearly as smoothly, and a continual stream of minor changes from Curtiss-Wright (in turn demanded by the U.S. Navy) meant that full-scale production took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> started. In {{the midst of this}} project MacGill and the works manager, E. J. (Bill) Soulsby, were dismissed. It was initially rumoured that Soulsby had been curt with a group of senior naval officers who had visited a week earlier, but it was later revealed the reason for the dismissals was that the two were having an affair.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{classical}} and quantum transport processes on some finite networks and model them by continuous-time random walks (CTRW) and continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW), respectively. We calculate the classical and quantum transition probabilities between two nodes of the network. We numerically {{show that there}} is a high probability to find the walker at the initial node for CTQWs on the underlying networks due to the interference phenomenon, even for <b>long</b> <b>times.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> global information (independent of the starting node) about the transport efficiency, we average the return probability over all nodes of the network. We apply the decay rate and the asymptotic value of the average of the return probability to evaluate the transport efficiency. Our numerical results prove that the existence of the symmetry in the underlying networks makes quantum transport less efficient than the classical one. In addition, we find that the increasing of the symmetry of these networks decreases the efficiency of quantum transport on them. Comment: 18 pages, 20 figure...|$|R
25|$|The final {{difficulty}} was {{the great}} parade of knights {{that was supposed to}} open the tournament at noon. The knights had had little practice mounting their horses and took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> prepared. Then each knight and his entourage (forty different groups) was supposed to ride to the castle, pick up a lady, officer or knight, and return to the lists. But there was only one drive to and from the castle, so that the knights had to jostle back and forth past and through each other. There had been no arrangement for parade control, and the knightly gridlock took hours longer to unfold than had been planned. By the time the parade was ready, it was a half mile long and over three hours late.|$|E
25|$|Operant conditioning, {{sometimes}} called instrumental learning, was first extensively studied by Edward L. Thorndike (1874–1949), who observed {{the behavior of}} cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes. A cat could escape from the box by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole, but when first constrained the cats took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out. With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently, so the cats escaped more and more quickly. Thorndike generalized this finding in his law of effect, which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences {{are less likely to}} be repeated. In short, some consequences strengthen behavior and some consequences weaken behavior. By plotting escape time against trial number Thorndike produced the first known animal learning curves through this procedure.|$|E
500|$|Matty Johns and {{the other}} players were {{investigated}} by police and cleared of any criminal wrongdoing. In May 2009, Johns appeared on the Nine Network's [...] A Current Affair program to explain {{his role in the}} event. He admitted having sex with the young woman, but claimed that it was consensual. He was later described as appearing during this interview like a [...] "broken-down wreck". Johns later said that he [...] "disconnected" [...] for a month after his suspension. He stated that his wife and family experienced [...] "great pain" [...] {{in the midst of the}} publicity. He said, [...] "It took us a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over it. It pains me they have to go through it again." [...] There was speculation that his media career was over.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|In another interview, Sapochnik {{revealed}} that the wildfire explosion at the Sept of Baelor was originally going to only {{be seen from the}} outside, but after storyboarding the sequence with shots of the High Sparrow also being engulfed, Sapochnik was able to convince Benioff and Weiss to make the change for the sequence. Sapochnik also stated about the sequence, [...] "The main chunk of the sequence was essentially a courtroom drama and then lots of little scenes surrounding it shot in many different sets and locations and even countries so it took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all the pieces into the editing system and start actually editing." [...] He also said that the main goal of the scene was to [...] "bring all these intersecting storylines surrounding King's Landing together and end them," [...] and that the music in the scene {{played an important role in}} reflecting how the scenes played out on screen tonally, praising Ramin Djawadi's opening score. The Girona Cathedral in Girona, Spain stood in for the exterior shots of the Sept of Baelor.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} in the online {{speculative}} fiction magazine Strange Horizons, Tony Keen was critical of Bear's novel, saying that {{the present and future}} passages [...] "do not mesh terribly well", and that it is [...] "too long" [...] with [...] "too many ideas". He complained that the book was difficult to follow and that Bear keeps [...] "moving the goalposts as it suits his narrative". Keen said that for a science fiction novel, he was surprised at its [...] "lack of consistency", and called it more a work of fantasy than science fiction. He said the [...] "revelations" [...] at the end still did not help explain what had happened, but that [...] "by this point, it was for me hard to care". A {{review in the}} Oakland Tribune complained that Bear, who it felt is not strong on [...] "crafting memorable characters", [...] "struggles" [...] with the novel's multiple viewpoints. The review added that while he [...] "takes a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there, and arrives with a palpable scent of anticlimax, [...] does deliver at the end", although with not enough to satisfy the reviewer.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of a token bardic is that there's still a chance for spontaneity and followers, yet it's easy to be polite to other performers because you can easily see when another performer wants a turn.

500|$|... "We {{did a lot}} of work on {{character}} and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," [...] Hui noted. [...] "In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> right." [...] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell {{into the hands of the}} surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.|$|E
500|$|Mendes' {{dominating}} visual {{style was}} deliberate and composed, with a minimalist design that provided [...] "a sparse, almost surreal feeling—a bright, crisp, hard edged, near Magritte-like take on American suburbia"; Mendes constantly directed his set dressers {{to empty the}} frame. He made Lester's fantasy scenes [...] "more fluid and graceful", and Mendes made minimal use of steadicams, feeling that stable shots generated more tension. For example, when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnhams' dinner table, he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters. He {{wanted to keep the}} tension in the scene, so he only cut away when Jane left the table. Mendes did use a hand-held camera for the scene in which Col. Fitts beats Ricky. Mendes said the camera provided the scene with a [...] "kinetic off-balance energy". He also went hand-held for the excerpts of Ricky's camcorder footage. Mendes took a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the quality of Ricky's footage to the level he wanted. For the plastic-bag footage, Mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air. The scene took four takes; two by the second unit did not satisfy Mendes, so he shot the scene himself. He felt his first take lacked grace, but for the last attempt, he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground. Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag.|$|E
500|$|A {{new set of}} the {{interior}} of the TARDIS was also designed, which Moffat estimated was three times bigger than the previous set. Moffat did not decide to create the new interior specifically for the new Doctor, but the brief to the set designer was to create a design that would suit Smith's Doctor. Though he loved the old set, Moffat thought {{it was time for a}} new one to [...] "surprise people", and believed that the spirit of a new era was to change everything. Piers Wenger said that it took [...] "quite a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the design right" [...] and they were careful not to make it too futuristic-looking, as [...] "futuristic" [...] meant nothing to the Doctor. The set was designed by Edward Thomas. The previous TARDIS interior was shown at the beginning of [...] "The Eleventh Hour"; the Time Rotor on console had to be rebuilt due to the explosion special effects that were used in The End of Time. In [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the sonic screwdriver is destroyed, and a new version, featuring a green light and metal claws, was created. Smith liked to keep the prop with him at all times [...] "twirling it around and flicking it" [...] which resulted in him breaking four of them. The noise made by the screwdriver was added in post-production using a synthesizer. Moffat described the changes as starting with a [...] "clean slate" [...] which made sense after the previous cast and crew had left.|$|E

50|$|Once at a {{healthcare}} facility, support must {{be provided}} until the venom is metabolised and the victim can breathe unaided, especially if no species-specific antivenom is available. Given that the toxins alter acetylcholine transmission which causes the paralysis, some patients have been successfully treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, such as physostigmine or neostigmine, but success is variable and may be species-dependent, as well. If death occurs, it typically takes place about six to 12 hours after the krait bite, but can be significantly delayed. Cause of death is usually respiratory failure—suffocation by complete paralysis of the diaphragm. Even if patients make it to a hospital, subsequent permanent coma and even brain death from hypoxia may occur, given the potentially <b>long</b> transport <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> medical care.|$|R

So he refused, and they withdrew their funding. It was very last minute that the Ertegun brothers at Atlantic gave us the cash and we were gone within days of getting that money. Alan had wanted to do it earlier, but there was just no money to do it with. He had no money, ever. He was always living hand to mouth.|$|E
50|$|Quintaglios live {{a mostly}} nomadic lifestyle, {{travelling}} in packs and following herds of animals. They {{set up camp}} for a short while, then move on so that prey can repopulate extensively hunted areas. Quintaglio population density is kept fairly low for this reason, and also due to the culling of egglings by the Bloodpriests. The culling of eggs is necessary as Quintaglios have a large sense of territoriality, socially acceptable close quarters means anywhere from 7 to 10 paces between each person. Quntaglios who feel that their space has been violated, along with other factors (such as having not hunted in a <b>long</b> <b>time)</b> tend <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fierce, and if not calmed might enter dagamant and fight the intruder(s) to the death.|$|R
5000|$|It {{had been}} a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> {{aspiration}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Sagay city status. The leadership of Mayor Joseph G. Marañon and Vice Mayor Fortunato S.

Passing through the legislation process, a public hearing was held in Sagay City on February 22, 1996. On May 3, 1996, Sen. Raul Roco sponsored the Senate Bill No. 1191, the Senate version of the cityhood. On June 11, 1996, then President Fidel V. Ramos signed into law RA8192, now the charter of Sagay City.
