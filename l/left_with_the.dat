5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and was <b>left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{impression}} {{that she had}} interrupted an argument. She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E
5|$|After Philippi, a new {{territorial}} {{arrangement was}} made {{among the members}} of the Second Triumvirate. Gaul and the provinces of Hispania and Italia were placed in the hands of Octavian. Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen Cleopatra VII, the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son Caesarion. Lepidus was <b>left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> province of Africa, stymied by Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.|$|E

5|$|After {{an hour on}} the ground, the {{helicopters}} <b>left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first 61 evacuees, including all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced {{the helicopters}} to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with her}} husband, Shabazz left the Nation of Islam in 1964. She {{witnessed}} his assassination the following year. <b>Left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> responsibility of raising six daughters {{as a single}} mother, Shabazz pursued a higher education, {{and went to work}} at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
5|$|Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn {{continued}} {{to push for}} an attack on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards Gonzales, where {{a small group of}} Texians were refusing to obey orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the Battle of Gonzales officially opened the Texas Revolution. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for Béxar. He <b>left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bulk of his soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bahía.|$|E

5|$|By all accounts, {{infidelity}} {{was responsible}} for the breakup of van Meegeren’s marriage to Anna de Voogt; they were divorced on 19 July 1923. Anna <b>left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> children and moved to Paris where van Meegeren visited his children from time to time. He now dedicated himself to portraiture and began producing forgeries to increase his income.|$|E
5|$|During the Lim era, the {{population}} became predominantly Amorite but also included Akkadian named people, {{and although the}} Amorite language became the dominant tongue, Akkadian remained the language of writing. The pastoral Amorites in Mari were called the Haneans, a term that indicate nomads in general, those Haneans were split into the Banu-Yamina (sons of the right) and Banu-Simaal (sons of the <b>left),</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ruling house belonging to the Banu-Simaal branch. The kingdom was also a home to tribes of Suteans {{who lived in the}} district of Terqa.|$|E
5|$|German paratroops {{attacked}} Crete on 20 May. Many paratroopers landed {{near the}} Div Cav positions and were beaten back. Cut {{off from the}} 10th Brigade headquarters, Russell followed Kippenberger's orders and withdrew to Galatas in Chania, to reinforce a Greek unit south of the village. At dusk, the regiment dug in near a stone wall. B Squadron held the right flank and C Squadron the centre; A Squadron and the 19th Battalion held the <b>left,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Greek unit in reserve.|$|E

5|$|Other risks {{associated}} with the crinoline were that it could get caught in other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be caught by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off their feet. In 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was <b>left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.|$|E
5|$|The 7th (Meerut) Division {{advanced}} in two columns. The 21st Brigade, on the right, {{supported by a}} mixed field-artillery brigade of two 4.5-inch howitzer and one 18-pounder batteries and a machine-gun company, advanced through Felamiye and Kufr Zibad. The 19th Brigade, on the <b>left,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> VIII Mountain Artillery Brigade and two machine-gun companies followed by the 28th Brigade, moved through El Majdal and Kufr Sur.|$|E
5|$|The Riverview {{became one}} of the few {{remaining}} single-screen theaters in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area; by the end of the 1980s, it was one of only six left, and after 1998, it was one of only four <b>left,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Uptown and Parkway Theaters and the Oak Street Cinema, although since 1998, several new single-screen theaters–the Trylon Microcinema and the Heights Theater–have opened. The owners installed new seats in 1999 that allowed for greater leg room and more space between patrons.|$|E

5|$|The {{company was}} created in 2004 as NSB Anbud AS {{to compete for the}} tender bid for a ten-year public service {{obligation}} (PSO) contract with the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications on the Gjøvik Line. The company won the bid and operations started on 11 June 2005, with newly renovated trains. Following the September 2005 election, all further PSO offerings for railway operations were terminated, and the company was <b>left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> single service, subsequently changing its name to reflect the single route.|$|E
5|$|The flag can {{be flown}} {{vertically}} or horizontally from public buildings, private homes, businesses, ships, town squares, or during official ceremonies. If the flag is flown horizontally, the yellow stripe {{must be at}} top; when flown vertically, the yellow stripe must be facing <b>Left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> red stripe facing Right. While the flag should be flown from sunrise to sunset, government offices in Lithuania and abroad must fly the flag on a 24-hour basis. The flags must conform to the legal standards, and cannot be soiled or damaged in any way.|$|E
5|$|The watercolourist Moses Harris (1731–1785), {{known for}} his The Aurelian or natural history of English insects (1766), {{published}} in 1780, the first scientific descriptions of several Odonata including the banded demoiselle, Calopteryx splendens. He was the first English artist to make illustrations of dragonflies accurate enough to be identified to species (Aeshna grandis at top left of plate illustrated), though his rough drawing of a larva (at lower <b>left)</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mask extended appears to be plagiarised.|$|E

5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his <b>left,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} {{defendants}} {{were required to}} pay trial expenses, and Cofresí's family was charged 643 pieces of eight, two reales and 12 maravedí. Contemporary documents suggest that Juana Creitoff, {{with little or no}} support from Cofresí's brothers and sisters, was <b>left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> debt. His brothers distanced themselves from the trial and their brother's legacy, and Juan Francisco left Cabo Rojo for Humacao. Ignacio also evidently disassociated himself from Creitoff and her daughter, and one of Ignacio's granddaughters ignored Bernardina and her descendants. Due to Cofresí's squandering of his treasure, his only asset the Spanish government could seize was Carlos. Appraised at 200 pesos, he was sold to Juan Saint Just for 133 pesos. After the auction costs were paid, only 108 pesos and 2 reales were left; the remainder was paid by Félix and Miguel Mattei after they made a deal with the authorities giving them the cargo of the San José y las Animas in return for future accountability. Juana Creitoff died a year later.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{played only}} nine more games after passing the milestone, and last played on December 20 against the Minnesota Wild. A healthy scratch in 32 of 50 games, and 28 {{of his final}} 29, Conroy was waived on January 25, 2011. After going unclaimed, he was <b>left</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> option of joining Calgary's AHL {{affiliate}} in Abbotsford or retiring. One week later, on February 4, 2011, Conroy formally announced his retirement and accepted a management position with the Flames organization, becoming the special assistant to General Manager Jay Feaster. On June 6, 2014, Conroy was promoted {{to the position of}} assistant general manager, reporting to GM Brad Treliving.|$|E
