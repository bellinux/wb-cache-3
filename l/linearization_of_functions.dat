40|$|A {{solution}} of two-stage stochastic generalized equations is a pair: a first stage solution which {{is independent of}} realization of the random data and a second stage solution which {{is a function of}} random variables. This paper studies convergence of the sample average approximation of two-stage stochastic nonlinear generalized equations. In particular an exponential rate of the convergence is shown by using the perturbed partial <b>linearization</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions.</b> Moreover, sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness, continuity and regularity of solutions of two-stage stochastic generalized equations are presented under an assumption of monotonicity of the involved functions. These theoretical results are given without assuming relatively complete recourse, and are illustrated by two-stage stochastic non-cooperative games of two players. Comment: 25 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

An alternative linearization method is presented in this paper. The method assumes that covariance matrices are determined on a square root factored form. A factorization of the output covariance from a nonlinear vector function is directly determined by "perturbing" the nonlinear function with the columns of the factored input covariance, without explicitly calculating the linearization and with no differentiations involved. The output covariance is more accurate than that obtained with the ordinary Jacobian linearization method.

40|$|Abstract. The {{classical}} {{formula of}} Lagrange for the inversion <b>of</b> analytic <b>functions</b> is extended to analytic and non–analytic inversion problems on non– Archimedean fields. We give some applications {{to the field}} of formal Laurent series in n variables, where the non–analytic inversion formula gives explicit formal solutions of general semilinear differential and q–difference equations. In particular we will be interested in studying the Siegel center problem (<b>Linearization</b> <b>of</b> germs <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> near a fixed point) and the problem of conjugation of a vector fields with its linear part near a critical point. In addition to the analytic Siegel Center problem, we give sufficient condition for the linearization to belong to some Classes of ultradifferentiable germs, closed under composition and derivation, including Gevrey Classes. We prove that the Bruno condition is sufficient for the linearization to belong to the same Class of the germ. If one allows the linearization to be less regular than the germ new conditions are introduced, weaker than the Bruno condition. This generalizes to dimension n ≥ 1 some results of [CM].

40|$|Temperature and {{emissivity}} {{are among}} the major physical properties of materials which are studied using thermal infrared images. Many methods for temperature and emissivity retrieval are based on <b>linearization</b> <b>of</b> Plancks law though these approximations are subjected to errors. This paper describes the propagation of errors in the <b>linearization</b> <b>of</b> Planks <b>function</b> using Wiens approximation. The relationship between radiance and temperature is non-linear and the temperature emissivity separation is a complex task. Linearization is a technique that mitigates this problem. The data {{used for this study}} were obtained using a &# 956;FTIR field spectroradiometer from a quartz sample under controlled conditions. The instrument is calibrated using cold and hot blackbodies and the sensor is calibrated with a Lambertian surface. The emissivity is calculated using the Planks function and the temperature for a radiance measured in a given wavelength. Other sources of errors such as atmospheric effects were not considered here. Possible errors in temperature, emissivity and wavelength were analyzed. To solve the problem of multiple variables, Wiens approximation is applied to the Planks <b>function</b> for the <b>linearization</b> <b>of</b> the data which will help to understand how errors are propagated in different approximation. It is seen that the propagation of errors does not have a significant influence on the final results and the application <b>of</b> <b>linearization</b> can be applied without significant loss of information.

40|$|Abstract- A simple {{interval}} {{method is}} suggested for globally solving optimization {{problems of the}} following type: minimize the objective function ϕ o (x) subject to the functional constraints ϕ o (x) ≤ 0, i= 1, [...] . r and the boundary constraints x ∈ X (o) where x is a n-dimensional vector and X (o) is a given initial search region (a box). All the functions involved are assumed continuously differentiable in X (o). Known interval methods for solving the global optimization problem considered are iterative and {{are based on a}} specific interval <b>linearization</b> <b>of</b> all the <b>functions</b> associated with the problem at each iteration of the method. This linearization involves one real term and n interval terms. In contrast, the present method appeals to a new interval <b>linearization</b> <b>of</b> each <b>function</b> which is constructed {{in such a way that}} now only one additive term is an interval while the remaining n terms are real numbers. The algorithm of the iterative method suggested includes the following basic procedures to be carried out at each iteration: (i) if the current subbox X is strictly feasible, then several tests for unconstrained minimization are applied and an upper bound on the global minimum is also found; (ii) if X is infeasible, X is discarded; (iii) if the first two cases do not occur, then a system of inequalities, including the objective <b>function</b> and some <b>of</b> the functional inequalities, is linearized and simultaneously solved in an attempt to reduce or completely discard X. The system involves at most n inequalities. The use of the new interval linearization in the computational scheme of the present method leads to improved performance as compared to other known interval methods of the same class.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a problem <b>of</b> <b>linearization</b> <b>of</b> multi-output logic <b>{{functions}}.</b> Specifically, the case is discussed, when the functions have {{a large number of}} variables and cannot be efficiently linearized by using known techniques.

The presented benchmarks results demonstrate high efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with known linearization approaches.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{improved}} differential cryptanalysis framework for finding collisions in hash functions is provided. Its principle {{is based on}} <b>linearization</b> <b>of</b> compression <b>functions</b> {{in order to find}} low weight differential characteristics as initiated by Chabaud and Joux. This is formalized and refined however in several ways: for the problem of finding a conforming message pair whose differential trail follows a linear trail, a condition function is introduced so that finding a collision is equivalent to finding a preimage of the zero vector under the condition function. Then, the dependency table concept shows how much influence every input bit <b>of</b> the condition <b>function</b> has on each output bit. Careful analysis of the dependency table reveals degrees of freedom that can be exploited in accelerated preimage reconstruction under the condition function.
