5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Holman Hardt {{is actually the}} one controlling the weather. All of the bizarre weather was the side-effect of his long-silent love for Sheila. He felt guilty that his weather-related problem caused Mootz to crash his car, so he would cause it to rain for Mootz. Once he realized Mootz had been drunk {{the night of the}} accident, however, he stopped. Unfortunately, Mulder begins to unintentionally attract Sheila, resulting in a massive thunderstorm that materializes due to the meteorologist's emotions. At the town's high school reunion, however, Hardt admits his love for Sheila, who accepts him. The storm stops, and Hardt and Sheila <b>live</b> <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after.|$|E

But instead, the magic mirror returns {{her to her}} true form, even more loathsome than before, as punishment from the Green-Eyed One for killing her stepdaughter. Meanwhile, the dwarfs, unable to save Snow White, place her in a coffin of ice and leave her near Monday's statue. When she receives a kiss of true love from Prince Alfred, in his bear form, she is revived. The spells on Alfred, Sunday, and Monday break, and Elspeth's mirrors shatter, freeing John.

5|$|Six months later, King Stewart {{learns that}} Redbush {{is gone and}} {{he makes his way}} to Quahog to reclaim his wife and kill Griffin Peterson. King Stewart's army arrives in Quahog where they terrorize the colony (similar to a scene from Blazing Saddles). King Stewart orders Cockney First Lieutenant (Chris) to search every house for them. Upon being {{discovered}} by the First Lieutenant, Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush are confronted by King Stewart. Griffin Peterson threatens to kill the officer, while King Stewart threatens to kill Redbush. After exchanging threats without getting anywhere, Griffin and Stewart decide to settle their dispute with a talent show, with the winner winning Lady Redbush's hand in marriage, and ownership of the town of Quahog. For his act, King Stewart steals his jester's mostly unfunny jokes about his Aunt Frieda. However, Griffin, Quagmire, Joe, Cleveland, Mort, and Seamus effectively steal the show with a techno-rock number from Revenge of the Nerds. This was enough to defeat King Stewart in the talent show. After King Stewart and his army leaves, Griffin and Redbush remain in Quahog to <b>live</b> <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after.|$|E
5|$|The second {{video game}} {{based on the}} film was titled Beauty & The Beast: Belle's Quest and is an action {{platformer}} for the Sega Genesis. Developed by Software Creations, the game was released in North America in 1993. It {{is one of two}} video games based on the film that Sunsoft published for the Genesis, the other being Beauty & The Beast: Roar of the Beast. Characters from the film like Gaston can help the player past tricky situations. As Belle, the player must reach the Beast's castle and break the spell to <b>live</b> <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after. To succeed, she must explore the village, forest, castle, and snowy forest to solve puzzles and mini-games while ducking or jumping over enemies. Belle's health is represented by a stack of blue books, which diminishes when she touches bats, rats, and other hazards in the game. Extra lives, keys and other items are hidden throughout the levels. While there is no continue or game saving ability, players can use a code to start the game at any of the seven levels.|$|E

5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and <b>live</b> <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E

25|$|Sisumayana {{introduced}} the earliest writings in the sangatya metre in his works Anjanacharita and Tripura-dahana, the later being a poem on {{the destruction of}} the triple fortress of birth, decay and death. The earliest known lexicon in Kannada is the Ranna Kanda (990) by the great poet Ranna with each verse ending with kaviratna. Ranna was the poet laureate (Kavichakravarti) of Western Chalukya kings Tailapa II and Satyashraya and was bestowed the royal attributes of golden rod, royal umbrella and an elephant by his patrons. The earliest books on cookery were written by Jayabandhunandana, Mangarasa. A book on toxicology was written by Mangaraja I in 1360 called Khagendramani-darpana. Among fiction writers, Nemichandra who was patronised by Hoysala Veera Ballala II wrote Lilavati in 1170. This story is a romance fiction based on an earlier work in 610 called Vasavadatta by Subhandu with the scene of action in Banavasi. A Kadamba prince and a princess dream of each other, meet after many delays and are finally wedded to <b>live</b> <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after. Dramas make their arrival into Kannada literature with Malavi-Madhava by Karnaparya (1140) and Subhadraharana and Prabodhachandra by Kesiraja (1260) being the earliest dramas now considered extinct. Of the once that are available, Mitravinda-govinda by Singararaya (1680) is a Kannada version of Sriharsha's Ratnavali. Writings of local history made their appearance after the fall of Vijayanagara Empire. Some well-known works of history are Maisururajara-charitre, Chikkadevarajavamsavali (17th century), Keladinripavijaya by Linganna, the last book being an important source of information on the origin of Vijayanagara Empire, etc. Among Biographies, Rajanripa-vijaya, Kanthiravanarasaraja-vijaya, Chikkadevaraja-vijaya (17th century) and Bijjalaraya-charite etc., are well-known works.|$|E
500|$|Five {{days before}} the first PS2 release for Kanon, a PS2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. Kanon {{was one of the}} three games {{supported}} at launch, the other two being America Ōden Ultra Quiz from DigiCube and Marle de Jigsaw from Nippon Ichi Software. The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu where the game received an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7). Yūichi Suzumoto commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of Kanons story could be summed up as [...] "the prince and princess <b>live</b> <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after. The end," [...] resulting in an ending that does not expand on what could possibly happen afterwards. In the October 2007 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, poll results for the 50 best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, Kanon ranked fifth with 71 votes.|$|E
500|$|Martin is firm about {{ending the}} {{series with the}} seventh novel [...] "until I decide not to be firm". With his stated goal of telling the story from {{beginning}} to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes. He knows the ending in broad strokes {{as well as the}} future of the main characters, and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will <b>live</b> <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after. Martin hopes to write an ending similar to The Lord of the Rings that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series Lost, which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires. In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing A Dream of Spring together with The Winds of Winter, and in early 2016, {{he said he did not}} believe A Dream of Spring would be published before the last season of the HBO show.|$|E

500|$|Atwell had stated on {{potential}} further seasons, [...] "We {{think that there}} could be more to come....the [...] finale doesn't suggest that that's it and they <b>live</b> <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after; that's the end. We know that's not the case. They've done it in a very clever way which wraps up and that gives the audience a very satisfying conclusion but they're not quite finishing it and leaving it there." [...] On the location for a third season, Fazekas stated that moving the series to London had been a possibility, an idea that creators Markus and McFeely had early on. Fazekas added, [...] "you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [...] all going to be determined by what story we want to tell. I loved [...] I loved how it looked, I loved how it looked on Peggy. We would be very happy to do another L.A. season, but we're not married to it." [...] Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and {{that the end of the}} second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file, was [...] "very much tied to a third season arc", with the shooter and their reason for taking the file already determined. Atwell added that the third season would have gone [...] "further back into [...] past” while having [...] "a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [...] family." [...] She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael.|$|E
500|$|However, several {{critics were}} more {{positive}} towards the show. A number of publications welcomed {{the show as}} [...] "guilty pleasure", including The Huffington Post, The Atlantic, and The Week. Tim Stack, writing for Entertainment Weekly, described the reality series as: [...] "my favorite little slice of reality TV spongecake." [...] Lauren Le Vine of Refinery29 appreciated {{the success of the}} family which [...] "achieved the American dream of making something out of nothing," [...] using the given platform. Libby Hill of The A.V. Club also acknowledged the show's success and said: [...] "Keeping Up With The Kardashians gives us real, joyous, ugly, unsavory, hilarious life, with all the polished sitcom trappings. And though the latter may have launched a multimedia empire, the former has made it last". Maura Kelly of The Guardian evaluated the aftermath of the failed wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries, which was documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and subsequently caused public outrage, including an online protest petition to cancel the show. [...] "Since Kim doesn't exactly seem to be an exemplar of self-awareness, I suppose it's possible that she really believed she and Humphries would <b>live</b> <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after," [...] Kelly speculated whether or not the marriage was a publicity stunt. [...] "But more likely, she and E! are laughing {{all the way to the}} bank [...] 10.5 million viewers tuned into [...] "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event", after all," [...] Kelly summarized the controversy. Josh Duboff, writing for Vanity Fair, commented on the show's long run and said that [...] "it is near impossible to argue that their continued relevance, 10 years later, is anything other than awe-inspiring and remarkable".|$|E

Robbie said she had [...] "big shoes to fill", but she was honoured to be working on her biggest storyline since she arrived. Clark said that Donna and Ringo had made the decision {{that they are going to}} be with each other for life and that they are [...] "going to be solid from now on". On the wedding day, Donna's car breaks down and she is forced to ride in the back of Lucas Fitzgerald's (Scott Major) truck. Donna walks down the aisle to Ringo's version of [...] "Suddenly", the original song played at Scott and Charlene's wedding. Clark added [...] "It's a perfect day, but I can't promise they'll <b>live</b> <b>happily</b> <b>ever</b> after." [...] Donna and Ringo became the 36th couple to get married on the show. A month later, Ringo is knocked down by Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) motorcycle and he dies. Donna is devastated and she stays in her room. Steph comes to visit her and as she is apologising, Donna gets up and hugs her.
