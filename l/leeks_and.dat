5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, <b>leeks</b> <b>and</b> chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, <b>leeks,</b> <b>and</b> {{garlic is}} caused by the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|Glamorgan sausage (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh vegetarian sausage for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), <b>leeks</b> <b>and</b> breadcrumbs. The earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese.|$|E

A large number of binocular and microscopic examinations were conducted on the gathered contaminated plant material, from which was concluded thе Puccinia porri (Sow.) Winter most often appears on <b>leek</b> <b>and</b> garlic, and that Puccinia allii, (D. C.) Rudolph can be seen on onion, <b>leek</b> <b>and</b> garlic. In the Republic of Macedonia, the rust most often appears on <b>leek</b> <b>and</b> garlic, and not too often on onion. It causes the greatest damage to garlic <b>and</b> <b>leek,</b> especialy in Kocani, Strumica and Gevgelija region. ...|$|R

5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, <b>leeks</b> <b>and</b> breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, {{is widely}} celebrated with festive family meals and {{symbolic}} foods. Sweetness {{is the main}} theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end with honey cake. The challah is usually round, often studded with raisins and drizzled with honey, and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an entree, such as pomegranates, carrots, <b>leeks</b> <b>and</b> beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, chraime. Honey cake (lekach) is often served as dessert, accompanied by tea or coffee.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Celestial Masters {{followed}} certain regular, communal rites. One {{of these}} communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could {{last as long}} as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, <b>leeks</b> <b>and</b> onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.|$|E

500|$|Sumerian farmers grew the cereals barley and wheat, {{starting}} {{to live in}} villages from about 8,000 BC. [...] Given the low rainfall of the region, agriculture relied on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Irrigation canals leading from the rivers permitted the growth of cereals in large enough quantities to support cities. The first ploughs appear in pictographs from Uruk around 3,000 BC; seed-ploughs that funneled seed into the ploughed furrow appear on seals around 2300 BC. Vegetable crops included chickpeas, lentils, peas, beans, onions, garlic, lettuce, <b>leeks</b> <b>and</b> mustard. They grew fruits including dates, grapes, apples, melons, and figs. Alongside their farming, Sumerians also caught fish and hunted fowl and gazelle. The meat of sheep, goats, cows and poultry was eaten, mainly by the elite. Fish was preserved by drying, salting and smoking.|$|E

500|$|In 1822, crews from Jesus and Brasenose raced {{each other}} to become Head of the River. One Brasenose rower {{apparently}} [...] "caught a crab", slowing the boat. The Brasenose boat was bumped by the Jesus boat, but rowed on regardless and claimed that it was still Head of the River. Jesus and Brasenose men competed over which college's flag should be hoisted to denote the winning boat. One of the Brasenose crew ended the dispute by saying [...] "Quot homines tot sententiae, different men have different opinions, some like <b>leeks</b> <b>and</b> some like onions", referring to the emblem on the Jesus oars, and it was agreed to row the race again. The Brasenose crew won the rematch. The incident has been said to be shown in an 1822 picture, the earliest depiction of an eights race at Oxford, painted by I. T. Serres (Marine Painter to GeorgeIV). However, the print was published on 1 March 1822 {{and it would have}} taken several months to prepare and engrave. It also shows a summer scene. Both of these points suggest that the print depicts either an imaginary scene or an unrecorded event from 1821.|$|E

5000|$|Following nationalisation, {{the line}} {{became part of}} the London Midland Region of British Railways. Passenger {{services}} remained fairly consistent with the wartime levels of five 'up' trains and six 'down' trains a day with additional workmens services between <b>Leek</b> <b>and</b> Uttoxeter. Falling passenger numbers throughout the 1950s led to a proposal in 1959 for the withdrawal of all advertised passenger services between Macclesfield and Uttoxeter and the retention of the non-advertised workmens' services between <b>Leek</b> <b>and</b> Uttoxeter only. [...] Despite objections the proposal was implemented on 7 November 1960. This did not stem the financial losses on the line, and the entire line between <b>Leek</b> <b>and</b> North Rode closed in June 1964. [...] At the same time local goods facilities were withdrawn at all other stations except Leek followed in January 1965 by the withdrawal of the passenger service over the south section between <b>Leek</b> <b>and</b> Uttoxeter and the closure of the line south of Oakamoor.|$|R

2500|$|Meat was {{prepared}} {{in several different}} ways. The most common was to cook it with water as a broth or a stew (for example, [...] ). Meat stewed with onions, garlic and <b>leeks</b> <b>and</b> flavored with cumin and coriander is described on ancient Babylonian cuneiform tablets, and it is most likely that it {{was prepared}} similarly in ancient Israel.

[...] "Turmut, 'tates and mate" [...] (i.e. [...] "Turnip, potatoes and meat", turnip being the Cornish and Scottish term for swede, itself an abbreviation of 'Swedish Turnip', the British term for rutabaga) describes a filling once very common.
