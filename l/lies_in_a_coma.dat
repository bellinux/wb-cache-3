25|$|Earlier in the season, Cliff had J.R. {{facing a}} {{financial}} mess, when J.R.'s plan to blackmail the Farlows into handing over John Ross, by stockpiling 5 {{million barrels of}} the Farlows' crude oil, backfired on J.R., when the market {{price of crude oil}} started to fall and fall. In order to stockpile the Farlows' crude oil, J.R. had taken out a $200,000,000 loan and used $50,000,000 worth of Ewing Oil assets as collateral. Cliff, along with Jordan Lee, Andy Bradley and Wade Luce, then worked with Vaughn Leland in order to buy into the notes owed by J.R., and they planned to foreclose. With Cliff seemingly putting one over on J.R., Miss Ellie bailed Ewing Oil out of this mess by agreeing to a deal with Clayton that Clayton would pay the price that he would have paid {{at the time that the}} oil was stockpiled. By the season's end, J.R. and Cliff's situations had turned sharply in the opposite direction, as Sue Ellen, with whom Cliff had had an off-and-on relationship, decided to return to J.R., planning to marry him again. In addition, J.R. had set a trap for Cliff by making sure that a fake geological report would convince Cliff to invest millions of dollars in buying property on supposedly oil rich land which was actually bone dry. Cliff was then fired by his mother from running Wentworth Tool & Die, due to Cliff's embezzlement of company funds. Cliff attempts suicide with an overdose of pills, and a guilt-ridden Sue Ellen rushes to his bedside as Cliff <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coma.</b> J.R. tries to convince Sue Ellen that it was not anybody's fault but Cliff's for what happened, but Sue Ellen disagrees and says she does not know if she can remarry J.R. if Cliff dies. Cliff's life hangs in the balance as the season ends.|$|E

Nevertheless, they form a close in bond, particularly as Mini remains distant from Liv. In her episode, Franky, overwhelmed with guilt, escapes to 'bad boy' Luke for companionship and excitement.

50|$|Alexi Tamarov was Hibernia's third {{midshipman}} after Seafort and Holser.

Tamarov, only sixteen at the beginning of the series, was initially somewhat childish, but rapidly matured into an experienced and trustworthy officer. He was Hibernia's first midshipman from Holser's promotion to Lieutenant until the arrival of Philip Tyre, and following his own promotion to Lieutenant was put in charge of the wardroom to deal with Tyre. After Hibernia's return, Tamarov became second lieutenant of Portia, and during her voyage finally came to terms with the fact that his hatred of Tyre was spiralling out of control, and ended his vindictive hounding of the midshipman. Upon Seafort's second arrival in Hope Nation, Tamarov acted as his second in Seafort's duel with Admiral Tremaine, and later became his aide as he recovered. Acting as such, Tamarov was seriously injured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> terrorist attack, <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coma</b> for some time, and later suffering from amnesia, although he eventually recovered, and rose to Captain of his own ship, marrying and fathering two children.
