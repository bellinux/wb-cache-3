40|$|A {{scheduling}} {{method for}} determining the critical path in linear projects is presented, {{that takes into account}} maximum time and distance constraints in addition to the commonly used minimum time and distance constraints. The maximum constraints, though often present in the specifications of a project, are not considered during the planning procedure, since no method existed to enable scheduling with them. The proposed method builds on the concept of the maximum constraints and expands on the necessary background for their implementation into the schedule. The introduced critical path algorithm allows for grouping linear activities into four categories regarding their critical status and their ability to influence project duration. The method is applied to a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pipeline</b> construction project and the results are presented...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{function}} of a gas distribution sys- tem, essentially composed of buried pipelines, reduc- tion stations, and demand nodes, is to deliver gas from sources to end users. The objective of the article is to discuss the evaluation of seismic risk of gas networks {{in compliance with the}} performance-based earthquake en- gineering framework adapted to spatially distributed sys- tems. In particular, three issues are addressed: (1) spatial seismic hazard characterization in terms of ground shak- ing and permanent ground deformation; (2) analysis of system’s vulnerability via fragility curves; (3) seismic per- formance evaluation via computer-aided simulation. As an application, the seismic risk analysis of L’Aquila (cen- tral Italy) gas distribution network, a 621 -km mid- and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>pipeline</b> system was considered. The anal- yses were performed with reference to the mid-pressure part of the network, through an object-oriented software, specific for risk assessment of lifelines, developed by the authors. Results in terms of connectivity-based per- formance indicators are presented and discussed, along with a performance disaggregation analysis carried out to evaluate the contribution of the components of the sys- tem to the risk...|$|E

2500|$|Wellington and the Hutt Valley {{were two}} of the {{original}} nine towns and cities in New Zealand to be supplied with natural gas when the Kapuni gas field entered production in 1970, and a [...] high-pressure pipeline from the field in Taranaki to the city was completed. The high-pressure transmission pipelines supplying Wellington are now owned and operated by First Gas, with Powerco owning and operating the medium- and <b>low-pressure</b> distribution <b>pipelines</b> within the urban area.|$|R
50|$|There are 2,600 {{kilometres}} of high-pressure {{natural gas}} transmission pipelines in the North Island. Most {{of these are}} {{owned and operated by}} First Gas, including the Maui pipeline, a 307 km pipeline that carries 78% of all natural gas produced in New Zealand. The <b>low-pressure</b> gas <b>pipelines</b> that distribute gas to end users are owned by First Gas (Northland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Kapiti Coast), Vector (Auckland), Powerco (Hawke's Bay, Taranaki, Manawatu, Wellington) and GasNet (Wanganui).|$|R

40|$|To {{cope with}} {{earthquake}} related secondary disasters, the new real-time disaster mitigation {{system for a}} city gas network has been developed by Tokyo Gas Co. since 1998 {{for the purpose of}} realization of dense real-time seismic motion monitoring, quick gas supply shut-off, prompt emergency response and efficient restoration work. In 2001, Tokyo Gas successfully started the operation of SUPREME, which employs 3, 800 new SI sensors and remote control devices at all the district regulator stations in its service area (3100 km 2). SUPREME can observe the status of 3, 800 district regulators and shut them off remotely, if necessary. The remote shut-off using SUPREME can realize quick gas supply shut-off and effectively reduce gas leakage risk during earthquakes. The SUPREME can also conduct damage assessment for gas pipe with enhanced use of GIS. To estimate the distribution of SI values and liquefied depth more precisely, digital map, geological map, topographical map and borehole logging data of about 60, 000 sites were collected and compiled. Site amplification factors for SI values were estimated at the boring points. Then, spatial distribution of the site amplification factor was estimated based on weighted average of the amplification factors of surrounding boring points and the geological / topographical maps, which is used to estimate the spatial variation of surface SI value from observed SI values by the new SI sensors,. The predicted surface SI distribution of 50 m x 50 m mesh is utilized to estimate seismic damage to <b>low-pressure</b> gas <b>pipeline.</b> In case of liquefaction, a method to evaluate spatial distribution of liquefied depth and PL, was developed also. Based on the method, spatial distribution of liquefaction-induce damage to <b>low-pressure</b> gas <b>pipeline</b> will b...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} the {{solution}} of the traffic situation in the city center of Havlíčkův Brod. Mainly the ground road number II/ 150 adjustment, which consist in the modification of the two-way traffic to one-way traffic organization in the streets Dolní, Žižkova and Na Ostrově by using the analogy of a roundabout layout, is solved within this thesis. All mentioned modifications simplify the traffic situation, improve the orientation and increase the security and the traffic flow mainly in relation to pedestrians and cyclists. Another part of this thesis is focused on revitalization of the public spaces in front of the community center called Ostrov and junction of existing cycle tracks situated on the both banks of the Sázava river. In relation to this topic the adjustment of rainwater sewerage system, low-voltage above ground network, public lighting, communication electric cables, fire brigade signal lights and <b>low-pressure</b> gas <b>pipeline</b> is also solved...|$|R
40|$|In the paper, {{we address}} Bayesian {{sensitivity}} issues when integrating experts’ judgments with available historical {{data in a}} case study about strategies for the preventive maintenance of <b>low-pressure</b> cast iron <b>pipelines</b> in an urban gas distribution network. We are interested in replacement priorities, {{as determined by the}} failure rates of pipelines deployed under different conditions. We relax the assumptions, made in previous papers, about the prior distributions on the failure rates and study changes in replacement priorities under different choices of generalized moment-constrained classes of priors. We focus on the set of non-dominated actions, and among them, we propose the least sensitive action as the optimal choice to rank different classes of pipelines, providing a sound approach to the sensitivity problem. Moreover, we are also interested in determining which classes have a failure rate exceeding a given acceptable value, considered as the threshold determining no need for replacement. Graphical tools are introduced to help decisionmakers to determine if pipelines are to be replaced and the corresponding priorities...|$|R
