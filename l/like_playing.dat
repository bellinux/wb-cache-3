Mike Weigand of GamePro wrote, [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>playing</b> Resident Evil for the first time." [...] GameSpot remarked that the defensive weapons add a new layer of strategy to the game. However, the controls were criticized for their lack of analog precision, a feature that was previously available in the Nintendo 64 version of Resident Evil 2. Hector Guzman of GameSpy criticized the fact that the original game's [...] "laborious" [...] movement scheme, where the analog stick moves the player character in the direction they are facing, was not changed, stating that it can cause unnecessary difficulties when players try to evade monsters. IGN's criticism was similar, but considered the Type C scheme a welcome addition.|$|E

[...] The GamesRadar review called the graphics [...] "a measured improvement on , but not a clean break from the [...] Croft titles." [...] Karavin called the detailing in textures and models [...] "impressive", but cited several points where the game suffered from severe framerate dips. Reed praised the game's graphical polish, with [...] "almost every multi-tiered location crammed with detail and careful incidentals", but critiqued the frequent loading screens and stylised or low detail for environments and characters.|$|E
500|$|Initial discussions {{took place}} in 2008 between Tom Cruise and Noyce about Cruise playing Edwin A. Salt. These discussions were ongoing {{for more than a}} year between the pair and their representatives. It was finally decided that Cruise was unable to commit to the script, because he feared that the {{character}} was too close to his [...] character Ethan Hunt. Cruise decided to work on [...] Knight and Day instead. The filmmakers tried to differentiate the character from Hunt, but eventually came to accept they were too similar and decided not to change the characteristics of Salt. Noyce said [...] "But, you know, he had a valid point. It was kind of returning to an offshoot of a character that he’d already played.

[...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way.

500|$|The {{physical}} {{violence in the}} story {{is a metaphor for}} the mechanisms behind capitalism. Morgan uses competition as theme throughout novel, punctuated by the [...] "portrayal of a society governed by extreme violence, ruthlessness and with no account for law, morals or humanity". Violent competition, where the losers die, is the norm and {{comes in the form of}} businesses competing for contracts, employees competing for promotions, foreign governments fighting insurgents, and other stand-offs between characters. Non-violent competition is viewed as a novelty or ineffective, <b>like</b> <b>playing</b> chess or publishing opinion essays. The existence of winners and losers and the duality of [...] "haves and the have-nots" [...] are contrasted. By illustrating how the First World exploits the Third World and the corporate executive's use of the ghetto areas, the novel challenges the idea that the have-nots are there by choice or that they competed and lost.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} new {{freestyle}} features into gameplay, citing the overuse of the Flavor Flav default sample {{in the first}} game.

While the addition of new multiplayer modes was well-received, many felt the vocal track addition did not work out well. [...] Chris Watters of GameSpot noted that [...] "the singing evaluation doesn't feel as slick as in other games", and unless the player knows the music from both tracks of a mix, singing the back-and-forth mix [...] "isn't all that fun". Helgeson commented that attempting to sing lyrics from two separate songs [...] "feels <b>like</b> <b>playing</b> karaoke game in the grips of a seizure".|$|E
