60|$|In {{the first}} weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest, gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final retirement, a small {{interval}} alone. Much as I liked my companions, this hour was the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded--or rather, I should say, the day lingered and the <b>last</b> <b>calls</b> of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the old trees--I could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy, almost {{with a sense of}} property that amused and flattered me, the beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving pleasure--if he ever thought of it!--to the person to whose pressure I had responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me, and that I COULD, after all, do it proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied myself, in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a general}} shade in all the lower reaches--a fine clear dusk in garden and grove, a thin suffusion of {{twilight}} out of which the greater things, the high tree-tops and pinnacles, the long crests of motionless wood and chimnied roof, rose into golden air. The <b>last</b> <b>calls</b> of birds sounded extraordinarily loud; they were like the timed, serious splashes, in wide, still water, of divers not expecting to rise again. I scarce know what odd consciousness I had of roaming at close of day in the grounds of some castle of enchantment. I had positively encountered nothing to compare with this {{since the days of}} fairy-tales and of the childish imagination of the impossible. Then I used to circle round enchanted castles, for then I moved {{in a world in which}} the strange [...] "came true." [...] It was the coming true that was the proof of the enchantment, which, moreover, was naturally never so great as when such coming was, to such a degree and by the most romantic stroke of all, the fruit of one's own wizardry. I was positively--so had the wheel revolved--proud of my work. I had thought it all out, and to have thought it was, wonderfully, to have brought it. Yet I recall how I even then knew on the spot that there was something supreme I should have failed to bring unless I had happened suddenly to become aware of the very presence of the haunting principle, as it were, of my thought. This was the light in which Mrs. Server, walking alone now, apparently, in the grey wood and pausing at sight of me, showed herself in her clear dress at the end of a vista. It was exactly as if she had been there by the operation of my intelligence, or even by that--in a still happier way--of my feeling. My excitement, as I have called it, on seeing her, was assuredly emotion. Yet what was this feeling, really?--of which, at the point we had thus reached, I seemed to myself to have gathered from all things an invitation to render some account.|$|E

If they mean only the imprisonment or compulsion of one person by another, such imprisonment or compulsion being in many cases highly expedient, slavery, so defined, would be no evil in itself, but only in its abuse; that is, when men are slaves, who should not be, or masters, who should not be, or even the fittest characters for either state, placed in it under conditions which should not be. It is not, for instance, a necessary condition of slavery, nor a desirable one, that parents should be separated from children, or husbands from wives; but the institution of war, against which people declaim with less violence, effects such separations,--not unfrequently in a very permanent manner. To press a sailor, seize a white youth by conscription for a soldier, or carry off a black one for a labourer, may all be right acts, or all wrong ones, according to needs and circumstances. It is wrong to scourge a man unnecessarily. So it is to shoot him. Both must be done on occasion; and it is better and kinder to flog a man to his work, than to leave him idle till he robs, and flog him afterwards.

The Jewish nation throve under it, in the hand of a monarch reputed not unwise; it is only the change of whip for scorpion which is inexpedient; and that change is as likely to come to pass on the side of license as of law. For the true scorpion whips are those of the nation's pleasant vices, which are to it as St. John's locusts--crown on the head, ravin in the mouth, and sting in the tail.

About EUR 195 million have been invested {{in research and}} demonstration projects on photovoltaics with the first five calls of the Programme. The actions to transform the photovoltaic market are carried out with the second Intelligent Energy Europe Programme. Horizon 2020 is the next framework programme {{for research}} and innovation for the 2014 - 2020 period. On {{the basis of the}} Commission proposals, the European Parliament and Council are negotiating the terms for the adoption of the legislative acts. The Commission wishes renewable energy to be developed as cost effectively as possible and works with Member States on the implementation of the Directive on renewables to facilitate the convergence of national support schemes, with schemes following best practice, avoiding over-compensation and retroactive changes. The June 2012 communication on renewables proposes the elements to start discussing the regulatory, industrial and technological configuration and legal instruments which are necessary for the post 2020 environment. The continuous growth of the photovoltaic electricity production in Europe justifies further consideration, particularly with regard to whether the center of gravity of the photovoltaic industry has already moved from technology development and demonstration to market deployment...|$|E

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 37 : 45 in lengthComposed in 1802, Ludwig van Beethoven???s 15 Variations and Fugue {{is a very}} challenging piece for the pianist. For this set of variations, Beethoven took a theme from his own contradance (WoO 14 of 1800 - 01) and he used the same theme in his Prometheus ballet music. Also, an interesting fact is that these variations were written earlier than the Third Symphony, with which they share their name, ???Eroica???. These variations do not start with the theme itself, but {{with the introduction of}} a bass ostinato which develops into variations on its own by adding two, three and four voices. Only after establishing the bass ostinato does the theme enter for the first time, followed by 15 variations and culminating with the four voice Fugue. The Fantasia in F minor Opus 49 composed in 1840 - 1841 by Frederick Chopin is rich with diverse ideas. It had been called a ???symphony for the piano,??? ???possibly Chopin???s most impressive single movement. ??? Most of the ideas in this work are derived melodically from the opening march-like theme. The music reflects picture-like images among which are an introduction, three marches, the second theme and the ending theme. Contrasting with these marches are the agitated main theme and the energetic transition to a majestic hymn {{in the center of the}} development. Another stormy transition leads to the recapitulation of the main theme and the last march. The Fantasia ends with the last statement of the recitative that flows into a rapid passage culminating in a cadence in A-flat major. At the end of the summer of 1911 Rachmaninov wrote nine piano pieces, Op. 33. At the first performance in St. Petersburg on December 5, 1911, the pieces were called preludes-Tableaux and only several days later at the Moscow premiere on December 13, the cycle received the name we know today, Etudes-Tableaux. The composer later called E-flat major Etude-Tableau ???the Fair. ??? Joyful ringing of bells and fanfares alternates with a happy song. The <b>last</b> <b>calls</b> of the fanfares end the etude. The next etude in G minor reminds us, by its mood, of Chopin???s G minor Ballade. Both pieces (Ballade and Etude) end with a G minor scale and two sorrowful chords. The melody of the etude is divided into two registers and has a feel of a conservation between the two hands. The lower register response is rhythmically compressed and has a descending half step instead of a whole step, otherwise the melodies are identical. Originally, the composer took the etude in D minor out of the cycle. A stern choral song-march alternates with distant signals of the bugle. By its thematic material and images this etude resembles the first movement of the first symphony (D minor, Op. 13) and the last theme of the Third Piano concerto (D minor, op. 30).
