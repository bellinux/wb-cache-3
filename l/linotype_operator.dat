25|$|A {{native of}} Chicago, Illinois, the {{diminutive}} Ziegler {{was the daughter}} of Frank Siegler and Mae (née Connal) Ziegler. At a very early age, she played baseball in Chicago. In 1933 her family had to relocate to the Los Angeles, California, due to the economic depression. Her father had been a <b>linotype</b> <b>operator</b> in Chicago, but went into different work after moving to California, while her mother was a housewife and an avid bridge player. Ziegler had a brother, Frank, who was three years older than she. At that time in California girls were not allowed to participate in interscholastic sports, except tennis. As expected, Ziegler expressed disappointment over very little organized women's school sport in her new home, but she recalled that various girls athletic associations in the Los Angeles area provided compensation, as her hectic later teenage years involved memberships on several softball, basketball and speedball teams. In the late 1930s, she joined the Goodrich Silvertown, a prestigious softball club sponsored by B. F. Goodrich Company, one of the largest tire and rubber manufacturers in the world. In 1939 she helped her team win another Southern California Championship.|$|E

Before and during the convention, its {{attendees}} often {{referred to it as}} [...] "Chicon II," [...] an unofficial nickname that stuck to this Chicago Worldcon in the decades that followed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first two}} columns of keys are: e, t, a, o, i, n; and s, h, r, d, l, u. A <b>Linotype</b> <b>operator</b> would often {{deal with a}} typing error by running the fingers down these two rows, thus filling out the line with the {{nonsense}} words etaoin shrdlu. This {{is known as a}} [...] "run down". It is often quicker to cast a bad slug than to hand-correct the line within the assembler. The slug with the run down is removed once it has been cast, or by the proofreader.|$|E

5000|$|Lillian Malt ran a {{secretarial}} training {{business from}} 1955. Based upon her experience of typing errors (having been closely concerned in the printing industry with the retraining of <b>Linotype</b> <b>operators</b> to use computer keyboards), she conceived {{the idea of}} a typewriter keyboard designed with the keys arranged to fit different finger lengths, but found no manufacturer who was willing to work with her. In 1974, Stephen Hobday came to her with a one-handed keyboard that he had designed for the handicapped. Malt made several suggestions for improvement, telling Hobday of her failure to engage the interest of any manufacturers in actually building her ideal keyboard. Hobday told her [...] "You {{tell me what you want}} and I'll tell you whether I can build it or not." [...] From the resulting collaboration, with Malt's expertise in keyboard design and Hobday's expertise in electronics, came the first Maltron keyboard.|$|R

25|$|The <b>linotype</b> machine <b>operator</b> enters text on a 90-character keyboard. The machine assembles matrices, {{which are}} molds for the letter forms, in a line. The {{assembled}} line is then {{cast as a}} single piece, called a slug, of type metal in {{a process known as}} hot metal typesetting. The matrices are then returned to the type magazine from which they came, to be reused later. This allows much faster typesetting and composition than original hand composition in which operators place down one pre-cast glyph (metal letter, punctuation mark or space) at a time.|$|R
