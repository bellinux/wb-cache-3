It was derived from the larger and heavier Z.505 seaplane. The Z.506 entered production in 1936 as the Z.506A, powered by more powerful 560kW (750hp) Alfa Romeo 126 RC.34 nine cylinder radial engines, giving a maximum output of 780 CV on take off and 750 CV at 3,400 meters. The fuselage had a wooden structure covered in tulipier wooden <b>lamellas.</b> The wings were built with a structure of three box-type spars linked by wooden wing-ribs covered by plywood. The floats were made of duraluminium covered in chitonal, and were 12.50 meters long. The armament consisted of a 12.7mm (0.50inch) Breda-SAFAT machine gun in the dorsal position and three 7.7mm (0.303inch) machine guns, one in the ventral position and two {{on the sides of the}} fuselage.

5000|$|... (Original {{description}} by Verrill & Smith) The small, fragile, white, nacreous shell has a conico-turbinate shape. It is canaliculate, {{with a wide}} umbilicus. The five, shouldered whorls are angulated and carinated {{below the}} middle, swollen just below the suture, which lies in a deep channel. They are crossed, above the peripheral carina by numerous elevated, thin, oblique ribs, which rise into <b>lamellas</b> near the suture, where they join the carina forming small nodules. Between the ribs are fine parallel lines of growth and sometimes a few fine revolving lines. Below the periphery, {{in line with the}} posterior edge of the lip, there is a smaller, plain, angular rib, and around the umbilicus there is a strong nodulose rib. Between these ribs, the base is covered with fine revolving lines. Within the umbilicus are radiating raised lines which cross two or three small revolving ribs. The aperture is rounded, with angles corresponding to the ribs.|$|E
40|$|Lamella flanges have lately grown {{very popular}} with the {{designers}} of steel bridges, because - in their belief - they provide us {{with the possibility of}} avoiding very thick flange plates in steel bridge structures.
