Sliding is on the (111) plane of single-crystal silicon in the 112 crystallographic direction both in dry and <b>lubricated</b> (<b>mineral</b> <b>oil)</b> sliding. The friction coefficient in dry sliding is controlled by adhesion and the surface chemical activity of the metal. The more active the metal the stronger the adhesion and the higher the friction.

40|$|Abstract. Burnishing is an {{important}} mechanical surface enhancement technique which can smooth the component surface and improve the component’s fatigue, wear and anti-corrosion properties. Fretting tests <b>lubricated</b> with <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> were performed on a pure copper (PC) against a Si 3 N 4 ball. The burnished surface exhibited a significantly improved fretting wear resistance and higher friction coefficient {{in comparison with the}} coarse-grained (CG) form. The wear volume of the burnished PC is quite lower than that of the CG PC. The friction coefficient of the CG PC increases with an increasing load, while the friction coefficient of burnished PC decreases with an increasing load up to 100 N and then increases. The enhanced wear properties of the burnished surface are correlated with the compressive residual stress and work-hardening, which may partly result from grain refinement induced by burnishing...|$|R

Cylindrical samples of heights (5, 10, 15 and 20 mm) and diameters (25. 4 and 19. 05 mm) were tested under <b>lubricated</b> (<b>mineral</b> <b>oil),</b> non-lubricated (natural) and increased friction (emery paper) conditions. Sample flatness (force free area/loaded area) ranged between 0. 79 and 4. 20. Deformation rate effect was also examined by performing compression tests at 50, 100, 200 and 400 mm min- 1. In this study, parameter derived from compression to failure was failure strain (εr %). It was established a method for determining the area expansion ratio, AF/A 0 (actual maximum area {{in contact with the}} loading platens/original area) at several deformation levels (ε %). For that, loaded area was determined at deformation levels (20 %, 40 % and 80 %) by planimetring of a graphic mark, and then adjusted by regression with respect to deformation level. From this regression, area expansion ratio at failure, AFr/A 0 was obtained by replacing at each equation corresponding failure strain value. Cylindrical potato samples compression was accompanied by a significant cross-sectional area expansion, evidencing a far-ideal area expansion. For lubricated and non-lubricated friction conditions, increasing deformation rate and sample diameter increased AFr/A 0, whereas increasing sample height decreased the ratio, mainly under non-lubricated condition. Lubrication causes an increase of AFr/A 0 average value, near 5 % with respect to that obtained with non-lubricated friction condition, meaning a lower influence of deformation rate and sample height, but a higher flatness influence. Effect due to surface lubrication was smaller than in previous compression tests on cheeses, which could be attributed to release of fluid from the damaged tissue of the potato flesh which relatively reduced lubricant effectiveness. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Tribological tests were performed using the Anton Paar THT 1000 high temperature tribotester according to ASTM G 133. Tribological properties were investigated using the “ball on disc” method.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade the range of {{possible}} applications for diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings has changed significantly: from their conventional use in low-stress applications without lubricants, to their use in high-stress applications under lubricated conditions. Despite this progress, {{there is still a}} lack of understanding of the lubrication mechanisms involving DLC coatings. Our idea for improving the boundary lubrication of DLC coatings is to dope them with various elements, thus making the coatings more "surface-active", in order that they behave in a similar way to conventional metal-lubrication mechanisms. Accordingly, in this paper we present and compare the tribological performance of self-mated (DLC/DLC) non-doped and doped Ti-, W-, and Si-DLC coatings, <b>lubricated</b> with paraffinic <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and using conventional anti-wear (AW) and extreme-pressure (EP) additives. For a comparison, conventional steel/steel contacts were also investigated. The results obtained under relatively severe contact conditions show the significant and beneficial influence of oil additives and DLC doping elements on the wear behaviour. Up to one order of magnitude less wear, as a result of using additives, suggests that efficient boundary lubrication with doped and non-doped DLC coatings can also be achieved and/or improved in self-mated DLC/DLC contacts by using conventional AW and EP additives. The coefficient of friction in DLC contacts increased with the use of additives, but it was always lower than that of steel contacts, thus maintaining the "reputation" of DLC contacts as low-friction coatings. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In this work, a rapid Fourier {{transform}} {{near infrared}} (FT-NIR) spectroscopic peroxide value (PV) method {{was developed and}} a prototype Continuous Oil Analysis and Treatment (COAT) system was assessed for monitoring and analytical purposes. High erucic acid rapeseed oil, a principle representative of triglyceride based oils suitable for biodegradable <b>lubricating</b> applications and <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> were {{used to test the}} methodology developed. The FT-NIR PV method is based on a well defined stoichiometric reaction of triphenylphospine (TPP) with hydroperoxides to form triphenylphospine oxide (TPPO). A partial least squares calibration model for the prediction of PV was developed using the NIR spectral region where TPP and TPPO co-absorb. The resulting calibration was highly linear over the analytical range of 100 PV. Validation of the method carried out by comparing the PV of PLS prediction to the results of AOCS iodometric procedures indicated an excellent concurrence between the two methods. By programming the FT-NIR spectrometer, the analytical procedure simply consists of the addition of TPP stock solution to oil sample, mixing, taking its spectrum and predicting PV value. Through selected testing procedures, the prototype COAT system utilizing FTIR spectroscopy, advanced sample handling system designs, and computer programming was proved to be effective in monitoring the oil quality and behavior of antioxidants in real time. Both approaches offer combined advantages of speed, accuracy, low labor cost, automation, and environmental friendliness mainly derived from FTIR spectroscopy, and can serve as convenient means for routine quality control applications in oils and fats industry. Potential application based on the joint usage of the two methods in the obtaining of true value of oil stability was also presented in this text. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} {{study showed that}} both <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> based nanofluids with 0. 01 % silica mass fraction and with 0. 1 % fullerene mass fraction have a higher AC breakdown strength than <b>mineral</b> <b>oil.</b> Breakdown occurs following discharge initiation and propagation in the oil. The breakdown strength value alone provides little information on the discharge process. Therefore, {{it is important to}} investigate the details of the discharge mechanisms in <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and in nanofluids. Hence, this study focuses on the partial discharge (PD) behavior of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil,</b> silica and fullerene nanofluids. The total charge, voltage and pulse shape were recorded {{with the help of a}} high bandwidth PD measuring system. The discharge mechanism in <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> appeared to depend strongly on the polarity of the applied DC voltage. Under positive DC voltage, the silica and the fullerene nanofluids show increased inception voltage and a reduction of the total discharge magnitude compared to the reference <b>mineral</b> <b>oil.</b> Under negative polarity, inception voltage and discharge magnitude of the nanofluids and the reference <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> are virtually the sam...|$|R
