500|$|The film's main theme {{shows the}} effect that {{coincidence}} and chance can have on the course of life—like the bad weather, angry dog, hungry goats, slippery planks, and careless postman that {{change the course of}} both Kaspar's and Ingeborg's lives—and shows, as the film's website states, that [...] "seemingly unrelated factors might play important roles in the big scheme of things after all." [...] In an interview, Kove said that [...] "what I'm trying to get across is just that I think life is really a kind of a meandering journey... a lot is really up to chance". However, Kove has also said that she'd <b>like</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be able to interpret the film in different ways: ...|$|E

500|$|In March 2008, Hot Chip re-recorded several {{songs from}} Made in the Dark, {{with one of}} their [...] "all-time heroes", Robert Wyatt. Doyle said the band had wanted it to happen [...] "for ages" [...] and that people would {{see it as a}} {{surprise}} collaboration. Taylor said, [...] "I crave confusion and quite <b>like</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be surprised. I try to do that in the words and music and try to be what people don't think we are. Robert is someone we have liked for much longer than people realise. We feel closer to people in a different field, age or era." [...] The album features Emma Smith, who had previously joined with Hot Chip to play violin and saxophone on their first two albums.|$|E
500|$|According to writer Linda Ruth Williams, {{the music}} video {{attracted}} {{attention from the}} press because of [...] "the clash between Spears' wholesome image and Dark's unwholesome back catalogue." [...] A Spears representative spoke to the Sunday Sport and revealed, [...] "as far as I'm aware the director just does music videos. This is a video for young teenage girls and not sexy at all." [...] Dark responded to the negative reviews saying, [...] "I don't deny that I did , it's just that I also <b>like</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> know that I don't currently and haven't in a long time." [...] Billboard reporter Carla Hay also noted, [...] "I don't think people who buy records are too concerned about {{the background of the}} video's director." [...] Lucy O'Brien, author of She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul, noted that hiring Dark as the video director implied that Spears was not that innocent. Time journalists Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce said that Spears [...] "may be the queen of pop tartiness, but her new video, 'From the Bottom of My Broken Heart', is an entirely wholesome affair," [...] while Chris Ryan of MTV considered it [...] "a suitably soft-focus affair". The video was also added to MTV's 2000 Yearbook, a list with the [...] "biggest, best, most memorable music videos of every year since the beginning of MTV." ...|$|E

I would <b>like</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> understand what they did in the past. He too should understand the part he played".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the game}} itself, the city remains nameless but is {{strongly}} influenced by the environs of Philadelphia. Cage cited his like of M. Night Shyamalan movies, several which are situated in Philadelphia. Working with a scouting agent that assisted on the Philadelphia film, Cage and his team visited the city, taking {{in many of the}} poorer neighborhoods and meeting with the residents there to capture the despair, poverty, and fear they saw. Cage has also stated that [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> play it once…because that's life. Life you can only play once... I would <b>like</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> have this experience that way." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm fine with , but the right way to enjoy Heavy Rain is really to make one thing because it's going to be your story. It's going to be unique to you. It's really the story you decided to write... I think playing it several times is also a way to kill the magic of it." [...] In the Director's Cut edition of the game (the PS Move compatible edition) within the bonus content, [...] "The Origami's Trail", the narrator states that the game is in fact set in Philadelphia.|$|E

Since his professional basketball retirement, Lightfoot has moved back to Chattanooga, Tennessee and become a trucking company's accounts manager. He has also become a father after his wife gave birth to their son. When asked how he would <b>like</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> remember his basketball career, he responded, [...] "I want people {{to say that he}} played for the big game.

2500|$|At a young age, Robertson was nicknamed Pat by his six-year-old brother, Willis Robertson, Jr., {{who enjoyed}} patting {{him on the}} cheeks {{when he was a}} baby while saying [...] "pat, pat, pat". As he got older, Robertson thought about which first name he would <b>like</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> use. He {{considered}} [...] "Marion" [...] to be effeminate, and [...] "M. Gordon" [...] to be affected, so he opted for his childhood nickname [...] "Pat". His strong awareness for the importance of names {{in the creation of a}} public image showed itself again during his presidential run when he threatened to sue NBC news for calling him a [...] "television evangelist", which later became [...] "televangelist", at a time when Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker were objects of scandal.|$|E

2500|$|Still {{during the}} {{promotion}} of the album, the singer acknowledged that she had to follow a more honest approach on her next project: [...] " [...] just made me realize that people want authentic Monica," [...] she stated. [...] "They don't want me to keep up with all the different gimmicks and trends that are taking place." [...] In late 2007, Monica started work on her follow-up album. Intending to create a record that lived up to the sound her previous hits, particularly those from the 1990s, she expressed that she wanted to appeal to her existing fans although her label was concerned with making the project sound up to date: [...] "I am going back to where I started. The next album I would <b>like</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> get more songs like [...] "Why I Love You So Much," [...] "Angel of Mine," [...] or the things they really, really love from me [...]" [...] Originally titled Lessons Learned—a reference to the mistakes Monica felt she made with The Makings of Me – the singer decided to change the project after recording the album's title track in 2008 as she felt that Still Standing was more appropriate for the body of work that she and Bryan-Michael Cox pulled off.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the month, Giuliani {{participated in}} the November 28, 2007 YouTube Debate to respond to {{allegations}} of a perceived 9-11 centric candidacy and other criticisms, Giuliani responded that he [...] "...would <b>like</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> look at my whole record. Long before September 11, 2001...the reason that I believe I'm qualified {{to be president of the}} United States is not because of September 11, 2001. It's because I've been tested...and I got very, very remarkable results. And that is the evaluation of other people, not me." [...] He also began airing his first television advertisement in key caucus-primary states. The ad concentrated solely on the transformation of New York City under the Giuliani mayoralty. Observers likened the ad to Republican icon Ronald Reagan's famous [...] "Morning in America" [...] ad. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Poll conducted November 28 found that in the crucial state of Florida 53% of voters found Giuliani to be the best candidate to fight the War on Terrorism. 33% of the Florida voters found Giuliani to be the best to deal with the Iraq conflict and 34% viewed him as the best candidate concerning economic issues. Giuliani led among primary voters in Florida receiving 38%, ahead of his closest rival, Mitt Romney by 21%. However, in head to head matchups, Giuliani was losing his lead. A November 911th poll had Clinton and Giuliani tied at 45% in the traditional red state of Virginia.|$|E
