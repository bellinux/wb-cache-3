Freeman's character alludes to the choice when queried by Andy on why he is called Red, replying [...] "Maybe it's because I'm Irish."

She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well.

500|$|The New York Times in 1966 wrote [...] "Russell's main {{characteristics}} are pride, intelligence, {{an active and}} appreciative sense of humor, a preoccupation with dignity, a capacity for consideration once his friendship or sympathy has been aroused, and an unwillingness to compromise whatever truths he has accepted." [...] Russell himself in 2009 wrote his paternal grandfather's motto, passed down to his father and thence to him is: [...] "A man has {{to draw a line}} inside himself that he won't allow any man to cross"; Russell was [...] "proud of my Grandfather's heroic dignity against forces more powerful than him... he would not allow himself to be oppressed or intimidated by anyone"; he wrote these words after recounting how that grandfather stood up to the Ku Klux Klan and whites who attempted to thwart his efforts to build a schoolhouse for black children (Jake Russell was the first person in Bill Russell's patrilineal line born free in North America, and was himself illiterate). Thus Bill Russell's motto became [...] "If you disrespect that <b>line,</b> <b>you</b> disrespect me." ...|$|E

Explaining why one particular member of his subsequent band, Wings, [...] "didn't last long" [...] in that group McCartney said: [...] "It's like in the Beatles, we had Pete Best, who was a really good drummer, but there just was something, he wasn't quite like the rest of us, we had like a sense of humour in common and he was nearly in with it all, but it's a fine <b>line,</b> <b>you</b> know, as to what is exactly in and what is nearly in. So he 'left' the band and we were looking for someone who would fit." [...] He told Mark Lewisohn, similarly, that when George Martin suggested [...] "changing their drummer" [...] the Beatles responded: [...] "Well, we're quite happy with him, he works great in the clubs," [...] but also that [...] "Pete had never quite been like the rest of us. We were the wacky trio and Pete was perhaps a little more sensible; he was slightly different from us, he wasn't quite as artsy as we were." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rose {{described}} {{the writing process}} for the album as [...] "a more personal experience to him", and said that due to the events that transpired in the prior year, he would sometimes have trouble coming up with words, and would often write gibberish as a temporary filler. While Rose would be the primary writer, all {{five members of the}} band would contribute. Rose focused on more distressing themes, while Witherspoon, who had just become a father, focused his lyrics on responsibility and commitment. The album's first single, [...] "Unraveling", was co-written by Lowery and is about the collapse of a relationship, while [...] "Confession" [...] indirectly addresses Lowery quitting and returning to the band. On Lowery's return, Rose spoke [...] "Since we all write, it's hard to tell exactly what each song is about, but we like to leave it up to the listeners to decide for themselves," [...] Rose says. [...] "It's funny because in the end you almost don't know what you wrote. I remember telling John one time, 'Dude, that was an amazing <b>line</b> <b>you</b> wrote,' and he went, 'What are you talking about? You wrote that.' We wanted to change the template completely from what we did with our last album, 'Hope And Sorrow'. We were going, 'Let's bring back those other elements Clint brought in that made us what we were.' So we sort of made a silent agreement {{that we were going to}} let Clint run wild. We said we'll jump in when it's time, but if you've got an idea let's go with it." ...|$|E
