5000|$|Above {{a certain}} engine speed or {{throttle}} position, the ECU switches to [...] "open-loop" [...] mode; the inputs from the exhaust <b>lambda</b> <b>sensors</b> are ignored and {{the mixture is}} enriched beyond stoichiometric for higher power and decreased engine wear.|$|R
50|$|The {{zirconium}} dioxide, or zirconia, <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is based}} on a solid-state electrochemical fuel cell called the Nernst cell. Its two electrodes provide an output voltage corresponding to the quantity of oxygen in the exhaust relative to that in the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|An {{air-fuel ratio}} meter {{monitors}} the air-fuel ratio {{of an internal}} combustion engine. Also called air-fuel ratio gauge, air-fuel meter, or air-fuel gauge. It reads the voltage output of an oxygen sensor, sometimes also called AFR sensor or <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor,</b> whether it be from a narrow band or wide band oxygen sensor.|$|E
50|$|Mono-Jetronic is {{different}} from all other known single-point systems, in that it only relies on a throttle position sensor for judging the engine load. There are no sensors for air flow, or intake manifold vacuum. Mono-Jetronic always had adaptive closed-loop lambda control, and due to the simple engine load sensing, it is heavily dependent on the <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> for correct functioning.|$|E
50|$|Beneath the ample bonnet stares {{the generous}} 3.0l V6 24 valve. Different from the {{standard}} showroom version, the fuel injection chip has been re-mapped and the exhaust no longer has <b>lambda</b> <b>sensors</b> or a catalytic converter. Also new is the centrally mounted engine oil cooler.|$|R
50|$|The 2007 United Kingdom petrol {{contamination}} problem arose on 28 February 2007, when motorists in South East England {{reported that}} their cars were breaking down. This was caused by silicon contaminated unleaded petrol, sold by several supermarkets, that damaged the <b>lambda</b> <b>sensors</b> in engine management systems.|$|R
50|$|The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said it {{believed}} suspect fuel {{might have}} damaged <b>lambda</b> <b>sensors</b> in some cars' systems, {{leading them to}} cut power to prevent damage to the engine. Silicon products are used as 'anti-foaming agents' in diesel fuel, but even very small quantities can cause serious problems in petrol engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{systems have}} the option for a <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor,</b> {{enabling}} their use with catalytic converter-equipped vehicles. This feedback system allows the system analyse exhaust emissions so that fuel and spark can be continually optimised to minimise emissions. Also present is adaptive circuitry, which adjusts for changes in an engine's characteristics over time. Some PSA engines also include a knock sensor for ignition timing adjustment, perhaps this was achieved using an external Knock Control Regulator.|$|E
50|$|Crankshaft {{position}} and speed {{are determined by}} input signals generated by poles in a magnetic reluctance disc. The system may be run in either open-loop or closed-loop mode (with the latter requiring a <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor).</b> Additional features include an engine speed limiter, overrun fuel cut-off, startup fuel enrichment (both during cranking and after startup), and fueling compensation for battery voltage. Some operating parameters are learned by the ECU over time, such as the optimal IAC valve position for a stable idle. This accommodates slight differences in engine wear and tune between different engines.|$|E
50|$|Options {{listed as}} {{standard}} on later models include anti-lock brakes (ABS); traction control; front fog lights; separate reading lights for passengers {{in the back}} (located in the rear grab handles and cleverly shielded from the driver's view); Radio/cassette player with six high fidelity Blaupunkt stereo speakers; tinted UV blocking windows; Map reading lights; Graduated sun visor; Self supporting (propless) bonnet; rear window wash/wipe; lumbar support; electric windows/mirrors; heated wing mirrors; central locking; tachometer. The driver's console on all models housed an array of warning lights, a rheostat and a <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> monitor.|$|E

50|$|The {{catalytic}} converter, {{which on}} the PH1 172 had been dual barrel {{was reduced to}} a single barrel and featured 2 <b>lambda</b> <b>sensors,</b> one before and one after the catalytic converter. The biggest change to the PH2 172 over the PH1 was the introduction of an electric throttle. This meant the Idle Control Valve of the PH1 was no longer required leading to a minor redesign of the intake manifold.|$|R
50|$|During this {{transient}} stage, {{the engine}} control unit (ECU) on a standard turbocharged engine uses a combination of <b>sensors</b> such as <b>lambda</b> <b>sensors</b> and air mass flow sensors to regulate the fuel flow rate. In an HTT equipped engine the ECU can deliver the precise fuel flow rate for complete combustion more accurately. This is achieved by directly controlling the air flow rate and boost pressure via control of the compressor speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{reworked}} substantially in 2000 {{in order to}} meet increasing emission requirements; with the 2.5 and 3.0 being replaced by lower compression 2.6 and 3.2 units. While displacement was changed the bore centers and deck height were retained. These later power plants had a revised engine management system setup, which utilised quad <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> control, coil per plug ignition system and drive by wire throttles. The 3.2 also received a stronger steel crankshaft. As a result of these changes the EGR and secondary air injection system were removed.|$|E
50|$|On 22 March 2013, Modenas {{launched}} the fuel-injected {{version of the}} CT in Greece as Modenas Kriss 125i EFI. The Kriss 125i uses the larger 120 cc engine mated together with the fuel injection system with a <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> supplied by Synerject. The same model was later launched in the home market as the Modenas 118EFI during the DRB-Hicom Autofest in Penang on 30 July 2013. The fuel-injected variant uses the same 120 cc engine being derived from the Kriss 120 and Ace 115 but with slightly lower power output. The 118EFI was sold in Malaysia with the price tag of RM4,755.00.|$|E
50|$|A {{less common}} type of {{narrow-band}} <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> has a ceramic element made of titania(It is also invented by NTK) (titanium dioxide). This type does not generate its own voltage, but changes its electrical resistance {{in response to the}} oxygen concentration. The resistance of the titania {{is a function of the}} oxygen partial pressure and the temperature. Therefore, some sensors are used with a gas temperature sensor to compensate for the resistance change due to temperature. The resistance value at any temperature is about 1/1000 the change in oxygen concentration. Luckily, at lambda = 1, there is a large change of oxygen, so the resistance change is typically 1000 times between rich and lean, depending on the temperature.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{alternative}} methods to improve the control of combustion in industrial moving grate biomass boilers. A review of existing and recently developed methods is presented, especially new gas sensors for CO and unburnt hydrocarbons. The development of a new passive optical method and first results obtained on industrial wood-burning boilers are shown. It is expected that these new types of sensors which are significantly cheaper than existing <b>Lambda</b> <b>sensors</b> will be increasingly used on biomass burning boilers...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the initial}} problem in 2007, {{many people have}} {{reported}} problems with their cars after filling up with petrol and diesel at Tesco filling stations. These problems normally caused the engine management light to come on, and ranged from problems with the fuel system to damaged <b>lambda</b> <b>sensors.</b> They may {{have been caused by}} silicon or even water found in the underground fuel storage tanks. In December 2015, Tesco in Faversham had a water leak in one of its tanks causing problems for some customers.|$|R

50|$|HS Technik driver Tom Dillmann {{became the}} first French driver to win the {{championship}} title after a title battle with Van Amersfoort Racing's Daniel Abt. Dillmann, who won six races during the season had held a seven-point championship lead into the final race over Abt, who won the opening race at Oschersleben to go with his other win at Assen, which meant that Abt had to finish in the top two placings to have a mathematical chance of overhauling Dillmann, but a broken <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> eliminated Abt from challenging Dillmann. Also resolved at the final round was the battle for third place between Motopark Academy rookie and three-time race winner Kevin Magnussen and Abt's Van Amersfoort team-mate Stef Dusseldorp, who won races at Oschersleben and Assen. Magnussen had led Dusseldorp by two points with one race to run, but Dusseldorp lost the opportunity for third place after failing to start the final race; he stalled at the first start and was rammed from behind by Magnussen's team-mate Jimmy Eriksson and accident damage prevented from restarting. Despite finishing behind Abt in the overall championship, Magnussen's consistent finishing won him the rookie championship.|$|E
50|$|Dillmann competed {{full-time}} in German Formula Three in the 2010 Formel 3 season, {{moving to}} the HS Technik team. At {{the first meeting of}} the year at Oschersleben, Dillmann won the second race on-the-road, before being demoted to seventh after a post-race penalty for jumping the start. Dillmann's first two victories of the season came at the following meeting, at the Sachsenring. Dillmann won both races during the weekend, to move into the championship lead. Dillmann extended his championship lead after a third victory of the season, from pole position, at Hockenheim. A strong weekend for Van Amersfoort Racing's Daniel Abt at Assen moved him ahead of Dillmann in the championship, but Dillmann took the championship lead once again after a double win at the Nürburgring. Consistent points finishes were the key to Dillmann's second half of the campaign, going on a run of five races without a podium, but his championship lead was slightly reduced by Abt. Dillmann achieved another victory at the Nürburgring during the championship's second visit to the circuit, and held a nine-point championship lead over Abt into the final meeting of the season at Oschersleben. Dillmann finished second to Abt in the opening race at Oschersleben, to reduce the advantage to seven points; but Dillmann ultimately prevailed, as Abt failed to score points in the final race due to a broken <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor.</b> Dillmann, who had earlier retired with a fuel pump failure, became the first French driver to win the championship title. He was invited to a Formula Renault 3.5 Series test at Motorland Aragón in October 2010, as a result of becoming champion in German Formula Three. Dillmann set the third-quickest time during the test, and best of all newcomers, while driving for the ISR Racing team.|$|E
40|$|Effective air-ratio {{control is}} {{desirable}} {{to maintain the}} best engine performance. However, traditional air-ratio control assumes the <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> located at the tail pipe works properly and relies strongly on the air-ratio feedback signal measured by the <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor.</b> When the sensor is warming up during cold start or under failure, the traditional air-ratio control no longer works. To address this issue, this paper utilizes an advanced modelling technique, kernel extreme learning machine (ELM), to build a backup air-ratio model. With the prediction from the model, a limited air-ratio control performance can be maintained even when the <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> does not work. Such strategy is realized as fault tolerance control. In order to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed fault tolerance air-ratio control strategy, a model predictive control scheme is constructed based on the kernel ELM backup air-ratio model and implemented on a real engine. Experimental results show that the proposed controller can regulate the air-ratio to specific target values within a satisfactory tolerance under external disturbance and the absence of air-ratio feedback signal from the <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor.</b> This implies that the proposed fault tolerance air-ratio control is a promising scheme to maintain air-ratio control performance when the <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> is under failure or warming up...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Closed-end {{tubes of}} yttria-stabilized {{zirconia}} (YSZ) are required in oxygen sensors for automotive applications to control fuel consumption and pollutant emission. High temperature oxygen sensors were prepared by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of submicron YSZ particles after suitably adjusting the rheological {{characteristics of the}} suspension of the ceramic particles in alcoholic medium. The ceramic tubes were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopy. The morphology of sintered specimens was studied by scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|Closed loop fuel {{injection}} {{have been in}} use for two decades but it's not until the recent five years that the wide band <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> have been utilized. The goal is to explain wide band and discrete lambda sensors in a simple but powerful way. Both sensors are modeled by simple mathematics and accounts for Oxygen, Hydrogen and Carbon monoxide influences. The focus is {{not just on the}} output from the sensors, but also on the underlying function. This means that all explanations are thorough and methodical. The function of a wide band <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> is more complicated than a discrete type <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor,</b> therefore it's harder to get correct readings. The model of the wide band <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> is used to evaluate different problems in preparation for the development of an observer. Several potential problem sources are tested and investigated, these include calibration error, pressure error, air leak error, gas sensitivity and fuel errors. To evaluate the potential problems and their ability to explain differences between actual lambda and sensor output, two sensors with differing outputs have been used. The final result is implemented in an ECU. The models indicate that {{the difference between the two}} sensors is most likely explained by different sensitivity for CO, O 2 and H 2. This can in turn have one or several explanations. It is suggested that different ability to pump oxygen, different nernst cells or even different controllers can cause this. The reason is not investigated further as this would require a very deep research on the two sensors. Because no usable explanation is found an observer that estimates the offset at stoichiometric conditions, where lambda equals one, is constructed. The observer uses the fact that the switch point of a discrete <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> is insensitive to disturbances. The offset calculation is performed in real time on an ECU. Tools for calibration of the observer are also developed. With the observer the error for the two sensors is roughly halved over the whole spectrum and at stoichiometric conditions, which is the normal operation for an engine, the error was too small to measure. Although the wide band <b>lambda</b> <b>sensor</b> is a very complex sensor it is shown that it can be understood with simple mathematics and basic knowledge in chemistry. The developed model agrees well with the real sensor for steady state conditions. For transient conditions, however, the model needs to be refined further. The question why the two sensors differ is discussed but the true origin of the cause remains unsolved. The conclusion is that the error can be drastically reduced with just an offset. It is also shown that when building a lambda sensing device the controller is of equal importance as the sensor element itself. This is due to the sensitivity of surrounding factors that the controller must be able to handle. These effects are specially important for engines running at lambda not equal to 1, for example diesel engines...|$|E

50|$|The newer “wide-band” O2 sensor {{solves the}} narrow sensing {{problem of the}} {{previous}} zirconia sensors. These sensors are often called by different names such as continuous <b>lambda</b> <b>sensors</b> (<b>lambda</b> representing air-fuel ratio), AFR (air-fuel ratio sensors), LAF (lean air-fuel sensor) and wide-band O2 sensor. Regardless of the name, the principle is the same, which {{is to put the}} ECM {{in a better position to}} control the air/fuel mixture. In effect, the wide-band O2 sensor can detect the exhaust’s O2 content way below or above the perfect air/fuel ratio. Such control is needed on new lean burning engines with extremely low emission output levels. Tighter emission regulations and demands for better fuel economy are driving this newer fuel control technology.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: European {{regulations}} regarding {{exhaust gas}} emissions have constantly become more restricted in the last decades. Components of the exhaust gas after-treatment system and ECU strategies have become correspondingly more complicated in order to fulfil the prescribed limits. Development and calibration of the system thus requires more accurate tuning within the imposed constraints of costs and time to market. This paper describes a simplified dynamic model of the exhaust line (TWC and <b>lambda</b> <b>sensors)</b> {{to be included in}} real time engine simulators in order to design and/or verify engine control strategies in lesser time than with conventional experimental developing programs. The model includes significant dependencies on the incoming gas mass flow rate, the air/fuel ratio (AFR) and the temperature of the converter itself.
