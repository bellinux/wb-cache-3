40|$|Background The rate of extra-hepatic <b>lactate</b> {{production}} and the route of influx of <b>lactate</b> to the liver may influence both hepatic and extra-hepatic <b>lactate</b> exchange. We assessed the dose-response of hepatic and extra-hepatic <b>lactate</b> exchange during portal and central venous <b>lactate</b> infusion. Methods Eighteen pigs randomly received either portal (n= 5) or central venous (n= 7) <b>lactate</b> infusion or saline (n= 6). Sodium <b>lactate</b> was infused at 33, 66, 99, and 133 µmol kg− 1 min− 1 for 20 min each. Systemic and regional abdominal blood flows and plasma <b>lactate</b> were measured at 20 min intervals until 1 h post-infusion, and regional <b>lactate</b> exchange was calculated (area under <b>lactate</b> uptake-time curve). Results Total hepatic <b>lactate</b> uptake [median (95 % confidence interval) ] during the experimental protocol (140 min) was higher during portal [8198 (5487 - 12 798) µmol kg− 1] than during central venous <b>lactate</b> infusion [4530 (3903 - 5514) µmol kg− 1, P< 0. 05]. At a similar hepatic <b>lactate</b> delivery (∼ 400 µmol kg− 1 min− 1), hepatic <b>lactate</b> uptake [mean and standard deviation (sd) ] was higher during portal [118 (sd 55) µmol kg− 1 min− 1] than during central venous <b>lactate</b> infusion [44 (12) µmol kg− 1 min− 1, P< 0. 05]. Time courses of arterial <b>lactate</b> concentrations and <b>lactate</b> uptake at other measured regions were similar in both groups. Conclusions Higher hepatic <b>lactate</b> uptake during portal compared with central venous <b>lactate</b> infusion at a similar total hepatic <b>lactate</b> influx underlines the role of portal vein <b>lactate</b> concentration in total hepatic <b>lactate</b> uptake capacity.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the accuracy of the <b>Lactate</b> Pro hand-held analyser in measuring blood <b>lactate</b> levels. METHODS: Blood was drawn from 15 healthy dogs into five tubes containing Na-EDTA. <b>Lactate</b> was measured immediately using the <b>Lactate</b> Pro analyser and a laboratory reference method. Further samples were analysed 120, 240, 480 and 1440 minutes later to artificially increase the <b>lactate</b> levels. <b>Lactate</b> was measured in blood samples of 60 healthy dogs using the <b>Lactate</b> Pro analyser to determine the reference interval of <b>lactate</b> concentration in normal dogs. RESULTS: The correlation between the <b>lactate</b> concentration measured with the <b>Lactate</b> Pro analyser and the reference method was high. <b>Lactate</b> levels were lower when measured with the handheld analyser than with the traditional laboratory determination. The reference interval for blood <b>lactate</b> concentrations in healthy dogs established by the <b>Lactate</b> Pro analyser was from the detection limit (0. 8 mmol/l) up to 3. 3 mmol/l. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The <b>Lactate</b> Pro analyser provides quick and reliable measurements of blood <b>lactate</b> in dogs with blood <b>lactate</b> levels up to 10 mmol/l.

40|$|We evaluated: the {{agreement}} between <b>lactate</b> minimum and maximal <b>lactate</b> steady state (MLSS) cycling powers (study 1); whether rates of change of blood <b>lactate</b> concentration during the <b>lactate</b> minimum test reflect that of constant power exercise (study 2); whether the <b>lactate</b> minimum power {{is influenced by}} the muscle groups used to elevate blood <b>lactate</b> concentration (study 3). Study 1 : 32 subjects performed a <b>lactate</b> minimum test comprising a <b>lactate</b> elevation phase, recovery phase, and incremental phase (five 4 min stages); MLSS was subsequently determined.

5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and <b>lactating</b> females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{threatened}} by humans indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur seals and brown fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are {{near the top of}} food chains and have large reserves of blubber. <b>Lactating</b> mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period.

This more widely separates <b>lactating</b> females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.|$|E

40|$|High-intensity {{exercise}} training {{contributes to}} the production and accumulation of blood <b>lactate,</b> which is cleared by active recovery. However, there is no commonly agreed intensity or mode for clearing accumulated blood <b>lactate.</b> We studied clearance of accumulated blood <b>lactate</b> during recovery at various exercise intensities at or below the <b>lactate</b> threshold after high-intensity interval runs that prompted <b>lactate</b> accumulation. Ten males repeated 5 -min running bouts at 90 % of maximal oxygen uptake ([Vdot]O 2 max), which increased blood <b>lactate</b> concentration from 1. 0 ± 0. 1 to 3. 9 ± 0. 3 mmol · l- 1. This was followed by recovery exercises ranging from 0 to 100 % of <b>lactate</b> threshold. Repeated blood <b>lactate</b> measurements showed faster clearance of <b>lactate</b> during active versus passive recovery, and that the decrease in <b>lactate</b> was more rapid during higher (60 - 100 % of <b>lactate</b> threshold) than lower (0 - 40 % of <b>lactate</b> threshold) (P &# 60; 0. 05) intensities. The more detailed curve and rate analyses showed that active recovery at 80 - 100 % of <b>lactate</b> threshold had shorter time constants for 67 % <b>lactate</b> clearance and higher peak clearance rates than 40 % of <b>lactate</b> threshold or passive recovery (P &# 60; 0. 05). Finally, examination of self-regulated intensities showed enhanced <b>lactate</b> clearance during higher versus lower intensities, further validating the intensity dependence of clearance of accumulated blood <b>lactate.</b> Therefore, active recovery after strenuous exercise clears accumulated blood <b>lactate</b> faster than passive recovery in an intensity-dependent manner.

40|$|The {{effects of}} oral ethanol {{administration}} on blood glucose and <b>lactate</b> concentrations, <b>lactate</b> inflow and outflow rates, and <b>lactate</b> incorporation into glucose were investigated in eight human volunteers. <b>Lactate</b> incorporation into glucose, <b>lactate</b> turnover, and <b>lactate</b> inflow and outflow rates were determined during an 8 hr constant infusion of 100 μCi of lactate-U- 14 C. Ethanol was administered by mouth at hourly intervals, 60 ml of bonded whiskey initially and 30 ml/hr thereafter. Blood <b>lactate</b> concentrations increased precipitously after {{the administration of}} ethanol, reached a plateau within 120 - 180 min, and remained constant thereafter despite the continued administration of ethanol. Before ethanol, the <b>lactate</b> turnover rate was 0. 76 mmoles/kg per hr ± 0. 05 (SEM) and <b>lactate</b> inflow and outflow rates were closely balanced. During the administration of ethanol, the <b>lactate</b> inflow rate was unchanged, but the <b>lactate</b> outflow rate was significantly inhibited, decreasing to 50 % of the inflow rate. Despite the continued administration of ethanol, equilibrium between <b>lactate</b> inflow and outflow was restored within 120 - 180 min and coincided temporally with establishment of a constant blood <b>lactate</b> concentration. <b>Lactate</b> oxidation was unaltered by ethanol, but <b>lactate</b> incorporation into glucose was significantly inhibited. <b>Lactate</b> incorporation into glucose was reduced within 30 min of the administration of ethanol, and nadir values were reached within 120 - 180 min. <b>Lactate</b> incorporation into glucose remained constant thereafter at rates that were only 30 % of those observed {{in the absence of}} ethanol.

Akodon spegazzinii is variable in coloration, ranging from light to dark and from reddish to yellowish brown. In general, animals in wetter, lower-lying areas are darker, and those in open, dry environments are paler. There is also variation within populations, and sometimes young mice are darker and <b>lactating</b> females are more reddish.

5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for <b>lactating</b> female bovids. As a result, during the rainy season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus cremoris {{was grown}} in pH-regulated batch and {{continuous}} cultures with lactose as the energy source. During growth {{the magnitude and}} composition of the electrochemical proton gradient and the <b>lactate</b> concentration gradient were determined. The upper limit {{of the number of}} protons translocated with a <b>lactate</b> molecule during <b>lactate</b> excretion (the proton-lactate stoichiometry) was calculated from the magnitudes of the membrane potential, the transmembrane pH difference, and the <b>lactate</b> concentration gradient. In cells growing in continuous culture, a low <b>lactate</b> concentration gradient (an internal <b>lactate</b> concentration of 35 to 45 mM at an external <b>lactate</b> concentration of 25 mM) existed. The cell yield (Ymax lactose) increased with increasing growth pH. In batch culture at pH 6. 34, a considerable <b>lactate</b> gradient (more than 60 mV) was present during the early stages of growth. As growth continued, the electrochemical proton gradient did not change significantly (from - 100 to - 110 mV), but the <b>lactate</b> gradient decreased gradually. The H+-lactate stoichiometry of the excretion process decreased from 1. 5 to about 0. 9. In nongrowing cells, the magnitude and composition of the electrochemical proton gradient was dependent on the external pH but not on the external <b>lactate</b> concentration (up to 50 mM). The magnitude of the <b>lactate</b> gradient was independent of the external pH but decreased greatly with increasing external <b>lactate</b> concentrations. At very low <b>lactate</b> concentrations, a <b>lactate</b> gradient of 100 mV existed, which decreased to about 40 mV at 50 mM external <b>lactate.</b> As a consequence, the proton-lactate stoichiometry decreased with increasing external concentrations of protons and <b>lactate</b> at pH 7. 0 from 1 mM <b>lactate</b> to 1. 1 at 50 mM <b>lactate</b> and at pH 5. 5 from 1. 4 at l mM <b>lactate</b> to 0. 7 at 50 mM <b>lactate.</b> The data presented in this paper suggest that a decrease in external pH and an increase in external <b>lactate</b> concentration both result in lower proton-lactate stoichiometry values and therefore in a decrease of the generation of metabolic energy by the end product efflux process...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of hyperlactatemia during sepsis {{is poorly}} understood. We have previously described {{an increase in}} <b>lactate</b> concentration across the lung in the dog during early endotoxemia. Accordingly, we sought {{to determine if the}} lung releases <b>lactate</b> in humans and what relation this has with lung injury. Methods: We measured <b>lactate</b> concentrations across the lung and lung injury scores (LIS) in two groups of patients. Group 1 consisted of nine patients with acute lung injury (LIS ≤ 2. 0) and elevated <b>lactate</b> concentrations (> 2. 0 mmol/L). Group 2 contained 12 patients with no acute lung injury (LIS scores ≤ 1. 5), with or without increased <b>lactate</b> concentrations. Simultaneous measurements of plasma <b>lactate</b> and blood gases were obtained from indwelling arterial and pulmonary artery, catheters. Measurements of cardiac output were also obtained. <b>Lactate</b> measurements were done using a <b>lactate</b> analyzer (YSI; Yellow Springs, Ohio). Results: For each patient with acute lung injury and hyperlactatemia, an arterial-venous <b>lactate</b> gradient existed demonstrating release of <b>lactate</b> by the lung. This gradient persisted after correction for changes in hemoconcentration across the lung. The mean <b>lactate</b> gradient across the lung was 0. 4 ± 0. 2 mmol/L for group 1 vs 0. 05 ± 0. 1 mmol/L for group 2 (p= 0. 001). This corresponded to a mean pulmonary <b>lactate</b> flux of 231. 3 ± 211. 3 vs 5. 0 ± 37. 2 mmol/h (p= 0. 001). The <b>lactate</b> flux and the arterial-venous <b>lactate</b> difference correlated with LIS both for the entire sample and for the subgroup with hyperlactatemia (r= 0. 69, p < 0. 01). Pulmonary <b>lactate</b> flux was not related to arterial <b>lactate</b> levels (r= 0. 25). Conclusion: In patients with acute lung injury and hyperlactatemia, the lung is a major source of <b>lactate</b> and <b>lactate</b> flux correlates with LIS. This <b>lactate</b> flux could explain some of the hyperlactatemia seen in sepsis...|$|R
5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} ass species, adults have more fluid {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them.

The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas.

5|$|In archaeology, {{the study}} of {{mortuary}} context, that is, {{the interpretation of the}} postmortem treatment of the dead, whether an individual or as pertains to patterns within a group, has {{led to the development of}} hypotheses on social status and/or hierarchy regarding many cultures, ancient and extant. In addition, the determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred prior to death has a bearing on analyses of the mother's population, as the concentration of trace elements differ markedly between the skeletons of prepartum adult women (before giving birth) and women who are lactating; the identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of the number of <b>lactating</b> women in a population or the rate of maternal mortality.

40|$|Background-Around birth, {{myocardial}} substrate supply {{changes from}} carbohydrates before birth to primarily fatty acids after birth.

Methods and Results-We measured myocardial <b>lactate</b> uptake, oxidation, and release with infusion of [1 -C- 13]lactate and myocardial flux of fatty acids and glucose in chronically instrumented fetal and newborn (1 to 15 days) lambs. Myocardial <b>lactate</b> oxidation was the same in newborn (81. 7 +/- 14. 7 mu mol. min(- 1). 100 g(- 1), n= 11) as in fetal Iambs (60. 7 +/- 26. 7 mu mol. min(- 1). 100 g(- 1), n= 7). <b>Lactate</b> uptake was also the same in newborn as in fetal lambs. <b>Lactate</b> uptake was higher than <b>lactate</b> flux, indicating <b>lactate</b> release simultaneously with uptake. In the newborn lambs, <b>lactate</b> uptake declined with age. <b>Lactate</b> uptake was strongly related to <b>lactate</b> supply, whereas <b>lactate</b> oxidation was not. The supply of fatty acids or glucose did not interfere with <b>lactate</b> uptake, but the nux of fatty acids was inversely related to <b>lactate</b> oxidation. Conclusions-We show that <b>lactate</b> is an important energy source for the myocardium before birth {{as well as in the}} first 2 weeks after birth in lambs.

40|$|At rest, {{the brain}} takes up oxygen and {{carbohydrate}} at an ~ 6 : 1 ratio. Exercise increases systemic <b>lactate</b> availability reducing this to {{as little as}} 1. 7 : 1 despite a ~ 20 % increase in cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRo₂), thus indicating a disproportionate increase of carbohydrate metabolism. Underlining mechanisms and metabolic fate for the augmented <b>lactate</b> uptake are unknown. This meta-analysis examines whether adrenergic activation explains the increased <b>lactate</b> uptake, cerebral <b>lactate</b> release following cerebral activation compensates for the extra carbohydrate uptake during exercise, and cerebral <b>lactate</b> uptake spares glucose as fuel. Ten studies (n= 96) measuring arteriovenous differences for <b>lactate,</b> glucose, and oxygen and cerebral blood flow were included. Cerebral <b>lactate</b> uptake increased during brain activation by whole-body exercise compared to the resting state. Unlike glucose, <b>lactate</b> uptake is proportional to its arterial concentration but is unaffected by sympathetic activity. Following exercise, significant cerebral <b>lactate</b> released as arterial <b>lactate</b> levels decreased, which may balance the surplus <b>lactate</b> uptake in the brain during physical activity in the long term. Finally, cerebral glucose uptake was reduced by ~ 25 % in relation to CMRo₂ when cerebral <b>lactate</b> uptake increased, suggesting, in part, preferential <b>lactate</b> consumption during activation. This meta-analysis favors the notion that cerebral <b>lactate</b> uptake is mainly passively governed by its availability, but when <b>lactate</b> is available, <b>lactate</b> supplements glucose and supports an increase in cerebral energy metabolism in an activity-dependent manner...|$|R

Immediately after the infusion there was a net efflux of <b>lactate</b> from the brain. The results suggest that the majority of <b>lactate</b> moving into the brain is not used as an energy substrate, and that <b>lactate</b> does not replace glucose as an energy source. Instead, the authors propose the concept of a <b>lactate</b> pool in the brain that can be filled and emptied in accordance with the blood <b>lactate</b> concentration, but which is not used as an energy supply for cerebral metabolism...|$|R
50|$|Local <b>lactate</b> use {{depends on}} {{exercise}} exertion. During rest, approximately 50% of <b>lactate</b> disposal take place through <b>lactate</b> oxidation whereas {{in time of}} strenuous exercise (50-75% VO2 max) approximately 75-80% of <b>lactate</b> {{is used by the}} active cell, indicating <b>lactate’s</b> role as a major contributor to energy conversion during increased exercise exertion.|$|R
30|$|Increased blood <b>lactate</b> levels (hyperlactataemia) {{are common}} in {{critically}} ill patients. Although frequently used to diagnose inadequate tissue oxygenation, other processes not related to tissue oxygenation may increase <b>lactate</b> levels. Especially in critically ill patients, increased glycolysis {{may be an important}} cause of hyperlactataemia. Nevertheless, the presence of increased <b>lactate</b> levels has important implications for the morbidity and mortality of the hyperlactataemic patients. Although the term lactic acidosis is frequently used, a significant relationship between <b>lactate</b> and pH only exists at higher <b>lactate</b> levels. The term <b>lactate</b> associated acidosis is therefore more appropriate. Two recent studies have underscored the importance of monitoring <b>lactate</b> levels and adjust treatment to the change in <b>lactate</b> levels in early resuscitation. As <b>lactate</b> levels can be measured rapidly at the bedside from various sources, structured <b>lactate</b> measurements should be incorporated in resuscitation protocols.|$|R
