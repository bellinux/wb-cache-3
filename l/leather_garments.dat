2500|$|A {{recent issue}} has been the {{shortage}} of cement to sustain the construction boom in the country. However, foreign and native investment, including the recent investment in a US$5 billion cement factory in Misraq Gojjam Zone of the Amhara Region, are an attempt to stabilize the situation. Still the brief severe shortage that occurred in 2005 was blamed on Meles Zenawi's policies that were alleged to ignore urban development. Other recent development in the country included a first car factory in Ethiopia that assembles cars to sell for local- and export-markets, as well as cars that use liquefied petroleum gas, bus manufacturing in Mek'ele and taxi manufacturing in Modjo city, Oromia state.

2500|$|Reading [...] “Your clothes {{have not}} grown old on you,” Rabbi Jose bar Hanina taught that the clothes that the Israelites wore did not wear out, but those that they packed away in their trunks did. Alternatively, Rabbi Eleazar, {{the son of}} Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai, asked his {{father-in-law}} Rabbi Simeon ben Jose whether the Israelites had not taken with them <b>leather</b> <b>garments</b> into the wilderness (which would wear out). Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied that the clothes that they wore were those with which the ministering angels had invested them at Mount Sinai, and therefore they did not grow old. Rabbi Eleazar asked whether the Israelites did not grow so that the clothes became too small for them. Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied that one should not wonder at this, for when a snail grows, its shell grows with it. Rabbi Eleazar asked whether the clothes did not need washing. Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied that the pillar of cloud rubbed against them and whitened them. Rabbi Eleazar asked whether they were not scorched, as the cloud consisted of fire. Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied that one should not wonder at this, as amianthus (a kind of asbestos) is cleansed only by fire, and as their clothes were made in heaven, the cloud rubbed against them without damaging them. Rabbi Eleazar asked whether vermin did not breed in the clothes. Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied that if in their death no worm could touch the Israelites, how much less could vermin in their lifetime. Rabbi Eleazar asked whether they did not smell because of perspiration.

60|$|But a {{city where}} all the valor resided in one woman could not long hold out, and in another inroad, when Genevieve was absent, Paris was {{actually}} seized by the Franks. Their leader, Hilperik, was absolutely afraid of what the mysteriously brave maiden might do to him, and commanded {{the gates of the}} city to be carefully guarded lest she should enter; but Geneviere learnt that some of the chief citizens were imprisoned, and that Hilperik intended their death, and nothing could withhold her from making an effort in their behalf. The Franks had made up their minds to settle, and not to destroy. They were not burning and slaying indiscriminately, but while despising the Romans, as they called the Gauls, for their cowardice, they were in awe of the superior civilization and the knowledge of arts. The country people had free access to the city, and Genevieve in her homely gown and veil passed by Hilperik's guards without being suspected of being more than an ordinary Gaulish village maid; and thus she fearlessly made her way, even to the old Roman halls, where the long-haired Hilperik was holding his wild carousal. Would that we knew more of that interview--one of the most striking that ever took place! We can only picture to ourselves the Roman tessellated pavement bestrewn with wine, bones, and fragments of the barbarous revelry. There were untamed Franks, their sun-burnt hair tied up in a knot {{at the top of their}} heads, and falling down like a horse's tail, their faces close shaven, except two moustaches, and dressed in tight <b>leather</b> <b>garments,</b> with swords at their wide belts. Some slept, some feasted, some greased their long locks, some shouted out their favorite war songs around the table which was covered with the spoils of churches, and at their heads sat the wild, long-haired chieftain, who was a few years later driven away by his own followers for his excesses, the whole scene was all that was abhorrent to a pure, devout, and faithful nature, most full of terror to a woman. Yet, there, in her strength, stood the peasant maiden, her heart full of trust and pity, her looks full of the power that is given by fearlessness of them that can kill the body. What she said we do not know--we only know that the barbarous Hilperik was overawed; he trembled before the expostulations of the brave woman, and granted all she asked--the safety of his prisoners, and mercy to the terrified inhabitants. No wonder that the people of Paris have ever since looked back to Genevieve as their protectress, and that in after ages she has grown to be the patron saint of the city.|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{polyurethane}} {{artificial leather}} is modified with carboxyl groups and non-hazardous sodium chloride {{to serve as}} a polyelectrolyte and meanwhile maintains the intrinsic property of fluorescence effect. The artificial leather supercapacitor using sheet electrodes exhibits excellent flexibility, pattern diversity, scalability, and high compatibility with artificial leather industrial processing techniques. As a demonstration, a fluorescent supercapacitor sleeve is fabricated by using these supercapacitors to power a light-emitting diode, realizing the energy storage, fluorescence capability, and wearability. Inheriting from the great wearability of artificial <b>leather</b> <b>garment,</b> the artificial <b>leather</b> supercapacitor has no problem of the practical comforting wearability of textiles, thus providing a reform of the mainstream yarn/textile-based supercapacitors and creating considerable potential for more practical applications of wearable electronics.|$|R
