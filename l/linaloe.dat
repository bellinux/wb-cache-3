25|$|Laca is {{the making}} of wooden items which are then painted and coated with a {{high-gloss}} lacquer. The best pieces of this type are made of a wood called <b>linalóe</b> (Bursera aloexylon) which is aromatic. Cheaper ones are made of pine, treated to smell like <b>linalóe.</b> The making of lacquered items is centered in the municipality of Olinalá, but also {{can be found in}} Temalcalcingo, Ocotepec and Acapetlahuaya. Olinalá’s lacquered items are traditional made with a wood called <b>linaloe,</b> with has a distinctive odor, but due to its relatively scarcity, pine is also being used. Items made include small boxes, chests, trays, masks, frames, jewelry boxes.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecosystem}} {{is dominated}} by grassland vegetation with species such as huisache, mesquite, nopal, <b>linaloe</b> and shrubland. Typical fauna includes species such as deer, rabbit, hare, squirrel, foxes and badger.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the colonial}} period, {{a wide variety}} of wood items has been treated in the same way. The most {{traditional}} wood for lacquerware is <b>linaloë</b> (genus Burseraceae). It is popular for its strong, pleasant odor, similar to lavender, but it has become scarce. Good pieces are still made from hard or semi-hard wood, but most are now made from avocado or pine wood which has been boiled to remove the resin. <b>Linaloë</b> essence may be added for the smell. In the past, lacquer makers also created the wood objects, but with the introduction of power woodworking tools, this aspect has been outsourced to local carpenters who can make them cheaper. However, the wood pieces must be completely dry, sanded fine and cracked filled before any lacquering begins.|$|E
50|$|Although {{he creates}} trays and other smaller items, he specializes in larger pieces such as folding screen and {{especially}} boxes and chests. He {{is the only}} artisan in the town that takes individual orders. For smaller pieces he uses a soft local wood called copal, but the larger pieces are made by local carpenters of <b>lináloe</b> (Bursera linanoe), pine and ayacahuite. He also makes a kind of sewing chest, using a kind of large dried gourd.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the rise}} in {{production}} has forced changes in both materials and productions techniques. In the 1980s the wood of the <b>linaloe</b> was exported to extract is essence making it scarce and most pieces are now made with other woods, including pine. While artisans using traditional methods and materials still exist, plaster has been substituted for dolostone, lineseed oil and even car wax for chia or aje and commercial pigments for natural ones. One {{reason for this is}} the natural materials are becoming scarce and more expensive.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{product is}} lacquerware, {{part of a}} larger Mesoamerican craft tradition. Most is produced in Olinalá, but there are also production in nearly Acapetlahuaya and Temalscacingo. Lacquer work dates back to the pre Hispanic period, when it was used to preserve and decorate wood objects, gourds and more. It survives mostly intact, with changes only in decorative motifs through the colonial period to modern times. Until recently, most wood items were made from a fragrant species called <b>linaloe,</b> but over exploitation has made it scarce and expensive.|$|E
40|$|The {{terpenes}} {{constitute an}} important group amongst the naturally occurring organic compounds. They vary greatly {{in nature and}} character and {{a very large number}} of them are still of unknown constitution. An interesting number of these compounds have been termed terpene aliphatic alcohols. They are comparatively small in number and although non-cyclic in nature, they are closely related to cyclic compounds and prone to cyclize under certain conditions. [ [...] . ] Their general structure and chemical properties have been fairly thoroughly investigated but the question of their isomeric structures has not yet been definitely settled. A brief historical review of the chemistry of the primary aliphatic terpene alcohols, namely, geraniol and citronellol, will be given. The attention attached to these compounds is largely due to their importance in the perfumery trade. Geraniol is a colourless liquid of sweet odour, recalling that of rose and pelargonium. It is found in the free state and also in the form of its esters in a large number of essential oils. Most of the work done on its occurrence was carried out in the last decade of the nineteenth century. It was found to be a constituent of palmarosa, Bulgarian and Turkish rose oils, geranium oils, citronella oils, lemongrass oil, <b>linaloe</b> oil, nutmeg oil, sassafras oil, petigrain oil, lavender oil and in smaller quantities in a large number of other oils.
