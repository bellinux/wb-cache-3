40|$|F ew {{papers have}} {{explored}} the optimal reserve {{prices in the}} name-your-own-price (NYOP) channel with bidding options in amultiple channel environment. In this paper, we investigate a double-bid business model in which the consumers can bid twice in the NYOP channel, and compare it with the single-bid case. We also study the impact of adding a retailer-own <b>list-price</b> channel on the optimal reserve prices. This paper focuses on achieving some basic understanding on the potential gain of adding a second bid option to a single-bid system and on {{the potential benefits of}} adding a <b>list-price</b> channel by the NYOP retailer. We show that a double-bid scenario can outperform a single-bid scenario in both single-channel and dual-channel situations. The optimal reserve price in the double-bid scenario is no less than that in the single-bid case. Furthermore, the addition of a retailer-own <b>list-price</b> channel could push up the reserve prices in both single-bid and double-bid scenarios.

40|$|In housing {{markets with}} {{asymmetric}} information list prices may signal unobserved {{properties of the}} house or the seller. Asymmetric information is {{the starting point for}} many models for the housing market. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of <b>list-price</b> reductions on the time houses remain for sale on the market to test for the presence of asymmetric information. We use very rich and extensive administrative data from the Netherlands. Our empirical results show that <b>list-price</b> reductions significantly increase the selling rate of a house, but also the rate of withdrawal from the market increases. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Even if {{firms in}} a market choose {{discount}} prices noncooperatively, the use of most-favored customer and meet-or-release contracts enables those firms to adopt quantity-choice strategies. Consequently, {{there can be a}} range of list prices that are impervious to unilateral nonselective discounts, but this range does not include prices above the level determined in a Cournot equilibrium. The practice of advance public notification of <b>list-price</b> increases can facilitate the establishment of such supracompetitive list prices, as was argued in the recent FTC Ethyl case. The possibility of offering discounts selectively results in a much more competitive situation. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{retailing}} operations, retailers {{face the}} challenge of incomplete demand information. We develop a new concept named K-approximate convexity, which is shown to be a generalization of K-convexity, to address this challenge. This idea is applied to obtain a base-stock <b>list-price</b> policy for the joint inventory and pricing control problem with incomplete demand information and even non-concave revenue function. A worst-case performance bound of the policy is established. In a numerical study where demand is driven from real sales data, we find that the average gap between the profits of our proposed policy and the optimal policy is 0. 27 %, and the maximum gap is 4. 6 %.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the role that}} seller motivation plays in determining selling time, list price and sale price. A new survey of home sellers suggests that sellers are heterogeneous in their motivation to sell. Our findings are that a seller who, {{at the time of}} listing, has a planned date to move sells more quickly than one who does not. Also, the shorter the planned time until a move at the time of listing, the shorter the actual duration of marketing time. We find that seller motivation affects sale price, but not the <b>list-price</b> markup. Our results suggest that theoretical models of the housing search process should be recast to allow for heterogeneous sellers. Copyright American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|E
40|$|We study a joint {{decision}} problem for replenishment, production, pricing {{strategies in the}} face of both supply and demand uncertainties. The supply of the raw material suffers from a potential supply disruption while the demand for the finished goods is price-sensitive and random. We assume that the raw material is storable and unfilled demands are fully backordered. We characterize the optimal policies for raw-material replenishment, finished-goods production, and pricing. We find that the optimal replenishment policy is an order-up-to type for a given finished-goods stock level while it is a threshold type for a given raw-material stock level. For either a given finished-goods stock level or a given raw-material stock level, the optimal production policy is a threshold type and the optimal pricing policy is a modified <b>list-price</b> type, respectively.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} recycling, remanufacturing, and pricing {{strategies}} of a manufacturer in a closed-loop supply chain. Different from traditional <b>list-price</b> transaction, a name-your-own-price auction is {{introduced into the}} recycling process where consumers offer a bid for their own used items and the manufacturer decides whether to accept the bid. We first analyze the consumers' behavior and find that their bids increase with the dealing cost. Next, we build a newsvendor framework to investigate the manufacturer's optimal manufacturing with pricing strategies and find that the stocking factor influences the recycling quantity and manufacturing policy. Moreover, we find that a larger salvage value motivates the manufacturer to set a higher stocking factor and thus recycle more as well as manufacture new products. We further investigate {{the effect of the}} demand uncertain level and the dealing cost on the system. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the joint pricing and inventory decision {{problem for a}} single retailer who orders, stocks and sells multiple products. The products are competitive in nature, e. g., these maybe similar products from multiple brands. Demand for a product depends on its price {{as well as the}} price of all competing products. We show that the optimal pricing and inventory policy is similar to the base-stock, <b>list-price</b> policy which is known to be optimal for the single product case. In addition, the base-stock level of each product is nonincreasing with the inventory level of other products. This structure suggests that one can improve profit by simultaneously managing all the products rather than managing each product independently of other products. by Kelly (Yunqing) Ye. Thesis (S.

40|$|We {{consider}} a joint inventory-pricing problem in which buyers act strategically and bid for units of a firm’s product over an infinite horizon. The number of bidders in each period {{as well as}} the individual bidders ’ valuations are random but stationary over time. There is a holding cost for inventory and a unit cost for ordering more stock from an outside supplier. Backordering is not allowed. The firm must decide how to conduct its auctions and how to replenish its stock over time to maximize its profits. We show that the optimal auction and replenishment policy for this problem is quite simple, consisting of running a standard first-price or second-price auction with a fixed reserve price in each period and following an order-up-to (basestock) policy for replenishing inventory {{at the end of each}} period. Moreover, the optimal basestock level can be easily computed. We then compare this optimal basestock, reserve-price-auction policy to a traditional basestock, <b>list-price</b> policy. We prove that in the limiting case of one buyer per period and in the limiting case of a large number of buyers per period and linear holding cost, list pricing is optimal. List pricing also becomes optimal as the holding cost tends to zero. Numerical comparisons confirm these theoretical results and show that auctions provide significant benefits when: (1) the number of buyers is moderate, (2) holding costs are high, or (3) there is high variability in the number of buyers per period.

40|$|The first essay {{considers}} a dynamic non-stationary inventory problem in which replenishment {{is made in}} fixed lot sizes (e. g., in full truckloads or full containers). We consider two separate cases: one with exogenous pricing {{and the other with}} endogenous pricing. In the first case (exogenous pricing), we show that when the ordering cost contains only a variable component, the reorder-point lot-size policy or (r, Q) policy is optimal for both single-stage and multi-echelon inventory systems. In the presence of a fixed cost, we establish the optimality of batch based (s, S) policies for the single-stage inventory system. In the second case (endogenous pricing), we show that when the demand function has the additive form and there is only a variable ordering cost, the (r,Q) <b>list-price</b> policy is optimal for the single-stage system, where inventory replenishment follows an (r,Q) policy and the optimal price in each period depends on the order-up-to level. The second essay analyzes a periodic-review, stochastic, inventory-control system in which the fixed order-cost is a step function of the order size. In particular, if the order size is within a specified limit, C, then the setup cost is K 1; otherwise it is K 2, where K 2 ≥ K 1. This cost structure is motivated from some industrial applications and transportation/production contracts used in practice. Under the condition that K 1 ≤ K 2 ≤ K 1, we introduce a new concept called C - (K 1 ≤ K 2) convexity, which enables us to partially characterize the structure of an optimal ordering policy. For the general condition K 1 ≤ K 2, the analysis is facilitated with a different notion called strong K-convexity. Based on this analysis, we provide a partial characterization of the optimal policy and construct an easy-to-implement heuristic method that has near-optimal performance in random test instances. Our study extends or redevelops (with different techniques) several existing results in the literature. The third essay studies a firm's periodic-review production/inventory ordering decisions when the next period's setup cost depends on the quantity produced/ ordered in the current period. In particular, if the current period's production/order quantity exceeds a specified threshold value, the system starts the next period in a "warm" state and no fixed setup cost is incurred; otherwise the state is considered "cold" and a positive setup cost is required for production/ ordering. We develop a dynamic programming formulation of the problem and provide a partial characterization of the optimal policy under the assumption that the demands follow a Polya or Uniform distribution. We use the structural results to develop fairly simple heuristic policies, which perform highly effectively in our computational experiments. With increased globalization and competition in the current market, supply chain has become longer and more complicated than ever before. An effective and efficient supply chain is crucial and essential to a successful firm. In a supply chain, inventories are a very important component as the investment in inventories is enormous.
