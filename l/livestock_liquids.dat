40|$|Increasing {{concern about}} the impacts of <b>livestock</b> <b>liquid</b> waste handling, treatment, and {{disposal}} systems on water quality has caused livestock producers to look for more environmentally benign systems. Hoop structures in conjunction with composting offer a solid manure management option, which can minimize the possible impacts to water quality. Finisher pigs are raised within a deep layer of bedding, which allows for in-situ decomposition of the manure. Manure and bedding from the hoops then can be directly land applied or further composted and used in crop production...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to understand the effect of the <b>livestock</b> <b>liquid</b> fertilizer treatment at field-scale up to catch ment-scale on the water quality properties. Cultivated paddy rice and upland plots located in Gyeonggi province, Korea were treated with two different liquid fertilizers, SP (Liquid fertilizer with storage process) and SCB (Liquid fertilizer with slurry composting and bio-filtration process). Plots with no fertilizer (control A) and chemical fertilizer (control B) were also prepared for comparison. Water quantity and quality were monitored at the catchment outlet for assessing the effect on water quality of stream water. As a result, the losses of N an d P and the values of EC (Electronic Conductivity) in the surface drainage water from paddy rice plots treated with SP and SCB were higher than those from the control plots (A and B). In addition, the losses of N and P by the runoff water from upland plots with SP and SCB treatment were higher than those from control plots (A and B). The nutrient outflow from paddy rice fields and uplands with ap plication of liquid pig manure was higher than those from the control plots (A and B). Particularly, the outflow from uplands may directly affect the water quality in neighboring streams. This caused the major eutrophication problem in stream water. In conclusion, it is necessary to establish the proper management practices to prevent the nutrient losses from agricultural fields and the pollutants against water environments. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas fluorescens {{has been}} well known as {{biological}} control agent for plant diseases control. The problem to apply the agents widely in the field or {{in the level of}} farmer is limited technology of mass production with low cost, due to the simple technology of propagation has not been yet available. The objective of this research is to study the potency of liquid organic wastes as media for mass production of P. fluorescens and to formulate them as bio-pesticide. The results showed that modification of coconut water to pH of 7. 0 could be used as media for growing P. flourescens. The P. fluorescens also could grow well in <b>livestock</b> <b>liquid</b> waste by adding 10 % meat extract. On the other hand, the liquid tofu waste and liquid compost waste became good media for growing of P. fluorescens by addition of 10 % meat extract and 1. 25 % sugar. Tetes tebu will be very good media for P. fluorescens at 5 % final concentration and by adding of 10 % meat extract and 2. 5 % of sugar. The P. fluorescens showed high antagonistic effect to Ralstonia solanacearum and Sclerotium rolfsii in all of modified liquid organic wastes media. Survival and antagonisctic activity of P. fluorescens in modified organic liquid wastes stored at 5 oC or room temperature were 12 weeks. In vivo antagonistic and plant growth promoting activity showed that P. fluorescens grown in liquid organic waste suppressed the incidence of stem rot diseases caused by Sclerotium rolfsii and increased the vigor of plant growth on watermelon. Formulation of the P. fluorescens grown in modified coconut water gave the best performance of P. fluorescens in supppressing of plant diseases and inducing plant growth.

50|$|Earthen manure storages are {{engineered}} structures {{used for}} the storage of <b>liquid</b> <b>livestock</b> manure. Generally these structures are designed so that about {{fifty percent of the}} structure is below existing grade and fifty percent is above. Certain circumstances such a high water table will require the structure to be built nearly all above grade. Conversely, it may be provident to build a deeper storage to accommodate gravity flow of the manure from a barn that is built at grade. Deeper EMSes still require some form of berming around them to prevent surface run-on.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One {{option for}} {{managing}} <b>liquid</b> <b>livestock</b> waste is an efficient {{separation of the}} liquid and solid fractions, and their subsequent treatment applying the best available technology. SELCO-Ecopurin is a technique which effectively separates liquid and solid phases using polyacrylamide as a coagulation agent. Anaerobic digestion of the solid fraction is an attractive option on account of its agronomic and energetic values. This work studies the toxicity of polyacrylamide residues for the anaerobic process. It also determines the optimum range of total solid concentration for maximum gas production {{as a function of}} polyacrylamide concentration. The results have shown that it is feasible to apply anaerobic process to the solid fraction phase obtained from a separation process with a polyacrylamide concentration of 120 mg/kg, which is the usual dose used, producing a fraction with a 13 % total solid content. Optimum gas yield has been obtained at a slightly lower total solid concentration...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{in southwestern}} Ontario, liquid manure from a tank under a pig barn entered tile drains located under {{the tank and}} {{contaminated}} surface water nearby. While {{this may have been}} an isolated instance, it focused attention on the ways that liquid manure storages are built on farms. It raised questions about the potential for similar spills to occur on <b>livestock</b> farms where <b>liquid</b> manure is stored. In the particular case mentioned, it appeared that there was a failure to eliminate and/or redirect the drains away from the construction project. How the manure leaked from the manure system and traveled to the tile drains was unclear. This report is an attempt to establish risks involved in this and similar manure handling and storage systems, through a survey of related literature. It appears that the main issues in this discussion are: a) Field drains near farm buildings and manure storage tanks b) Integrity of manure storages c) Manure transfer systems- from barn to long-term storage Environmental Problems with Manure Storages In Ontario, the environmental track record of liquid manure storages has been fairly good...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural <b>liquid</b> <b>livestock</b> wastes are an {{important}} potential source of valuable nitrogen-containing compounds such as ammonia and proteins. Large volumetric quantities of these wastes are produced in areas with a high livestock production density. Much technological research {{has been carried out}} in the past to recover nitrogen compounds from livestock wastes, usually within the framework of a more or less complete waste treatment process. A large part of this research did not result in applicable technology due to various technical and/or economical reasons. However, increasing interest in both the negative environmental aspects of agricultural liquid wastes and in recycling of valuable compounds promote further development of technologies for recovery valuable nitrogen compounds. In this paper the most important technologies to recover nitrogen compounds as valuable products are briefly discussed and evaluated. For each technology the stage of development, the applicability and the obtained experience is discussed. The evaluation covers biological conversion techniques like enzyme synthesis from ammonium and production of algae, chemical processes such as precipitation of fertiliser compounds and separation techniques such as stripping, partial condensation, and membrane chemo-sorption. It is emphasised that practical implementation of a technology can only be successful if both liquid animal waste producers and potential buyers and users of products of the treatment processes are heavily involved in the development of technology - a development that should start at farm level...|$|R
40|$|Liquid manure tank wagons were {{evaluated}} on a cost basis {{to determine the}} optimum size for a given livestock operation. Also the economics of adding a liquid injector to the tank wagon was studied for profitability. INTRODUCTION The proper selection of a liquid manure tank wagon is a problem faced by many progressive <b>livestock</b> producers with <b>liquid</b> manure systems. Selection of a manure tank wagon is usually based on the farmer 2 ̆ 7 s or dealer 2 ̆ 7 s opinion of what size is right rather than on a logical analysis including an economic {{analysis of the costs}} involved. This paper provides guidelines for selecting the proper size tank wagon for a given situation based on a least cost approach. Additionally, the economics of liquid manure injection is presented. EXPLANATION OF THE PROBLEM In order to select the proper size tank wagon, an economic comparison must be made. This comparison can be based upon the annual costs of using machinery of different sizes. Hunt (1977) gave the following equation for finding the approximate cost of a machine. ASSUMPTIONS AND PROCEDURE To use Hunt 2 ̆ 7 s equation for approximate annual costs for manure tank wagons requires some assumptions. The term cA/SWe represents hours of field use by a machine. Hours of tanker use will depend on the quantity of manure to be spread, on the tank capacity, and on the distance traveled to and from the disposal area. An assumption of 0. 3 -h round trip travel time, which includes loading and unloading time, was made. Travel time multiplied by the number of trips required equals the total hours of annual machine use. The number of trips required is determined by dividing the quantity of liquid manure to be hauled annually by the wagon capacity. Values of other constants in equation [1] can be found in Table 1. The purchase price of manure tank wagons can be expressed as a function of their capacity in liters. The purchase price per liter is not constant but varies according to capacity. Generally, the tanker price per liter decreases as the size increases with the form of the equation being...|$|R
40|$|Risk is {{pervasive}} in developing countries. The standard household risks of sickness, mortality, fire, theft, and unemployment are especially severe for poor families in developing countries. Rural households, {{most of which}} derive their livelihoods from the land, face the additional risks of droughts, floods, and pests and diseases affecting their crops and livestock. Insurance provision is still limited, and state-provided social security or more basic social safety nets are often limited or unavailable for particular widespread disasters. Richer families have reasonable access to insurance alternatives, such as credit and substantial savings. Although these alternatives are generally not options for poorer families, {{it is well known}} that such families do employ relatively sophisticated mechanisms to manage and cope with risk. They tend to diversify their crops and income-generating activities, often incorporating nonfarm activities into their income streams and even having family members migrate to reduce the household’s overall exposure to risk. Where possible, they build up savings for precautionary purposes, often in the form of <b>livestock</b> or other <b>liquid</b> assets. They also engage in informal mutual support networks in which assistance is provided if a member experiences some form of shock. Nevertheless, given the variety and severity of risks to be dealt with, shocks inevitably have serious welfare consequences. These consequences are well illustrated by evidence from Ethiopia, where rural households face a considerable risk of drought. For example, about half of the households interviewed in 2004 for a rural panel data survey in 15 communities across the country reported that they faced serious hardship due to drought in the preceding five years, while about a quarter of the sample reported hardship resulting from illness and a similar number reported problems related to illness. Despite increased investment in health services and a relatively widespread, foreign aid–supported safety net to cope with drought, these shocks continue to impose significant welfare costs. The consumption levels of those reporting a serious drought, for example, were found to be 16 percent lower than those of families not affected, and shocks from illness appeared to have similar average impacts. Further, the costs were not just short term: in the sample, it was found that those who had suffered considerably in the 1984 – 85 famine—the most severe famine in recent history—were still experiencing lower growth rates in consumption in the 1990 s, a period of overall recovery, than those who were not seriously affected by the famine. Children born during the famine were found to be up to three centimeters shorter at adulthood than children born before or after the famine, suggesting that famine had serious, persistent health impacts with long-term consequences. Risk should thus be seen as a cause of persistent poverty, in that shocks cause serious losses of physical assets and human capital. The presence of risk also tends to induce poorer households to become risk averse, even at the expense of otherwise higher returns: for example, they may choose to grow low-returning but safe crops and to avoid committing resources to more productive capital in order to preserve the liquidity of their asset base. In Ethiopia, efforts to increase farmers’ fertilizer use and thereby raise their productivity—a risky undertaking as farmers must still bear the costs of fertilizer even if the harvest fails—are significantly undermined by the lack of protection against poor rainfall. Evidence from other countries shows similar patterns: risk induces farmers to engage in low-return investment portfolios in rural India and to grow more low-risk, low-return crops such as sweetpotatoes or cassava in Tanzania. Climate and other shocks have been shown to undermine long-term nutrition, educational achievement, and earnings in settings as diverse as India, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. These studies all show that risk causes poverty to persist. 2020 Vision Focus; BriefPRIFPRI 1; GRP 4; 2020 MTID; DG...|$|R
