2500|$|The report closely {{examined}} {{the distinctions between}} [...] "forcible removal", [...] "removal under threat or duress", [...] "official deception", [...] "uninformed voluntary release", and [...] "voluntary release". The evidence indicated that in numerous cases, children were brutally and forcibly removed from their parent or parents, possibly even from the hospital shortly after birth, when identified as mixed-race babies. Aboriginal Protection Officers often made the judgement to remove certain children. In some cases, families were required to sign legal documents to relinquish care to the state. In Western Australia, the Aborigines Act 1905 removed the <b>legal</b> <b>guardianship</b> of Aboriginal parents. It made all their children legal wards of the state, so {{the government did not}} require parental permission to relocate the mixed-race children to institutions.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1958, [...] Archibald MacLeish instigated the {{campaign}} for Pound's release which was successful. [...] He stayed on at St. Elizabeths for the next month, waiting for a passport, packing books and papers that were stored in Dorothy's apartment, leaving the hospital early in May. In June Dorothy and her husband, traveling with Marcella, [...] now acting nominally as Pound's secretary, boarded a ship for Italy. Upon their arrival they were met in Verona by Mary, Pound's daughter with Olga, and from there they traveled to Schloss Brunnenburg. In January 1959 tensions between the three women became intolerable. Dorothy, who lived in her own section of the castle, maintained <b>legal</b> <b>guardianship</b> and controlled his funds. A few months later, Dorothy took Pound and Marcella to Rapallo to visit Olga, and then traveled through Italy. In Sirmione Pound {{began to talk about}} marrying Marcella, and Dorothy used her legal power: {{by the end of the}} summer Marcella, 40 years younger than Pound, had been sent back to the US. Pound fell into a period of ill-health in 1960 that lingered through the early months of 1961. Dorothy eventually brought him to Rapallo, and unable to cope with him, she turned his care over to Olga.|$|E
40|$|Diagnoses of {{psychiatric}} diseases {{do not include}} criminal behavior. In schizophrenia, a non-negligible subgroup is incarcerated for capital and other crimes. Most studies that compared offender and non-offender patients with schizophrenia have only focused on male patients. With this study, we compared demographic and disease-related characteristics between 35 female incarcerated forensic patients (fSZ) and 35 female inpatients with schizophrenia (SZ). Basic clinical documentation and basic forensic clinical documentation revealed significant clinical and demographic {{differences between the two}} groups. Compared to SZ, fSZ were more severely clinically impaired, showing higher rates of comorbid alcohol and substance disorder, more suicide attempts, had more previous hospitalizations, and were younger at disease onset. Regarding demographic variables, fSZ showed a higher rate of unemployment and homelessness and had to rely more often on housing and <b>legal</b> <b>guardianships</b> compared to SZ. These results suggest that female forensic patients with schizophrenia are more severely affected by clinical and non-clinical variables requiring an adapted intervention program. These results may also indicate two developmental trajectories for criminal and non-criminal schizophrenia in females...|$|R

60|$|Old lawyer Pittman {{had once}} been a very {{important}} person indeed, having in his earlier days managed the affairs of several gentlemen in those parts, who had subsequently been obliged to sell everything and leave the country, in which crisis Mr. Pittman accommodatingly stepped in as a purchaser of their estates, taking on himself the risk and trouble of a more leisurely sale; which, however, happened to turn out very much to his advantage. Such opportunities occur quite unexpectedly in the way of business. But I think Mr. Pittman must have been unlucky in his later speculations, for now, in his old age, he had not the reputation of being very rich; and though he rode slowly to his office in Milby every morning on an old white hackney, he had to resign the chief profits, as well as the active business of the firm, to his younger partner, Dempster. No one in Milby considered old Pittman a virtuous man, and the elder townspeople were not at all backward in narrating the least advantageous portions of his biography in a very round unvarnished manner. Yet I could never observe that they trusted him any the less, or liked him any the worse. Indeed, Pittman and Dempster were the popular lawyers of Milby and its neighbourhood, and Mr. Benjamin Landor, whom no one had anything particular to say against, had a very meagre business in comparison. Hardly a landholder, hardly a farmer, hardly a parish within ten miles of Milby, whose affairs were not under the <b>legal</b> <b>guardianship</b> of Pittman and Dempster; and I think the clients were proud of their lawyers' unscrupulousness, as the patrons of the fancy's are proud of their champion's 'condition'. It was not, to be sure, the thing for ordinary life, but it was the thing to be bet on in a lawyer. Dempster's talent in 'bringing through' a client was a very common topic of conversation with the farmers, over an incidental glass of grog at the Red Lion. 'He's a long-headed feller, Dempster; why, it shows yer what a headpiece Dempster has, as he can drink a bottle o' brandy at a sittin', an' yit see further through a stone wall when he's done, than other folks 'll see through a glass winder.' Even Mr. Jerome, chief member of the congregation at Salem Chapel, an elderly man of very strict life, was one of Dempster's clients, and had quite an exceptional indulgence for his attorney's foibles, perhaps attributing them to the inevitable incompatibility of law and gospel.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the {{situations}} of minor infirmity or of travel abroad {{that allow for}} the possible delegation of the royal functions by the monarch to counsellors of state (as authorised by section 6 of the Regency Act 1937), {{the establishment of a}} regency carries with it the notion that the sovereign is not fit and able to administer the affairs of his own person, so that he needs a <b>legal</b> guardian. The <b>guardianship</b> of the monarch, however, is not governed by the same ordinary body of laws that regulate the appointment of legal guardians to people in general.

40|$|ABSTRACT One of the {{consequences}} of dementia is the possibility of a guardianship proceeding that will deprive patients of legal capacity in taking decisions and managing their own assets. Objective To assess the <b>legal</b> capacity and <b>guardianship</b> proceedings in patients diagnosed with dementia. Methods Ninety-seven patients diagnosed with dementia and seen at a tertiary hospital were evaluated. Results Of these 97 patients, 60 (62 %) were female. The mean age of the patients was 77. 9 years; average schooling was 5. 5 years. The main diagnosis was Alzheimer’s disease (73 %) : 16 patients were at a mild stage, eight at a moderate stage and 73 at an advanced stage of dementia. Only 28 patients had been legally declared incapable. Conclusion The large numbers of patients at an advanced stage of dementia, and the relatively few patients legally declared incapable show that legal issues in dementia are problematic...|$|R

40|$|Guardianship laws in most Western {{societies}} provide decision-making {{mechanisms for}} adults with impaired capacity. Since {{the inception of}} these laws, the principle of autonomy and {{recognition of human rights}} for those coming within guardianship regimes has gained prominence. A new legal model has emerged, which seeks to incorporate ‘assisted decision-making’ models into guardianship laws. Such models legally recognise that an adult’s capacity may be maintained through assistance or support provided by another person, and provide formal recognition of the person in that ‘assisting’ role. This article situates this latest legal innovation within a historical context, examining the social and <b>legal</b> evolution of <b>guardianship</b> laws and determining whether modern assisted decision-making models remain consistent with guardianship reform thus far. It identifies and critically analyses the different assisted decision-making models which exist internationally. Finally, it discusses a number of conceptual, legal and practical concerns that remain unresolved. These issues require serious consideration before assisted decisionmaking models are adopted in guardianship regimes in Australia...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} the {{implementation}} of women 2 ̆ 7 s property rights in al-Andalus and the Maghrib in the period between the tenth and fifteenth centuries, as reflected in legal sources. An examination of Islamic property and family law, judicial practice, and the attitude of jurists toward women indicates {{that the majority of}} Muslim women owned property independently {{at some point in their}} lives, that women acquired property at every stage of the life-cycle, and that women played an important role in the intergenerational transmission of property and in keeping familial property intact. At the same time, the <b>legal</b> institutions of <b>guardianship</b> (wilāya) and interdiction (ḥajr) placed constrains on the ability of women to exercise effective control of their property during adulthood. The implementation of women 2 ̆ 7 s sharʿī property rights by qādīs and muftīs had important consequences for women 2 ̆ 7 s relationships with their families, especially their husbands. That male domination was never complete in propertied families calls into question the characterization of the Muslim family as “patriarchal” and points to the need for a new social, cultural, and economic explanation of the nature of the Muslim family...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{develop a}} {{conceptual}} model and asso-ciated assessment template that is usable across state jurisdictions {{for evaluating the}} independent-living capacity of older adults in guardianship proceed-ings. Design and Methods: We used an iterative process in which <b>legal</b> provisions for <b>guardianship</b> and prevailing clinical practices for capacity assessment were integrated, through expert group consensus and external review by legal and health care professionals, to form a conceptual model and template. Results: The model and template provide a structure for conducting and documenting a capacity evaluation in guardian-ship by using six assessment domains {{of interest to the}} courts: (a) medical condition, (b) cognition, (c) func-tional abilities, (d) values, (e) risk of harm and level of supervision needed, and (f) means to enhance capacity. The template also addresses the participation of the person in the guardianship hearing, confidentiality and privilege issues, and certification by the examiner. An on-line version of the template can be adapted to address specific jurisdictional requirements. Implications: A conceptual model and evaluation template provide a useful cross-jurisdictional format for conducting and documenting capacity assessments of older adults in guardianship proceedings. The template may be par-ticularly useful to clinicians for providing courts with information to support limited guardianship orders...|$|R
