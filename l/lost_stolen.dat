5|$|SmarTrip cards {{comply with}} the ISO/IEC 14443 Type B standard. A {{microchip}} contained within the card stores its value, {{as well as the}} rider’s most recent entry and exit points, and a unique identifier. However, the unique identifier is not linked to a person’s name or identity, unless one registers the card online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should the card be <b>lost,</b> <b>stolen,</b> or damaged. The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers to subsidize employee transportation costs tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to their cards.|$|E

25|$|Lost source accidents, also {{referred}} to as orphan sources, are incidents in which a radioactive source is <b>lost,</b> <b>stolen</b> or abandoned. The source then might cause harm to humans. One case occurred at Yanango where a radiography source was lost, also at Samut Prakarn a phosphorus teletherapy source was lost and at Gilan in Iran a radiography source harmed a welder. The best known example of this type of event is the Goiânia accident in Brazil.|$|E

2500|$|On February 18, 2010, the day {{the case}} was made public, the school {{district}} posted an initial reply on its website asserting that: [...] "The tracking-security feature was limited to taking a still image of the operator and the operator's screen," [...] and that it [...] "has only been used for the limited purpose of locating a <b>lost,</b> <b>stolen,</b> or missing laptop. [...] his includes tracking down a loaner computer that, against regulations, might be taken off campus." [...] The complaint had not indicated whether Robbins' laptop had been reported lost or stolen, and Young said the district could not disclose that fact.

60|$|In the meantime, Bruce and his {{few friends}} had wandered {{on to the}} banks of Loch Lomond, where they could only find one leaky boat, unable to hold more than three. Bruce, Douglas, and one other {{were the first to}} cross, and the third then rowed back for another freight, while {{throughout}} this tedious waiting the King made his friends forget their troubles by reciting poems and tales of chivalry. He spent part of the winter in Kentire, and the rest at the little island of Rachrin, so entirely lost to the knowledge of his enemies, that derisive proclamation was made for Robert Bruce, <b>lost,</b> <b>stolen,</b> or strayed. The Pope's legate solemnly excommunicated him at Carlisle, with bell, book, and candle; and Annandale was given to the Earl of Hereford, and Carrick to Henry Percy, whilst the executions of his relatives and adherents were both savage and cruel.|$|E
60|$|Of course I {{asked whether}} {{a great many}} of the books were not <b>lost,</b> <b>stolen,</b> and destroyed; and of course I was told that there were no losses, no thefts, and no destruction. As to thefts, the {{librarian}} did not seem to think that any instance of such an occurrence could be found. Among the poorer classes, a book might sometimes be lost when they were changing their lodgings; but anything so lost was more than replaced by the fines. A book is taken out for a week, and if not brought back {{at the end of that}} week--when the loan can be renewed if the reader wishes--a fine, I think of two cents, is incurred. The children, when too late with the books, bring in the two cents as a matter of course, and the sum so collected fully replaces all losses. It was all couleur de rose; the librarianesses looked very pretty and learned, and, if I remember aright, mostly wore spectacles; the head librarian was enthusiastic; the nice, instructive books were properly dogs-eared; my own productions were in enormous demand; the call for books over the counter was brisk; and the reading-room was full of readers.|$|E
60|$|Here I am, {{running away}} from a bad {{headache}} as Tristram Shandy ran away from death, and lodging for {{a week in the}} Hôtel de l'Écu de Genève, wherein there is a large mirror shattered by a cannon-ball in the late revolution. A revolution, whatever its merits, achieved by free spirits, nobly generous and moderate, even in the first transports of victory, elevated by a splendid popular education, and bent on freedom from all tyrants, whether their crowns be shaven or golden. The newspapers may tell you what they please. I believe there is no country on earth but Switzerland in which a violent change could have been effected in the Christian spirit shown in this place, or in the same proud, independent, gallant style. Not one halfpennyworth of property was <b>lost,</b> <b>stolen,</b> or strayed. Not one atom of party malice survived the smoke of the last gun. Nothing is expressed in the Government addresses to the citizens but a regard for the general happiness, and injunctions to forget all animosities; which they are practically obeying at every turn, though the late Government (of whose spirit I had some previous knowledge) did load the guns with such material as should occasion gangrene in the wounds, and though the wounded do die, consequently, every day, in the hospital, of sores that in themselves were nothing.|$|E
