500|$|James Fox, {{journalist}} {{and author of the}} non-fiction book White Mischief: The Murder of Lord Erroll, was credited, along with Keith Richards, as co-author. He had previously interviewed Richards in 1973 and the pair had been friends since then. Reportedly, $7.3 million was paid for the work in 2007, [...] "on the basis of a 10-page excerpt". Fox spent [...] "hundreds of hours" [...] with Richards at his Caribbean home, and also in the United Kingdom, to gather material for the book. He interviewed Richards at length and also talked to many associates. Fox said of Richards, [...] "I'd have to catch him like a salmon." [...] The interviews were conducted seated at a table, but the two were not opposite each other. Richards always played music, so Fox provided him with a <b>lapel</b> <b>microphone.</b> [...] The subject matter was not handled chronologically; Fox allowed his subject to mentally [...] "dart about". [...] "Some sessions lasted hours and some, dealing with the more painful parts of Richards' life, lasted just minutes." [...] The project took five years to complete.|$|E

50|$|While Judge Cochran won the 2012 reelection handily {{during the}} investigation, the {{discovery}} of the pre-signed warrants started speculation that the Chief Magistrate would step down. Before this happened, however, Poston's client was stopped in her car at night near her home by a Murray County deputy, who was almost immediately joined by his Sergeant, the judge's cousin. When the first officer's drug dog failed to signal the presence of any illegal drugs, the officers turned off their <b>lapel</b> <b>microphones</b> and called the embattled Chief Magistrate Judge. Just after the call, one of the officers walked directly to a certain spot and reached under the car. A magnetized tin-box was found under the woman's car containing methamphetamine.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} {{automatic}} segmentation of meetings into {{a sequence of}} group actions or phases. Our work {{is based on a}} corpus of multiparty meetings collected in a meeting room instrumented with video cameras, <b>lapel</b> <b>microphones</b> and a microphone array. We have extracted a set of feature streams, in this case extracted from the audio data, based on speaker turns, prosody and a transcript of what was spoken. We have related these signals to the higher level semantic categories via a multistream statistical model based on dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). We report on a set of experiments in which different DBN architectures are compared, together with the different feature streams. The resultant system has an action error rate of 9 %. I...|$|R
30|$|There was an {{important}} issue to solve even before the actual speech recognition process started. That is, what speech signal should be actually recognized. The {{problem was that the}} signal extracted from the archive video recordings was stereo, one channel containing the speech of the interviewer and the other the speech of the interviewee. However, there were frequent echoes {{despite the fact that the}} speakers were wearing <b>lapel</b> <b>microphones.</b> This was particularly challenging in the event of cross-talking when the speech of both dialogue participants was mixed together in both channels and we have to design an algorithm for separating the speech that was based on the levels of energy. Also, to save the computational power and storage, we have omitted from recognition all the portions of the signal that did not contain any speech.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{automatic}} structuring of multiparty meetings using audio information. We have used a corpus of 53 meetings, recorded using a <b>microphone</b> array and <b>lapel</b> <b>microphones</b> for each participant. The task was to segment meetings into a sequence of meeting actions, or phases. We have adopted a statistical approach using dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). Two DBN architectures were investigated: a two-level hidden Markov model (HMM) in which the acoustic observations were concatenated; and a multistream DBN in which two separate observation sequences were modelled. Additionally we have also explored the use of counter variables to constrain the number of action transitions. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} DBN architectures are an improvement over a simple baseline HMM, with the multistream DBN with counter constraints producing an action error rate of 6 %. 1...|$|R
50|$|Day 7: Will {{finally had}} his <b>lapel</b> <b>microphone</b> {{returned}} to him, {{but he had}} to get past cockroaches and other insects to get it. Marylaine and Jen were put in the punishment room for a violation Jen committed. Their bickering continued there while installing train tracks used in the weekly task. The entire task took overnight, but the two eventually reconciled.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{entering}} the house, Barrera was a singer in Japan. He {{was the first}} housemate evicted, on his 21st day in Pinoy Big Brother's house.

50|$|Bam - Among {{the four}} housemates {{mentioned}} by Big Brother, he committed the gravest violations, and therefore was forcibly evicted by Big Brother on Day 14. This was done as disciplinary action for violations such as talking without the <b>lapel</b> <b>microphone,</b> writing using pen and paper, using hand signals, whispering, talking when told not to, etc. The next day, new housemate Brenda {{entered the house}} to take Bam's place.|$|E
40|$|The recently-completed ICSI Meeting Corpus is {{available}} through the LDC. It consists of audio and transcripts of 75 research meetings, {{ranging in size from}} 3 to 10 people, with an average of 6 people. The meetings were recorded by means of both closetalking (headset or <b>lapel)</b> <b>microphones</b> and far-field (table-top) microphones. The close-talking microphones enable separation of each person’s audible activities from those of every other participant. The far-field microphones provide a view of the meeting as a whole. The transcripts preserve words and other communicative phenomena, displayed in musical score format, time-synchronized to the digitized audio recordings. The corpus is intended as a resource for both speech researchers and language researchers. This paper describes the methods used to prepare the corpus, some interesting challenges and solutions, and the benefits of using both closetalking and far-field microphones. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our early exploration of automatic recognition of conversational speech in meetings {{for use in}} automatic summarizers and browsers to produce meeting minutes effectively and rapidly. To achieve optimal performance we started from two different baseline English recognizers adapted to meeting conditions and tested resulting performance. The data {{was found to be}} highly disfluent (conversational human to human speech), noisy (due to <b>lapel</b> <b>microphones</b> and environment), and overlapped with background noise, resulting in error rates comparable so far to those on the CallHome conversational database (40 - 50 % WER). A meeting browser is presented that allows the user to search and skim through highlights from a meeting efficiently despite the recognition errors. 1.

30|$|The first {{database}} used in {{the present}} study is available from [URL] It consists of voice recordings of 60 female speakers of Standard Chinese (i.e. Mandarin/Putonghua). Each speaker was recorded twice with each recording approximately 10 min long. All speakers were first-language speakers of Standard Chinese from Northeastern China, aged between 23 and 45. The nature of the speech was spontaneous, collected from an information exchange task over a telephone. Recordings were made at 44.1 kHz 16 -bit using flat-frequency response <b>lapel</b> <b>microphones</b> (Sennheiser MKE 2 P-C) together with the use of an external soundcard (Roland® UA- 25 EX) under studio-clean conditions. Furthermore, each of the approximately 10 -min length recording was also post-processed using SoundLabeller [46] to remove of silence segments such that only the speech-active segments of about 2 to 5 min are used in our experiments. For more details on the database, readers may refer to section 6.3. 1 of [47].|$|R
40|$|Accurate speaker {{location}} {{is essential for}} optimal performance of distant speech acquisition systems using microphone array techniques. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, no comprehensive studies on the degradation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) as a function of speaker location accuracy in a multi-party scenario exist. In this paper, we describe a framework for evaluation of the effects of speaker location errors on a microphone array-based ASR system, in the context of meetings in multi-sensor rooms comprising multiple cameras and microphones. Speakers are manually annotated in videos in different camera views, and triangulation is used to determine an accurate speaker location. Errors in the speaker location are then induced in a systematic manner to observe their influence on speech recognition performance. The system is evaluated on real overlapping speech data collected with simultaneous speakers in a meeting room. The results are compared with those obtained from close-talking headset <b>microphones,</b> <b>lapel</b> <b>microphones,</b> and speaker location based on audio-only and audio-visual information approaches...|$|R
30|$|Large Farsdat [22] {{includes}} about 140 h {{of speech}} signals, all segmented and labeled in word level. This corpus is uttered by 100 speakers {{from the most}} common dialects of the Persian language. Each speaker utters 20 - 25 pages of text from various subjects. In contrast with small Farsdat, which is recorded in a quiet and reverberation-free room, large Farsdat is recorded in office environment. Four microphones, a unidirectional desktop <b>microphone,</b> two <b>lapel</b> <b>microphones</b> and a headset microphone are used to record the speech signals. All the speech signals in this corpus are recorded using two microphones simultaneously, the desktop microphone is used {{in all of the}} recording sessions and each of the other three microphones is used in about one-third of the sessions. Totally, the desktop microphone is used for about 70 h of recorded speech and the other three microphones are used for the 70 remaining hours. The average SNR of the desktop microphone is about 28 dB. The sampling rate is 16 kHz for the whole corpus.|$|R

50|$|Day 36: In the wee hours, {{the boys}} from both Houses {{completed}} their sacrifice for Angelo's mother. As a result, she received Angelo's college scholarship aside from the P10,000 wage for being a house help. Big Brother had the Villa's housemates' limbs braced and the Apartment's housemates wear opaque goggles for several violations several housemates in both housemates committed (such as sleeping at the wrong time, mishandling the <b>lapel</b> <b>microphone,</b> and taking a bath outside shower time). The punishments were relieved after the Philippine housemates brought in April, Ann, and Carson's luggage to their bedrooms and the Teenternational housemates brought in pillows from their designated areas. After the eviction proceedings, Angelo {{and his mother had}} a 100-second reunion, the first time they saw each other in two years.

The NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY SMART DATA FLOW system is a low overhead, high bandwidth transport mechanism for standardized multi-modal data streams. It is designed to allow integration of multiple sensors with distributed processing needed for the sense-recognize-respond cycle of multi modal user interfaces. Its core is a server/client architecture, allowing clients to produce or subscribe to data flows, and supporting steps toward scalable processing, distributing the computing requirements among many network connected computers and pervasive devices.

30|$|The ASR {{subsystem}} is an HTK-based phone recognition system [83] (and therefore, not a word-based ASR {{system as}} the rest of the systems described before), which produces a phone lattice and a 1 -best phone sequence for each speech file. The ASR subsystem employs 39 -dimensional MFCCs as acoustic features with cepstral mean compensation and histogram equalization applied. Three-state context-dependent phone models have been trained from different speech sources: (1) the noise-free phonetically-balanced data of the ALBAYZIN database [132], which amount to 12.8 h of speech, (2) the close-talk microphone speech data from Speech-Dat-Car database [133], which amount to 18.85 h of speech, (3) data recorded with the close talk microphone and one of the <b>lapel</b> <b>microphones</b> of the Domolab database [134], which amount to 9.33 h of speech, and (4) data corresponding to the Spanish parliament sessions of the TC-STAR database [135], which amount to 111.89 h of speech. In total, about 153 h of speech have been used for acoustic model training. The text transcriptions of these speech sources have been used to train the phone trigram LM with the SRI-LM toolkit [127]. In total, there are about 500 k words in the text material and about 3 million phones that are finally used to train the phone trigram.|$|R
