50|$|When {{automatic}} record changers, auto replay adapters and jukeboxes {{began appearing}} in the 1920s the need arose to find a more reliable and forgiving way to accurately direct the stylus {{to the start of}} the recorded area as well as signal the end of a performance. Appearing near the outer edge of the record and leading the stylus inward to the performance, Decca introduced the <b>lead-in</b> <b>groove</b> in 1935 in the USA, with the industry following soon thereafter. <b>Lead-in</b> <b>groove</b> length, positioning and motion varied by manufacturer and era, some moving slower, some requiring several revolutions before encountering audio, while others being very short and jerky. As with the recorded locked groove at the end, it is possible to record sound into the <b>lead-in</b> <b>groove.</b> King Crimson's USA (mentioned above) has this feature. George Harrison's Wonderwall Music and the Dead Kennedys' Plastic Surgery Disasters also start in the <b>lead-in</b> <b>groove.</b> Many Telarc classical LP's began the music near the end of the <b>lead-in</b> <b>groove</b> to avoid pre-echo (caused by wide groove modulations following a number of closely spaced silent grooves).|$|E

5000|$|In the {{original}} release of Ricochet, {{the sound of}} two hands clapping can be heard {{at the beginning of}} the second track. This was actually the very last tiny bit of applause decay before the music started-probably left in as a then adequate buffer before the start of the piece, on the LP <b>lead-in</b> <b>groove.</b> V-2044. This sound has been edited out in some of the re-released versions of the album, notably Virgin's 1995 [...] "Definitive Edition" [...] CD release, presumably being regarded as noise.|$|E
5000|$|On the Ralph Records release Songs for Swinging Larvae by Renaldo and the Loaf, {{the last}} song on side one {{continues}} {{into the inner}} spiral and into the inner groove with a loop of a male voice providing a spoken percussion effect of [...] "boom boom crash crash," [...] which, however, when it reaches the inner groove is not strictly in the same 4/4 rhythm, being more in 5/8 ("boom boom crash crash crash") This motif reappears (in strict 4/4 rhythm again) in the <b>lead-in</b> <b>groove</b> opening Side Two of the album, which then leads to the first selection on that side.|$|E
