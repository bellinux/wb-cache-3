30|$|Because of the {{thickness}} of the <b>LP</b> <b>tube,</b> we could not do any measurement in the anode dark and cathode glow regions, and in the Crookes dark space the current of the probe was zero for the interval − 50 to + 50  V.|$|E

50|$|The HP {{cylinder}} exhaust {{passed through}} an LP feed heater, {{and then the}} <b>tubes</b> of an <b>LP</b> boiler; this was roughly equivalent to the LP boiler in the Schmidt system, but was heated by HP exhaust steam not combustion gases. Steam {{was raised in the}} LP boiler at , fed to the LP superheater, and then the LP cylinder. The LP exhaust fed the blastpipe in the smokebox. The HP exhaust condensed in the <b>LP</b> boiler heating <b>tubes</b> was pumped back to the HP steam generator.It was a complex system.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the unique}} {{characteristics}} of imaging plates, computed radiography (cRT) enables {{the development of new}} radiographic techniques that were not possible with conventional film radiography, including material characterization. In this case, achieving maximum radiographic image quality is imperative which implies that every parameter of the cRT workflow must be controlled. The paper presents an analysis of the scanning parameter influence on the characterization of the cell structure of expanded polystyrene (PS-E). For this purpose, an experiment was conducted varying three main scanning parameters: resolution (Res), laser power (<b>LP)</b> and photomultiplier <b>tube</b> gain (PMT). In order to determine the significance of each scanning parameter for the radiographic image quality, a parameter called „worthiness“ was introduced. Also, using a mathematical model developed {{on the basis of the}} experiment, a methodology for the selection of scanning parameters for the cRT of PS-E of different compressive strength is proposed. Key words: computed radiography technique, expanded polystyrene, optimizing scanning parameters 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Wireless power {{transmission}} has been recently used to charge batteries in portable devices. This {{is the first}} study to combine this technology with light-emitting diodes (WPT-LP) for plant tissue culture application. We also present the comparison of the in vitro growth of chrysanthemum and strawberry plantlets under the new LED lighting system; LED - Uni-Pack (<b>LP)</b> system; LED <b>tube</b> and fluorescent light (FL). The results showed that fresh weight (1. 42 g), dry weight (118. 67 mg), plant height (5. 68 cm), leaf area (3. 59 cm 2) and chlorophyll content (47. 9 &# 956;g g- 1) of chrysanthemum plantlets under the WPT-LP system were higher than those under FL and LED tube. Similar results were also recorded on the strawberry plantlets. Our results suggested that utilizing WPT-LP system saves the culture space considerably compared with the conventional downward lighting system with fluorescent lamps. The results also indicated that the subsequent growth and development of chrysanthemum and strawberry plantlets derived from WPT-LP system were either equal to or better than those from LP system under LED tube or FL...|$|R
