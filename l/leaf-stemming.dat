40|$|Abstract Ginseng root is {{used more}} often than other parts such as leaf stem {{although}} extracts from ginseng <b>leaf-stem</b> also contain similar active ingredients with pharmacological functions. Ginseng's <b>leaf-stems</b> are more readily available {{at a lower cost}} than its root. This article reviews the pharmacological effects of ginseng <b>leaf-stem</b> on some diseases and adverse effects due to excessive consumption. Ginseng <b>leaf-stem</b> extract contains numerous active ingredients, such as ginsenosides, polysaccharides, triterpenoids, flavonoids, volatile oils, polyacetylenic alcohols, peptides, amino acids and fatty acids. The extract contains larger amounts of the same active ingredients than the root. These active ingredients produce multifaceted pharmacological effects on the central nervous system, {{as well as on the}} cardiovascular, reproductive and metabolic systems. Ginseng <b>leaf-stem</b> extract also has anti-fatigue, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-obesity, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and anti-aging properties. In normal use, ginseng <b>leaf-stem</b> extract is quite safe; adverse effects occur only when it is over dosed or is of poor quality. Extracts from ginseng root and <b>leaf-stem</b> have similar multifaceted pharmacological activities (for example central nervous and cardiovascular systems). In terms of costs and source availability, however, ginseng <b>leaf-stem</b> has advantages over its root. Further research will facilitate a wider use of ginseng <b>leaf-stem.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Leaf-stem</b> {{allometry}} is {{an important}} spectrum that linked to biomass allocation and life history strategy in plants, although the determinants and evolutionary significance of <b>leaf-stem</b> allometry remain poorly understood. Leaf and stem architectures - including stem area/mass, petiole area/mass, lamina area/mass, leaf number, specific leaf area (LA), and mass-based leafing intensity (LI) - were measured on the current-year branches for 28 Ficus species growing in a common garden in SW China. The leaf anatomical traits, stem wood density (WD), and stem anatomical and mechanical properties of these species were also measured. We analyzed <b>leaf-stem</b> allometric relationships and their associations with stem hydraulic ad mechanical properties using species-level data and phylogenetically independent contrasts. We found isometric relationship between leaf lamina area/mass and stem area/mass, suggesting that the biomass allocation to leaf was independent to stem size. However, allometric relationship between LA/mass and petiole mass was found, indicating large leaves invest a higher fractional of biomass in petiole than small ones. LI, i. e., leaf numbers per unit of stem mass, was negatively related with leaf and stem size. Species with larger terminal branches tend to have larger vessels and theoretical hydraulic conductivity, but lower WD and mechanical strength. The size of leaf lamina, petiole, and stem was correlated positively with stem theoretical hydraulic conductivity, but negatively with stem WD and mechanical strength. Our results suggest that <b>leaf-stem</b> allometry in Ficus species was shaped by the trade-off between stem hydraulic efficiency and mechanical stability, supporting a functional interpretation {{of the relationship between}} leaf and stem dimensions. </p...|$|R

Transcriptome analysis is a powerful approach to research grain traits and elucidate their genetic regulation. In this study, two cDNA libraries from the developing grain and <b>leaf-stem</b> components of bread wheat cultivar, Nongda 211, were sequenced using Roche/ 454 technology. There were 1061274 and 1516564 clean reads generated from grain and <b>leaf-stem,</b> respectively. A total of 61393 high-quality unigenes were obtained with an average length of 1456 bp after de novo assembly. The analysis of the 61393 unigenes involved in the biological processes of the grain showed that there were 7355 differentially expressed genes upregulated in the grain library.

40|$|The {{study of}} readily {{measurable}} agronomic traits which may estimate {{total dry matter}} production and the determination of their relationships with quality characteristics needs more emphasis in alfalfa breeding. The main objective {{of this study was}} the selection of specific stem weight (SSW) and its relationship to other agronomic and nutritive traits. A secondary study was on agronomic and nutritive traits and their relationship with one another. Means, standard deviations, analyses of variance, and correlations were obtained on 98 Mesa-Sirsa alfalfa clones for SSW, plant height, yield, <b>leaf-stem</b> ratio, stem acid detergent fiber (ADF), leaf ADF, stem acid detergent lignin (ADL), and leaf ADL. The means of SSW (70 - 47 mg/ 5 cm), plant height (58 - 48 cm), yield (52 - 23 g), <b>leaf-stem</b> ratio (2. 1 - 1. 0), stem ADF (45 - 42 %), and stem ADL (10. 1 - 9. 1 %) varied from one harvest to another depending on the temperature. Significant differences were observed among alfalfa clones on June 1980 for SSW, plant height, yield, <b>leaf-stem</b> ratio, stem ADF, stem ADL, and leaf ADL. Range values were as follows: SSW (92 - 53 mg/ 5 cm), plant height (70 - 41 cm), yield (82 - 22 g), <b>leaf-stem</b> ratio (1. 6 - 0. 6), stem ADF (50 - 36 %) stem ADL (13 - 8 %), leaf ADF (18 - 13 %), and leaf ADL (5 - 3 %). A low correlation was reported between stem ADF and SSW (0. 34) and also was observed between stem ADF and leaf ADF (0. 46). The SSW probably would be more effective in increasing total dry matter production in dense stands. The coarseness of the stem was not related with high fiber. High leaf ADF could be useful in selecting for leaf cells which are more resistant to rupture and would gradually release soluble protein in the rumen; thus, the incidence of bloat probably would be reduced. A low stem ADF would make the stem more digestible; therefore, intake of the stem fraction may be greater. With more coarse material in the rumen, salivary secretion might be stimulated. The SSW and stem ADF could be used to select individual genotypes which could increase growth and development {{and at the same time}} improve forage quality, since SSW and stem ADF are not related...|$|R

Gongga Mountain, southwest China. (1) We investigated stem cross-sectional area and stem mass, leaf area and leaf/lamina mass of plant twigs (terminal branches of current-year shoots) of 89 species belonging to 55 genera in 31 families. (2) Data were analyzed to determine <b>leaf-stem</b> scaling relationships using both the Model type II regression method and the phylogenetically independent comparative (PIC) method. (1) Significant, positive allometric relationships were found between twig cross-sectional area and total leaf area supported by the twig, and between the cross-sectional area and individual leaf area, suggesting that species with large leaves and thick twigs could support a disproportionately greater leaf area for a given twig cross-sectional area. (2) However, the scaling relationships between twig stem mass and total leaf area and between stem mass and total lamina mass were approximately isometric, which indicates that the efficiency of deploying leaf area and lamina mass was independent of leaf size and twig size. The results of PIC were consistent with these correlations. (3) The evergreen species were usually smaller in total leaf area for a given twig stem investment in terms of both cross-sectional area and stem mass, compared to deciduous species. Leaf mass per area (LMA) was negatively associated with the stem efficiency in deploying leaf area. (4) Compound leaf species could usually support a larger leaf area for a given twig stem mass and were usually larger in both leaf size and twig size than simple leaf species. Generally, thick-twigged/large-leaf species do not {{have an advantage}} over their counterparts in deploying photosynthetic compartments for a given twig stem investment.

Spring clipping treatments included (1) not clipped, (2) clipped when 6 inches high and (3) clipped when 12 inches high. The hay harvest criteria were (1) near full light interception by the vegetative canopy, (2) crown bud stage and (3) one-tenth bloom stage. Combinations of these criteria included first hay harvest based on light interception followed by either of the other criteria at subsequent harvests, and first harvest based on crown bud development in combination with one-tenth bloom criterion for subsequent harvest. Two alfalfa varieties, Vernal and Du Puits, were subjected {{to each of the}} 18 treatments (6 x 3 in all combinations). Results of one growing season indicated that the influence of spring clipping was not reflected in yield of dry matter (hay) except at the relatively small third harvest when spring clipping showed a deleterious effect. The yields obtained by the spring clipping were sufficient to offset the reduction at the third hay harvest. It was observed that the total yields for the season did not differ. Cutting at the one-tenth bloom stage showed an advantage in yield but with a greatly reduced crude protein percentage. Cutting on the basis of nearly complete light interception resulted in harvest at an immature stage in early May and at a very mature stage in late season. Highest yields, with leafiness and crude protein suitable for high quality hay, were obtained by cutting at the crown bud stage throughout the season, or by taking the first harvest on the basis of light interception and subsequent harvests on the basis of either crown buds or one-tenth bloom. The varieties produced approximately the same total for the season. Vernal was slightly leafier than Du Puits at the second and third hay harvests.

In this study, U. pilulifera was used as a bioindicator to investigate the possible differences in the absorption and accumulation of mineral nutrients at different levels of the Al exposure and examine the mineral nutrition composition of U. pilulifera under Al stress. Also, some growth parameters (<b>leaf-stem</b> fresh and dry weights, root dry weights, stem lengths and leaf surface area) were investigated. U. pilulifera seedlings were grown for two months in growth-room conditions and watered with spiked Hoagland solution, which contained 0, 100, and 200 ŒºM aluminium chloride (AlCl 3). It was observed that macro- and micro-nutritional status of roots and leaves was altered by Al exposure. The concentrations of some macro- and micronutrients were reduced while concentrations of others were increased by excess of Al. Some macro- and micronutrients were increased at low level of Al whereas reductions were observed at high level of Al, and vice versa. The patterns were dependent on the macro- or micronutrient and the plant part...|$|R
40|$|Poorly {{constrained}} {{rates of}} biomass turnover {{are a key}} limitation of Earth system models (ESMs). In light of this, we recently proposed a new approach encoded in a model called Populations-Order-Physiology (POP), for the simulation of woody ecosystem stand dynamics, demography and disturbance-mediated heterogeneity. POP is suitable for continental to global applications and designed for coupling to the terrestrial ecosystem component of any ESM. POP bridges the gap between first-generation dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) with simple large-area parameterisations of woody biomass (typically used in current ESMs) and complex second-generation DVMs that explicitly simulate demographic processes and landscape heterogeneity of forests. The key simplification in the POP approach, compared with second-generation DVMs, is to compute physiological processes such as assimilation at grid-scale (with CABLE (Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange) or a similar land surface model), but to partition the grid-scale biomass increment among age classes defined at sub-grid-scale, each subject to its own dynamics. POP was successfully demonstrated along a savanna transect in northern Australia, replicating the effects of strong rainfall and fire disturbance gradients on observed stand productivity and structure. Here, we extend the application of POP to wide-ranging temporal and boreal forests, employing paired observations of stem biomass and density from forest inventory data to calibrate model parameters governing stand demography and biomass evolution. The calibrated POP model is then coupled to the CABLE land surface model, and the combined model (CABLE-POP) is evaluated against <b>leaf‚Äìstem</b> allometry observations from forest stands {{ranging in age from}} 3 to 200 year. Results indicate that simulated biomass pools conform well with observed allometry. We conclude that POP represents an ecologically plausible and efficient alternative to large-area parameterisations of woody biomass turnover, typically used in current ESMs...|$|R

We conducted a study of broccoli plant response to nitrogen nutrient treatments in a commercial production field in Nova Scotia. The objectives were to quantify the effects of nitrogen nutrition on direct-seeded broccoli development and plant nitrogen uptake in different soils. The nitrogen treatments consisted of the rates of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg ha- 1, arranged with four replicates in a split-block design with soil type as the main plot. The two soil types were the well-drained Kentville (Kt) loam and the imperfectly-drained Woodville (Wd) loam. The N treatments were applied to the 60 -day cultivar ‚ÄòEverest‚Äô at shoot-tip straightened stage. Results showed that the direct-seeded broccoli N uptake ability was significantly higher (6. 2 g plant- 1) in the Wd soil, where the soil was near neural (pH 6. 2) and contained more water (12 % soil water content, SWC), compared to the Kt soil where the soil was acidic (pH 5. 2) and drier (8 % SWC). Broccoli plants responded significantly up to the lower N rate (50 kg ha- 1) in the Wd soil but to the higher rate (75 kg ha- 1) in the Kt soil. There was a significant correlation between head yield and <b>leaf-stem</b> N reserves (R 2 = 0. 56, P < 0. 01). It was suggested that increasing N uptake could stimulate broccoli heading. Soil pH (6. 2) and SWC (12 %) conditions could promote broccoli plant N assimilation. Further quantification of regulating N temporal reserves in leaves and stems could enhance N transfer to sinks (heads), {{which would be the}} mechanism of promoting broccoli plant floret development...|$|R
40|$|To {{optimize}} plant architecture (e. g., photosynthetic active leaf area, <b>leaf-stem</b> ratio), plant physiologists {{and plant}} breeders rely on destructively and tediously harvested biomass samples. A fast and non-destructive method for obtaining information about different plant organs could be vehicle-based spectral proximal sensing. In this 3 -year study, the mobile phenotyping platform PhenoTrac 4 {{was used to}} compare the measurements from active and passive spectral proximal sensors of leaves, leaf sheaths, culms and ears of 34 spring barley cultivars at anthesis and dough ripeness. Published vegetation indices (VI), partial least square regression (PLSR) models and contour map analysis were compared to assess these traits. Contour maps are matrices consisting of coefficients of determination for all of the binary combinations of wavelengths and the biomass parameters. The PLSR models of leaves, leaf sheaths and culms showed strong correlations (R 2 = 0. 61 ‚Äì 0. 76). Published vegetation indices depicted similar coefficients of determination; however, their RMSEs were higher. No wavelength combination could be found by the contour map analysis to improve the results of the PLSR or published VIs. The best results were obtained for the dry weight and N uptake of leaves and culms. The PLSR models yielded satisfactory relationships for leaf sheaths at anthesis (R 2 = 0. 69), whereas only a low performance for all of sensors and methods was observed at dough ripeness. No relationships with ears were observed. Active and passive sensors performed comparably, with slight advantages observed for the passive spectrometer. The results indicate that tractor-based proximal sensing in combination with optimized spectral indices or PLSR models may represent a suitable tool for plant breeders to assess relevant morphological traits, allowing for a better understanding of plant architecture, which is closely linked to the physiological performance. Further validation of PLSR models is required in independent studies. Organ specific phenotyping represents a first step toward breeding by design...|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, it seems {{pretty clear that}} certain plants have {{efficiently}} armed themselves against the aphides, in turn, by secreting bitter or otherwise unpleasant juices. So far as I can discover, the little plunderers seldom touch the pungent 'nasturtiums' or trops√¶lums of our flower-gardens, even when these grow {{side by side with}} other plants on which the aphides are swarming. Often, indeed, I find winged forms upon the <b>leaf-stem</b> of a nasturtium, having come there evidently in hopes of starting a new colony; but usually in a dead or dying condition--the pungent juice seems to have poisoned them. So, too, spinach and lettuce may be covered with blight, while the bitter spurges, the woolly-leaved arabis, and the strong-scented thyme close by are utterly untouched. Plants seem to have acquired all these devices, such as close networks of hair upon the leaves, strong essences, bitter or pungent juices, and poisonous principles, mainly as deterrents for insect enemies, of which caterpillars and plant-lice are by far the most destructive. It would be unpardonable, of course, to write about honey-dew without mentioning tobacco; and I may add parenthetically that aphides are determined anti-tobacconists, nicotine, in fact, being a deadly poison to them. Smoking with tobacco, or sprinkling with tobacco-water, are familiar modes of getting rid of the unwelcome intruders in gardens. Doubtless this peculiar property of the tobacco plant has been developed as a prophylactic against insect enemies: and if so, we may perhaps owe the weed itself, as a smokable leaf, to the little aphides. Granting this hypothetical connection, the name of honey-dew would indeed be a peculiarly appropriate one. I may mention in passing that tobacco is quite fatal to almost all insects, a fact which I present gratuitously to the blowers of counterblasts, who are at liberty to make whatever use they choose of it. Quassia and aloes are also well-known preventives of fly or blight in gardens.|$|R

Information was obtained that would {{contribute to the development of}} techniques in the selection of alfalfa genotypes efficient in water use. Mesa-Sirsa genotypes varied in their water requirement. Some plants required three times more water to produce one gram of dry matter than other plants. Soil-moisture content significantly affected the water-use efficiency in the seedling stage but not in the mature stage of growth. The amount of available soil. moisture significantly influenced the production of dry forage, stems, and leaves at both seedling and mature stages of growth. The relationship between water-use efficiency and growth components studied was significantly influenced by the amount of available soil moisture at the 'seedling stage but not at the mature stage of growth. The water-use efficiency of Mesa-Sirsa seedlings grown under the medium soil moisture regime increased when dry matter production from forage, stems, and leaves increased. There was also a significant relationship between the total transpired water per plant and dry matter produced, number of stems and leaflets. Total water transpired was not significantly associated with the water-use efficiency of alfalfa seedlings. At the mature stage of growth, there was a significant correlation between the water-use efficiency and each of the following factors: dry weight of forage and stems, number of leaflets, and stem-leaf ratio. The amount of water transpired per plant was significantly and positively correlated to dry matter production from forage, stems, and leaves, and to number of stems and leaflets per plant. There was no association between the total water transpired from a plant and the water requirement. The relationship between the water requirement and transpiration rate significantly varied with the three growth stages. The most efficient alfalfa genotypes at floral bud or flowering stage transpired significantly less water per unit leaf area per unit time compared to the less efficient genotypes. The rates of net photosynthesis and respiration varied among alfalfa genotypes and with growth stages. The rates of both decreased as plants progressed toward maturity. At the floral bud stage plants with the highest water requirement also had the highest rates of photosynthesis and transpiration. At the vegetative stage of growth, respiration was directly associated with <b>leaf-stem</b> ratio and transpiration rate. The number of xylem vessels was significantly associated with the water-use efficiency of alfalfa genotypes at the vegetative stage. The most efficient alfalfa plants had significantly less xylem vessels in the leaf midvein when compared to the least efficient plants.

Efficient alfalfa genotypes developed a thinner palisade layer...|$|R
40|$|Large {{mammalian}} grazers {{are among}} the most conspicuous species groups of the animal kingdom. The richest assemblages of large grazers {{can be found on the}} African continent. Diverse large grazer assemblages and the grazing systems they live in have been ascribed great socio-economic as well as ecological value. The impact of wild large grazers on humans has been enormous throughout the evolutionary history of mankind. Domesticated grazers have taken over most of the socio-economic role of their wild counterparts in industrialized societies but in many African countries, where domesticated animals were introduced relatively late, the socio-economic impact of wild ungulates is still strong, forming an important protein source and driving the fast-growing tourism industry. Next to this socio-economic role, the potential influence of large grazers on terrestrial ecosystems can be enormous, from driving large-scale changes in vegetation structure to influencing system nutrient cycling. By shaping the systems they inhabit large grazers influence communities of many other taxa that depend on these systems (from arthropods, to birds and large carnivores). Moreover, an increasing number of studies discuss the importance of grazer species diversity for the functioning of grazing systems as species differ in the way they shape their environment. Alarmingly, these diverse grazer communities and their ecological and socio-economic role are increasingly threatened. Free-roaming large grazers have disappeared from large parts of Africa and the remaining areas with high species richness seem to coincide with regions that have the highest human population growth, so the human-wildlife conflict is due to increase. To conserve these diverse assemblages and their functional role we need to understand what factors shape the large grazer communities in time and space. In other words we need to understand how these different large grazer species can locally coexist. Though other aspects such as differences in predation pressure and disease susceptibility have been mentioned, partitioning of the food resource is generally accepted to be the basis of large grazer niche differentiation and ultimately coexistence. In the past several studies have emphasized the importance of body size to explain the separation of feeding niches amongst large African grazers along resource quality and quantity axes, based on the hypothesis that larger grazers can tolerate a lower-quality diet than smaller ones. Prerequisite is that there is sufficient variation in food quality and quantity (i. e. resource heterogeneity) available to large grazer species to be able to coexist. Up to now, in the African context resource heterogeneity has mostly been defined in terms of variation in plant species and in vegetation structure, such as grass height or <b>leaf-stem</b> ratio. Furthermore, several studies argued that different-sized grazers partition resources over time, where species use the same areas and plant species but at different moments in time during large-scale migrations, exploiting different vegetation growth stages that vary in resource quality and quantity. In many areas, however, these large scale migrations do not (or no longer) occur (such as in many South African reserves). Still these same areas sustain species rich and abundant grazer assemblages without clear evidence of competition for resources. Clear empirical evidence how these species partition their resources is still lacking. In this thesis I argue that this is partly due to the fact that the spatial dimension has not been well incorporated into our thinking on large grazer resource partitioning. Spatial variation in resource quality and quantity can be defined at different spatial scales, from the feeding patch level to landscape gradients. Past studies have linked spatial variation in resource quality and quantity to single species foraging behavior and some studies have modeled the effect of resource heterogeneity on the stability of grazer population numbers. We, however, lack empirical studies that specifically relate resource heterogeneity to spatial resource partitioning and ultimately coexistence patterns in species rich grazing systems. The aim of this thesis was, therefore, to explore how naturally coexisting large African grazers might spatially partition resources by defining variation in resource quality and quantity at different spatial scales using experimental as well as observational techniques. All studies were carried out in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, a 90. 000 ha reserve on the South African east coast, just south of Swaziland and were mainly focused on the 6 commonly occurring large grazer species in the park; impala, warthog, wildebeest, zebra, buffalo and white rhino. In the thesis I start with describing how the body mass of these grazer species influences their distribution over the landscape and how this distribution is linked to landscape variation in habitat type and quality. The larger species were more evenly distributed over the landscape than the smaller species and had a more diverse habitat use, though digestive physiology influenced this relationship. By differently distributing over the landscape, large grazer species might partition their resources at a coarse landscape scale (chapter 3). At a finer scale (hectares) differences in soil type cause spatial variation in grassland types. I describe how grazer species partition these grassland types that differ in resource quality and availability and how fire interacts with grassland type to affect grazer community composition (chapter 4). In general, grazing lawn sites, situated on relatively sandy soils, were nutrient hotspots and attracted all grazer species. On the relatively clayey soils bunch grasslands attracted the larger grazer species (wildebeest and larger), especially in the months after a fire. At an even finer scale (meters), most grassland in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi is characterized by a high spatial heterogeneity at the patch level, with alternating patches of short and tall grass. I showed how this within-grassland heterogeneity might increase opportunities for resource partitioning amongst savanna grazers and ultimately mediate their coexistence (chapter 5). In a field experiment where I manipulated variation in short grass patch size and resource quality I found that species differ in their selection of patch size and quality. Moreover, at this scale grazers do not only respond to heterogeneity, but they can also shape vegetation heterogeneity. I describe and experimentally test a scale-dependent mechanism that might drive short-tall grass patch dynamics in savanna grasslands (chapter 6). This mechanism is based on an interaction between very large (mega) grazers, such as the white rhino, and smaller grazers. The mega grazers cause disturbances above a certain scale (such as wallows and middens) which attracts smaller grazers. The intense localized grazing of the smaller grazers hence promotes lawn development. These results support the suggestion that the diversity of grazer communities is a significant aspect of savanna ecosystem functioning. In the concluding chapter I synthesize the results and discuss how resource partitioning among large grazers might be nested across different spatial scales (chapter 7). Results from this thesis suggest that resource partitioning does not simply happen at one spatial scale but that large grazers actually partition a complex resource landscape where a hierarchical set of factors determines the spatial heterogeneity of resource quality and quantity at different spatial scales. However, many studies in the past were actually limited to one spatial scale. Our future challenge is that we need to design studies where we really integrate spatial scale into our thinking about how herbivores partition this complex resource landscape. These new studies might benefit from newly available techniques, such as remote-sensing of vegetation quality and satellite tracking of grazers that allow us to better integrate observed patterns of spatial resource use across spatial scales. From a practical conservation perspective the results of this study emphasize the need to take spatial resource heterogeneity into account when managing savanna systems. These results support the shift towards a new paradigm in the management of grazing systems. This so-called heterogeneity paradigm states that management should promote grassland heterogeneity to maintain biologically diverse communities in these systems. At the end of the thesis (chapter 7) I philosophize how fine scale heterogeneity might counterbalance a lack of reserve extent, because optimal and suboptimal resources become available in home ranges of sedentary species. In contrast coarse-grained systems, where there are only large-scale gradients that affect resource quality and quantity, have to be sufficiently large for animals to find the right balance of optimal and suboptimal resources. This means that focusing on reserve size would still be necessary in some cases (e. g. Serengeti system) but in places where the abiotic template is heterogeneous small reserves might provide a good alternative supporting diverse and abundant large grazer populations. This offers opportunities for areas where many different stakeholders compete for space, such as the province of Kwazulu-Natal in South Africa where Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park is situated. In other words next to reserve size, the available scale of heterogeneity of e. g. topography or soil types should be an essential criterion for reserve planning. ...|$|R
