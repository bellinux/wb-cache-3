40|$|Eight {{varieties}} of cotton from all cultivated species viz. Gossypium barbadense, Gossypium hirsutum, Gossypium herbaceum and Gossypium alboreum {{were collected from}} Ayub Agriculture Research Institute, Faisalabad. The yarn of 20 â€™s count was spun on Shirley miniature spinning unit and tested for count, lea-strength, Count <b>Lea</b> <b>Strength</b> Product value (CLSP) and unevenness (U%). The data was analyzed statistically using DMR test and presented in tabular form. The results showed that G. barbadense from long staple group and G. herbaseum from short staple cotton species presented better spinning performance...|$|E
40|$|Although ring {{spinning}} is the universal spinning system but main {{limitation of this}} system is its limited spindle speed which causes lower production rate. Now-a-days spinners are trying to finding out various alternative spinning systems among which only rotor and air-jet has established market value. So {{it is very important}} for spinners to find out a suitable one according to end use and others economic aspects. Ring, Rotor and Air-jet spinning systems provide yarn with different structures and properties. Each system has its advantages and limitations in terms of technical feasibility and economic viability. We have produced 20 's Ne, 100 % cotton yarn from the above systems and their properties are tested by UT 5 and <b>lea</b> <b>strength</b> tester. The main object of the project is to study the yarn properties (Um%, CVm%, Imperfection, Hairiness etc) of ring, rotor and air-jet spun yarn and compare among them. We observed how yarn properties are changed with the change of process. We analyzed the various yarn properties by the graphical representation...|$|E

Effects of a multifactorial falls {{prevention}} program {{for people with}} stroke returning home after rehabilitation: a randomized controlled trial. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2012; 93 : 1648 - 55. Objectives: To determine whether a multifactorial falls {{prevention program}} reduces falls in people with stroke at risk of recurrent falls and whether this program leads to improvements in gait, balance, strength, and fall-related efficacy. Design: A single blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial with 12 -month follow-up. Setting: Participants were recruited after discharge from rehabilitation and followed up in the community. Participants: Participants (N= 156) were people with stroke at risk of recurrent falls being discharged home from rehabilitation. Interventions: Tailored multifactorial falls prevention program and usual care (n= 71) or control (usual care, n= 85). Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes were rate of falls and proportion of fallers. Secondary outcomes included injurious falls, falls risk, participation, activity, <b>lea</b> <b>strength,</b> gait speed, balance, and falls efficacy. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in fall rate (intervention: 1. 89 falls/person-year, control: 1. 76 falls/person-year, incidence rate ratio= 1. 10, P=. 74) or the proportion of fallers between the groups (risk ratio=. 83, 95 % confidence interval=. 60 - 1. 14). There {{was no significant difference in}} injurious fall rate (intervention:. 74 injurious falls/person-year, control:. 49 injurious falls/person-year, incidence rate ratio= 1. 57, P=. 25), and there were no significant differences between groups on any other secondary outcome. Conclusions: This multifactorial falls prevention program was not effective in reducing falls in people with stroke who are at risk of falls nor was it more effective than usual care in improving gait, balance, and strength in people with stroke. Further research is required to identify effective interventions for this high-risk group. Open Acces...|$|E

In her review for [...] "Original Song", Reiter opined that [...] "The original songs [...] weren't half bad: From Santana's ode to poor, horrified Sam, 'Trouty Mouth,' to Puck's tribute to Lauren, 'Big Ass Heart,' to Mercedes' self-celebrating 'Hell to the No,' the original songs on this episode were funny and revealing. And rousing Regionals-winning anthem 'Loser Like Me' landed like an exuberant slushy in the face [...]" [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard praised the performance of [...] "Candles", and called it [...] "beautifully intimate", and commended The Warblers' [...] "solid performance". Todd VanDerrWerf of The A.V. Club responded negatively to [...] "Trouty Mouth", but was generally pleased with the other songs. VanDerWerff went on to praise the voice of Lea Michele: [...] "The first song Rachel sang at regionals [...] was a nicely done little ballad, the sort of song you could both see someone like Rachel writing and later belting." [...] James Poniewozik also praised the voice of Michele, as well as her character development. He opined, [...] "That said, I like the arc of Rachel-as-songwriter, which has played to some of <b>Lea</b> Michele's greatest <b>strengths</b> both as a comic and dramatic actress." [...] Robert Canning of IGN found the original songs to be [...] "hilarious". He opined, [...] "Getting to run through a series of comical and catchy false starts was entertaining. Santana's 'Trouty Mouth' was sultry and hilarious. Puckerman's rocking ode to Lauren, 'Big Ass Heart,' was also a ridiculous treat. And then both were outdone by Mercedes' stomping, Amy Winehouse-aping 'Hell to the No'." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} numerical process {{that can be used}} as a quality criterion to determine the technological value of the Egyptian cotton varieties, which in turn would denote the end-use of their fibers. However the material used in the study comprised the 6 Egyptian cotton varieties Giza 70, Giza 80, Giza 86, Giza 88, Giza 90 and Giza 92. According to the local practice in Egypt, Giza 70, Giza 88 and Giza 92 belong to the Extra-Long Staple (ELS) category, while Giza 80, Giza 86 and Giza 90 are included under the Long Staple (LS) category. The regression analysis of the relationships between fiber properties and yarn skein <b>strength</b> (<b>lea</b> product) of the 2 carded ring counts 40 and 50 Ne, was employed to drive an equation for calculating the Multiplicative Analytic Hierarchy Process (MIAHP) values. The values of the MIAHP have been used as numerical determinations of the technological values of the Egyptian cotton varieties. Nevertheless, the findings of this study clarified that with respect to the criteria weights, the pair-wise comparisons denoted that fiber length properties of Egyptian cotton ranked first where they revealed the most dominant effect on yarn strength, while tensile properties ranked second with a relative weight close to that of fiber length. On the contrary, the relative weight of fiber fineness (micronaire reading) was found to be marginal. With regard to the relative weight of sub-criterion, the pair-wise comparisons indicated that the role of fiber tenacity as a determinant of yarn strength is much superior to that of fiber elongation. Further the global weights of the sub-criterion of fiber length pointed out that the UHML (upper half mean length) plays an important role in determining yarn strength of the Egyptian cotton comparing with either the UI (uniformity index) or the SFC (short fiber content). In conformity with the values of the MIAHP, it was found that in the order of descending rank, Giza 88 ranked first, followed by Giza 92, Giza 70, Giza 86, Giza 80 and finally Giza 90...|$|R
