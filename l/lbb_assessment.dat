40|$|Cast duplex {{stainless}} steels {{are susceptible to}} thermal aging during long-term service at temperatures ranging from 280 °C to 450 °C. To analyze the effect of thermal aging on leak-before-break (LBB) behavior, three-dimensional finite element analysis models were built for circumferentially cracked pipes. Based on the elastic–plastic fracture mechanics theory, the detectable leakage crack length calculation and J-integral stability assessment diagram approach were carried out under different bending moments. The LBB curves and <b>LBB</b> <b>assessment</b> diagrams for unaged and thermally aged pipes were constructed. The {{results show that the}} detectable leakage crack length for thermally aged pipes increases with increasing bending moments, whereas the critical crack length decreases. The ligament instability line and critical crack length line for thermally aged pipes move downward and to the left, respectively, and unsafe <b>LBB</b> <b>assessment</b> results will be produced if thermal aging is not considered.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{crack opening}} displacement (COD) evaluation methods used in {{leak before break}} (<b>LBB)</b> <b>assessment</b> of sodium piping system in the Japanese sodium cooled fast reactor (JSFR). Thin wall and low work hardening material are features of piping of JSFR. Detectability of coolant sodium is very high, the target leak detection performance of leak detector of JSFR is 100 g/hr. Internal pressure of JSFR piping is very low, and large through wall crack is allowable to satisfy LBB condition. The existing COD evaluation method {{cannot be applied to}} the piping of JSFR which has above-mentioned features. Finite element analysis (FEA) were performed to evaluate COD for thin wall and low work hardening material piping with a circumferential through wall crack. These analytical results were arranged into engineering evaluation formulae. Proposed method gives high accuracy COD estimation, and is applicable to <b>LBB</b> <b>assessment</b> of JSFR piping.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{provides}} an engineering {{application of a}} continuum damage model to analyze the ductile tearing of axial surface cracks in X 80 pipelines. Compact tension experiments were conducted to examine the behavior of large crack extension of X 80 pipeline steel. The test results were used to verify the optimized parameter set of the proposed damage model. In the numerical model, progressive damage was restricted within a predetermined fracture process zone (FPZ). The material’s damage behavior in FPZ was {{described in terms of}} the Gurson–Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) micro-mechanical damage model. The measured load versus load line displacement curve of CT specimens was numerically predicted using the damage model developed. T * integral was calculated to determine the limiting crack size in X 80 pipelines. The damage model was then used to analyze the axial subcritical crack extension.

40|$|Past elastic-plastic {{fracture}} {{studies for}} leak-before-break (<b>LBB)</b> <b>assessment</b> of {{low alloy steel}} pipings have been focused mostly {{on the behavior of}} base metals and their weld metals. In contrast, the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of a welded pipe has not been studied in detail primarily because the size of the HAZ is too small to make specimens for mechanical properties measurements. In this study, microstructural analyses, microhardness tests, tensile tests and J-R tests have been conducted as a function of distance from a fusion line and temperature for HAZ materials of SA 106 Gr. C low alloy piping steels. For the ferrite-pearlite steels such as SA 106 Gr. C, the HAZ specimens showed a higher yield strength and fracture toughness compared with those of its base metal. These characteristics, despite of grain coarsening, can be explained by cleaner microstructures of HAZ materials with a finer morphology of carbides compared with pearlitic-ferritic base metals. However, the situation can be reversed for a bainitic steel since its HAZ can develop an upper bainitic structure with a reduced fracture resistance and strength, warranting further studies. close 212...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the seminar was to present {{the current state of}} the art in Leak-Before-Break (LBB) methodology development, validation, and application in an international forum. With particular emphasis on industrial applications and regulatory policies, the seminar provided an opportunity to compare approaches, experiences, and codifications developed by different countries. The seminar was organized into four topic areas: status of LBB applications; technical issues in LBB methodology; complementary requirements (leak detection and inspection); <b>LBB</b> <b>assessment</b> and margins. As a result of this seminar, an improved understanding of LBB gained through sharing of different viewpoints from different countries, permits consideration of: simplified pipe support design and possible elimination of loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA) mechanical consequences for specific cases; defense-in-depth type of applications without support modifications; support of safety cases for plants designed without the LOCA hypothesis. In support of these activities, better estimates of the limits to the LBB approach should follow, as well as an improvement in codifying methodologies.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a probabilistic leak-before-break (<b>LBB)</b> <b>assessment</b> of a ferritic main coolant line of a pressurized water reactor representative for German nuclear power plants. The analysis approach {{is based on the}} elastic-plastic fracture mechanics methodology, incorporating the failure assessment diagram to calculate the critical through-thickness crack size, as well as fatigue crack growth calculations to determine the flaw length at wall penetration. An essential part of this study is the collation and statistical treatment of material data, such as strength properties, crack resistance and fatigue crack growth curves, and their incorporation in the probabilistic assessment. The analysis yields negligible break probabilities, thus demonstrating the LBB behavior of the piping. This conclusion is validated by {{results of a}} sensitivity study with additional conservative assumptions and simplifications with respect to the initial crack size and material st ate. For the sake of simplicity, the blocking effect of the intact austenitic cladding on the crack extension, as well as the conditional probability of crack penetration through the wall during the service life are neglected in this investigation. Through an additional treatment of these issues a more realistic assessment is achieved, resulting in even smaller failure probabilities...|$|E
40|$|The term Leak-Before-Break (LBB) {{refers to}} a {{well-established}} safety criterion used to assess whether cracked tanks or pipes can leak detectable amounts of fluid as a warning before catastrophic failure occurs. In this research The LBB criterion {{was applied to the}} safety assessment of spherical Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) containment systems on ships. For this type of LNG tanks, the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC) requires several fracture mechanics analyses of fatigue crack growth. Details on how these analyses should be carried out can be found in industry codes. Although these codes provide guidance on most aspects of an <b>LBB</b> <b>assessment,</b> they are not fully satisfactory with regard to their recommendations on how to calculate the growth of deep semi-elliptical surface cracks, on how to estimate the crack shape when the crack snaps through the tank wall and how to assess these through-thickness cracks in the stage right after breakthrough. The aim of this research was to more accurately simulate the development of cracks for LBB applications. To do so, a new numerical calculation model have been developed for the estimation of crack growth, crack shape development and crack propagation after wall penetration. In addition, Finite Element Models (FEM) have been developed to predict the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF), a parameter that characterises the local stress distribution in the vicinity of a crack-tip and is commonly used in fracture mechanics. Finite Element (FE) analyses were conducted to evaluate existing, approximative SIF solutions for deep, semi-elliptical surface cracks and to find a new, FE-derived SIF solution for through-thickness cracks after breakthrough. Both the new FE-derived and existing SIF solutions were used in the numerical model. The results of different SIF solutions and numerical model configurations were then compared to experimental data from the literature in order to find recommendations for the enhancement of existing LBB procedures.
