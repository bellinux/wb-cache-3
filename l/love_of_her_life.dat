Educated privately, she had no training as a writer before publishing her first novel in 1931.

Mitford's marriage to Peter Rodd in 1933 proved unsatisfactory to both (they divorced in 1957 after a lengthy separation), and during the Second World War she [...] formed a liaison with a Free French officer, Gaston Palewski.

[...] However Breeds previously revealed she did not want the pair to romance each other, due to her real life relationship with Mitchell. Mitchell himself had also revealed he did not want the pair to start a romance. In comparison to her willingness to take him from Indigo, Breeds said Ruby would not have done the same whilst Romeo was with her best friend Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best).|$|E

Derek was the <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> but Cristina was her soul mate. More than anyone else, Cristina challenged Meredith, was honest with her, and inspired her.
