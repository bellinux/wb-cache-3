Black jay is a <b>local</b> <b>name</b> {{applied to the}} species within Tasmania. The species is often confused with the local dark-plumaged subspecies of the grey currawong (S.versicolor), known as the clinking currawong or hill magpie.|$|E
5|$|Commonly {{known as}} the {{tropical}} banksia, B.dentata is known locally as swamp banksia, and guibuk by the indigenous people in Kakadu National Park. Its <b>local</b> <b>name</b> in the Nunggubuyu language of eastern Arnhem Land is rilirdili. Other names from the same region include Enindurrkwa in the Enindhilyagwa language of Groote Eylandt, and gulpu in the Rirratjingu language of Yirrkala. Frederick Manson Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Cape Bedford knew it as kabir.|$|E
5|$|In {{what would}} later become the second of two {{tropical}} cyclones to form within the basin during November 1988, an area of disturbed weather was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) early on November1. Six hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started following the system. The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also started to track the storm and assigned it with the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> Welpring.|$|E

5|$|The {{garden warbler}} {{was given the}} {{binomial}} name Motacilla borin by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783. The current genus name is from Modern Latin silvia, a woodland nymph, related to silva, a wood. The specific borin is derived from a <b>local</b> <b>name</b> for the bird in the Genoa area of Italy; it derives from the Latin bos, ox, because the warbler was believed to accompany oxen.|$|E
5|$|About 18 hours later, the {{depression}} was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} and given the name Dan. The cyclone moved westward at , and convection continued to mature. Outflow was good across most of the system, except the northwestern corner where it was restricted by interaction with a nearby typhoon. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm, assigning it with the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> Saling. The JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm on October 9; both agencies recognized it as a typhoon the next day after an eye became visible and outflow improved in the northwestern quadrant. Dan made landfall on the southeastern coast of Luzon in the Philippines, and its center tracked {{just south of the}} Ninoy Aquino International Airport.|$|E
5|$|An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted west of Guam on September13, in {{association}} with the monsoon trough. The system gradually developed a low-level circulation and rainbands, aided by low wind shear from an anticyclone aloft. Late on September14, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a tropical depression to the east of the Philippine island of Luzon. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 12W. A nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough limited the depression's outflow to the north, although convection continued to increase. The depression moved northwestward along the southwestern periphery of a ridge. At 03:00UTC on September15, the Philippine-based PAGASA began warning on the system, giving it the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> Inday. Nine hours later, the JMA named the system Tropical Storm Fanapi.|$|E

It travelled along the eastern edge of Bronte Creek Provincial Park north to Highway5 (Dundas Street) at Palermo, bearing the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> of Bronte Road. Today, the route encounters an interchange with Highway407, Exit13, just north of Dundas Street, though the toll highway wasn't yet built in the area at the time Highway25 was decommissioned. The route continued north into Milton as Ontario Street, jogging westward for a short distance along Steeles Avenue before resuming a northward course along Martin Street.|$|E
5|$|By July15, Typhoon Ma-on had a {{well-defined}} eye with the strongest convection in its southern periphery. It continued intensifying, and the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 220km/h (135mph). Late on July15, Ma-on weakened slightly due to stronger wind shear, which caused its eyewall to break {{apart in the}} northwest quadrant. It re-intensified the next day after an eyewall replacement cycle commenced. At 0600UTC on July16, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph) while the typhoon was located about 1185km (735mi) southeast of Okinawa. Around that time, Ma-on began a motion to the northwest due to a weakening of the subtropical ridge, and it briefly entered the area warned by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA); the agency gave it the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> Ineng.|$|E
5|$|Chat Moss may {{be named}} after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, {{but as it}} was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as {{evidenced}} by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> for a peat bog.|$|E

5|$|Following the system's {{classification}} as {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression maintained a west-southwesterly track {{in response to}} a subtropical ridge to the north. On July12, it is estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Gordon by the JTWC. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> Goring. During the afternoon of July13, Gordon briefly turned southwestward as it attained typhoon status before returning to a more westerly track later that day.|$|E
5|$|India {{had been}} {{approached}} {{as a possible}} customer for the Jaguar as early as 1968, but had declined, partly {{on the grounds that}} it was not yet clear if the French and British would themselves accept the aircraft into service. India had already its Marut fighter-bomber, and tried to upgrade it with new engines, until the new project collapsed. A decade later IAF would become the largest single export customer, with a $1 billion order for the aircraft in 1978, the Jaguar being chosen ahead of the Dassault Mirage F1 and the Saab Viggen after a long and difficult evaluation process. The order involved 40 Jaguars built in Europe at Warton, and 120 licence-built aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> Shamsher ("Sword of Justice").|$|E
5|$|Nelson tracked westward, staying {{south of}} a large {{subtropical}} ridge. Despite the aforementioned favorable environment, Nelson briefly weakened late on March19, but re-intensified slightly the following morning. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the system into a typhoon. Further intensification was halted due to increased easterly wind shear, and the storm began to level off in intensity as it accelerated on a westward course. On March21, the JMA declared Nelson a severe tropical storm. According to the JTWC, the storm fluctuated between tropical storm and typhoon status for about 60hours, even though the JMA suggest that Nelson did not become a typhoon until March24. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started monitoring the storm, assigning it with the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> Bising.|$|E

5|$|On October18, a {{tropical}} depression formed {{just west of}} Palau. Tracking westward, the system attained tropical storm-force winds the following day and was assigned the name Hester. At this time, Hester was located approximately 400km (250mi) east of northern Mindanao in the Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> Goying. Early on October20, Hester brushed northern Mindanao before crossing the Visayas. The storm passed approximately 75km (45mi) south of Cebu City later that day before moving into the South China Sea. Early on October21, Hester intensified into a typhoon hours before crossing Palawan.|$|E
5|$|Sundanese or Priangan Batik is {{the term}} for batik from the Priangan region of West Java and Banten. Although Priangan batiks can use {{a wide range of}} colours, a {{preference}} for indigo is seen in some of its variants. Natural indigo dye made from Indigofera is among the oldest known dyes in Java, and its <b>local</b> <b>name</b> tarum has lent its name to the Citarum river and the Tarumanagara kingdom, which suggests that ancient West Java was once a major producer of natural indigo. Noted Priangan batik is produced in Ciamis, Garut, and Tasikmalaya. Other traditions include Batik Kuningan influenced by batik Cirebon, batik Banten that developed quite independently, and an older tradition of batik Baduy.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Prapiroon, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Henry, was a minimal typhoon which caused deadly {{flooding}} in southern China in August 2006. Prapiroon developed out of a persistent area of convection accompanied by an {{area of low pressure}} on July 25 about 120km (75mi) west-southwest of Yap. Two days later, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and PAGASA classified the system as a tropical depression, with PAGASA giving it the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> 'Henry'. By July31, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W. A strong subtropical ridge located {{to the north of the}} depression led to a west-northwest movement for most of the storm existence.|$|E
5|$|After the {{northern}} circulation became the dominant center on October9, a deepening trough in the westerlies caused {{a decrease in}} synoptic pressures, resulting in Bess' forward motion greatly decreasing. Maintaining a west-northwesterly track, strong outflow developed, especially to the southwest of the circulation. The storm eventually intensified into a typhoon on October10 as it approached {{the northern}} Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> Susang. Later that day, Bess made landfall in northern Luzon, roughly 95km (60mi) south of Escarpada Point, with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph). Though classified a minimal typhoon by the JTWC, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had recorded surface winds of 140km/h (85mph) before the system moved ashore. Inland, a barometric pressure of 976.9mbar (hPa; 28.85inHg) was recorded in Tuguegarao as the typhoon passed 55km (35mi) to the north.|$|E
5|$|Although the low {{initially}} exhibited features {{typical of}} a monsoon trough, surface observations suggested that surface pressures {{in the vicinity of}} the low began to fall on September4. Consequently, the TFCA was re-issued at 10:00UTC. Eight hours later, Dvorak intensity estimates for the storm reached T2.0/, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system into a tropical depression, although post-storm analysis from the agency indicated that the system attained tropical depression status at 00:00UTC on September4 and tropical storm intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 06:00UTC on September5, the JMA followed suit and classified Gerald as a tropical storm. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the <b>local</b> <b>name</b> Neneng. The JTWC initially expected Gerald to re-curve east of the Philippines; however, the storm's circulation remained quite shallow and embedded within the monsoon trough, causing Gerald to meander. The JMA upgraded Gerald into severe tropical storm during the evening hours of September5.|$|E
