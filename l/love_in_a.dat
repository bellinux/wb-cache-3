5|$|In {{the temple}} with Nourabad, Leila expresses fear at being left alone, but Nourabad exhorts {{her to be}} brave and to fulfil her vows to Brahma on pain of her own death. She tells him of the courage she once {{displayed}} when, as a child, she had hidden a fugitive from his enemies and refused to give him up even when threatened with death (""). The fugitive had rewarded her with a necklace that he asked her always to wear. She had kept this promise, as she would her vows. On the priest's departure, Leila quietly muses on the former times when she and Nadir would meet together secretly (""). Nadir then enters; in her fear of Nourabad's threats Leila begs him to leave, but he remains and the two declare their <b>love</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> passionate duet (""). He goes, promising to return next night, but as he leaves he is captured by the fishermen and {{brought back to the}} temple.

However, after Nourabad removes Leila's veil, Zurga recognises her as his former love; consumed by jealousy and rage, he orders that both Nadir and Leila be put to death. A violent storm erupts, as the fishermen unite in singing a hymn to Brahma ("Brahma divin Brahma!").|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1949, King married divorceé Anita Leslie (Anita Theodosia Moira Rodzianko King 1914–1984). She was {{the eldest}} child of Sir John Randolph Shane Leslie, 3rd Baronet {{and his wife}} Marjorie Ide, the Vermont-born {{daughter}} of the US ambassador to Spain. Bill and Anita probably met in Lebanon in 1943, where King served for 5 months as {{executive officer of the}} submarine base at Beirut. She was on a skiing trip after doing duty in Africa in the Motor Transport Corps in 1940–42, although a letter mentions her being in Beirut in 1941–42. Leslie-King then became an ambulance driver in the French Army from 1944 to 1945. For the latter, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1945 by General Charles de Gaulle. As Anita Leslie, she wrote over a dozen books, including <b>Love</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Nutshell (1952), The Remarkable Mr. Jerome: The Life and Times of Leonard Jerome, Sir Winston Churchill's American Grandfather (1954). In 1974 she wrote the biography of Francis Chichester, the first person to sail around the world single-handedly with only one stop. The Kings had two children, Richard Tarka Bourke King (b. 1949), and Leonie Rose King (b. 1951).|$|E

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, {{any notion of}} lesbian <b>love</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> film almost always {{required}} audiences to infer the relationships. The lesbian aesthetic of Queen Christina (1933) with Greta Garbo has been widely noted, even though the film is not about lesbians. Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), {{based on the novel}} by Daphne du Maurier, referred more or less overtly to lesbianism, but the two characters involved were not presented positively: Mrs. Danvers was portrayed as obsessed, neurotic and murderous, while the never-seen Rebecca was described as having been selfish, spiteful and doomed to die. All About Eve (1950) was originally written with the title character as a lesbian but this was very subtle in the final version, with the hint and message apparent to alert viewers.|$|E

25|$|After the Jacobean/Caroline era, A Midsummer Night's Dream {{was never}} {{performed}} {{in its entirety}} until the 1840s. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms like Henry Purcell's musical masque/play The Fairy Queen (1692), which had a successful run at the Dorset Garden Theatre, but was not revived. Richard Leveridge turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1716. John Frederick Lampe elaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of <b>Love</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Forest, his 1723 adaptation of As You Like It. In 1755, David Garrick did {{the opposite of what}} had been done a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation called The Fairies. Frederic Reynolds produced an operatic version in 1816.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 1779, a {{few weeks}} after his {{ordination}} as a priest of the Church of England, Hackman followed Martha Ray to Covent Garden, where she had gone to watch a performance of Isaac Bickerstaffe's comic opera <b>Love</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Village with her friend and fellow singer Caterina Galli. Suspecting that Ray had a new lover, when Hackman saw her in the theatre with William Hanger, 3rd Baron Coleraine, he left, fetched two pistols, and waited in a nearby coffee house. After Ray and Galli came out of the theatre, Hackman approached the ladies just as they were about to get into their carriage. He put one pistol to Ray's forehead and shot her dead. With the other he then tried to kill himself but made only a flesh wound. He then beat himself with both discharged pistols until he was arrested and taken, with Martha Ray's body, into a tavern in St James's Street. Two letters were found on Hackman, one addressed to his brother-in-law, Frederick Booth, and a love letter to Martha Ray: both later appeared in evidence at the murder trial.|$|E
25|$|Cohen and Batchellor {{ended their}} deal with Universal in 1934, and entered into an {{agreement}} with Pathe, to utilize their facilities and equipment. Cohen announced in August 1934 that C and I would produce 18 films in the 1934-35 schedule. In early 1935 Cohen survived a health scare, {{when he had to}} undergo emergency appendectomy procedure. Rumors began circulating in May 1935 that Cohen's company, along with Batchellor's, were to merge with Republic Pictures. Cohen denied those rumors. In December 1936, it was reported that Cohen was seeking to sell Invincible and begin producing for one of the major studios. Less than two weeks later, Cohen had signed agreements with Samuel J. Briskin to leave Invincible and had signed on with RKO to produce, which led to Invincible being disbanded. The remnants of Invincible were {{one of a number of}} Poverty Row studios taken over by Herbert Yates in 1936 and merged into his newly formed Republic Pictures in an attempt to create a dominant low-budget producer with enough power to take on the major studios. His first film at his new studio was 1937's Living on Love (originally titled <b>Love</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Basement), directed by Lew Landers. Cohen's stay at RKO was short-lived however, and after his year-long contract expired, he left RKO.|$|E

25|$|After confronting his wife, Gavrik {{locks the}} door and {{strangles}} Elena to death. Sasha is unable to stop it. Meanwhile, Ruth joins Harry outside the bunker, and they both decide to leave the intelligence service and live together. However Sasha, armed with {{a large piece of}} broken glass and blaming Harry for his mother's death, tries to stab him. Ruth intervenes and is stabbed instead. She dies from her injuries before help can arrive, leaving Harry to mourn the loss of his <b>love.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> telephone conversation with Towers sometime later, it is evident that Harry is considering leaving the service. It also becomes clear that Harry has engaged an outside agency to assassinate Mikhail Levrov (Jeffry Wickham) and his co-conspirators. Towers requests he not be informed of the details of these actions. Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) is shown walking into Levrov's house for an appointment with him. Harry is then seen entering the memorial area of Thames House with the names of all the MI5 officers who died in service, some of whom were characters who were killed during the series (Danny Hunter, Fiona Carter, Colin Wells, Zafar Younis, Ben Kaplan, Adam Carter, Jo Portman, Ros Myers, Ruth). He then walks onto the Grid, sits down at his desk and answers the phone, indicating he intends to continue working in the service.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} of Bonin's defense attorneys, William Charvet and Tracy Stewart, was {{to challenge the}} credibility of numerous prosecution witnesses, and to suggest that extremely significant mitigating factors as to {{the root causes of}} Bonin's behavior lay in the extensive physical, sexual, and emotional abuse he had endured throughout his childhood and adolescence. To support this contention, Bonin's defense attorneys summoned an expert on the developmental effects of violence and abuse on children named Dr. David Foster, to testify as to the conclusions of his psychological examinations upon Bonin. Dr. Foster opined that Bonin had, as a result of repeated abandonment, not received the nurturing, protection, and behavioral feedback as a child necessary for sufficient psychological development. This had been so consistent and prevalent, Foster stated, that Bonin held a confusion as to the differences between violence and <b>love.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> direct rebuttal, the prosecution summoned a forensic psychiatrist and expert in both impulse disorders and sexual sadism named Dr. Park Dietz, who testified that the overall pattern of Bonin's behavior was inconsistent with an inability to control his impulses. Dr. Dietz further testified as to Bonin's actions being reflective of planning as opposed to impulsive behavior. In summary, Dr. Dietz concluded that Bonin was a sexual sadist, and that although Bonin suffered from an antisocial personality disorder, neither of these conditions had impaired his ability to control his actions.|$|E
25|$|Ballad operas {{developed}} {{as a form of}} English stage entertainment, partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene. It consisted of racy and often satirical spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that were deliberately kept very short to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story. Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period. The first, most important and successful was The Beggar's Opera of 1728, with a libretto by John Gay and music arranged by John Christopher Pepusch, both of whom probably influenced by Parisian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of Thomas D'Urfey (1653–1723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work. Gay produced further works in this style, including a sequel under the title Polly and he was followed by many other composers. There was also a general revival in English language opera in the 1730s, largely attributed to Thomas Arne, the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, unsuccessfully in The Temple of Dullness (1745), Henry and Emma (1749) and Don Saverio (1750), but triumphantly in Thomas and Sally (1760). His opera Artaxerxes (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown opera seria in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Arne {{played a major role in}} moving the ballad opera into a more pastoral form, together with Isaac Bickerstaffe producing <b>Love</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Village (1763) using more original music that imitated, rather than reproduced, existing ballads. It was followed by other works like William Shield's Rosina (1781). Although the form declined in popularity towards the end of the eighteenth century, it was maintained into the nineteenth century by figures such as Charles Dibdin and his family and its influence can be seen in light operas like those of Gilbert and Sullivan's, particularly their early works like The Sorcerer (1877).|$|E
