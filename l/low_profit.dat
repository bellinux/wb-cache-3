5|$|The Imme R100 was a {{lightweight}} motorcycle made by Riedel AG from 1948 to 1951. It is {{noted for its}} simple and innovative design with many advanced features. With low cost and technical innovation, the R100 sold well, but reliability problems and <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> margins resulted in warranty costs driving Riedel AG into bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|The Imme R100's light weight, {{relatively}} powerful engine, {{and long}} travel suspension made it popular in motorsport; this, along with good marketing and low pricing, led to strong sales. The management of Riedel AG expected high sales volume {{to offset the}} <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> margin. A basic Imme sold for 775 Deutschmark without battery, tachometer, or centre stand. Passenger accommodation was an optional extra, as was a spare wheel. Initially, Immes were all painted oxide red.|$|E

This situation {{was created by the}} Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> margin for local films.

5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies {{had been made by}} the American-educated Chinese-Indonesian director The Teng Chun. His low budget but popular films were mainly inspired by Chinese mythology or martial arts, and although aimed at ethnic Chinese proved popular among native audiences because of their action sequences. The Teng Chun's dominance was an effect of the Great Depression and changing market trends. The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices, ensuring that there was a very <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> margin for local films. As a result, cinemas in the colony mainly showed Hollywood productions, while the domestic industry decayed. The Teng Chun was able to continue his work only because his films often played to full theatres.|$|E

5000|$|Severe {{economic}} recessions—called [...] "panics"—struck {{the nation}} in the Panic of 1873 and the Panic of 1893.

25|$|After nearly {{achieving}} {{agricultural self-sufficiency}} in the 1960s, Iran {{reached the point}} in 1979 where 65 percent of its food had to be imported. Declining productivity was blamed {{on the use of}} modern fertilizers, which had inadvertently scorched the thin Iranian soil. Unresolved land reform issues, a lack of economic incentives to raise surplus crops, and <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> ratios combined to drive increasingly large segments of the farm population into urban areas.|$|E
25|$|The South China Morning Post {{reports the}} rise in the use of ketamine, easy to mass-produce in illicit labs in {{southern}} China, particularly among the young. Because of its low cost, and <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> margin, drug peddlers rely on mass distribution to make money, thus increasing its penetrative power to all, including schoolchildren. The journal cites social workers saying that four people can get high by sharing just HK$20 worth of ketamine, and estimates 80 per cent of young drug addicts take 'K'.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Green Party {{candidate}} for the London mayoral election, Siân Berry, proposed the closure and redevelopment of London City airport, citing a number of reasons, including relatively <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> from such {{a large amount of}} land, high demand for housing in Greater London and the high levels of pollution generated.

25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{vaccines}} were a product with <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> margins, {{and the number}} of companies involved in vaccine manufacture declined. In addition to low profits and liability risks, manufacturers complained about low prices paid for vaccines by the CDC and other US government agencies. In the early 21st century, the vaccine market greatly improved with the approval of the vaccine Prevnar, along with a small number of other high-priced blockbuster vaccines, such as Gardasil and Pediarix, which each had sales revenues of over $1 billion in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Dell did not {{emphasize}} the consumer market, {{due to the}} higher costs and unacceptably <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch. While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> {{margins and}} an {{increase}} in vaccine-related lawsuits led many manufacturers to stop producing the DPT vaccine by the early 1980s. In 1982, the television documentary DPT: Vaccine Roulette depicted the lives of children whose severe disabilities were incorrectly blamed on the DPT vaccine by reporter Lea Thompson. The ensuing negative publicity led to many lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers. By 1985, vaccine manufacturers had difficulty obtaining liability insurance. The price of DPT vaccine skyrocketed, leading providers to curtail purchases, limiting availability. Only one manufacturer remained in the US by the end of 1985. To correct the situation, Congress in 1986 passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which established a federal no-fault system to compensate victims of injury caused by mandated vaccines. The majority of claims that have been filed through the NCVIA have been related to injuries allegedly caused by the whole-cell DPT vaccine.|$|E

25|$|The tonnage of the {{returning}} ships rose by 125 percent in this period. However, the Company's {{revenues from the}} sale of goods landed in Europe rose by only 78 percent. This reflects the basic change in the VOC's circumstances that had occurred: it now operated in new markets for goods with an elastic demand, in which it had to compete on an equal footing with other suppliers. This made for <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> margins. Unfortunately, the business information systems of the time made this difficult to discern for the managers of the company, which may partly explain the mistakes they made from hindsight. This lack of information might have been counteracted (as in earlier times in the VOC's history) by the business acumen of the directors. Unfortunately by this time these were almost exclusively recruited from the political regent class, which had long since lost its close relationship with merchant circles.|$|E
500|$|Sapphires {{from these}} three sites are {{routinely}} heat-treated to enhance color. While millions of carats of sapphires have been mined from the Missouri River deposits, {{there has been}} little commercial activity there since the 1990s because of the high cost of recovery and environmental concerns.

The Rock Creek area, also known as Gem Mountain, continues to be the most productive site in Montana, even more so than Yogo Gulch, producing over [...] of sapphires since its inception in 1906. Other than Yogo, Montana sapphire mines have been less successful because they have few blue sapphires and non-blue sapphires have <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> margins.|$|E

In addition, Golub has sued over the residential portion of the project, which was given to Freed. Golub claims to have accepted the office space part of the project at a <b>low</b> <b>profit</b> with the expectation of making a larger profit on the residential portion. However, a court ruling has paved the way for Mills to terminate its contract with Chicago-based Golub & Co. to develop the project’s two residential towers and to sell the residential portion of the Block 37 project in the Loop to developer Joseph A.

Profit levels might therefore have been maintained if the increase in the scale of trading operations that in fact took place had resulted in economies of scale. However, though larger ships transported the growing volume of goods, labour productivity did not go up sufficiently to realise these. In general the Company's overhead rose in step with the growth in trade volume; declining gross margins translated directly into a decline in profitability of the invested capital.
