40|$|Advanced {{programming}} languages such as Standard ML {{have rarely}} {{been used for}} systems programming tasks such as operating systems and network communications. In order to understand more fully the requirements of systems programming, we have implemented a suite of industry-standard network communication protocols in a completely type-safe extension of Standard ML. While the implementation has only recently become operational, we already observe acceptable communications throughput. We make careful use of the Standard ML modules system, with the core component of the implementation being a signature which is generic to all communications protocols. This generic protocol is then specialized for specific protocols, and these are implemented by functors parameterized by generic protocols. This leads naturally to a <b>layered</b> <b>system</b> <b>structure</b> and also provides an important and useful "mix-and-match" capability in composing protocols into complex networking systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{constructed}} the electron density distribution from the x-ray diffraction of {{a phase of}} phospholipid that exhibited rhombohedral symmetry. To determine the phases of the diffraction amplitudes, we first extended the well-known one-dimensional swelling method for planar bilayers to a three-dimensional method applicable to a <b>layered</b> <b>system</b> containing in-plane <b>structures,</b> such as rhombohedral structures. The complete phase determination was accomplished {{by a combination of}} the swelling method and Luzzati’s pattern recognition method. The constructed electron density distribution showed that in each unit cell, two apposed monolayers merged across the water layer and developed into an hourglass structure consistent with a postulated membrane fusion intermediate state called a stalk. The observation of the stalk structure lends a strong support to the stalk hypothesis for membrane fusion and opens a way to measure the structural parameters in the fusion pathway...|$|R

Describing this organizational approach Stephen Bezan remarked: “the individual sounds manipulated by Parkins seem to interact and influence {{the outcome of the}} other, crafting a goal-oriented structure based on timbre, not harmony or rhythm. This approach transcends the inherent cacophony of the material and reveals a genuinely organic, even playful quality to her work.” Parkins has described her Rube Goldberg approach as a means for examining slippages between object and meaning. She observed: “An important conceptual thread running through these pieces is the discovery and expression of metaphors for the slippage and tension between object and meaning that occurs through the passage of time.” Describing her intentions, Parkins noted: “As both a sonic and visual artist, I try to build and <b>layer</b> idiosyncratic <b>systems</b> and <b>structures</b> that point to these shifts in meaning.” ...|$|R

40|$|Profiles of {{dissolved}} and particulate 234 Th {{were determined}} at the VERTEX 2 and 3 stations off Manzanillo, Mexico, {{and at the}} VERTEX 4 station about 900 km north of Hawaii. By modeling the disequilibria between 234 Th and 238 U in the dissolved and particulate form, estimates of scav-enging rates for Th from the dissolved to particulate phases, particle residence times, and the flux of Th via particle removal can be obtained. 234 Th: 238 U activity ratio profiles indicate that the euphotic zone can be separated into two layers: An upper oligotrophic layer characterized by low new production values, low net scavenging, and long dissolved 234 Th residence times; and a sub-surface eutrophic layer with higher new production values, more intense scavenging, and shorter dissolved 234 Th residence times. New production, rather than total primary production may determine net scavenging rates of reactive elements from oceanic surface waters. These results contribute to the emerging descriptions of the layered structure of oligotrophic euphotic zones and {{support the notion that}} this may be a general and ubiquitous feature of global stratified oligotrophic regimes.

40|$|Microspatially offset Raman {{spectroscopy}} (micro-SORS) {{has been}} proposed as a valuable approach to sample molecular information from layers that are covered by a turbid (nontransparent) layer. However, when large magnifications are involved, the approach is not straightforward, as spatial constraints exist to position the laser beam and the objective lens with the external beam delivery or, with internal beam delivery, the maximum spatial offset achievable is restricted. To overcome these limitations, we propose here a prototype of a new micro-SORS sensor, which uses bare glass fibers to transfer the laser radiation to the sample and to collect the Raman signal from a spatially offset zone to the Raman spectrometer. The concept also renders itself amenable to remote delivery and to the miniaturization of the probe head which could be beneficial for special applications, e. g., where access to sample areas is restricted. The basic applicability of this approach was demonstrated by studying several <b>layered</b> <b>structure</b> <b>systems.</b> Apart from proving the feasibility of the technique, also, practical aspects {{of the use of}} the prototype sensor are discussed...|$|R
