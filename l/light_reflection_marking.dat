5000|$|<b>Light</b> <b>Reflection</b> - {{the main}} goal of {{anti-reflective}} coatings {{is to reduce the}} <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> that causes the so-called glare. Therefore, the lower the <b>light</b> <b>reflection,</b> the less glare reaches the viewer. The best anti-reflective products available for the picture framing market have <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> of 0.5%. The seemingly small differences in <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> are actually very important due to the logarithmic response of human eyes to signal intensity (Weber's law). In other words, under normal lighting conditions, the human eye perception of the intensity of a reflected light source in a 1% reflecting glass surface will be perceived as more than twice of the same light source in 0.5% reflecting glass.|$|R
40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>reflection</b> of {{materials}} depends on many factors, mainly on their colour and type, angle of light incidence and surface structure. This paper {{is focused on}} evaluation of the surface shape influence of expanded polyvinylchloride on <b>light</b> <b>reflection.</b> For this reason polyvinylchloride samples with different shapes, depths, widths and numbers of surface grooves were produced on CNC milling machine. The <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> of the investigated material samples was experimentally measured by means of illuminance ratio. The samples were subsequently compared {{in terms of their}} ability to reflect light. A part of the work deals with mathematical simulation of the daylight factor for definite surface shapes. The simulations were performed using Wdls 4. 1 software. It was found that the surface shape has an influence on the <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> and on the illuminance in a given point too. The <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> of the tested material is in general influenced by shape, depth, width and number of surface unevenesses. © 2014. Published by Manufacturing Technology...|$|R

The <b>light</b> blockage model is based on wall-mounted sensors, and results in 3 D volumes. The <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> model is based on ceiling-mounted sensors, and results in 2 D maps (projections onto the floor plane).|$|R

50|$|Like a {{full-size}} CD player, a portable CD player reads the bumps and grooves using a laser. With its photocell (a device that detects {{any sort of}} <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> given off of certain area), it determines {{whether there is a}} <b>reflection</b> of <b>light</b> given off from the CD when the laser hits. Depending on the <b>light</b> <b>reflection,</b> the photocell will return a 1 (if there is no reflection) or a 0 (if there is any <b>light</b> <b>reflection).</b> When its laser hits a groove on a CD, it will not reflect any light, making it a 1. When its laser hits a bump or any other surface on the CD, a <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> will appear making it a 0. The series of data from 0-1 on the CD is then transformed by a digital to analog converter, to recreate the shape of a sound wave. The headphones then amplify the sounds and then the audio is now able to be heard.|$|R

40|$|Recently, image {{analysis}} techniques in monitoring non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) migration have been gaining attention from researchers. Over {{the last two}} decades, photographic methods such as <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> and <b>light</b> transmission methods {{have been shown to}} be applicable and effective tools for characterization and measuring NAPL migration. A review of recent studies published on <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> and <b>light</b> transmission methods used in NAPL migration is summarized and presented in this paper. Besides discussion on the research efforts, recommendations for future research in using <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> and <b>light</b> transmission methods are provided.

50|$|Light {{transmission}} (for this article, the perceivable {{visible spectrum}} between 390 nm and 750 nm is considered) through glass is diminished either by <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> or <b>light</b> absorption of the glazing material. The total light transferred through the glazing material (light transmission) {{is reduced by}} reflection and/or absorption. In art framing, <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> causes glare, while light absorption also may cause the transmitted colors to be dulled or distorted. While type of the glass substrate will affect the light absorption of the glazing, the surface treatment can affect <b>light</b> scattering, <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> and in some cases, light absorption. There are various glazing options {{to achieve this goal}} as explained in the following sections on Types of Picture Framing Glass.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> model for image synthesis based on experimental studies of surface gloss perception. To develop the model, we’ve conducted two experiments that explore {{the relationships between the}} physical parameters used to describe the reflectance properties of glossy surfaces and the perceptual dimensions of glossy appearance. In the first experiment we use multidimensional scaling techniques to reveal the dimensionality of gloss perception for simulated painted surfaces. In the second experiment we use magnitude estimation methods to place metrics on these dimensions that relate changes in apparent gloss to variations in surface reflectance properties. We use the results of these experiments to rewrite the parameters of a physically-based <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> model in perceptual terms. The result is a new psychophysically-based <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> model where the dimensions of the model are perceptually meaningful, and variations along the dimensions are perceptually uniform. We demonstrate that the model can facilitate describing surface gloss in graphics rendering applications. This work represents a new methodology for developing <b>light</b> <b>reflection</b> models for image synthesis...|$|R
