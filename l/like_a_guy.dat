500|$|Between 1996 and 2000, {{the lead}} monster and child went through radical changes {{as the story}} evolved. As the story {{continued}} to develop, the child varied in age and gender. Ultimately, the story team decided that a girl {{would be the best}} counterpart for a furry, [...] co-star. After a girl was settled upon, the character continued to undergo changes, at one point being from Ireland and at another time being an African-American character. Originally the character of the little girl, known as Mary, became a fearless seven-year-old who has been toughened by years of teasing and pranks from four older brothers. In stark contrast, Johnson is nervous about the possibility of losing his job after the boss at Monsters, Inc. announces a downsizing is on the way. He feels envious because another scarer, Ned (who later became Randall), is the company's top performer. Through various drafts, Johnson's occupation went back-and-forth from being a scarer and from working in another area of the company such as a janitor or a refinery worker, until his final incarnation as the best scarer at Monsters, Inc. Throughout development Pixar worried that having a main character whose main goal was to scare children would alienate audiences and make them not empathize with him. Docter would later describe that the team [...] "bent over backwards trying to create a story that still had monsters [...] " [...] while still solving the problem, A key moment came when the team decided [...] "Okay, he’s the BEST scarer there. He’s the star quarterback" [...] with Docter noting that before that moment [...] "design after design, we really didn’t know what he was about." [...] Disney noted to Pixar early on that they did not want the character to [...] "look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> in a suit." [...] To this end Johnson was originally planned to have tentacles for feet; however, this caused many problems in early animation tests. The idea was later largely rejected, as it was thought that audiences would be distracted by the tentacles. Mary's age also differed from draft to draft until the writers settled on the age of 3. [...] "We found that the younger she was, the more dependent she was on Sulley", Docter said.|$|E
2500|$|Bob Dylan {{wrote that}} [...] "When Johnson started singing, he seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> {{who could have}} sprung {{from the head of}} Zeus in full armor. I {{immediately}} differentiated between him and anyone else I had ever heard. The songs weren't customary blues songs. They were so utterly fluid. At first they went by quick, too quick to even get. They jumped all over the place in range and subject matter, short punchy verses that resulted in some panoramic story-fires of mankind blasting off the surface of this spinning piece of plastic." ...|$|E

Asuta is a good deal more masculine than Hazumu ever was, and thinking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy,</b> he had planned that even if Yasuna did turn Hazumu down that {{he would be able to}} take Hazumu out into town and have fun, in effect helping him dull the pain of getting rejected.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Disney Channel's commercial-segment, Disney 365, Selena Gomez discussed her interpretations of the songs on the soundtrack saying: [...] "Disappear {{is more of a}} romantic song.

2500|$|Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker {{considered}} Buscemi miscast as {{the central}} figure in the drama. [...] "Buscemi can’t play that kind of character; even {{at the age of}} fifty-two, he looks cagey and restless—not <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> at the top but like the guy who gets killed when he tries to knock off the guy at the top." [...] The review concludes [...] "Boardwalk Empire” is at great pains to give viewers a sense that they are there, and yet rarely did I feel engrossed in the show. Even if its point is to show you the ugly side of fun, Boardwalk Empire should be much more fun to watch." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, his {{propensity}} for throwing strikes and avoiding walks kept his pitch counts low. On July 2, 1997 {{he won a}} game against the New York Yankees, for example, with the numbers [...] "nine innings, three hits, no walks, eight strikeouts, one pickoff, one double play, 84 pitches ... two hours and nine minutes". Dodgers general manager Fred Claire admired Maddux's pitching consistency, saying [...] "It's almost <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> lining up a 60-foot-6-inch putt ... he is just so disciplined, so repetitive in his pitches." [...] Speaking about Maddux's accuracy, Orel Hershiser said, [...] "This guy can throw a ball in a teacup." [...] Baseball Hall of Famer Wade Boggs talked about facing Maddux: [...] "It seems like he's inside your mind with you. When he knows you're not going to swing, he throws a straight one. He sees into the future. It's like he has a crystal ball hidden inside his glove." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{inspiration}} for album's single [...] "Somewhere Down the Crazy River", Lanois commented, [...] "Robbie Robertson was describing {{what it was like}} to hang out in Arkansas with Levon Helm in his old neighbourhood. He was telling me about the hot nights and fishing with dynamite, and was asking someone for directions for someplace somewhere down the crazy river. ... I had presented him with this instrument that [...] Eno introduced me to called the Suzuki Omnichord, like an electric autoharp. He found a little chord sequence with it that was sweet and wonderful. As he was developing his chord sequence I recorded him and superimposed his storytelling, which I was secretly recording, on top. That was the birth of [...] 'Somewhere Down The Crazy River.' It's kind of <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> with a deep voice telling you about steaming nights in Arkansas." [...] This song is notable as Robertson's only solo hit in the UK, reaching number 15 on the UK singles chart. His follow-up single there, [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] (also from the album), reached number 95.|$|E

2500|$|... "Friday" [...] was {{revealed}} as YouTube's No. 1 video of 2011, with Black hosting a short video called [...] "YouTube Rewind" [...] in the year-end recap. Despite the over 167 million views {{during its first}} four months, prior to its temporary removal, [...] "Friday" [...] had amassed more than 3,190,000 [...] "dislikes". After the fallout with Ark Music Factory, Black started an independent record label named RB Records. She released a self-produced single titled [...] "My Moment" [...] on July 18, 2011, the first on her label, with an accompanying music video published to her YouTube channel the same day. In the video, director Morgan Lawley features real life footage of Black from {{both before and after}} her fame. In late October 2011, production began on the music video for Black's third single, [...] "Person of Interest". About the song, Black stated [...] "The basis of it is that it's a love song but it's not a love song. It's about almost teenage crushes – when you're not in love yet but you really <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> – which I'm really excited about because I don't think there are too many out like that. It's very much a dance type song. It will make you get up and dance and sing along in your car." [...] The single and its accompanying music video were released on November 15, 2011. Black released two more singles in 2012: [...] "Sing It" [...] in May, and [...] "In Your Words" [...] in November. Black was planning to release her debut album in late 2011, which she said would include [...] "a bunch of different kinds of stuff." [...] The album was being recorded at a studio belonging to music producer Charlton Pettus. However, the album was never released. Black was featured in an ABC Primetime Nightline: Celebrity Secrets special entitled Underage and Famous: Inside Child Stars' Lives.|$|E

I would address the servants in a lucid manner, pointing out to them that I had painted Master B.'s room and balked the paper, and taken Master B.'s bell away and balked the ringing, and if they could suppose that that confounded boy had lived and died, to clothe himself with no better behaviour than would most unquestionably have brought him and the sharpest particles of a birch-broom into close acquaintance in the present imperfect state of existence, could they also suppose a mere poor human being, such as I was, capable by those contemptible means of counteracting and limiting the powers of the disembodied spirits of the dead, or of any spirits?--I say I would become emphatic and cogent, not to say rather complacent, in such an address, when it would all go for nothing by reason of the Odd Girl's suddenly stiffening from the toes upward, and glaring among us like a parochial petrifaction.|$|E
