5|$|Montgomery {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Allied commanders and the German high command expected him to be present for any invasion of France. Clarke hoped Montgomery's apparent presence in Gibraltar and Africa would <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea that the Allies might be planning landings in southern France, as part of Operation Vendetta, rather than across the Channel. While in London, in February 1944, Clarke, the London Controlling Section and Ops (B) drafted Copperhead in support of Vendetta.|$|E
25|$|Various {{population}} genetics studies along with historians such as Gabriel Camps and Charles-André Julien <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{idea that the}} bulk of the gene pool of modern Northwest Africans, irrespective of linguistic group, is derived from the Berber populations of the pre-Islamic period.|$|E
25|$|Apparitional {{experiences}} {{would seem}} to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> importance of central factors, since they represent a form of quasi-perceptual experience in which the role of external stimuli is minimal or possibly non-existent, while the experience nevertheless continues to be phenomenologically indistinguishable from normal perception, {{at least in some}} cases.|$|E

25|$|Pynson {{is often}} {{considered}} a more accomplished stylist than Caxton; he favored a dialect of English called Chancery Standard {{and contributed to}} the standardization of early Modern English. Pynson's usage of devices, title-pages, types, and other technical aspects <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> common image of him as a highly skilled craftsman and capable businessman who invented nothing but was quite good at improving upon innovations others had made before.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{scholars}} {{feel that the}} dating of Thomas rightfully belongs no later than 200CE B. Grenfell and A. Hunt placed the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus1, {{one of the oldest}} copies of the Gospel of Thomas, in this period. It is not the autograph copy and therefore, must have existed earlier than 200ce. Additionally, an investigation of the text provides internal evidence that suggests a date of authorship to be the beginning of the 2ndCentury. This timeframe would fit well with the time of the Synoptic Gospels and <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea that Thomas may have been written around the time of Q.|$|E
25|$|Nor may the Essenes be classed {{among the}} order of ascetics. While some of their institutions, notably celibacy, appear to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theory that would class them as such, their {{fundamental}} doctrines show no connection with the pessimism that is the essential factor in Asceticism. They were political indifferentists; they were but little, if at all, under the sway of national aspirations. They stood for a universal fellowship of the pure and just. They set but little store by the goods of this earth, and were members of a communistic fraternity. But it is inadmissible to construe from these elements of their hopes and habits the inference that in them {{is to be found}} a genuine Jewish order of monks and ascetics.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of Italy, the original contracting {{party of the}} 1932 border protocol, stated on 6 February 1996 that it considered the protocol valid, thus <b>lending</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greek position.|$|R

25|$|In 1919, {{the federal}} {{government}} launched a campaign to recolonize parts of the German interior including in Silesia, and new provisions for maternity were introduced. In February 1920, an industrial relations law was passed, giving workers in industry legally guaranteed representation, together {{with the right to}} co-determination in cases of hiring and firing, holiday arrangements, the fixing of working hours and regulations, and the introduction of new methods of payment. A Socialisation Law was also passed, while the government adopted guidelines on the workers' councils. In addition to workers' councils at national, regional, and factory level, the government made provision for economic councils in which employers and employees would work together on matters affecting {{the economy as a whole}} (such as nationalisation) and <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Weimar parliament.|$|E
25|$|Both of Montoto's {{children}} with Raverta {{went on to}} work in the group HIJOS in Mar del Plata. Fernanda studied at the University of Mar del Plata and became a social worker. She also became president of the Asociación Civil Sol de Mayo, an NGO created in 2007. Her relationship with her father is “almost nil.” His daughter Fernanda Raverta, who was born in November 1973 and who was three years old when her mother was kidnapped, served manager of the headquarters of ANSES (Administración Nacional de la Seguridad Social), Argentina's social-security administration, under the agency's executive director Diego Bossio. She lives in Mar del Plata and entered the Argentinian legislature in July 2011. She is also a “militant” member of La Cámpora, a political youth organization whose purpose has been to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> governments of Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.|$|E
25|$|In 244 BC, Hamilcar {{transferred}} {{his army}} at night by sea {{to a similar}} position {{on the slopes of}} Mt. Eryx (Monte San Giuliano), from which he was able to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> besieged garrison in the neighbouring town of Drepanum (Trapani). Hamilcar seized the town of Eryx, captured by the Romans in 249 BC, after destroying the Roman garrison, and positioned his army between the Roman forces stationed at the summit and their camp {{at the base of the}} mountain. Hamilcar removed the population to Drepana. Hamilcar continued his activities unhindered from his position for another two years, being supplied by road from Drepana, although Carthaginian ships had been withdrawn from Sicily by this time and no naval raids were launched. During one of the raids, when troops under a subordinate commander named “Boaster” engaged in plunder against the orders of Hamilcar and suffered severe casualties when the Romans caught up to them, Hamilcar requested a truce to bury his dead. Roman consul Fundanius (243/2 BC) arrogantly replied that Hamilcar should request a truce to save his living and denied the request. Hamilcar managed to inflict severe casualties on the Romans soon after, and when the Roman consul requested a truce to bury his dead, Hamilcar replied that his quarrel was with the living only and the dead had already settled their dues, and granted the truce.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{quantities}} {{appear in}} quantum mechanics {{in the form}} of expected values of observables, and as such the Ehrenfest theorem (which predicts the time evolution of <b>the</b> expected values) <b>lends</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> correspondence principle.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} Stocqueler in Australian newspapers seems <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> {{mention of his}} painting (coincidentally) of The Beehive, an area of canvas tenements on Camp Street, Bendigo, dated 1853, which <b>lends</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> emigration date.|$|R

2500|$|In East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism, rebirth is not instantaneous, {{and there}} is an {{intermediate}} state (Tibetan [...] "bardo") between one life and the next. The orthodox Theravada position rejects the wait, and asserts that rebirth of a being is immediate. However there are passages in the Samyutta Nikaya of the Pali Canon that seem to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea that the Buddha taught about an intermediate stage between one life and the next.|$|E
2500|$|Following a {{personal}} visit by Shach to the halachic decisors and leading rabbis, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, in Jerusalem to seek {{their support for}} the new party, they agreed to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new party. Schneerson's followers mobilized to support the Agudat Yisrael party. In the end, Agudat Yisrael secured nearly three times the amount of votes it had in 1984, and increased its Knesset representation from two seats to five, while Degel HaTorah only picked up two seats.|$|E

Artiocetus fossils represent intermediate forms between land-living ungulates and whales, <b>lending</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theory that whales and hippopotomi descended from a common ancestor.|$|R
50|$|Also, psalm 139:8 ("If I ascend up into Heaven, {{thou art}} there: if I make my {{bed in the}} Underworld, behold, thou art there.") <b>lends</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notion that people do not {{necessarily}} go to Hell because of suicide alone.|$|R
40|$|The {{empirical}} {{results in}} this paper show a negative and statistically significant relationship between inventory variability and price variability, thereby <b>lending</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contention that inventory adjustments help <b>to</b> smooth price. <b>The</b> implication is that inventories assist in coordination of oligopolistic agreements. ...|$|R
2500|$|Davitt {{resigned}} from the Commons again on 26 October 1899 with a prediction that no just cause could succeed there unless backed by massed agitation. Parliament alleviated this need by granting full democratic control of all local affairs, a form of [...] "grass roots home rule", to County and District Councils under the 1898 Local Government (Ireland) Act. Davitt then co-founded in 1898 together with William O'Brien the United Irish League and organised it in Mayo and beyond. In 1899 he left his seat in parliament for good in protest against the Boer War, visiting South Africa to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Boer cause. His experiences inspired his Boer fight for Freedom, published in 1902.|$|E
2500|$|The NBC History Files at the Library of Congress <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{notion that}} NBC was {{gradually}} groping {{for a way}} to differentiate the Red Network from the Blue Network. [...] For example, they contain a confidential memorandum, dated May 13, 1936, which sets forth a network policy against mixing the Red and Blue network stations. (Compare and contrast this with the way the Harry Lauder broadcast of 1929 was handled, above.) [...] There also exists an October 1938 sales force memorandum, which contains talking points on how to differentiate the Blue Network from the Red Network and CBS. Even as far back as December 1932, NBC had set forth a policy banning specific references not only to CBS, but even to the Red Network.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "colitas" [...] in {{the first}} stanza ("warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air") has been {{interpreted}} as a sexual slang or a reference to marijuana. [...] "Colitas" [...] means [...] "little tails" [...] in Spanish; in Mexican slang it refers to buds of the cannabis (marijuana) plant. According to Glenn Frey, the [...] "warm smell" [...] is [...] "colitas...it means little tails, {{the very top of}} the plant." [...] The Eagles' manager Irving Azoff appears to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marijuana hypothesis, however, Felder said: [...] "The colitas is a plant that grows in the desert that blooms at night, and it has this kind of pungent, almost funky smell. Don Henley came up with a lot of the lyrics for that song, and he came up with colitas." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the U.S., [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] {{was issued}} as the album's first single, with an {{accompanying}} music video. Initially, the album and single lingered {{for almost a}} year without performing well, but when Geffen founder David Geffen was asked to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band, he obliged, personally convincing MTV executives to play [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] during the network's after-hours rotation. Even though the video was initially only played once at 4 a.m. on a Sunday, heavy metal and hard rock fans took notice and soon began requesting the video and song en masse. The song, written in Seattle, was about Los Angeles. The music video took place in New York. According to Rose, the inspiration for the lyrics came from an encounter he and a friend had with a homeless man while they were coming out of a bus into New York. Trying to put a scare into the young runaways, the man yelled at them, [...] "You know where you are? You're in the jungle baby; you're gonna die!" [...] The song was featured in the 1988 Dirty Harry film The Dead Pool, starring Clint Eastwood, and members of the band had a cameo appearance in the film.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} tactics, the Takembeng women use their {{numbers and the}} social status accorded to older women {{in order to protect}} other protesters. In certain instances, the women use nudity and urinating and defecating in public as key aspects of their protest. Showing their vaginas or {{threatening}} to do so provide a unique power for the women and these tactics are quite effective in preventing troops or security forces from intervening in the protests. Historian Henry Kam Kah explains that [...] "The symbolisation in this threat of the vagina shows the central role of women in matters of procreation. Reverence for the vagina is reverence for the woman and her creator. A woman can lose all else but not her vagina which is representative of her entire womanhood. Women do not expose them carelessly and when this happens or threats are made to this effect, men take to their heels for they cannot abuse the part of the body that brought them to mother earth. In fact, in contemporary Cameroon, the Takembeng women of Mankon, Bamenda, used the vagina as a weapon to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Social Democratic Front (SDF) party and dispel the gun trotting [...] military men." [...] Similarly, Susan Diduk explains that “it is less that female nakedness affronts onlookers, and more that displaying female genitalia is a powerful act of moral censure embodying widely shared assumptions about mystical power and pollution.” These more direct forms of activism are not undertaken without great care being taken. Younger women are not included in these practices and are kept a good distance away from these demonstrations and soldiers and security forces are warned before they occur.|$|E

30|$|For {{the share}} of postcolonial {{migrants}} and migrant protest a negative relation is shown. While this statistical relationships <b>lends</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interpretation that migrants from former colonies protest less often along group boundaries because they form alliances with natives, it goes against the expectation typically made by POS theory that postcolonial migrants would protest more because of their better political opportunities relative to other migrants. Furthermore, a higher share of migrants in the industrial sector seems to be positively related with migrant protest, which <b>lends</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> division of labor hypothesis. However, without control for the time trend the coefficient remains insignificant (see below). Finally, unsurprisingly the more participants in migrants protest can be observed, the more migrants reside in a country.|$|R
