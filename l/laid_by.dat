5|$|There {{are several}} {{arguments}} behind {{an association of}} the chitinozoans with annelids or gastropods, {{and it is not}} impossible that the chitinozoans are a convergent phenomenon <b>laid</b> <b>by</b> both groups. In fact, the spirally coiled nature of chitinozoan chains has been used to suggest that they were <b>laid</b> <b>by</b> a spirally coiled organism, such as the gastropods; were this inference true, uncoiled chains could be to be attributed to the (straight) annelid worms or other organisms.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Dakar on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at Dakar, Cape Verde and Gibraltar; the Allies {{believed that this}} area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through. As such, the Brazilian unit's mission was to patrol for mines <b>laid</b> <b>by</b> German minelaying submarines {{and to make sure}} that convoys passing through would be safe. Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul had problems with their condensers, a matter which was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources such}} as the Manchester Mercury name Byrom as the sponsor of the building, they do not identify his architect. The church was described by the English author and historian Clare Hartwell as being the first significant building in Manchester to be constructed in the Gothic Revival style of architecture. It had galleries supported by slender cast-iron columns. The foundation stone was <b>laid</b> <b>by</b> Edward Byrom on 28 April 1768 and Keene performed the consecration on 7 July 1769, when the sermon was given by John Byrom's friend, John Clayton. Construction of the tower, which contained a peal of eight bells manufactured by Lester and Pack, was completed in May 1770.|$|E

5|$|Appeals to nonviolent {{resistance}} were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, {{a recently}} appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County. A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson's attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered. Because {{of these and}} other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the American Revolution. Supporters of the excise argued that there was a difference between taxation without representation in colonial America, and a tax <b>laid</b> <b>by</b> the elected representatives of the American people.|$|E
5|$|At 05:10, four German torpedo boats {{reached the}} Eastern Task Force and {{launched}} fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Svenner off Sword beach but missing the battleships HMS Warspite and Ramillies. After attacking, the German vessels {{turned away and}} fled east into a smoke screen that had been <b>laid</b> <b>by</b> the RAF to shield the fleet from the long-range battery at Le Havre. Allied losses to mines included USS Corry off Utah and USS PC-1261, a 173-foot patrol craft. In addition, many landing craft were lost.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} 23 August 1774. The Prince of Wales {{was invited to}} lay the first stone but declined, and so the stone was <b>laid</b> <b>by</b> {{commission}} member Henry Hobart. The bridge opened to pedestrians in September 1776 and to other traffic on 12 January 1777, at which time the ferry service was closed, although work on the bridge was not completed until December 1777. A large milestone was placed at the Richmond end, giving the distances to other bridges and to local towns.|$|E

5|$|During the American {{participation}} in World War I, the Connecticut-class ships {{were used to}} train sailors for an expanding wartime fleet. In late 1918, they began to escort convoys to Europe, and in September that year, Minnesota was badly damaged by a mine <b>laid</b> <b>by</b> a German U-boat. After the war, {{they were used to}} bring American soldiers back from France and later as training ships. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated major reductions in naval weapons, cut the ships' careers short. Within two years, all six ships had been sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|From late 1918, {{the ships}} {{were used to}} escort convoys part-way across the Atlantic. In late September, Minnesota struck a naval mine <b>laid</b> <b>by</b> the German U-boat U-117, causing serious damage that kept her out of service for five months. Convoy duty was cut short by the German {{surrender}} in November; thereafter, the Connecticuts were used to ferry American soldiers back from the battlefields of France. This work was completed by mid-1919. The ships briefly operated as training ships in the early 1920s, though {{under the terms of}} the Washington Naval Treaty, they were all sold for scrap by 1924 and broken up.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Oliver Butterworth {{authored}} a children's book, The Enormous Egg.

The dinosaur, named Uncle Beazley, becomes too big, so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.|$|E
