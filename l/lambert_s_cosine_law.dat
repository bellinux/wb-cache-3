40|$|We {{present a}} {{generalisation}} of surface photometry to the higher-order {{moments of the}} line-of-sight velocity distribution of galaxies observed with integral-field spectrographs. The generalisation follows the approach of surface photometry by determining the best fitting ellipses along which the profiles of the moments can be extracted and analysed by means of harmonic expansion. The assumption for the odd moments (e. g. mean velocity) is that the profile along an ellipse satisfies a simple <b>cosine</b> <b>law.</b> The assumption for the even moments (e. g velocity dispersion) is that the profile is constant, as it is used in surface photometry. We find that velocity profiles extracted along ellipses of early-type galaxies are well represented by the simple <b>cosine</b> <b>law</b> (with 2 % accuracy), while possible deviations are carried in the fifth harmonic term which is sensitive {{to the existence of}} multiple kinematic components, and has some analogy to the shape parameter of photometry. We compare the properties of the kinematic and photometric ellipses and find that they are often very similar. Finally, we offer a characterisation of the main velocity structures based only on the kinemetric parameters which can be used to quantify the features in velocity maps (abridged) ...|$|R
