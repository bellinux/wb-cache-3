40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether calcium potentiates acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) -induced toxicity. Elevated calcium levels were induced in mice by pre-treatment with cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3; V. D 3), a compound that has previously been shown to induce hypercalcemia in human and animal models. As seen previously, mice injected with CCl 4 exhibited increased plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine; transient body weight loss; and increased lipid peroxidation along with decreased total antioxidant power, glutathione, ATP, and NADPH. Pre-treatment of these animals with V. D 3 caused further elevation of the values of these liver functional markers without altering kidney functional markers; continued weight loss; a lower <b>lethal</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> of CCl 4; and enhanced effects on lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant power. In contrast, exposure to V. D 3 alone had no effect on plasma markers of liver or kidney damage or on total antioxidant power or lipid peroxidation. The potentiating effect of V. D 3 was positively correlated with elevation of hepatic calcium levels. Furthermore, direct injection of CaCl 2 also enhanced CCl 4 -induced hepatic injury. Since CaCl 2 induced hypercalcemia transiently (within 3 h of injection), our results suggest that calcium enhances the CCl 4 -induced hepatotoxicity at an early stage via potentiation of oxidative stress...|$|E

Potentially, these lamps {{may be used}} in bacterial disinfection or in minor cosmetic procedures, but safety tests are necessary. For this purpose, cellular damage induced by the UV radiation is assessed. 3 T 3 mouse fibroblasts are used as a model system.

Exposures ranging up to 30 kR were given with 300 kVp X-rays and ⁶⁰Co gamma rays. Half of the newts were injected (I. P.) with 15 g DMSO/kg (the maximum sublethal dose) just before exposure. The remainder were irradiated without treatment. The mean survival time-exposure curves for both groups of animals were typically sigmoid. However, the mean survival times of the DMSO-treated newts were significantly longer for all exposures between 200 R and 15 kR. The <b>threshold</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> for the untreated newts was 200 R, while at exposures up to 600 R the DMSO-treated animals showed a mean survival time not significantly different from the fasting controls (370 days).

Additional studies revealed a linear relationship between the concentration of DMSO administered and the degree of radioprotection afforded and demonstrated clearly that DMSO must be administered prior to irradiation to be protective. Marked changes in the physiological status of the DMSO-treated newts were observed which may partially account for their reduced radiosensitivity. DMSO-treated newts showed a decreased metabolic rate during the early post-injection period.

The effects of dose and follicle culture duration were examined. At the <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> (that required to produce antra) and at one subthreshold dose, the major difference be-tween the two isoform fractions was the timing and effectiveness of acquisition of two-cell embryonic developmental capacity. With the least-acidic fraction, {{the highest rate of}} two-cell de-velopment (ø 80 %) occurred after 3 days of follicle culture only at the <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> (2. 5 ng/ml). With the acid fraction, the highest two-cell rate (ø 60 %) occurred after 5 days of culture but at equivalent rates over a range of doses between 10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml (<b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> was 50 ng/ml).

The concepts maximum acceptable dose (MAD) and its improvement, maximum tolerable dose (MTD), were developed for estimation of <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> for avoidance of UVR-induced cataract. The present report details the results of our research investigating the impact of age, exposure time, and interexposure interval for double exposures on <b>threshold</b> <b>dose.</b> Methods: Lenses from female Sprague-Dawley outbred rats were exposed to UVR type B (UVR-B). The radiation from a high-pressure mercury arc lamp was collimated, passed through a water filter and a double monochromator (lambda(max) = 300 nm), and projected in vivo on the cornea or in vitro on the anterior surface of lens. One week after in vivo UVR-B exposure, extracted lenses were photographed and forward light scattering was measured. After in vitro UVR-B exposure, both exposed and nonexposed lenses were cultured. The intensity of forward light scattering was measured daily during week 1 and every second day during weeks 2 and 3. Morphologic changes were documented. Results: The MAD for 3 -week-old rats was almost 3 times lower than that for 18 -week-old rats (study I). Rats aged 18 to 60 weeks had a stable MTD of approximately 5 kJ/m 2 (study II). The data from rats aged 3 to 60 weeks were used to derive a general expression for <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> (MTD) as a function of rat life span. It was shown that MTD increases with increasing age in the first third of the life and then remains stable for the remaining two thirds of the life span. The study of lenses exposed in vitro to UVR-B proved that the sensitivity difference between young and old rats does not depend on age-related anatomic differences (study III). With varying exposure times (7. 5, 15, 30, 60, or 120 minutes), it was found that there was a lowest <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> at 15 minutes of UVR-B exposure (study IV). When varying intervals between 2 repeated exposures at a constant UVR-B dose, it was found that the 1 day interexposure interval was associated with a lower <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> than the interexposure intervals 6 hours, and 1, 3, 9, and 30 days (study V) ...|$|R

Concomitantly, the therapeutic window for levodopa narrowed and the levodopa dose-antiparkinsonian response slope increased. The antiparkinsonian <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> correlated best with duration of symptoms; the dyskinesia <b>threshold</b> <b>dose,</b> therapeutic window, and dose-response slope related most closely with the duration of levodopa treatment. The differing dose-response profiles for the antiparkinsonian and dyskinetic effects suggest involvement of separate pharmacological mechanisms. The present results, taken together with previous observations that the wearing-off phenomenon responds promptly to plasma levodopa stabilization while on-off fluctuations tend to diminish over several days, suggest that postsynaptic modifications, presumably at the receptor level, serve as the major determinant for the increasing difficulty with optimal dose adjustment and the motor fluctuations, especially of the on-off type, which complicate levodopa therapy of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease...|$|R

Furthermore, the <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> for E-selectin expression was 1 Gy, whereas the <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> for ICAM- 1 synthesis was 5 Gy of X-rays.

40|$|Abstract Backround Micrometastases of {{colorectal}} liver metastases {{are present}} in up to 50 % of lesions. In this study we sought to determine the <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> for local control of occult micrometastases in patients undergoing CT (computed tomography) -guided brachytherapy of colorectal liver metastases. Materials and methods Nineteen patients demonstrated 34 local tumor recurrences originating from micrometastases after CT-guided brachytherapy of 27 colorectal liver metastases. We considered a local tumor recurrence as originating from a micrometastasis if tumor regrowth occurred adjacent to a formerly irradiated lesion and {{the distance of the}} 3 D isocenter of the new lesion was ≤ 23. 5 mm from the previous tumor margin. Follow-up MRI was fused with the planning-CT and dosimetry data. Two reviewers independently indicated the dose exposure at the isocenter of the micrometastases. Statistical analysis included an analysis of variance (ANOVA) using backward selection. 95 % tolerance intervals with coverage of 87. 5 and 75 % of the data of the normal distribution were calculated. Results The median distance of the micrometastases to the margin of the originating colorectal metastases was 8. 75 mm (1 - 21 mm). Dose exposure at the isocenter was 12. 25 Gy (7 - 19. 8) in median. We stratified according to the distance from the isocenter to the initial tumor margin: ≤ 9 mm, > 9 - 15 mm and > 15 mm. The median dose in the according isocenters was 13. 18, 11. 6 and 11. 85 Gy. The <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> failing to prevent micrometastasis growth was sigificantly higher in a subgroup of lesions with ≤ 9 mm distance as compared to > 15 mm (13. 18 vs 11. 85 Gy). Adjuvant chemotherapy correlated with greater distance of micrometastasis growth to the tumor but not with the <b>threshold</b> <b>dose.</b> Conclusion To prevent loss of local tumor control by continuous growth of micrometastases a <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> of 15, 4 Gy (single fraction) should be delivered at a distance of 21 mm to the gross tumor margin. </p...|$|R
30|$|Protection of the gonads against {{diagnostic}} X-rays gained {{ground in}} the 1950 s [1 – 4]. Among the reasons were the increased radiation awareness caused by the genetic effects observed in irradiated fruit flies and the higher cancer incidence in the atomic bomb survivors.

40|$|CP- 47, 497 (cis- 3 -j 2 -hydroxy- 4 (1, 1 -dimethylheptyl) phenylj-cy-clohexan- 1 -ol) is {{characterized}} as a cannabimimetic agent, with 3 to 28 times greater potency than i 9 -tetrahydrocanna-binol 9 -THC), based on the following. In common with A 9 -THC and other active structures closely related chemically to THC, CP- 47, 497 exerts analgesic, motor depressant, anticon-vulsant and hypothermic effects. It elicits vocalization in pal-pated rats and ataxia in dogs. In drug discrimination studies in rats, the stimulus properties of 9 -THC (3. 2 mg/kg i. p.) are generalized to CP- 47, 497, with an absolute <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> 3 to 1 4 times lower than the <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> of i 9 -THC itself, depending on route. Furthermore, rats are unable to discrimi-nate between the stimulus properties of equated i. p. doses of 9 -THC and CR 47, 497 after prolonged training. Despite it...|$|R
40|$|In the eye, it {{has been}} {{previously}} reported that exposure to a cholinesterase inhibitor results in a reduced miotic response following prolonged exposure and a decreased miotic response to the cholinergic agonists. However, no studies exist that character-ize {{the effect of a}} single low-level vapor exposure to a nerve agent on parasympathetic function in the eye or determine the <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> for such an effect. The present study investigated the hypotheses that a single low-level exposure to soman vapor would result in dysfunction of the parasympathetic pathway mediating the pupillary light reflex resulting from a loss of muscarinic receptor function on the pupillary sphincter muscle. Adult male rats were exposed to soman vapor in a whole-body dynamic airflow exposure chamber. Rats exposed to low levels of soman vapor dose-dependently developed miosis (<b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> between 4. 1 and 6. 1 mg-min/m 3). Pupil size returned to preexposure level...|$|R
40|$|This {{review of}} the Nagasaki leukaemia {{experience}} {{during a period of}} 14 years after the detonation of the atomic bomb, together with comparisons with data from Hiroshima and from other series of post-radiation leukaemia cases, again demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt the leukaemogenic effect on man of ionizing radiation. An increased risk of leukaemia following doses probably as low as 100 rads (air-entry dose) of whole-body radiation is demonstrated {{on the basis of the}} available estimates of atomic bomb radiation doses. At doses above this level the increase in leukaemia incidence may be linearly related to the radiation dose. The data are too limited to allow of an evaluation of the risk represented by doses at the lower levels of radiation; but it seems clear that, if a <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> for leukaemia induction exists, it is lower than the <b>threshold</b> <b>dose</b> for the clinical expression of acute radiation syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The erythematogenic and melanogenic {{properties}} of polychromatic long-wave ultraviolet light (UV-A) has been re-examined. Redness appeared immediately after exposure and persisted for 24 hr with doses of about 50 Joules/cm 2. With <b>threshold</b> erythemal <b>doses,</b> about 13 J/cm 2, the redness faded {{after a few}} minutes. The response was not biphasic. Pigmentation also appeared immediately after exposure and faded rapidly with <b>threshold</b> <b>doses</b> of 4 J/cm 2. With larger doses (18 J/cm 2) immediate pigmentation gave way without fading to delayed pigmentation (true melanogenesis). Thus, the acute effects of UV-A, unlike other wavelengths within the UV-spectrum, are immediate and appear without latency. The responses are also most intense immediately after exposure...|$|R
