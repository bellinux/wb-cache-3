Sabo's CATACLYSM achieves a machinima verite style through displaying and recapturing the machinima video with a <b>low</b> <b>resolution</b> black and white hand-held video camera to produce a shaky camera effect. Other element of cinéma vérité, such as longer takes, sweeping camera transitions, and jump cuts may be included to complete the effect.|$|E

Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using Radiocarbon dating. Such methods can help to reconstruct Holocene sea levels.|$|E

The technique is experimentally quick, however, it requires forward modeling {{to calculate the}} material properties. The sensitivity of the feedpoint impedance to space discretisation is investigated using a full-wave BOR FDTD analysis. The <b>lowest</b> <b>resolution</b> mesh, yields Zin = 8. 56 −j 10. 6 at 1. 0 GHz, a mesh 4 times finer gives Zin = 8. 28 − j 9. 21.

Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot criticized the Dreamcast version for its limitations, {{such as the}} presentation of vector graphics on a <b>low</b> <b>resolution</b> television set, which obscures the copyright text in Asteroids. The arcade and Atari 2600 versions of Asteroids, along with Asteroids Deluxe, were included in Atari Anthology for both Xbox and PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} inconclusive, as {{three weeks of}} {{surveying}} in almost continuous bad weather during July and August 1980 failed to find Titanic. The problem was exacerbated by technological limitations; the Sea MARC sonar used by the expedition had a relatively <b>low</b> <b>resolution</b> and was a new and untested piece of equipment. It was nearly lost only 36 hours after it was first deployed when the tail was ripped off during a sharp turn, destroying the magnetometer, {{which would have been}} vital for detecting Titanics hull. Nonetheless it managed to survey an area of some 500 square nautical miles and identified 14 possible targets.|$|E
5|$|Very-high {{redshift}} objects (Lyman-break galaxies) {{cannot be}} seen in visible light and generally are detected in infrared or submillimetre wavelength surveys of the HDF instead. Observations with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) indicated infrared emission from 13 galaxies visible in the optical images, attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation. Infrared observations have also been made with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Submillimeter observations of the field have been made with SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, initially detecting 5 sources, although with very <b>low</b> <b>resolution.</b> Observations have also been made with the Subaru telescope in Hawaii.|$|E

40|$|Deep {{convolutional}} {{neural networks}} (ConvNets) have been recently shown to attain state-of-the-art performance for action recognition on standard-resolution videos.

Reliable action recognition using eLR cameras would address privacy concerns in various application environments such as private homes, hospitals, nursing/rehabilitation facilities, etc. In this paper, we propose a semi-coupled filter-sharing network that leverages high resolution (HR) videos during training in order to assist an eLR ConvNet. We also study methods for fusing spatial and temporal ConvNets customized for eLR videos in order to take advantage of appearance and motion information.

Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a <b>low</b> <b>resolution,</b> 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{released}} a Microsoft Windows port {{of the game}} in October 2014, where it was met with a more critical reception than the original versions. PC Gamers Samuel Roberts, when reviewing the port, criticized not only the original gameplay, but heavily criticized the quality of the port itself, decrying the <b>low</b> <b>resolution,</b> limited graphical options and low framerate. He was especially critical of the time taken for the port given that an unofficial patch was produced by modder Peter Thoman within a day of release that fixed many of the issues. Michael McWhertor of Polygon also noted a similar critical response by consumers. A patch was released by Square Enix in December 2014, which was noted by Thoman as adding only the graphical features that his external patch had, with no other additions or performance improvements.|$|E

In addition, the <b>low</b> <b>resolution</b> {{of the satellite}} imagery allows minor events, which do not make an impression on the satellite picture, to pass unnoticed. There are no seismic or geophysical instruments on the mountain (the nearest are in Nikolski), and some eruptions are first observed by pilots flying over the volcano. A field {{study was conducted in}} late 2001, and an automatic system based on thermal anomalies was implemented following eruptive events in 2005. In recent years the Alaska Volcano Observatory has made an effort to expand volcanic coverage westward along the Aleutian Arc.|$|E

25|$|Frescography is {{a method}} for reproduction/creation of murals using digital {{printing}} methods, invented in 1998 by Rainer Maria Latzke, and patented in 2000. The frescography is based on digitally cut-out motifs which are stored in a database. CAM software programs then allow to enter the measurements of a wall or ceiling to create a mural design with <b>low</b> <b>resolution</b> motifs. Since architectural elements such as beams, windows or doors can be integrated, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall mural. Once a design is finished, the <b>low</b> <b>resolution</b> motifs are converted into the original high resolution images and are printed on canvas by Wide-format printers.
