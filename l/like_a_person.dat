5|$|Having {{received}} Nintendo 64DD development kits {{that included}} the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, Iguana Entertainment added an optional high-resolution mode to the game {{early on in the}} development cycle. In conjunction with the Expansion Pak, this mode allows the game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels, a technical accomplishment for the Nintendo 64 at the time. An upgraded polygon modelling technique was used to give the game better-formed creatures. However, motion capture was avoided because none of game's enemies are human. Dienstbier felt that if their animations were motion captured, enemies would look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> pretending to be a lizard in a costume. The game features different animations for different creatures. Unlike its predecessor, where enemies have two types of death animations, Seeds of Evil includes a third and gorier one.|$|E

Tobey eventually goes out with her but is confused between her and Callie Rose.|$|E
25|$|During sleep, {{a person}} is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a {{sleeping}} person {{to a person who}} is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. When {{a person is}} asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who is influenced by strong feelings. Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|E

50|$|Whiteface {{is a form}} of {{performance}} in which <b>a</b> <b>person</b> wears theatrical makeup in order to make themselves look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> white <b>person,</b> usually for comic purposes. The term is a reversal of the more common form {{of performance}} known as blackface, in which performers use makeup in order to make themselves look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> black <b>person.</b> Whiteface performance originated in the 19th century, and today occasionally appears in cinema.|$|R

500|$|The final line recalls an old English saying: [...] "All his swans {{are turned}} to geese", meaning all his {{expectations}} end in nothing; all his boasting ends in smoke, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who fancies {{he sees a}} swan on a river but finds it {{to be only a}} goose. The phrase is sometimes reversed (as Moore has done): [...] "All his geese are swans", which was commonly applied to people who think too much of the beauty and talent of their children and derived from Aesop's fable [...] "The Eagle and the Owl".|$|E
500|$|Several {{different}} phenomena have lent {{credence to}} the idea that tornadoes [...] "skip" [...] houses, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> jumping over hurdles. Tornadoes vary in intensity along their path, sometimes drastically over a short period and distance. If a tornado was causing damage, then weakened {{to the point where it}} could cause no damage, followed by a re-intensification, it would appear as if it skipped a section. Occasionally with violent tornadoes, a smaller subvortex within a tornado will completely destroy a structure next to another building which appears almost unscathed and thus apparently skipped over.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the critics}} of McCarthy's {{approach}} were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like [...] "story understanding" [...] and [...] "object recognition" [...] that required a machine to think <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person.</b> In order to use ordinary concepts like [...] "chair" [...] or [...] "restaurant" [...] {{they had to make}} all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. Gerald Sussman observed that [...] "using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn't make them any more precise." [...] Schank described their [...] "anti-logic" [...] approaches as [...] "scruffy", as opposed to the [...] "neat" [...] paradigms used by McCarthy, Kowalski, Feigenbaum, Newell and Simon.|$|E

2500|$|Among certain Tanala communities, the Indri lemur (babakoto) is {{considered}} sacred and {{is protected by}} a range of fady. For instance, they cannot be killed or eaten, and if captured they must be set free; if they are found dead or inadvertently killed, they must be buried <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person.</b> [...] Pigs are also considered fady and Tanala people cannot have any contact with them, a taboo most likely originating in Islamic influences.|$|E
2500|$|In general, European French {{speakers}} have {{no problems}} understanding Quebec newscasts or other moderately formal Québécois speech. However, they may have some difficulty understanding informal speech, such as the dialogue in a sitcom. This is due more to slang, idioms, vocabulary and use of exclusive cultural references than to accent or pronunciation. However, when speaking to a European French speaker, a more rural French speaker from Quebec is capable of shifting to a slightly more formal, [...] "international" [...] type of speech by avoiding idioms or slang, much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> from the southern U.S. would do when speaking with a speaker of British English.|$|E

2500|$|The student {{newspaper}} reporter commented on Botkin's [...] "unorthodox" [...] beliefs regarding sexual relations {{between men and}} women. Botkin {{believed that it was}} inappropriate for a man to react to his wife's affair with the rage that was expected by society: [...] "A woman falls in love with another man. All that is necessary is to let her have her fling. After that she is often a better wife and mother. It is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who loves to play Bach and suddenly wants to play Beethoven." [...] One historian commented that Botkin's church [...] "was a curious faith, to be sure," [...] but [...] "the Church of Aphrodite was not nearly so wanton as it sounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{boundary}} between the two species Mandragora autumnalis and Mandragora officinarum varies among authors, with some regarding them as the same species (see § Taxonomy below). Whatever distinction is used, plants of M.autumnalis are herbaceous perennials, with a large upright tap-root, often branched and sometimes shaped somewhat <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person.</b> There {{is little or no}} stem, the leaves being borne in a basal rosette up to [...] across. The flowers are clustered at the centre of the rosette, each with five sepals, five petals and five stamens. Both the sepals and petals are fused at the base forming two five-lobed bell-shaped cups. The ovary has two chambers (locules) and a long style. The fruit is a fleshy berry with many seeds.|$|E
2500|$|Prayer plays a {{significant}} role among many believers. Muslims believe that the purpose of existence is to worship God. He is viewed as a personal God and there are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God. Prayer often also includes supplication and asking forgiveness. God is often believed to be forgiving. For example, a hadith states God would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked repentance. Christian theologian Alister McGrath writes that there are good reasons to suggest that a [...] "personal god" [...] is integral to the Christian outlook, but that one has to understand it is an analogy. [...] "To say that God is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> is to affirm the divine ability and willingness to relate to others. This does not imply that God is human, or located at a specific point in the universe." ...|$|E
50|$|The word usually connotes {{something}} wrong or evil; a monster is generally morally objectionable, physically or psychologically hideous, or a freak of nature.

2500|$|As a teenager, Earl Hooker (a {{cousin of}} John Lee Hooker) sought out Nighthawk as his teacher {{and in the}} late 1940s, the two toured the South extensively. Nighthawk had a lasting impact on Hooker's playing; however, {{by the time of}} his 1953 {{recording}} of [...] "Sweet Angel" [...] (a tribute of sorts to Nighthawk's [...] "Sweet Little Angel"), [...] "Hooker had by now transcended his teacher", according to biographer Sebastian Danchin. Danchin also notes that his solos had an uncanny resemblance to the human singing voice and music writer Andy Grigg commented: [...] "He had the uncanny ability to make his guitar weep, moan and talk just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person...</b> his slide playing was peerless, even exceeding his mentor, Robert Nighthawk." [...] The vocal approach is heard in Hooker's instrumental [...] "Blue Guitar", which was later overdubbed with a unison vocal by Muddy Waters and became [...] "You Shook Me". Unusual for a blues player, in the 1960s, Hooker explored using a wah-wah pedal to further emulate the voice.|$|E
2500|$|The spell is {{explained}} as a complicated memory-altering magic. But {{it is not}} as simple as erasing the memory of everyone directly, as this is merely Subtractive Magic. Also, simply attempting to erase the memory because it uses Subtractive Magic, has a strong probability of destroying portions of the mind, thus killing the subject. A death spell, can for instance, make it seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> is dead, but everyone still remembers the person existed. [...] Also, if you tried to erase the knowledge of even a simple person like a woodcutter, the nature of reality would be such that all too obvious gaps in memory would be noticed, such as how the woodcutter's wife got her food and wood if she were crippled. For this reason, some wizards came up with a workaround, using some energy to warp reality itself or at least human perception of it. [...] False memories are automatically created to fill the gaps in reality, almost as if someone went back in time and changed them.|$|E
2500|$|On May 3, 1939, Asimov {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Queens (New York) Science Fiction Society where he met Ernest and Otto Binder who had recently published a short story [...] "I, Robot" [...] featuring a sympathetic robot named Adam Link who was misunderstood and motivated by love and honor. (This was {{the first of a series}} of ten stories; the next year [...] "Adam Link's Vengeance" [...] (1940) featured Adam thinking [...] "A robot must never kill a human, of his own free will.") Asimov admired the story. Three days later Asimov began writing [...] "my own story of a sympathetic and noble robot", his 14th story. Thirteen days later he took [...] "Robbie" [...] to John W. Campbell the editor of Astounding Science-Fiction. Campbell rejected it claiming that it bore too strong a resemblance to Lester del Rey's [...] "Helen O'Loy", published in December 1938; the story of a robot that is so much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> that she falls in love with her creator and becomes his ideal wife.

2500|$|... 11 bullets is a {{very bad}} cricket team of North Kolkata. The team is formed {{with the people of}} the {{locality}}, who have various professions. The film starts with a match between 11 bullets and a cricket team of South Kolkata. The hero, named Abir, alone smashes 11 bullets. The team members of 11 bullets are then abused by the people of their locality. In the meantime, Abir comes with his family to stay at Dorjipara, which is the locality of 11 bullets. But, due to huge cultural deference between North Kolkata and South Kolkata, Abir becomes irritated to stay over there. The niece of the landlord of Abir's tenant house, stars having regular quarrels with Abir. Then one day, Abir comes to know that some political leader is trying to grab Dorjipara, and for that, the leader wants the tenant house, which the landlord doesn't want to sell. When Abir teaches the 11 bullets people, that without protesting against these political evils, {{they will not be able}} to survive, slowly, those people come close to Abir, and vice versa. Then slowly, Abir gets intimate with Rani, which her brother Rajat doesn't <b>like.</b> <b>A</b> <b>Person,</b> Shankar, who is attached to that leader comes and gets involved with the unmarried, frustrated, elder sister of Rani, named Ratna. But, when Shankar says that, he wants to marry Rani, and not Ratna. Then Ratna commits suicide. Ultimately, when the party leaders come to take control over Dorjipara, Abir throws a challenge of a cricket match, which is going to decide, who's going to get control over the house. 11 bullets get a tensed and marvelous win, and Abir gets a romantic win over Rani.|$|E
