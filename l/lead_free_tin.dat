40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on Dr. Taguchi’s Robust Engineering methodology, {{measurement}} methods and experimental results for the optimization of a <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> SMT process for use in an Automotive Electronics application. The key strategy is to find process parameters that make the process insensitive to noise factors. Traditional optimization approaches focus on maximizing the response variable while the Robust approach focuses on consistent results regardless of variation in noise factors. The Robust method was utilized {{in the development of}} a <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> process for manufacturing an Automotive SMT product. Major factors that can create variation in a <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> process were identified, including <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> solder paste brand, paste print speed, oven reflow temperatures and times, and reflow environment. Several noise factors were studied including volume of solder paste, location of components on the board, and lead frame plating materials, namely tin and palladium/nickel/gold. A series of measurements were made on the <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> product that assessed the strength and reliability of <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> solder joints, measurements such as visual scoring, cross-section, surface insulation resistance, and pull strength. Using the Robust experimental design, these measurements were optimized to create high quality and reliable <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> SMT solder joints that were the most insensitive to the noise. In essence, quality was increased by using variable measurements rather than by counting attributes (good/bad). Overall, a gain of 2. 1 dB was realized. In Robust terms, this equates to reducing variation in the <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> process by ~ 22 %. This study also revealed which of the processing factors were most significant in controlling the <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> process. The results of this study and the use of Robust Engineering methodology provide a means for developing a full range of <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> technology, components and products used on Automotive Electronics...|$|R

The adverse effect of lead on {{human health and the}} environment has led the manufacturing sector to focus on sustainable manufacturing of <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> brass, as well as how to maintain control of the surface integrity when substituting the lead content in the brass with silicon.

It is important to study the topographical characteristics of the brass samples which are the intermediate link between the manufacturing process variables and the functional behaviour of the surface. To numerically evaluate the sample's surface topography and to validate the measurements for a significant study, a general statistical methodology is implemented.

40|$|Saab Microwave Systems, SMW is a {{supplier}} of radar systems. The circuit boards that are operating in their radars have components which solder joints contains lead. However, the EU directive RoHs and WEEE are causing SMW {{to prepare for}} a transition to <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> solder joints. The objective of this thesis is to gain deeper knowledge of <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> solder joints. Brittle fractures in solder joints is a type of failure that might increase in a transition to <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> solder joints. The brittle fractures are induced by the creation of the intermetallic phases which are formed during soldering. The amount and composition of the intermetallics affects the mechanical strength of the joint. An intermetallic layer is thickened during heat exposure as during soldering, thermal aging and rework. The focus of this thesis was to investigate how rework affect the brittleness of the <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> solder joint and thereby how the intermetallic layers change depending on chemical composition, design and reflow cycles. Two types of components and two types of solder materials (SnPb and SAC 305) were studied. To study the mechanical properties of the joint a shear testing device was used. This is a way of measuring the reliability of the joint when subjected to mechanical shock. The intermetallic layers were examined in a Scanning Electron Microscope and the fracture surfaces were studied in a optical microscope, a scanning electron microscope and a stereomicroscope. The heat spread over the board where examined by soldering thermocouples to the board and plotting the values of time and temperature. The results showed that the rework process did not have any significant impact of the intermetallic growth. The adjecent and distant components were not damaged during rework. A <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> rework process can therefor be preformed successfully at SMW. The intermetallic layers formed at the interface between the a <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> solder and a nickel finish grew faster than an intermetallic layer formed between a leaded solder and a nickel finish. The presence of nickel could therefore have a more negative effect on the intermetallic growth rate for the <b>lead</b> <b>free</b> material compared to the leaded...|$|R
