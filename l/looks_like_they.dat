25|$|Aguirre {{is helping}} Senator Grassley's staff examine 21,000 Federal Reserve (the Fed) {{transactions}} involving taxpayer funds distributed to {{banks and other}} financial institutions. The Fed was forced to reveal the information by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by Bloomberg News and Fox News, as well as provisions contained in Wall Street reform legislation. Despite pronouncements by the Fed about its transparency, the information released has been incomplete. The lack of details {{make it impossible to}} tell just how much profit the recipients of the funds are making and only the recipients' names and amount of funds are known. Aguirre says that between $3 and $4 trillion in cash transfers were made and another $9 to $11 trillion in commitments that taxpayer funds would cover the cost of failed investments. “It <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are borrowing the money from the Fed, say, at 70 cents on the dollar and selling it back to the Fed for 90 cents. We can’t tell for certain because the Fed won’t tell us. The Fed publishes information but not enough for you {{to figure out what the}} hell happened,” Aguirre said.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, President Bush {{dismissed}} Arafat as {{a negotiating}} partner, {{saying he had}} [...] "failed as a leader" [...] and accused him of undercutting Abbas when he was prime minister (Abbas resigned the same year {{he was given the}} position). Arafat had a mixed relationship with the leaders of other Arab nations. His support from Arab leaders tended to increase whenever he was pressured by Israel; for example, when Israel declared in 2003 it had made the decision, in principle, to remove him from the Israeli-controlled West Bank. In an interview with the Arabic news network Al Jazeera, Arafat responded to Ariel Sharon's suggestion that he be exiled from the Palestinian territories permanently, by stating, [...] "Is it his [...] homeland or ours?

[...] The other said, [...] "mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me." [...] The phrase [...] "night witch" [...] was thought to mean [...] "night watch"; when the notes were {{initially}} read aloud, night watchman Newt Lee is reported by police to have said, [...] "Boss, it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are trying to lay it on me" [...] (or words to that effect). Lee was arrested that morning based on these notes and his apparent familiarity with the bodyhe stated that the girl was white when the police, because of the filth and darkness in the basement, initially thought she was black. A trail leading back to the elevator suggested to police that the body had been moved by Lee.|$|E
500|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{described}} Makoto Yuki {{as being}} an initially [...] "ambivalent, broken character" [...] and added that the character's growth took center stage in the film. He also remarked that the film could have [...] "been a very dark, difficult-to-see movie" [...] since the majority of it takes place at night but praised the lighting effects and contrasts which rendered the action easily visible while creating a [...] "visual style all its own". On the flip side, Eisenbeis explained that while the movie covers only {{the very beginning of}} the Persona 3 story, there was [...] "the unfortunate side effect of a good chunk of the main cast and the majority of the antagonists not even being in the movie." [...] Adding that since none of the game's key plot twists are reached, he felt that it was [...] "a very simple, straight-forward movie." [...] Eisenbeis also noted that the film had [...] "more images of teen suicide than you can shake a stick at". The [...] "Evokers" [...] which in the Persona 3 world allowed the characters to summon Personas by putting one to their heads and pulling the trigger, were likened to guns in this context. Despite not being actual weapons, Eisenbeis stated that [...] "it still <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are blowing their brains out — often complete with spiritual brain and skull fragments." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 2013-2014 {{brought a}} similar fate to the Centennials. With a record of 31-22-1-4, the team once again lost {{in the first round}} of the playoffs. This time they did not win a single game against the Penticton Vees. Penticton scored 23 goals against the Centennials, who only scored 10 in the entire series. Still, it looks like things are going up for the team. Currently, the Merritt Centennials have played 55 games with a record of 30-23-2-0.

When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did think there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots.
