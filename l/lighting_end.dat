5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the <b>lighting</b> <b>end</b> or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E

The more {{recently}} completed extension begins at this point, as Highway 410 passes {{to the west}} of Trinity Common and diverges from its straight path into greenspace and alongside the Heart Lake Conservation Area.As it passes beneath Mayfield Road, the highway makes a sharp turn to the west and descends through the Etobicoke Creek valley.After rising back to level ground, it curves north, passing beneath Valleywood Drive.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the use of}} LBNL`s End-use Disaggregation Alogrithm (EDA) to 12 US Army installations nationwide {{in order to obtain}} annual estimates of electricity use for all major building types and end uses. The building types include barrack, dining hall, gymnasium, administration, vehicle maintenance, hospital, residential, warehouse, and misc. Up to 8 electric end uses for each type were considered: space cooling, ventilation (air handling units, fans, chilled and hot water pumps), cooking, misc. /plugs, refrigeration, exterior and interior lighting, and process loads. Through building simulations, we also obtained estimates of natural gas space heating energy use. Average electricity use for these 12 installations and Fort Hood are: HVAC, misc., and indoor <b>lighting</b> <b>end</b> uses consumed the most electricity (28, 27, and 26 % of total[3. 8, 3. 5, and 3. 3 kWh/ft{sup 2 }]).

40|$|Throughout the United States, {{in every}} sector and {{building}} type, lighting {{is a significant}} electrical end-use. Based on the many and varied studies of lighting technologies, and experience with programs that promote lighting energy-efficiency, {{there is a significant}} amount of cost-effective energy savings to be achieved in the <b>lighting</b> <b>end</b> use. Because of such potential savings, and because consumers most often do not adopt cost-effective lighting technologies on their own, programs and policies are needed to promote their adoption. Characteristics of lighting energy use, as well as the attributes of the lighting marketplace, can significantly affect the national pattern of lighting equipment choice and ownership. Consequently, policy makers who wish to promote energy-efficient lighting technologies and practices must understand the lighting technologies that people use, {{the ways in which they}} use them, and marketplace characteristics such as key actors, product mix and availability, price spectrum, and product distribution channels. The purpose of this report is to provide policy-makers with a sourcebook that addresses patterns of lighting energy use as well as data characterizing the marketplace in which lighting technologies are distributed, promoted, and sold...|$|E

40|$|Five {{placements}} of a CO 2 {{removal unit}} in a gas-to-liquid (GTL) process are evaluated from an economical point of view. The kinetic {{model is the}} one given by Iglesia et al. for a cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactor. For each alternative, the process is optimized with respect to steam-to-carbon ratio, purge ratio of <b>light</b> <b>ends,</b> amount of tail gas recycled to syngas and FT units, reactor volume, and CO 2 recovery. The results indicate that carbon and energy efficiencies and the annual net cash flow of the process with or without CO 2 removal unit are not significantly different, {{and that there is}} not much to gain by removing CO 2 from the process. It is optimal to recycle about 97 [*]% of the <b>light</b> <b>ends</b> to the process (mainly to the FT unit) to obtain higher conversion of CO and H 2 in the reactor...|$|R
50|$|Most geologists {{agree that}} crude becomes ‘heavy’ {{as a result}} of biodegradation, in which <b>lighter</b> <b>ends</b> are {{preferentially}} consumed by bacterial activity in the reservoir, leaving heavier hydrocarbons behind.

Poor geologic reservoir sealing exposes the hydrocarbon to surface contaminants, including organic life (such as bacteria) and contributes to this process.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Some physico-chemical {{analysis}} of samples of Gasoline, Kerosene, Diesel Oil, Low Pour Point Oil and Residual fuel have been studied.

The samples were analyzed by gravimetric and micro-kjeldahl methods for sulphur and nitrogen content respectively. The experiment data indicated that, the total sulphur and nitrogen contents increased from <b>light</b> <b>ends,</b> intermediates, distillates to heavy distillates fractions and also the concentrations of the trace metals in the petroleum products follows the same trend i. e. from less viscous petroleum products (Gasoline, Kerosene and Diesel Fuel) to high viscous petroleum products sample (residual fuel and LPFO).

5000|$|The Halmahera python changes color over a {{short period}} of time; however, {{scientists}} are unable to determine what circumstances cause the color change. At the darker end of the color spectrum, morelia tracyae could be medium brown, orangish-brown, or russet. These colors could change to be a greenish-straw, grey-tan, yellowish-tan, or tan on the <b>lighter</b> <b>end</b> of the spectrum. Though the base color of the snake changes, the pattern of thick dorsal stripes remains the same. The stripes could be dark brown, charcoal-brown, brownish black, charcoal, or black at the dark end of the color continuum and become a medium greenish brown or medium reddish brown as the python shifts to the <b>lighter</b> <b>end</b> of the continuum. However, if a stripe is pure black it will remain black despite any other color changes. Though no newly hatched Halmahera pythons have been observed, Barker and Harvey of the 2000 python study “would predict that hatchlings are very dark reddish-brown in color.” ...|$|R
