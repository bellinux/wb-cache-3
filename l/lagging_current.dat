25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect).

40|$|The Egyptian {{economy is}} marked for its {{budgetary}} imbalances. The present paper addresses {{the important question}} of whether these noticeable budget deficits have come {{to bear on the}} current account component of the Egyptian balance of payments, thus creating imbalances therein as well. We thus examine the familiar so called twin deficit hypothesis. Our findings elucidate the existence of a short and long run relationship linking budgetary deficits to their current account counterparts. Thus a Granger causality test reveals that while budget deficits lead to one <b>lag</b> <b>current</b> account deficits, the latter in turn have arguably been the source of two lags deficits in the government budget, which gives a plausible testimony confirming the reverse hypothesis. Indeed, notwithstanding the strong causal effect whereby budget deficits resulted in four to nine year <b>lagged</b> <b>current</b> account deficits; a remarkably significant counter-effect exists, thus signifying a bi-directional causal relationship between the two types of deficits. The ECM analysis of our results indicates that a 10 percent increase in the government budget deficit will accentuate itself by a further 7 percent increase in the first lag but will also cause a one lag increase of 8. 7 percent in the current account deficit. These findings lend strong support to the twin deficit hypothesis in the Egyptian case. Barring the presence of strong shocks, it can plausibly be claimed that there is a reasonably stron...|$|R

50|$|The {{effects of}} this {{modulation}} on voltage magnitude and phase angle is illustrated using phasor diagrams that map VR, VS, and the resistive and inductive components of Vline drop. Three power factor scenarios are shown, where (a) the line serves an inductive load so the current lags receiving end voltage, (b) the line serves a completely real load so the current and receiving end voltage are in phase, and (c) the line serves a capacitive load so the current leads receiving end voltage. In all cases the line resistance R causes a voltage drop that is in phase with current, and the reactance of the line X causes a voltage drop that leads current by 90 degrees. These successive voltage drops are summed to the receiving end voltage, tracing backward from VR to VS in the short line approximation circuit. The vector sum of VR and the voltage drops equals VS, and it is apparent in the diagrams that VS does not equal VR in magnitude or phase angle.The diagrams show that the phase angle of current in the line affects voltage regulation significantly. <b>Lagging</b> <b>current</b> in (a) makes the required magnitude of sending end voltage quite large relative to the receiving end. The phase angle difference between sending and receiving end is minimized, however. Leading current in (c) actually allows the sending end voltage magnitude be smaller than the receiving end magnitude, so the voltage counterintuitively increases along the line. In-phase current in (b) does little to affect the magnitude of voltage between sending and receiving ends, but the phase angle shifts considerably.|$|E

40|$|Two {{important}} {{subjects in}} high frequency fluorescent lighting are investigated. Part I. presents a fundamental {{understanding of the}} negative incremental impedance of flourescent lamps. Search for simple, high power factor, lamp ballast topologies, a more practical aspect of lighting electronics, is presented in Part II. Part I. Flourescent lamps have a special v-i characteristic. Their incremental or small-signal impedance is defined and studied in the frequency domain. It is found that the negative incremental impedance of a fluorescent lamp can be characterized by a right half plane zero. The existence of such a result is explained by the modified Francis equation. Two approaches are proposed in order {{to set up a}} stable operating point for the lamp. First, a resonant matching network, which provides impedance transformation, is placed between a voltage source and the lamp. Second, a feedback loop is closed from the lamp current to control the magnitude of the voltage source. Stability criteria based on the Nyquist criterion are developed for the impedance of the resonant matching network and for the loop gain in the above two cases, respectively. It is found that the input impedance of a switching dc-to-dc regulator, which is another case with the negative incremental impedance, and the fluorescent lamp impedance, are two dual cases and thus can be analyzed in a unified manner based on the stability of one-port circuit. The small-signal lamp impedance is measured in the most practical case of a sinusoidal carrier, and it is fit by a real rational function with a right half plane zero. The small signal models describing low frequency variations of sinusoidal magnitude are developed and are experimentally verified for the three major resonant matching networks. Stability analysis for resonant matching networks at parallel resonance are performed. It shows that the LCC network is the simplest resonant matching network that a fluorescent lamp needs. It is also predicted, and experimentally verified, that the resonant matching networks at series resonance are feasible as ballasts when the lamp current feedback loop is closed. Part II. Unlike conventional high power factor ballasts requiring two cascaded power conversion stages, the proposed new lamp ballasts achieve near unity input power factor and high frequency sinusoidal lamp current in a single power conversion stage. A single-stage, high power factor lamp ballast is proposed, which is derived from the Cuk converter. A new discontinuous inductor current mode of its input inductor makes this possible by separating the input current-shaping from the output high frequency inversion. The desirable mode of operation is presented with major waveforms. The high efficiency is further enhanced by the soft-switching improvement, which is provided naturally through the <b>lagging</b> <b>current</b> of the resonant matching network. Design equations are given. The performances of the proposed single-stage, high power factor lamp ballast are verified by the experimental results. Single-switch, unity power factor ac-to-ac converter topologies based on proper integrations of automatic current shapers and single-switch inverters, such as the Class E converter, are presented, which are suitable for lamp ballast applications. Descriptions of the desirable mode of operations and a first order analysis are given. The ballasts have the compact structure of single active switch, high input power factor and low crest factor lamp current as well as soft-switching.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to present studies addressing the question: How do we identify that a system drifts or experiences sudden changes in the safety space? Hence, the studies in this thesis focus on the identification of safety performance indicators. This identification {{is influenced by the}} way safety is understood. If safety is seen as the absence of accidents and failures, then indicators refer to failures, malfunctions or deviations. Safety critical organizations like airlines, air navigation service providers or oil companies have implemented numerous improvements by using such lagging indicators. These lagging indicators by their nature provide information after the fact. Nevertheless, today’s systems and organizations must be able to function in rapidly changing environments {{in which there is a}} great deal of uncertainty. The Resilience Engineering perspective does not see safety as the absence of failures but as something that the organization or the sociotechnical system does. Thus successes and failures are related to the capability of the system or organization to adjust and continue operations in the presence of continuous changes and operational constrains. Given such a perspective, finding indicators that allow an organization to act before something happens, i. e. to be leading, rather than reactive and lagging, is a main challenge. In order to address this challenge, the work starts with a systematic review of existing methods that could be applied for the identification of safety indicators. The thesis explores methods accounting for the monitoring of failures, deviations and everyday performance. In everyday operation, there are many successes i. e. flights arrive on schedule without significant problems. Hence, the empirical part of the work deals with the understanding the deficiencies and strengths of specific incidents and daily operations. Established and relatively new methods are tested. Each method represents a different perspective on safety having an influence on the identification of indicators. Using a multidisciplinary analysis that combines methods with different perspectives provides broad understanding. The studies document the application of the following methods: 1) Triangulation using a list of outcome and activity indicators, 2) Sequentially Timed Events Plotting (STEP method), 3) storytelling and 4) the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM method). Findings from the studies and their limitations have been presented and discussed with industry and the research community. It is essential to understand how a system operates under operational and financial constraints in order to identify that the system drifts or experiences sudden changes. Therefore, the main argument in this thesis is the identification of indicators related to failures and everyday successful operations. For that purpose, it is reasonable to distinguish from among three types of performance indicators: 1) lagging indicators, which refer to what has occurred in the past; 2) current indicators, which refer to what is occurring now; and 3) leading indicators, which refer to what may occur in the future. While, there is considerable data available for lagging indicators, a balanced composition of <b>lagging,</b> <b>current</b> and leading indicators is needed. Hence, the thesis represents a step forwards for the identification of current and leading indicators. The test of the methods provides a tool box for industry. The work also contributes to develop the FRAM method. While most of the subjects are related to aviation some ideas and methods presented in this thesis are useful to other safety critical organizations such as industry in the nuclear, oil and gas or railway sectors.
