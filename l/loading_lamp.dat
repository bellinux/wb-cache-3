Incandescent globes are often used to add more far-red light, {{with the aim of}} producing a more natural red to far-red ratio (R:FR), but also add to thermal <b>load.</b> High-intensity discharge <b>lamps</b> are often used to produce higher irradiances, more akin to natural light, but the thermal implications are rarely considered because air temperature is controlled. This paper examines the spectral properties and thermal implications of growth chamber light sources and takes a whole-plant physiology approach, by examining growth responses of a photoperiodic pea line (Pisum sativum L. cv.

High R:FR delayed flowering and inhibited internode extension in pea. However, the addition of far-red-rich incandescent globes in the proportions provided in the growth chambers (400 – 500 W) did little to reduce R:FR, did not induce earlier flowering and actually further inhibited internode length. Leaflet size and yield were significantly reduced. While air temperature was maintained at 20 C in all experiments, radiant temperature was significantly higher under high irradiance and/or with incandescent added, and soil temperatures were elevated. Growth responses under these lights were similar to the effect caused by elevating the air temperature.

40|$|Battling {{infection}} {{is a major}} healthcare objective. Untreated infections can rapidly evolve toward the condition of sepsis in which the body begins to fail and resuscitation becomes critical and tenuous. Identification of infection followed by rapid antimicrobial treatment are primary goals of medical care, but precise identification of offending organisms by current methods is slow and broad spectrum empirical therapy is employed to cover most potential pathogens. Current methods for identification of bacterial pathogens in a clinical setting typically require days of time, or a 4 - to 8 -h growth phase followed by DNA extraction, purification and PCR-based amplification. We demonstrate rapid (70 – 120 min) genetic diagnostics methods utilizing loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to test for 15 common infection pathogen targets, called the Infection Diagnosis Panel (In-Dx). The method utilizes filtration to rapidly concentrate bacteria in sample matrices with lower bacterial <b>loads</b> and direct <b>LAMP</b> amplification without DNA purification from clinical blood, urine, wound, sputum and stool samples. The In-Dx panel was tested using two methods of detection: (1) real-time thermocycler fluorescent detection of LAMP amplification and (2) visual discrimination of color change {{in the presence of}} Eriochrome Black T (EBT) dye following amplification. In total, 239 duplicate samples were collected (31 blood, 122 urine, 73 mucocutaneous wound/swab, 11 sputum and two stool) from 229 prospectively enrolled hospital patients with suspected clinical infection and analyzed both at the hospital and by In-Dx.

40|$|It {{has been}} found that if two metal {{electrodes}} are immersed in a microwave induced plasma, under certain conditions, a DC potential difference develops across the electrodes, and a DC current flows through a resistor externally connected to the electrodes. This phenomenon suggests a method of microwave-to-DC energy conversion. Experimental investigations were made using mainly a commercial neon indicator lamp inserted into a waveguide and irradiated by a microwave signal of frequency 2. 45 GHz. It was found that the magnitude of extracted current and its polarity could be changed by adjusting the impedance of the RF <b>load</b> of the <b>lamp.</b> Under optimal conditions, the lamp was ignited at about 0. 5 W of incident microwave power, and 2 mA DC current into 500 Ohms DC load was obtained at 10 W of incident microwaves. A theoretical model of the process consistent with the experimental data is proposed. It is based on the existence of a nonuniform microwave electric field distribution between extracting electrodes and the formation of unequal plasma sheaths around electrodes. Numerical computation of the microwave electric field distribution for the particular structure of the NE- 2 lamp is presented in the dissertation. The resultant field {{has been found}} to be highly nonuniform, and the position of its maximum has been determined to vary while adjusting the RF load reactance. Such a nonuniform field produces a gaseous plasma characterized by an adequately nonuniform distribution of particle temperature and concentration. If the microwave electric fields at electrode surfaces are not equal, charged particles of the plasma diffuse toward the electrodes at different rates. This gives rise to different plasma sheaths around the electrodes, and when the external DC circuit is open, a difference in plasma sheath potentials appears across the electrodes. When the DC circuit is loaded, there is a flow of electrons through the external circuit from the high field electrode to the low field electrode. This process explains the origin of the extracted DC current. The value of the extracted current is determined by the microwave electric field distribution, geometry of the electrodes and discharge chamber, and properties of the gas used. The conclusion of this work is that microwave-to-DC conversion by a microwave induced plasma is possible. Although the power handling capacity and the energy conversion efficiency of the NE- 2 lamp and other laboratory-built structures were not satisfactory, some design criteria have been developed to improve both of them...|$|R
40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} {{reported}} that as much as 12 % of global electricity production goes into producing artificial light using arc discharge lamps and that global annual production of these lamps may be as much as 1. 2 billion units. In the liquid steel production industry, one metric tone of steel demands, on average, 400 kW-hr and in the year 2007, the crude steel output reached 1, 343. 5 million metric tons. In both instances, engineered electric arcs are present and represent major loads in electrical power systems which require the utmost attention. They observe a highly non-linear behaviour with the capacity to export harmonic distortion and flicker into the power system. Electric arc furnace installations, in particular, are well-known to be sources of dynamic disturbances affecting neighbouring <b>loads.</b> Arc discharge <b>lamps,</b> on aggregate, may exhibit the same perturbing effect. Over the years, the non-linear nature of these loads and their ubiquitous nature have caught the interest of researchers in all corners of the world and from different backgrounds, including this author. The research work reported in this thesis advances current knowledge in the modelling and simulation of electric arcs with particular reference to arc discharge lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and electric arc furnaces with particular reference to operational unbalances and the impact in the installation of ancillary power electronics equipment. In these two quite distinct applications, linked by the presence of engineered electric arcs, the fundamental modelling item is a non-linear differential equation which encapsulates the physic of the electric arc by applying power balance principles. The non-linear differential equation uses the arc conductance as state variable and adapts well to model a wide range of characteristics for which a set of experimental coefficients are available. A fact of perhaps equal relevance is that the non-linear differential equation is amenable to algebraic representations using operational matrices and suitable for carrying out periodic steady-state solutions of electric circuits and systems. The modelling and numerical solution takes place in the harmonic space where all harmonics and cross-couplings between harmonics are explicitly represented. Good application examples are the harmonic domain solution of arc discharge lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and the harmonic domain solution of electric arc furnaces with ancillary power electronics equipment. Building on the experience gained with the representation of the arc discharge lamps with electromagnetic ballasts, the research turns to the representation of the electric arc furnace installation with provisions for reactive power compensation using power electronic control and harmonic filters. This is a three-phase application which comprises several nodes, giving rise a large-scale model of a non-linear system which is solved in the direct frequency domain using a blend of the Newton-Raphson method and the Gauss-Seidel method, achieving robust iterative solution to a very tight tolerance. Both algorithms are implemented in MATLAB code and the raw simulation results which are the harmonic complex conjugated vectors of nodal voltages are used to assess in a rather comprehensive manner the harmonic interactions involved in both kinds of applications...|$|R
