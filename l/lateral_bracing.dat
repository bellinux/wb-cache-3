THA said {{the goal was to}} create a [...] "feeling of {{openness}} and availability", with a focus on [...] "books and people". Most of the library's collection is housed within a single large room level with the sidewalk outside. The building has an exposed gridded steel roof [...] high, supported by six pairs of slender steel columns and lined with windows. From several column options, Degenkolb chose cantilevered columns designed in a cruciform shape, built from four steel angles measuring [...] The columns taper from the top and provide even distribution of loads, protecting the structure against wind and earthquakes without <b>lateral</b> <b>bracing</b> (or the need for supporting walls). The library features a 32-person capacity meeting room for hosting community events at no charge on a first come, first served basis. The building houses original artwork, including a work by Margot Voorhies-Thompson and, at the entrance, a 15-line poem by Kim Stafford titled [...] "Open This Door of All Doors". The exterior includes 36 stainless steel panels etched with words depicting the history of books.|$|E
2500|$|Testing {{on the new}} bridge {{design was}} begun in November 1943 and {{continued}} through 1945. The studies included 200 different configurations, to wind forces hitting the span at up to plus-or-minus 45-degrees perpendicular to the deck. Then, testing was performed on a design using open strips of wind grating placed in the roadway, which added even greater stability against torsional movement. A design with bottom <b>lateral</b> <b>bracing</b> on the stiffening truss was also tested to test the resistance against lateral movement. Then, a design was tested with motion damping devices located on the deck at three locations: one at each tower (one {{at each end of}} the main span, and one on each side span at the tower), and a set of damping devices at mid-span on each main cable. [...] Each of these steps in the design and testing phase were performed to reduce as much lateral and torsional movement as possible.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of the {{new road}} deck and {{stiffening}} truss of the 1950 span was conducted differently than had been done in Gertie's case. In 1940, the road deck was prefabricated in [...] long sections on the Tacoma tideflats, then barged to the site via tugboats and hoisted into place via gantry cranes installed on the main cable. When construction of the road deck began in early March, workers installed a Chicago boom high above the roadway level, upon which prefabricated stiffening truss assemblies each -by- were hoisted into place. After the deck assemblies were hoisted into place and finished, four traveling derricks were then lifted onto the completed deck sections. [...] After the traveling derricks (called [...] "layleg rigs" [...] by the crew) were assembled and readied, the deck was then assembled {{in a series of}} steps. On the new bridge, the stiffening truss featured a series of outer members called [...] "chords" [...] that formed {{the top and bottom of}} the stiffening truss. These were installed first, then the diagonal and vertical truss members on the sides were installed. Next, an [...] deep stiffening truss [...] "floor beam" [...] perpendicular to the length of the bridge was installed at intervals of [...] (the distance between suspender cables; they were installed at each vertical beam member in the stiffening truss). These floor beams, each [...] wide, would form the upper lateral stiffening mechanism in the deck itself. After the floor beams were installed, at alternate floor beam panel points a set of diagonal bracing struts were installed. Then, a series of <b>lateral</b> <b>bracing</b> struts were installed on the top and bottom of the road deck - that connected to the outer steel chords. Next, a series of eight [...] deep I-beam [...] "stringers" [...] were installed (positioned longitudinally). This was the final steelwork step involved, and the deck was soon raised [...] on each corner to attach the suspender cables and their [...] "jewels" [...] to the vertical stiffening truss members.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Both total {{potential}} energy and buckling equation of two-span continuous beam with <b>lateral</b> elastic <b>brace</b> under uniform load are deduced, based on energy variation method and {{the principle of}} minimum {{potential energy}}. Buckling of H-beams is simulated by ANSYS software, then compared to theoretical value, validated its rationality. High precision buckling moment formula is regressed using 1 stOpt which is a famous mathematical optimization analysis software in China. The relationship between <b>lateral</b> <b>brace</b> stiffness and buckling moment is obtained. Results: with <b>lateral</b> <b>brace</b> stiffness increases, critical bending moment of beam increases within up-limit, e. g. when <b>lateral</b> <b>brace</b> stiffness increases to certain extent, buckling moment no longer increases...|$|R

The presence of bilateral brace on wall causes about 5.4  % reduction on its maximum displacement compared to <b>lateral</b> <b>brace</b> samples.

To calculate (R d) from Eq. (3) for wall with <b>lateral</b> <b>brace</b> a mean value of ductility equal to 2.30 was {{used and the}} value of R d was evaluated as 1.89. Since the value of (S y/S yp) is less than 1, there is no additional resistance; thus the value of (R 0) is considered equal to 1.

The validity of both models are verified against 3 D finite element analyses in ABAQUS. Where applicable, verifications were also conducted against available solutions from previous studies. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate the effect of geometric and material parameters on the critical moments. The results indicate the presence of two separate groups of potential buckling modes, symmetric and anti-symmetric, with fundamentally different behavioural characteristics. The governing buckling mode is shown to depend on the bracing height, load height and <b>lateral</b> <b>brace</b> stiffness. The study shows that beyond a certain threshold bracing height, the critical moment is governed by the antisymmetric mode of buckling.
