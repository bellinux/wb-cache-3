5000|$|Qinna (擒拿) is the set {{of joint}} lock {{techniques}} used in the Chinese martial arts to control or lock an opponent's joints or muscles/tendons so he cannot move, thus neutralizing the opponent's fighting ability. Qinna Shu ( [...] meaning [...] "technique") literally translates as <b>lock</b> <b>catch</b> technique. Some schools simply use the word na ("hold") to describe the techniques. Qinna features both standing and ground-based grappling techniques.|$|E
2500|$|The Model 1861 used metal rimfire cartridges, {{and had a}} {{laterally}} hinged block {{called the}} [...] "cap" [...] which enveloped the standing breech and could be swung open to the left when the <b>locking</b> <b>catch</b> was released. This design was refined in 1862 {{with the addition of}} cam surfaces which improved the cartridge seating and extraction. The Model 1861 was chambered for the Spencer [...]56-56 rimfire cartridge, and the improved Model 1862 used the Spencer [...]56-52 rimfire cartridge. The barrels were not designed to accept a bayonet.|$|R
5000|$|... catcher's <b>lock</b> (or <b>catches)</b> - hanging upside down, {{with the}} bar {{across the front}} of the thighs, and the ropes passing inside the bent knees. This is {{generally}} a strong position to catch or hold another person (hence the name).|$|R
60|$|Without {{a sign to}} {{show that}} he heard, Bradley walked out of the <b>Lock</b> House. <b>Catching</b> up from the table a piece of bread, and taking his Bargeman's bundle under his arm, Riderhood {{immediately}} followed him. Bradley turned towards London. Riderhood caught him up, and walked at his side.|$|R
50|$|Before arming, a <b>locking</b> <b>catch</b> on {{the outer}} handle must be {{released}} by flipping it to the left, exposing the white dot in the cutout. (This unlocks {{the inner and outer}} handles; the inner handle remains fixed and the outer handle rotates.) The operator then grasps the warhead with their offhand and grips the handle with their throwing hand. The handle is then pulled back, rotated clockwise to the right and pushed in; a red dot will appear in the window to indicate it was now cocked. The thumb safety is now pushed to the right to cover the red dot in the cutout, making it safe. The top of the warhead had a metal cover over the fuze well that was pushed aside, allowing the fuse to be inserted; it is disarmed by pushing the catch open, causing the fuze to pop out and be retrieved.|$|R
50|$|A torc, also spelled torq or torque, {{is a large}} rigid or stiff {{neck ring}} in metal, made either as a single piece or from strands twisted together. The great {{majority}} are open at the front, although some had hook and ring closures and a few had mortice and tenon <b>locking</b> <b>catches</b> to close them. Many seem designed for near-permanent wear {{and would have been}} difficult to remove. Torcs are found in the Scythian, Illyrian Thracian, Celtic, and other cultures of the European Iron Age from around the 8th century BC to the 3rd century AD. For the Iron Age Celts the gold torc {{seems to have been a}} key object, identifying the wearer as a person of high rank, and many of the finest works of ancient Celtic art are torcs. The Celtic torc disappears in the Migration Period, but during the Viking Age torc-style metal necklaces, now mainly in silver, came back into fashion. Torc styles of neck-ring are found as part of the jewellery styles of various other cultures and periods.|$|R
50|$|The rifle's {{stock is}} made from fiberglass-reinforced {{polyamide}} 66. At the forward end is the pistol grip with an enlarged forward trigger guard completely enclosing the firing hand that allows the rifle to be operated with winter gloves. The trigger is hung permanently on the pistol grip, together with its two operating rods which run in guides past the magazine housing. Behind that is the <b>locking</b> <b>catch</b> for the stock group. Pressing this to the right will separate the receiver and stock. The magazine catch is behind the housing, {{on the underside of}} the stock. Above the housing are the two ejector openings, one of which is always covered by a removable strip of plastic. The rear of the stock forms the actual shoulder rest which contains the hammer unit and the end of the bolt path. The butt is closed by an endplate which is held in place by the rear sling swivel. This swivel is attached to a pin which pushes in across the butt and secures the plate. There is a cavity under the buttplate that holds a cleaning kit.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>locked,</b> but the <b>catch</b> was not {{a strong}} one, and with the blade of his pocketknife he easily pushed it back. Then the sash came up and {{he stepped into the}} bedroom beyond.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a Terran, isn't he?" [...] Erickson said. [...] "All Terrans are {{together}} in these times." [...] He fumbled suddenly at the <b>catch</b> <b>lock</b> on the case. [...] "Yes, Mr. Thacher. I'm a salesman. We're all salesmen, {{the three of}} us." ...|$|R
50|$|Magalhães was {{promoted}} to Black Belt by his Instructors Vinicius Aieta and Royler Gracie, on the Podium after winning thirteen matches (Ten by Submissions), and taking home two Gold Medals in the 2005 World Jiu-Jitsu Championship as a Laranje Belt. Magalhães has recently expressed that he's been training in different grappling styles such as Sambo (primarily leg <b>locks)</b> and <b>Catch</b> Wrestling. He is also known, despite his background in Brazilian Jujitsu, as {{being one of the}} primary pioneers (along with Shinya Aoki and others) of 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu techniques in MMA.|$|R
50|$|Commonly {{associated}} with the Springfield rifle, the breechblock is hinged above the breech face and lifts up like a trapdoor to expose the breech. The breech is <b>locked</b> by a <b>catch</b> operating {{at the end of}} the breechblock furtherest from the hinge. It is similar in principle to a break-action.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 they {{introduced}} a full size sporting air rifle {{in the guise}} of the HW35 which was to become their most successful model and was the first to feature the famous Rekord two stage sporting trigger developed from the target trigger of the HW55T, a trigger design that remains across the range unchanged to this day, the HW35 furthermore boasted a <b>locking</b> barrel <b>catch</b> and an automatic safety located {{at the rear of the}} cylinder, the HW35 was such a successful model that despite its relatively modest power output it still remains in the company's range, almost unchanged to this day.|$|R
60|$|Our {{next story}} of this kind relates to a French officer, Monsieur Mathieu Martinel, {{adjutant}} of the 1st Cuirassiers. In 1820 {{there was a fire}} in the barracks at Strasburg, and nine soldiers were lying sick and helpless above a room containing a barrel of gunpowder and a thousand cartridges. Everyone was escaping, but Martinel persuaded a few men to return into the barracks with him, and hurried up the stairs through smoke and flame that turned back his companions. He came alone to the door of a room close to that which contained the powder, but found it <b>locked.</b> <b>Catching</b> up a bench, he beat the door in, and was met by such a burst of fire as had almost driven him away; but, just {{as he was about to}} descend, he thought that, when the flames reached the powder, the nine sick men must infallibly be blown up, and returning to the charge, he dashed forward, with eyes shut, through the midst, and with face, hands, hair, and clothes singed and burnt, he made his way to the magazine, in time to tear away, and throw to a distance from the powder, the mass of paper in which the cartridges were packed, which was just about to ignite, and appearing at the window, with loud shouts for water, thus showed the possibility of penetrating to the magazine, and floods of water were at once directed to it, so as to drench the powder, and thus save the men.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, {{with the}} direct {{proportion}} of increasing demand, a new production facility built at Güngören/Istanbul. This facility {{was the first}} integrated technological plant in Turkey. And in 1986, all the companies founded by Kale were collected {{under the umbrella of}} Kale Endüstri Holding A.Ş. Today, Kale Kilit is the leading manufacturer in Turkey with a production range of cylinders/barrels, safety lock, steel door <b>locks,</b> screws, safety <b>catches</b> and attachments.|$|R
50|$|The {{upgraded}} SV-98 {{sniper rifle}} {{is designed to}} engage various targets at a range up to 1000 m. The upgraded sniper rifle features an Aluminum Alloy Receiver and shoots a 1 MOA with 7.62X54R and improves on that with. They note the new receiver provides enhanced performance and lower cost of production. It is magazine-fed and manually reloaded. It also features a Picatinny rail {{on top of the}} receiver to mount Russian-made and foreign-made optics. It comes with a standard 1P69 optical sight with a 3-10× variable magnification and is equipped with an open sight. The rifle safety <b>catch</b> <b>locks</b> the trigger, inerts the sear and prevents the rotary bolt from turning (unlocking).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of biathlon, because semiautomatic guns are illegal for race use, straight-pull actions are quite common, and are used almost {{exclusively}} on the world cup along with the Lateral Toggle action. The first company to make the straight pull action for [...]22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; the action is specifically the straight pull ball bearing lock action, which features spring-loaded ball bearings {{on the side of}} the bolt which lock into a groove inside the bolt's housing. With the new design came a new dry-fire method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is <b>locked</b> back to <b>catch</b> the firing pin. The two companies who have made the lateral toggle are Finn biathlon, as well as Izhmash. Finn was the first to make this type of action, however, due to the large swing of the arm as well as the stiffness of the bolt, these rifles fell out of favour and have been discontinued. Izhmash improved on the lateral swing with their Biathlon 7-3 and 7-4 series rifles, which have some use on world cups, but are largely thought of as inaccurate as well as having the inconvenience of having to remove the shooter's hand from the grip.|$|R
6000|$|... {{when the}} door opened, as ye saw it did the now. It is weel kenned that a corp canna lie still {{in a room with}} the door hafflins open. I rose to <b>lock</b> it, the <b>catch</b> is crazy. I was backing to the door, with my face to the feet o' the corp. I saw them move backwards, slow they moved, and my heart stood still in my breist. Then I saw'--here she stepped {{to the head of the}} bed and drew apart the curtains, which opened in the middle--'I saw the curtain was open, and naething but {{blackness}} ahint it. Ye see, my Lord, ahint the bed-heid is the entrance o' the auld secret passage. The stanes hae lang syne fallen in, and closed it, but my Lord never would have the hole wa'ed up. [...] "There's nae draught, Jean, or nane to mention, and I never was wastefu' in needless repairs," [...] he aye said. Weel, when I looked that way, his face, down to the chafts, was within the blackness, and aye draw, drawing further ben. Then, I shame to say it, a sair dwawm cam ower me, I gae a bit chokit cry, and I kenned nae mair till I cam to mysel, a' the candles were out, and the chamber was mirk and lown. I heard the skirl o' a passing train, and I crap to the bed, and the skirl kind o' reminded me o' living folk, and I felt a' ower the bed wi' my hands. There was nae corp. Ye ken that the Enemy has power, when a corp lies in a room, and the door is hafflins closed. Whiles they sit up, and grin and yammer. I hae kenned that. Weel, how long I had lain in the dwawm I canna say. The train that skirled maun hae been a coal train that rins by about half-past three in the morning. There was a styme o' licht that streeled in at the open door, frae a candle your lordship set on a table in the lobby; the auld lord would hae nae lichts in the house after the ten hours. Sae I got to the door, and grippit to the candle, and flew off to your lordship's room, and the rest ye ken.' ...|$|R
