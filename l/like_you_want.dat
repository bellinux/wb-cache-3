Professor Martin Binks, director of the Nottingham University Institute for Entrepreneurial Innovation, said, [...] "It is brilliant in its simplicity... advertisers have been attracted to it by its novelty... the site has become a phenomenon." [...] Popular Mechanics said, [...] "There's no content. No cool graphics, giveaways or steamy Paris Hilton videos for viewers to salivate over. Imagine a TV channel that shows nothing but commercials, a magazine with nothing but ads. That's The Million Dollar Homepage. An astonishing example of the power of viral marketing". Don Oldenburg of the Washington Post {{was one of the few}} without praise for the site, calling it a [...] "cheap, mind-bogglingly lucrative marketing monstrosity, an advertising badlands of spam, banner ads and pop-ups." [...] Oldenburg continues, [...] "it looks like a bulletin board on designer steroids, an advertising train wreck you can't not look at.

2500|$|Individuals with {{receptive}} aphasia may speak in long sentences {{that have no}} meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create new [...] "words" [...] (neologisms).

They have poor auditory and reading comprehension, and fluent, but nonsensical, oral and written expression. Individuals with receptive aphasia usually have great difficulty understanding the speech of both themselves and others and are, therefore, often unaware of their mistakes. Receptive language deficits usually arise from lesions in the posterior portion of the left hemisphere at or near Wernicke's area.|$|E
