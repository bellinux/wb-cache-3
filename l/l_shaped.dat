5|$|Fremantle Prison's New Division was {{constructed}} between 1904 and 1907, {{as a response}} to overcrowding. The division continues the façade alignment of the main block. The building, <b>L</b> <b>shaped</b> in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and freestone and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it complements the main cell block and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example of an attempt to introduce the separate system to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for {{the first three months of}} their sentence. The division's exercise yard initially used a panopticon to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading its removal within five years.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{residential}} architecture in Scales Mound is of traditional 19th-century forms: I-house, gable-front, cottages or T and <b>L</b> <b>shaped</b> plans. Homes {{from the early}} 20th century also adhere to traditional forms with American Foursquare style being prevalent. None of the houses in Scales Mound appear to be architect-designed and generally contain scaled down elements of Stick style, Eastlake and Queen Anne styles, often on the same house. The most ornamented and architecturally impressive houses are found on North Main Street and are classified as Queen Anne style.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Compaction {{is applied}} by an {{external}} {{force on the}} soil and its result is decreasing soil macro porosity and increasing soil bulk density. One of the main important parameter in soil compaction is mechanization in agriculture and travelling in the fields. Compaction with decreasing in soil infiltration, percentage of stable aggregates and decreasing soil porosity limits the developing of roots, infiltration and decreasing {{of water in the}} soil and finally decreases crop yield. In order to study of the effect of C and <b>L</b> <b>shape</b> subsoiler on water consumption and quantitative and qualitative characteristics of cotton, an experiment was conducted in Hashem Ababd of Gorgan in silt-clay-loam soil for two years. This study carried out in split plot arrangement based on randomised complete block design with three replications. Two methods of subsoiling (parallel and perpendicular to row plant) were taken as a main plot and the form of subsoiler (<b>L</b> <b>shape,</b> C shape and moldboard as testimonial) were assigned to sub plot. C and <b>L</b> <b>shape</b> Subsoilers decrease the soil penetration resistance significantly which this decreasing was more in C shape subsoiler. the results showed that none of the treatments, subsoilers, the methods of subsoiling and their reciprocal effects, did not affect on cotton yield in the first year. However, the continuity of the second year subsoiling affected significantly the cotton yield. The C shape subsoiler in perpendicular to row plant had more cotton yield in compare with other treatments. Despite the lack of significant cotton yield increase, The use of subsoiler could be explained in economic terms with respect to the increased yield. The fibres quality was not affected by the treatments. Most water consumption in this study in first and second year was achieved by <b>L</b> <b>shape</b> subsoiler with 5740 and 4163 m 3 ha- 1, respectively.

The runner design used in this study is Radius bend <b>shaped</b> and <b>L</b> <b>shape</b> design. Flow behavior of filling process is identified by using the ADSTEFAN simulation software. 3 -point bending test was applied to measure the flexure strength and its scatter is quantified by Weibull statistics.
