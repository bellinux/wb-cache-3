Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of nanostructured few-layer graphene through a mild etching process via catalytic steam gasification of carbon by Fe nanoparticles (NPs). Controlling the reaction temperature, steam concentration, and the loading density of the NPs enables the fine-tuning of the etching level of graphene. Well-defined nanotrenches with a width of less than 25 nm were formed by channeling of the catalytic NPs. Etching caves and quasi-semicircular etched edges were observed as well.

However, it is known that the control of the redox conditions in the glass melt has a strong implication on the final hue of glass because it affects Fe 2 +/ΣFe. Therefore an increasing number of studies on the redox conditions have been published in recent years by means of synchrotron based X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This is a technique which is not easily accessible and requires dedicated facilities. In this paper we describe an alternative approach by means of optical absorption spectroscopy. We synthesised 10 soda-lime-silica glasses with known redox conditions and iron concentration to calibrate the absorption at 1100 nm as a function of Fe 2 + concentration.

The Fe 2 +/ΣFe values obtained were compared and demonstrated that the two techniques were in good agreement with each other. Optical spectroscopy can be applied in situ with moderate sample preparation to determine the concentration of Fe 2 +.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the history of}} attempts to directly measure cloud extinction, the current measurement device known as the Cloud Extinction Probe (CEP), specific problems with direct measurement of <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient,</b> and the attempts made here to address these problems. <b>Extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{is one of the}} fundamental microphysical parameters characterizing bulk properties of clouds. Knowledge of <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> is of crucial importance for radiative transfer calculations in weather prediction and climate models given that Earth's radiation budget (ERB) is modulated much by clouds. In order for a large-scale model to properly account for ERB and perturbations to it, it must ultimately be able to simulate cloud <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> well. In turn this requires adequate and simultaneous simulation of profiles of cloud water content and particle habit and size. Similarly, remote inference of cloud properties requires assumptions to be made about cloud phase and associated single-scattering properties, of which <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> is crucial. Hence, <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{plays an important role in}} both application and validation of methods for remote inference of cloud properties from data obtained from both satellite and surface sensors (e. g., Barker et al. 2008). While estimation of <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> within large-scale models is relatively straightforward for pure water droplets, thanks to Mie theory, mixed-phase and ice clouds still present problems. This is because of the myriad forms and sizes that crystals can achieve, each having their own unique extinction properties. For the foreseeable future, large-scale models will have to be content with diagnostic parametrization of crystal size and type. However, before they are able to provide satisfactory values needed for calculation of radiative transfer, they require the intermediate step of assigning single-scattering properties to particles. The most basic of these is <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient,</b> yet it is rarely measured directly, and therefore verification of parametrizations is difficult. The obvious solution is to be able to measure microphysical properties and extinction at the same time and for the same volume. This is best done by in situ sampling by instruments mounted on either balloon or aircraft. The latter is the usual route and the one employed here. Yet the problem of actually measuring <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficient</b> directly for arbitrarily complicated particles still remains unsolved...|$|R

Observations were taken intermittently from January to March, and continuously from April through October, 2003. We assessed the data quality of ILAS-II version 1. 4 aerosol <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> at 780 nm from comparisons with the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II, SAGE III, and the Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement (POAM) III aerosol data. At heights below 20 km in the Northern Hemisphere, aerosol <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> from ILAS-II agreed with those from SAGE II and SAGE III within 10 %, and with those from POAM III within 15 %. From 20 to 26 km, ILAS-II aerosol <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> were smaller than <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> from the other sensors; differences between ILAS-II and SAGE II ranged from 10 % at 20 km to 34 % at 26 km. ILAS-II aerosol <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> from 20 to 25 km in February over the Southern Hemisphere had a negative bias (12 - 66 %) relative to SAGE II aerosol data. The bias increased with increasing altitude. Comparisons between ILAS-II and POAM III aerosol <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> from January to May in the Southern Hemisphere (defined as the non-Polar Stratospheric Cloud (PSC) season) yielded qualitatively similar results. From June to October (defined as the PSC season), aerosol <b>extinction</b> <b>coefficients</b> from ILAS-II were smaller than those from POAM III above 17 km, {{as in the case}} of the non-PSC season; however, ILAS-II and POAM III aerosol data were within 15 % of each other from 12 to 17 km...|$|R
