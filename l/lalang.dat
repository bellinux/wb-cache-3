25|$|During the Mahathir {{administration}} in 1987, several DAP leaders, including Parliamentary Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang, were detained {{by the government}} without trial during Operation <b>Lalang,</b> under the accusation of being a national security threat. It is widely believed they were arrested for protesting {{the expansion of the}} New Economic Policy (NEP).|$|E

The {{most popular}} beaches in Selangor are located at Bagan <b>Lalang,</b> Sepang Gold Coast, Batu Laut Beach and Morib Beach. There {{are also a}} number of {{pristine}} nature sites such as the Firefly Sanctuary, Kuala Selangor Nature Park in Kuala Selangor; Malaysia Agriculture Park Bukit Cerakah in Shah Alam; Commonwealth Forest Park and Forest Research Institute of Malaysia (FRIM) in Selayang; Ampang Recreational Forest and Kanching Recreational Forest in Ampang Jaya.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} then launched Operation <b>Lalang</b> (Weeding Operation), detaining 55 {{people under}} the ISA. More were arrested {{over the next few}} months. Although most were opposition politicians — including Parliamentary Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang — a few from BN were included. All BN politicians were released from detention after two months, while those from the opposition remained in custody for much longer. The government later justified these detentions on grounds of security, stating that the detainees had played up the issue of Chinese education to incite racial sentiment. Some of Mahathir's supporters saw this as a vindication of his rejection of the Tunku's [...] "compromise" [...] with the non-Malays, teaching the non-Malays not to criticise the government and its pro-Malay policies.|$|E
2500|$|Article 10 (4) of the Constitution permits Parliament to make {{it illegal}} to question, among others, Article 153 of the Constitution. Under the Sedition Act, {{questioning}} Article 153 is indeed illegal—even for Members of Parliament, who usually {{have the freedom to}} discuss anything without fear of external censure. The government can also arbitrarily detain anyone it desires theoretically for sixty days, but in reality for an undetermined length of time, under the Internal Security Act (ISA). In 1987 under Operation <b>Lalang</b> (literally [...] "weeding operation"), several leaders of the DAP, including Lim Kit Siang and Karpal Singh, were held under the ISA. It is widely believed this was due to their calling for the NEP and other Malay privileges to be reviewed. Others have questioned the constitutionality of the NEP.|$|E
2500|$|Under Mahathir Mohamad’s long Prime Ministership (1981–2003), Malaysia’s {{political}} culture became increasingly centralised and authoritarian, due to Mahathir's {{belief that the}} multiethnic Malaysia could only remain stable through controlled democracy. In 1986–87, he faced leadership challenges among his own party. There were also attacks by the government on several non-governmental organisations (NGO) which were critical of various government policies. There were also issues such the questioning by MCA's Lee Kim Sai {{over the use of}} the term pendatang (immigrants) that was seen as challenging Malay's bumiputra status, [...] as well as rumours of forced conversion to or from Islam. Mahathir initiated a crackdown on opposition dissidents with the use of the Internal Security Act named Operation <b>Lalang.</b> The Internal Security Act was invoked in October 1987 arresting 106 people, including opposition leaders. The head of the judiciary and five members of the supreme court who had questioned his use of the ISA were also arrested, and a clampdown on Malaysia's press occurred.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "UMNO 11" [...] {{case was}} just one of a number which had irritated Mahathir and the government. The case of the two journalists {{mentioned}} earlier had begun when John Berthelsen and Raphael Pura authored a series of articles on financial transactions of dubious ethical and legal nature carried out by government officials. The Asian Wall Street Journal which published them was promptly banned from the country, and Mahathir in his capacity as Home Affairs Minister had Berthelsen's and Pura's work permits revoked. However, the Supreme Court overturned the cancellation of Berthelsen's work permit because he had not been given a chance to answer the charges of the government. As a result, the ban on the Asian Wall Street Journal was also lifted. In a different case, the Supreme Court used its power of judicial review, and nullified amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code which gave the Attorney-General the power to initiate criminal proceedings in the High Court without first going to a Magistrate's Court. After Operation <b>Lalang</b> in 1987, where the government detained several political dissidents without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA), the High Court granted Karpal Singh's application to be released from detention due to [...] technicalities in the way he had been detained.|$|E

50|$|Operation <b>Lalang</b> (Operasi <b>Lalang,</b> also {{referred}} to as Ops <b>Lalang</b> and taken to mean Weeding Operation) is a major crackdown carried out beginning 27 October 1987 by the Malaysian police, ostensibly to prevent the occurrence of racial riots in Malaysia. The operation saw the arrest of 106 persons -NGO activists, opposition politicians, intellectuals, students, artists, scientists and others-who were detained without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA). It was the second largest ISA swoop in Malaysian history since the 13 May riots. It also involved the revoking of the publishing licenses of two dailies, The Star and the Sin Chew Jit Poh and two weeklies, The Sunday Star and Watan.|$|E

5000|$|Operation <b>Lalang</b> is a {{major event}} in Mahathir's {{administration}} that had a strong impact on civil liberties in Malaysia, and it {{was seen as an}} excuse by the Mahathir government to tighten the executive hold by restricting fundamental liberties. [...] To the opposition parties, Operation <b>Lalang</b> came to symbolise 'injustice' and government 'oppression'. [...] The first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, commenting on Operation <b>Lalang,</b> said that: [...] "We are on the road to dictatorship. I cannot see any other way... This is no democracy." [...] The operation is seen as the beginning of Mahathir's authoritarian rule which continued in the following year with the sacking of the Supreme Court judges in the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis.|$|E

50|$|Sitobo <b>lalang</b> lipa is the Bugis {{term for}} a type of knife duel {{formerly}} practiced by pesilat of the Batak and Bugis-Mangkasara communities. The challenger stands with a loosened sarong around him and invites the other man {{to step into the}} sarong. Knives in their right hands, the two duellists fight to the death {{within the confines of the}} sarong. This method of fighting originated in ancient India where the duellists fought with knives in their right hands while their left hands were tied together. It is unknown in what part of Southeast Asia this duel was first introduced, but it was practiced in Thailand where the fighters boxed each other with the right hands. Duelling within a sarong rather than tying the hands together appears to be unique to Indonesia. Among the Bugis and Mangkasara, the weapon used in sitobo <b>lalang</b> lipa is the badik. The Batak however use another type of knife known as the raut. Duelling is no longer practiced today but reenactments of sitobo <b>lalang</b> lipa are still performed at cultural shows in Indonesia.|$|E
