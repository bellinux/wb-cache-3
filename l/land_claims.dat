5|$|Boone {{served as}} syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri {{became part of}} the United States {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase. Because Boone's land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements, he once again lost his <b>land</b> <b>claims.</b> In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish <b>land</b> <b>claims,</b> which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty.|$|E

5|$|California has {{experienced}} less possessory land claim litigation than other states. This is primarily {{the result of}} the <b>Land</b> <b>Claims</b> Act of 1851 (following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) that required all claims deriving from the Spanish and Mexican governments to be filed within two years. Three U.S. Supreme Court decisions and one Ninth Circuit ruling have held that the <b>Land</b> <b>Claims</b> Act applied to aboriginal title, and thus extinguished all aboriginal title in the state (as no tribes filed claims under the Act). Two Deputy Attorneys General of California have advocated this view.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, Boone {{worked as}} a {{surveyor}} and merchant, but fell deeply into debt through failed Kentucky land speculation. Frustrated with the legal problems resulting from his <b>land</b> <b>claims,</b> in 1799, Boone emigrated to eastern Missouri, where {{he spent most of}} the last two decades of his life (1800–20).|$|E
50|$|The <b>land</b> <b>claim</b> {{agreement}} {{provided for}} the establishment of the Government of Nunatsiavut to represent the residents of the <b>land</b> <b>claim</b> area and any Labrador Inuit living elsewhere in Canada. Nunatsiavut remained a part of Newfoundland and Labrador, but the Government of Nunatsiavut acquired the jurisdictional authority over health, education, and justice in the <b>land</b> <b>claim</b> area. Nunatsiavut operates under a consensus government within the parliamentary system of Canada.|$|R

50|$|Also in 1843 {{he bought}} part of James A. O'Neil’s <b>land</b> <b>claim</b> at Wheatland downriver from Salem. The Crawford family {{remained}} on the farm there until {{the fall of the}} next year. Crawford moved to Oregon City in April 1845 where he worked portaging goods around Willamette Falls for seven years. He moved to a farm on Joe McLoughlin’s old <b>land</b> <b>claim</b> {{at the mouth of the}} Yamhill River in 1852 and filed and received a Donation <b>Land</b> <b>Claim</b> on the property. Crawford retained his farm near Dayton in Yamhill County until his death.|$|R
5|$|In 1795, Rebecca and {{he moved}} back to Kentucky, living in present Nicholas County on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first {{governor}} of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting <b>land</b> <b>claims</b> continued {{to make their way}} through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining <b>land</b> <b>claims</b> were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named Boone County in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Prominent First Nations people include Joe Capilano, who {{met with}} King of the United Kingdom, Edward VII, {{to speak of the}} need to settle <b>land</b> <b>claims</b> and Ovide Mercredi, a leader at both the Meech Lake Accord {{constitutional}} reform discussions and Oka Crisis.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Boone {{returned}} to North Carolina {{to bring his}} family back to Kentucky. In the autumn of 1779, a large party of emigrants came with him, including (according to tradition) the family of Abraham Lincoln's grandfather. Rather than remain in Boonesborough, Boone founded the nearby settlement of Boone's Station. He began earning money at this time by locating good land for other settlers. Transylvania <b>land</b> <b>claims</b> had been invalidated after Virginia created Kentucky County, so settlers needed to file new <b>land</b> <b>claims</b> with Virginia. In 1780, Boone collected about $20,000 in cash from various settlers and traveled to Williamsburg to purchase their land warrants. While he was sleeping in a tavern during the trip, the cash was stolen from his room. Some of the settlers forgave Boone the loss; others insisted he repay the stolen money, which took him several years to do.|$|E

5|$|Among Alaska Natives, the Rampart Dam project {{encouraged}} {{organization and}} the creation of communications links between various like-minded communities and tribal groups. When the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was proposed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Native organizations that had formed to oppose Rampart Dam were revived in opposition to the pipeline. Only after Native <b>land</b> <b>claims</b> were recognized in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act did the pipeline progress.|$|E
5|$|Before {{settlers}} arrived, {{the land}} that became known as Forest Park was covered by a Douglas-fir forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into donation <b>land</b> <b>claims</b> filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, the steep slopes and unstable silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated construction plans, and claims were defaulted or donated to the city.|$|E
5|$|Before {{turning to}} the {{district}} court's rulings, we must acknowledge a certain awkwardness in deciding whether the Act encompasses the Tribe without considering {{at the same time}} whether the Act encompasses the controverted land transactions with Maine. Whether the Tribe is a tribe within the Act would best be decided, under ordinary circumstances, along with the Tribe's specific <b>land</b> <b>claims,</b> for the Act only speaks of tribes {{in the context of their}} land dealings.|$|E

5|$|In a one-sentence {{per curiam}} opinion, the Court affirmed the D.C. Circuit, citing Barker, Title Insurance, Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock (1903), and Conley v. Ballinger (1910). The Karuk attempt to re-assert their claims decades later {{based upon the}} federal government's general trust {{relationship}} and other statutes were unsuccessful. Since Super, the Court has twice interpreted the <b>Land</b> <b>Claims</b> Act to also have imposed the requirement to file upon the state of California itself.|$|E
5|$|Left undone, however, was {{extending}} the laws dealing with surveying and registering <b>land</b> <b>claims</b> with the registrar {{of the state}} land office. Cognizant that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on {{his experience as a}} surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to <b>land</b> <b>claims,</b> which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.|$|E

5|$|Numbered Treaties {{were signed}} {{in the late}} 19th century with the chiefs of various First Nations that lived in the area. These {{treaties}} made specific promises of land for every family.

The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given; this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal <b>land</b> <b>claims,</b> many of which are still ongoing.|$|E
