In this study, the eectiveness of S/S {{in terms of the}} reduction of contaminant mobility was evaluated through two dierent <b>leaching</b> <b>procedures.</b> Heavy metal enriched mining residue was used as hazardous waste. For the S/S of mining waste, Portland cement as a binding agent was mixed with mining waste at dierent ratios (10 and 20 %).

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{selective}} method was {{established for the}} teaching of methylmercury (MeHg) from river sediments. Spiked sediment samples were extracted with 0. 50 % m/v thiourea aqueous solution by sonication extraction. The effect of various conditions on the extraction efficiency, including thiourea concentration, leaching time and liquid-to-solid ratio (L/S) was studied Optimal conditions for MeHg extraction were with an aqueous thiourea solution of 0. 5 % m/v, leaching time of 50 min, and liquid-to-solid ratio of 8 / 1. The leach solutions obtained were directly subjected to derivatization/extraction with sodium tetraphenylborate, followed by preconcentration and gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometric (GC/ITMS) analysis. The ultrasound-assisted thiourea leaching and common HCl <b>leaching</b> <b>procedure</b> were compared. The former one yields MeHg recoveries comparable with those obtained by HCl <b>leaching</b> <b>procedure</b> (56 %). The incomplete recovery suggests the strong binding of MeHg to some sediment components such as sulfides or selenides.

40|$|Abstract: Coal Combustion Byproducts (CCBs) are {{attractive}} for filling abandoned coal mines {{because they may}} constitute a source of low cost alkalinity and favorable economics. The environmental risk of mine filling with CCBs is currently evaluated by either the Toxic Characteristics <b>Leaching</b> <b>Procedure</b> (TCLP) or the Synthetic Precipitation <b>Leaching</b> <b>Procedure</b> (SPLP). However, these tests include only one leach cycle and there is doubt regarding their applicability to long-term CCBs leaching behavior in groundwater environments: particularly those associated with coal mines. The Mine Water <b>Leaching</b> <b>Procedure</b> (MWLP) was developed to provide a site specific risk assessment tool. In this study we added increasing proportions of coal mine spoil to MWLP fly ash leachings to evaluate the potential of a given mine spoil to sorb selenium ions.

The HTS was conducted in an autoclave and converted the plumbojarosite into amorphous iron oxide and liberated the Pb and Ag as sulfides (S 2) The best operating conditions were 50 g of plumbojarosite and 7 pct So (2. 04 g So added) in 500 mL of 2. 0 -mol/L NH 3 at 15020 C for 1 h. The sulfidation product contained, in percent, 37 Pb, 28 Fe, 2 S 042., 7 total S, and 11. 2 tr oz/st Ag.

40|$|The {{major element}} and {{strontium}} isotope systematics and geochemistry of coal utilization byproducts (CUB) and {{their interactions with}} environmental waters were investigated using laboratory leaching experiments with water, sodium carbonate, acetic acid, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid. Analysis of elemental data from both column and sequential <b>leaching</b> <b>procedures</b> shows rapid release of most major elements early in the <b>leaching</b> <b>procedure,</b> excluding silicon and iron, suggesting association with soluble and surface bound phases. Possible sulfate mineral phases can be inferred due to the high proportions of S leached with sodium carbonate solution, effective at dissolving sulfates such as anhydrite (CaSO 3). For all elements except sulfur, highly acidic leachates were most effective in extracting elements from the CUB. In both the column and sequential <b>leaching</b> <b>procedures</b> silicon was <b>leached</b> most effectively by stronger acidic solutions later in the experiment, suggesting {{the presence of a}} more resistant silicate phase, possibly residual biotite, feldspar, or clays, or an amorphous glass phase formed during combustion. Isotopic results from the column leaching experiment show a marked increase in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio with continued leaching. This general trend is also seen in the sequential leaching data, showing an increase in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio with continued leaching in increasingly acidic solutions. These data show that there are isotopically distinct phases within the CUB, suggesting the presence of a more resistant, highly radiogenic phase that survives the combustion process and is leached after the more soluble minerals are removed. The Sr isotope systematics and leaching behavior of the Class F CUB samples demonstrate that isotopic homogenization of minerals in coal does not always occur during the combustion process, despite the high temperatures encountered in the boiler. A key factor in accessing more resistant phases within CUB appears to be the extent of leaching, rather than the particular <b>leaching</b> <b>procedure</b> or acid used. Early-released Sr tends to be isotopically uniform; thus the Sr isotopic composition of CUB could be distinguishable from other sources and a useful tool for quantifying the possible contribution of fly ash leaching to the total dissolved load in natural surface and groundwaters...|$|R

The SPS used for the TCLP tests was prepared by the direct method of adding sulfuric acid to recycled Styrofoam and was then subjected to batch ion exchange test with ion-simulated wastewater. Experimental results from the TCLP tests yielded the following results: the heavy metals exchanged leached out with concentrations greater than the regulatory standards for wastewater; and the sulfonate group or the active site remained in the ion exchange material. The {{results suggest that the}} SPS from recycled Styrofoam will only slow down the release of heavy metals to the receiving environment and will act as a temporary holder of heavy metals.
