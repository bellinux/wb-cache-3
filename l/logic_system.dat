In Codd's book, these two Null-type markers {{are referred to as}} 'A-Values' and 'I-Values', representing 'Missing But Applicable' and 'Missing But Inapplicable', respectively. [...] Codd's recommendation would have required SQL's <b>logic</b> <b>system</b> be expanded to accommodate a four-valued <b>logic</b> <b>system.</b> [...] Because of this additional complexity, the idea of multiple Nulls with different definitions has not gained widespread acceptance in the database practitioners' domain. It remains an active field of research though, with numerous papers still being published.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Combining {{both kinds}} of fuzzy logic forms {{including}} fuzzy T-S model and adaptive fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems,</b> this paper presents an adaptive control scheme for a class of nonlinear systems. Firstly, the fuzzy T-S model is used to approximate the nonlinear systems, and the fuzzy control law of the fuzzy model is derived by the linear matrix inequality. Secondly, the adaptive fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> are constructed, and the modeling errors are eliminated by a compensator based on the adaptive fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> with three adjustable parameters: weights, centers and widths. It is proved that the closed loop system satisfies the anticipant performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the control scheme is effective.

500|$|The ISO SQL {{implementation}} of Null {{is the subject}} of criticism, debate and calls for change. [...] In The Relational Model for Database Management: Version 2, Codd suggested that the SQL {{implementation of}} Null was flawed and should be replaced by two distinct Null-type markers. [...] The markers he proposed were to stand for [...] "Missing but Applicable" [...] and [...] "Missing but Inapplicable", known as A-values and I-values, respectively. [...] Codd's recommendation, if accepted, would have required the implementation of a four-valued logic in SQL. [...] Others have suggested adding additional Null-type markers to Codd's recommendation to indicate even more reasons that a data value might be [...] "Missing", increasing the complexity of SQL's <b>logic</b> <b>system.</b> [...] At various times, proposals have also been put forth to implement multiple user-defined Null markers in SQL. [...] Because of the complexity of the Null-handling and logic systems required to support multiple Null markers, none of these proposals have gained widespread acceptance.|$|E
500|$|Boosinger {{called the}} game too easy and streamlined, {{and found the}} <b>Logic</b> <b>system</b> to be too simple. He did however feel that finding contradictions in testimonies was [...] "fantastic as always", while too reliant on trial and error. Ronaghan said that many {{solutions}} in the Rebuttal phases are [...] "binary" [...] - while {{it makes sense to}} present a piece of evidence at several points, the game accepts only one of them. He found the controls to be fine, but called the touch screen-based walking controls [...] "awkward and imprecise". Goldstein similarly found problems with multiple pieces of evidence that all could point to the same contradiction, but where the game would only allow a specific one. At other times, she said that no reasonable solution could be found, forcing her to guess. John Walker at Eurogamer also complained about how reasonable solutions sometimes are not accepted. Hopper said that solving cases isn't intuitive enough, and involves a lot of trial and error. While some puzzles made sense to him, others were frustrating. Parker called the gameplay exciting, and said that the game has depth and variety, but that it is too easy at times.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} with previous Ace Attorney games, players could identify with Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice; for Ace Attorney Investigations, they wanted players to be {{immersed in the}} game and feel like they are Edgeworth. He said that they think players will feel a connection with Edgeworth and understand his character. As examples of this, Eshiro cited the ability to directly control Edgeworth, and the possibility to see inside his head: the game's <b>logic</b> <b>system</b> was created because the development team wanted to show how Edgeworth thinks. It represents what is happening inside his mind, which Eshiro describes as a [...] "very cool, calm and collected way of thinking". For the rebuttal phases in the game, Eshiro wanted to try out new things that could not be done in courtroom battles: during rebuttals, several characters come in and out during each scene at a rapid pace, providing the player with evidence, to create drama with tension. Ace Attorney Investigations has a larger focus on the environment than previous Ace Attorney titles had; previous titles featured gameplay elements in which the player finds contradictions in suspects' statements, whereas the goal of Ace Attorney Investigations is to find things at the crime scene that contradict the evidence the player has. The game's third person perspective was specifically chosen to be different from the main series' first person perspective, and to show the environment so that players can walk around inside it. The game system was designed specifically for Ace Attorney Investigations, with the aim of being different from the main series; therefore, Eshiro felt that a lot of its features should stay within the Investigations series, and not be used in other Ace Attorney titles.|$|E
40|$|Extreme {{learning}} machine (ELM) is originally proposed for single- hidden layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFN). From the functional equivalence of fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> and SLFN, the fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> {{can be interpreted}} as a special case of SLFN under some mild conditions. Hence the fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> can be trained using SLFN 2 ̆ 7 s learning algorithms. Considering the same equivalence, ELM is utilized here to train interval type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> (IT 2 FLSs). Based on the working principle of the ELM, the parameters of the antecedent of IT 2 FLSs are randomly generated while the consequent part of IT 2 FLSs is optimized using Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of ELM. Application of the developed model to electricity load forecasting is another novelty of the research work. Experimental results shows better forecasting performance of the proposed model over the two frequently used forecasting models...|$|R

2500|$|The {{converse}} can {{be proven}} as well: if a formula always has the value 1, {{then it is}} deducible from the laws of intuitionistic logic, so the intuitionistically valid formulas are exactly those that always have a value of 1. This {{is similar to the}} notion that classically valid formulas are those formulas that have a value of 1 in the two-element Boolean algebra under any possible assignment of true and false to the formula's variables [...] that is, they are formulas which are tautologies in the usual truth-table sense. A Heyting algebra, from the logical standpoint, is then a generalization of the usual system of truth values, and its largest element 1 is analogous to 'true'. The usual two-valued <b>logic</b> <b>system</b> is a special case of a Heyting algebra, and the smallest non-trivial one, in which the only elements of the algebra are 1 (true) and 0 (false).|$|E
2500|$|EA first {{showed the}} game on August 14, in a non-playable beta build of the Xbox 360 version. They {{revealed}} their main design strategy had been [...] "Act like a mobster, think like a Don;" [...] they wanted to enhance the features from the first game, such as extortion methods and shooting, but also include an element whereby the player {{would be able to}} control their entire family on a larger scale. They also revealed Robert Duvall was reprising the role of Tom Hagen from the films and the first game, but, as in the first game, Al Pacino would not be appearing in voice or likeness in the role of Michael Corleone. A major concern for the developers was the behavior of the other families. Whereas in Godfather, the other families were relatively inactive, and simply waited for the player to attack them, in Godfather II, they are more proactive and will attack the player, and each other, on a regular basis. In the first game, once a player took over a business, they couldn't lose that business. However, in Godfather II, the other families are constantly trying to retake businesses from the player. The developers also explained the crime ring bonus system was built using an [...] "under-the-hood" [...] battle card model, whereby different perks are awarded for different rings owned, which determines how the families act. However, they emphasized the card game element only serves {{as the basis for the}} <b>logic</b> <b>system</b> that drives the behavior of the families, it is not actually a part of the game itself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Higher order fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> such as {{interval}} type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} shown to be very well suited to dealing with the large amounts of uncertainties present in the majority of real world applications. General type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> are expected to further extend this capability. However, the complexity as well as the immense computational requirements have generally prevented a foray into general type- 2 fuzzy logic research. This paper introduces an alternative approach termed zSlices for representing general type- 2 sets based on interval type- 2 sets. Thus, this will lead to a smooth transition from interval to general type- 2 fuzzy systems. The proposed approach will lead to a significant reduction in both the complexity and the computational requirements for general type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems.</b> Hence, this will lead to facilitating the application of general type- 2 fuzzy logic to many real world applications.

The first album to be released using a full commercial Vocaloid was A Place in the Sun, which used Leon's voice for the vocals singing in both Russian and English. Miriam has also been featured in two albums, Light + Shade and Continua. Japanese progressive-electronic artist Susumu Hirasawa used the Lola Vocaloid in the original soundtrack of Paprika by Satoshi Kon. The software's biggest asset {{is its ability to}} see continued usage even long after its initial release date. Leon was featured in the album 32bit Love by Muzehack and Lola in Operator's Manual by anaROBIK; both were featured in these albums six years after they were released. Even early on in the software's history, the music making progress proved to be a valuable asset to the Vocaloid development as it not only opened up the possibilities of how the software may be applied in practice, but {{led to the creation of}} further Vocaloids to fill in the missing roles the software had yet to cover. The album A Place in the Sun was noted to have songs that were designed for a male voice with a rougher timbre than the Vocaloid Leon could provide; this later led to the development of Big Al to fulfill this particular role.|$|E
