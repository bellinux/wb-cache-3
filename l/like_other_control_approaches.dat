The controller design task {{is carried out}} based on feedforward control sketch in state space framework with no need to the Computed Torque Control (CTC) which is usually used in many <b>other</b> <b>control</b> <b>approaches.</b> In the proposed approach, the load torque and some other uncertainties in the linear model of the actuators as external disturbances are successfully mitigated by the used control law. Six degrees of freedom PUMA 560 arm, including completed models of actuators is simulated and the results satisfy the common technical specifications including good tracking and robustness.

For the observer, the dynamic system is modelled as a jump Markov linear system whose parameters evolve along with the running mode of plant, then the continuoustime based interacting multiple model(CT-IMM) algorithm is proposed to estimate the full state more precisely. For the controller, a dynamic reliability constraint is added and the optimal control problem is reformulated to guarantee the reliability of system.

30|$|Different from {{previous}} researches which mostly focused on linear response control of seismically excited high-rise buildings, {{this study aims}} to control nonlinear seismic response of high-rise buildings. To this end, a semi-active control strategy, in which H∞ control algorithm is used and magneto-rheological dampers are employed for an actuator, is presented to suppress the nonlinear vibration. In this strategy, a modified Kalman–Bucy observer which is suitable for the proposed semi-active strategy is developed to obtain the state vector from the measured semi-active control force and acceleration feedback, taking into account {{of the effects of}} nonlinearity, disturbance and uncertainty of controlled system parameters by the observed nonlinear accelerations. Then, the proposed semi-active H∞ control strategy is applied to the ASCE 20 -story benchmark building when subjected to earthquake excitation and compared with the <b>other</b> <b>control</b> <b>approaches</b> by some <b>control</b> criteria. It is indicated that the proposed semi-active H∞ control strategy provides much better control performances by comparison with the semi-active MPC and Clipped-LQG <b>control</b> <b>approaches,</b> and can reduce nonlinear seismic response and minimize the damage in the buildings. Besides, it enhances the reliability of the control performance when compared with the active control strategy. Thus, the proposed semi-active H∞ control strategy is suitable for suppressing the nonlinear vibration of high-rise buildings.|$|R

The disease was declared eradicable by the International Task Force for Diseases Eradication (ITFDE) in 1993, {{and it is}} listed among the 17 WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases and Neglected Zoonoses that are potentially eradicable. In view of that, WHO has proposed a step-wise approach to its elimination, including chemotherapy of infected pigs. Different drugs have been tested on porcine cysticercosis with varying efficacies. These include flubendazole, fenbendazole, albendazole, albendazole sulphoxide, oxfendazole, praziquantel, and nitazoxanide. This review summarises available information on the efficacies and adverse effects shown by these drugs in pigs.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of a captured motion can be addressed by means of forward or inverse dynamics approaches. For this purpose, a 12 segment 2 D model with 14 degrees of freedom is developed and both methods are implemented using multibody dynamics techniques. The inverse dynamic analysis uses the experimentally captured motion to calculate the joint torques produced by the musculoskeletal system during the movement. This information is then used as input data for a forward dynamic analysis without any <b>control</b> design. This <b>approach</b> is able to reach the desired pattern within half cycle. In order to achieve the simulation of the complete gait cycle two different control strategies are implemented to stabilize all degrees of freedom: a proportional derivative (PD) control and a computed torque control (CTC). The selection of the control parameters is presented in this work: a kinematic perturbation is used for tuning PD gains, and pole placement techniques are used {{in order to determine}} the CTC parameters. A performance evaluation of the two controllers is done in order to quantify the accuracy of the simulated motion and the control torques needed when using one or the <b>other</b> <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> to track a known human walking pattern.

Current {{efforts to reduce}} chemicals used to control rodents are encouraging development of alternative practices, such as biological control. For several years growers in California have been installing artificial owl nest boxes to attract barn owls {{with the hope of}} reducing rodents, especially gophers, through predation. Effectiveness of barn owls as biological control of gophers in vineyards and orchards is unknown. The {{purpose of the study was}} to use growers surveys and diet analysis to assess the effectiveness of installing barn owl nest boxes to control gophers. Surveys of growers that installed artificial nest boxes reported that 40 % of boxes were occupied within six months of installation. Of those growers with occupied nest boxes, however, only 23 % felt that barn owls were effective in controlling gophers on their lands. The diet results indicated that bam owls most frequently prey upon gophers and voles. Barn owls prey upon both adult and juvenile gophers, and juvenile gophers were especially vulnerable during spring and summer. The findings provide little evidence that barn owls are effective in controlling gophers.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{alternative}} modal active <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> to reduce sound transmission through a structure excited by an acoustic wave. Active control {{makes it possible to}} conserve lightness while improving acoustic performances. “Modal mass damping control” is proposed for light and small structures having slight modal overlap. The aim of this control is to modify the modal distribution of high radiation efficiency modes with active modal virtual mass and active modal damping. The active virtual mass effects lower eigen frequencies to less audible frequency range while reducing vibration amplitudes in a broad frequency range. An application of this concept is presented in a simple smart structure. It is harmonically excited on large bandwidth by a normal acoustic plane wave.
