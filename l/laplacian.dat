5|$|The {{perceived}} {{deficiencies of}} the <b>Laplacian</b> model stimulated scientists {{to find a}} replacement for it. During the 20th century many theories addressed the issue, including the planetesimal theory of Thomas Chamberlin and Forest Moulton (1901), the tidal model of Jeans (1917), the accretion model of Otto Schmidt (1944), the protoplanet theory of William McCrea (1960) and finally the capture theory of Michael Woolfson. In 1978 Andrew Prentice resurrected the initial <b>Laplacian</b> ideas about planet formation and developed the modern <b>Laplacian</b> theory. None of these attempts proved completely successful, {{and many of the}} proposed theories were descriptive.|$|E
5|$|Pierre-Simon Laplace {{independently}} {{developed and}} proposed a similar model in 1796 in his Exposition du systeme du monde. He envisioned that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout {{the volume of}} the Solar System. His theory featured a contracting and cooling protosolar cloud—the protosolar nebula. As this cooled and contracted, it flattened and spun more rapidly, throwing off (or shedding) a series of gaseous rings of material; and according to him, the planets condensed from this material. His model was similar to Kant's, except more detailed and on a smaller scale. While the <b>Laplacian</b> nebular model dominated in the 19th century, it encountered a number of difficulties. The main problem involved angular momentum distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model. As a result, astronomers largely abandoned this theory of planet formation {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Despite of {{the extreme}} success of the {{spectral}} graph theory, there are relatively few papers applying spectral analysis to hypergraphs. Chung first introduced <b>Laplacians</b> for regular hypergraphs and showed some useful applications. Other researchers treated hypergraphs as weighted graphs and then studied the <b>Laplacians</b> of the corresponding weighted graphs. In this paper, we aim to unify these very different versions of <b>Laplacians</b> for hypergraphs. We introduce a set of <b>Laplacians</b> for hypergraphs through studying high-ordered random walks on hypergraphs. We prove the eigenvalues of these <b>Laplacians</b> can effectively control the mixing rate of high-ordered random walks, the generalized distances/diameters, and the edge expansions.

We give a number of applications of this spectral decimation. We also prove analogous results for fractal <b>Laplacians</b> on the unit Interval, and this yields an analogue of the classical Sturm-Liouville theory for the eigenfunctions of these one-dimensional <b>Laplacians...</b>|$|R

40|$|While {{the theory}} and {{applications}} of discrete <b>Laplacians</b> on triangulated surfaces are well developed, far less {{is known about the}} general polygonal case. We present here a principled approach for constructing geometric discrete <b>Laplacians</b> on surfaces with arbitrary polygonal faces, encompassing non-planar and non-convex polygons. Our construction is guided by closely mimicking structural properties of the smooth Laplace–Beltrami operator. Among other features, our construction leads to an extension of the widely employed cotan formula from triangles to polygons. Besides carefully laying out theoretical aspects, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach for a variety of geometry processing applications, embarking on situations that would have been more difficult to achieve based on geometric <b>Laplacians</b> for simplicial meshes or purely combinatorial <b>Laplacians</b> for general meshes...|$|R

25|$|In 1978, {{astronomer}} A. J. R.

Prentice also suggested that the young Sun transferred some angular momentum to the protoplanetary disc and planetesimals through supersonic ejections understood to occur in T Tauri stars. However, his contention that such formation would occur in toruses or rings has been questioned, as any such rings would disperse before collapsing into planets.|$|E
