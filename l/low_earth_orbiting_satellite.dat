40|$|The European Space Agency {{is going}} to conduct an inter orbit link {{experiment}} which will connect a <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> <b>satellite</b> and a Geostationary satellite via optical terminals. This experiment has been called SILEX (Semiconductor Inter satellite Link EXperiment). Two payloads will be built. One called PASTEL (PASsager de TELecommunication) will be embarked on the French Earth observation satellite SPOT 4. The future European experimental data relay satellite ARTEMIS (Advanced Relay and TEchnology MISsion) will carry the OPALE terminal (Optical PAyload Experiment). The principal characteristic of the mission is a 50 Megabits flow of data transmitted via the optical satellite link. The relay satellite will route the data via its feeder link thus permitting a real time reception in the European region of images taken by the observation satellite. The PASTEL terminal {{has been designed to}} cover up to 9 communication sessions per day with an average of 5. The number of daily contact opportunities with the <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> <b>satellite</b> will be increased and the duration will be much longer than the traditional passes over a ground station. The terminals have an autonomy of 24 hours with respect to ground control. Each terminal will contain its own orbit model and that of its counter terminal for orbit prediction and for precise computation of pointing direction. Due to the very narrow field of view of the communication laser beam, the orbit propagation calculation needs to be done with a very high accuracy. The European Space Agency is responsible for the operation of both terminals. A PASTEL Mission Control System (PMCS) is being developed to control the PASTEL terminal on board SPOT 4. The PMCS will interface with the SPOT 4 Control Centre for the execution of the PASTEL operations. The PMCS will also interface with the ARTEMIS Mission Control System for the planning and the coordination of the operation.

40|$|The Space Fed Lens Array (SFLA) is an {{alternative}} to a phased array antenna that replaces large numbers of expensive solid-state phase shifters with a single spatial feed network. SFLA {{can be used for}} multi-beam application where multiple independent beams can be generated simultaneously with a single antenna aperture. Unlike phased array antennas where feed loss increases with array size, feed loss in a lens array with more than 50 elements is nearly independent of the number of elements, a desirable feature for large apertures. In addition, SFLA has lower cost as compared to a phased array at the expense of total volume and complete beam continuity. For ground station applications, both of these tradeoff parameters are not important and can thus be exploited in order to lower the cost of the ground station.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis {{is to provide a}} system level performance analysis for an imaging spacecraft. In an imaging spacecraft, an attitude control subsystem’s function is to orient the spacecraft’s body to acquire a target through the use of an actuator. In practice, reaction wheels commonly perform this function by producing a reactive torque on the spacecraft. Consequently, due to the static and dynamic imbalances in individual reaction wheels, an undesired vibration, called jitter, is generated during operation and causes variations in the spacecraft’s attitude. Focusing on missions and payloads operating in the infrared band, optical jitter effects on target detection and tracking performance need to be investigated. Using a quaternion error feedback design, jitter produced by the reaction wheels was recorded while performing a standard spacecraft maneuver. Simulating a <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> <b>satellite,</b> the vibrations generated a significant optical jitter blur due to a line-of-sight motion. After implementing the optical jitter blur in a baseline high resolution image, the simulation considerably reduced the frame’s spatial resolution and intensity. The simulation demonstrated the jitter blur’s effects on spatial resolution and intensity, which significantly decreased the system’s ability to detect and track objects-of-interest.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the current {{research}} is to introduce the alternative algorithm of the non-recursive batch filter based on the unscented transformation in which the linearization process is unnecessary. The presented algorithm is applied to the orbit determination of a <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbiting</b> <b>satellite</b> and compared its results with those of the well-known Bayesian batch least squares estimation and the iterative UKF smoother (IUKS). The system dynamic equations consist of the Earth`s geo-potential, the atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure and the lunar/solar gravitational perturbations. The range, azimuth and elevation angles of the satellite measured from ground stations are used for orbit determination. The characteristics of the non recursive unscented batch filter are analyzed for various aspects, including accuracy of the determined orbit, sensitivity to the initial uncertainty, measurement noise and stability performance in a realistic dynamic system and measurement model. As a result, under large non-linear conditions, the presented non-recursive batch filter yields more accurate results than the other batch filters about 5 % for initial uncertainty test and 12 % for measurement noise test. Moreover, the presented filter exhibits better convergence reliability than the Bayesian least squares. Hence, it is concluded that the non-recursive batch filter based on the unscented transformation is effectively applicable for highly nonlinear batch estimation problems...|$|E
