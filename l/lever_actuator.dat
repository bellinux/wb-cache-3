40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{carbonization}} pattern and operation characteristics of an MCCB. The MCCB is consisted of the actuator <b>lever,</b> <b>actuator</b> mechanism, bimetallic strip, contacts, up and down operator, arc divider or extinguisher, metal operation pin, terminal part, etc. When the actuator lever of the MCCB is at the top or the internal metal operation pin is in contact with the front part, the MCCB is turned on or off. It means trip state if the actuator lever or the internal metal operation pin moves to back side. In the UL 94 vertical combustion test, white smoke occurred from the MCCB when an average of 17 ~ 24 seconds elapsed after the MCCB was ignited and black smoke occurred when an average of 45 ~ 50 seconds elapsed. It took 5 ~ 6 minutes for the MCCB surface to be half burnt and took an average of 8 ~ 9 minutes for the MCCB surface to be entirely burnt. In the UL 94 test, the MCCB trip device operated when an average 7 ~ 8 minutes elapsed. If the MCCB trip has occurred, it may have been caused by an electrical problem such as a short-circuit, overcurrent, etc., as well as fire heat. From the entire part combustion test according to KS C 3004, it was found that the metal operation pin could be moved t...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In a {{conventional}} parallel plate MEMS variable capacitor, the capacitance versus voltage response (C-V response) has been deterministic. In this work, the C-V response is tuned versatilely {{through the application}} of a control voltage to an additional electrode in order that the initial gap between the parallel capacitor plates is set by the control voltage. Then, the capacitor plates are lifted (capacitance decreases) as the actuation voltage applied to the <b>levering</b> <b>actuator</b> increases. In this manner, the shape of the C-V response can be controlled even after the device is fabricated. At a zero control voltage, the fabricated MEMS variable capacitor exhibited a convex shape in the C-V response (i. e. the capacitance decreases slowly in the low actuation voltage region and rapidly in the high actuation voltage region). When 3 V was applied to the control voltage, the capacitor exhibited an almost linear C-V response with a linearity factor of 0. 999. At 5 V of control voltage, the C-V response changed to a relatively concave shape (i. e. the capacitance decreases rapidly in the low actuation voltage region and slowly in the high actuation voltage region). The capacitance tuning ratio of the fabricated device exceeded 120 % at all control voltages. The proposed C-V response tuning capability is vital and amenable to various circuit demands.

These DACs take digital electrical signals and produce mechanical displacements at the output. A 3 -bit DAC with thermal actuator arrays operating on 5 V signals has been demonstrated with 2 3 states of displacements. This DAC has a least significant bit (LSB) size of 0. 74 m, an integral nonlinearity (INL) of 0. 27 LSB, and a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of 0. 25 LSB.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the forward kinematics of a five-bar compliant micro-manipulator. To overcome the limited displacement {{of such a}} flexure-based mechanism driven by piezoelectric <b>actuators,</b> <b>lever</b> mechanisms are utilized to enlarge the working range. The mechanical design of the micro-manipulator is firstly described. Mathematical formulations for the five-bar mechanism are described and the solutions are developed to decide the end-effector position in Cartesian space. The amplification factor of the lever mechanism is also derived based on the analytical solution of the four-bar linkages. The velocity of the end-effector is obtained by differentiating the forward position kinematic equation, and the local mobility index of the five-bar compliant mechanism is determined and analysed. Based on linearization of trigonometric functions and constant Jacobian matrix, numerical simulations are carried out to investigate {{the performance of the}} five-bar compliant manipulator and to determine the optimal geometric parameters for the configuration. The comparisons between the exact solution and simplified methodologies are conducted. Experiments are carried out to validate the established model and the performance of the developed micro-manipulator...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{falls into}} the field of tactile {{displays}} that are meant to produce realistic tactile sensations, which replicate tactile sensations arising naturally when humans interact with the real world. To begin with {{we need to know}} the biomechanics of the glabrous skin in human subjects. To this end, small patches of fingerpad skin are tested in vivo for their biomechanical properties under tangential loading. The skin is quasi-statically stretched and sheared to obtain its effective Young's modulus. Moreover, isotonic and isometric testing conditions are implemented to identify the viscoelasticity model of the skin. The results show a great deal of variability across subjects and it is observed that the glabrous skin exhibits nonlinear stiffening in tangential traction. The skin is consistently more elastic across the ridges, compared to along the ridges, regardless of the location of the sample on the fingerpad. The skin behaves visco-elastically but relaxes about twice as fast as it creeps. Finally, it is found that under large deformation, there is consistently 80 % of hysteretic loss {{for a wide range of}} loading conditions. Based on the results obtained by controlled testing, a high performance distributed display is designed. The display has a compact, yet modular structure. Its 6 x 10 piezo bimorph actuator array has a spatial resolution of 1. 8 x 1. 2 millimeters and a wide temporal bandwidth. The actuator mounting method is improved from conventional cantilever to dual-pinned <b>lever,</b> giving the <b>actuator</b> the capability of optimally coupling with glabrous skin. By using previously measured biomechanical data of the skin, we tune the parameters of the actuators to be optimal in terms of real deflection when they couple with the skin. The blocked force of the individual actuators can be adjusted from 0. 15 N to 0. 22 N to accommodate different applications. It is self-contained in a 150 cm 3 volume and may be interfaced to most computers, provided that two analog outputs and six digital IO lines are available. Both public demonstration and psychophysical experiments have validated its effectiveness in rendering virtual tactile features. The availability of a display raises the question of what signals should be used to drive it in order to render specific sensations. Some progress is made in this direction by analyzing the contact mechanics of fundamental cases, such as isolated indentation and traveling undulation. With the intention of explaining a tactile illusion engendered by straining the fingertip skin tangentially in a progressive wave pattern, resulting in the perception of a moving undulating surface, we carry out a contact mechanics analysis to derive the strain tensor field induced by a sinusoidal surface sliding on a finger, as well as the field created by a tactile transducer array deforming the fingerpad skin by lateral traction. We find that the first field can be well approximated by the second. Our results imply that, first, tactile displays using lateral skin deformation can generate tactile sensations similar to those using normal skin deformation. Second, there is a synthesis approach to achieve this result given constraints on the design of tactile stimulators. Third, the mechanoreceptors embedded in the skin must respond to the deviatoric part of the strain tensor field and not to its volumetric part. Finally, many tactile stimuli might represent for the brain an inverse problem to be solved. Using the results of these investigations, we have demonstrated the feasibility of producing high-fidelity virtual tactile sensations...|$|R
