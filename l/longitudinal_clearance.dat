50|$|Mod 4, {{the twelve}} guns from , relined in 1921-1923, had a conical {{one-step}} liner and uniform rifling {{with a new}} chase locking hoop and locking ring. With the Mod 5 {{an attempt was made}} to reline a Mod 1 with a uniform twist rifling, but it was dropped. Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a uniform twist rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling, and added a tube and liner locking ring. Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling that was secured by a tube and liner locking ring with a liner locking collar at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>clearance</b> at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band seating slope and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12. Mod 12 used a Mod 10 and lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope with Mod 13 being similar but of a Mod 8, Mod 14 used a Mod 9, Mod 15 used a Mod 7, Mod 16 used a Mod 10, Mod 17 used a Mod 8, and Mod 18 a Mod 9. Mod 19, the last modification, used a Mod 2 with its breech modified for the Smith-Asbury Breech Mechanism and the forward end of the chamber modified similar to the Mod 18, lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope. The breech end was further modified by being machined out so that it could accommodate a gas check seat liner locking ring. The Mod 19 could also be used right or left handed by cutting a new slide keyway that was 180° from the original keyway.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is {{proposed}} to assist drivers tedious manual acceleration or braking of the vehicle, {{as well as}} with maintaining a safe headway time gap. This thesis proposes, simulates, and implements a vision-based ACC system which uses a single camera to obtain the clearance distance between the preceding vehicle and the ACC vehicle. A three-step vehicle detection framework is used to obtain the position of the lead vehicle in the image. The vehicle coordinates are used in conjunction with the lane width at that point to estimate the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>clearance</b> range. A Kalman filter filters this range signal and tracks the vehicle’s longitudinal position. Since image processing algorithms are computationally intensive, this document addresses how adaptive image cropping improves the update frequency of the vision-based range sensor. A basic model of a vehicle is then derived for which a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller with gain scheduling is used for ACC. A simulation of the system determines whether the ACC algorithm will work on an actual vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to make clear the {{machinability}} of the bamboo culm. Using Mosochiku (Phyllostachys pubescence MAZEL) grown at Kyushu district, the variations of the cutting-force components in orthogonal cutting of the bamboo culm were measured (Figs. 1 ～ 12 and Tables 1 ～ 2), the effects of internode region and nodal region in the stem wall, the bamboo culm in the radial direction and the <b>longitudinal</b> direction, and <b>clearance</b> angle of the knife upon the variations of the cutting-force components and the other cutting phenomena were clarified (Figs. 13 - 17). Based on these results, characteristics of the orthogonal cutting of bamboo in this study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimisation}} of a trimaran configuration is not trivial due to {{the influence}} of <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>clearance</b> between the hulls. This sensitivity is illustrated in the predictions presented. The proposed calculation procedure is based on an extension of the slender ship theory of Noblesse. In particular the highly oscillatory terms within the associated Kochin function are expanded as series of products of Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials to facilitate faster computation and to separate out specific parameter dependencies. These objectives allow calculation of constituent terms of the Kochin function as a function of hull clearance parameters,which may be stored externally to the resistance calculation software. The rapid calculation procedure allows identification of optimal trimaran configurations. Comparison between the numerical predictions and experimental measurement based on the authors’ earlier experimental investigations and those of other researchers (Degiuli etal., 2003) has shown good agreement. The wave resistance differences for symmetric and asymmetric outer hull forms for three distinct cases are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{developed a}} new methodology and new models for assessing the potential of motorcycle crashes and selecting countermeasures to improve motorcyclist safety in a motorcycle-dominated traffic environment of urban roads. The crash risk models were developed based on discrete choice models and traffic conflict techniques. The innovative features of this research are that the non-lane-based movements of motorcycles were captured to evaluate their contributions to crash risk and a new concept - that of the Conflict Modification Factor (CoMF) - was proposed {{to use as a}} surrogate measure to assess the relative contribution of risk factors to crashes. In addition, a methodology was also developed to enhance the existing International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) star rating system for motorcyclists. The developed models were fitted and validated using data collected from urban roads in the city of Danang in Vietnam. The operating speed, speed difference, traffic density, front distance, <b>longitudinal</b> gap, lateral <b>clearance</b> and road surface condition were found to significantly contribute to motorcycle crash risk and several countermeasures have been consequently identified to improve motorcyclist safety including: installing changeable speed limit signs, installing changeable gap warning signs, installing changeable road surface condition warning signs and providing segregated motorcycle lanes...|$|R
