5|$|Physically, some insects {{move their}} flight muscles {{directly}}, others indirectly. In insects with direct flight, the wing muscles directly {{attached to the}} wing base, so that a small downward movement of the wing base <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> wing itself upward. Those insects with indirect flight have muscles that attach to and deform the thorax, causing the wings to move as well.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. powerlifting team {{consisted}} of two competitors, Mary Stack and Andy Wise. All of Stack's lifts were declared invalid. She faltered and missed on her first two attempts to lift 110kg. On her third attempt, Stack managed to lift the weight but the judges did not accept the lift and she was disqualified. Wise completed two valid <b>lifts,</b> <b>the</b> maximum of which was 150kg, and finished in eleventh place.|$|E
5|$|The {{legends of}} Krishna's {{childhood}} and youth {{describe him as}} a cow herder, a mischievous boy whose pranks earns him the nickname a Makhan Chor (butter thief), and a protector who steals {{the hearts of the}} people in both Gokul and Vrindavana. The texts state, for example, that Krishna <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> Govardhana hill to protect the inhabitants of Vrindavana from devastating rains and floods.|$|E

5|$|Winter knows from Yates that Irwin's {{ultimate}} goal is to raise the American flag upside down, a classic signal of distress. Irwin's men create havoc but ultimately are confronted by overwhelming numbers of guards, armed with live ammunition. Irwin orders the prisoners to stand down and elects to personally hoist the flag. After Winter's men, including Captain Peretz, disobey his orders and refuse to kill Irwin, Winter fatally shoots Irwin in the back as he <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> flag.|$|E
5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E
5|$|Construction was in two phases. A {{level section}} from Tiverton to Lowdwells on the Devon/Somerset border, opened in 1814, and {{was capable of}} {{carrying}} broad-beam barges, carrying up to 40tons. The Somerset section, suitable for tub-boats, which were about 20feet (6.1m) long and capable of carrying eight tons, opened in 1839. It included an inclined plane and seven boat <b>lifts,</b> <b>the</b> earliest lifts to see commercial service in the UK. The lifts predated the Anderton Boat Lift by nearly 40 years.|$|E

5|$|In the ocean, Varaha {{encounters}} Hiranyaksha, who obstructs {{his path}} and challenges {{him to a}} duel. In some versions, the demon also mocks Varaha as the beast and warns him not to touch earth. Ignoring the demon's threats, Varaha <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> earth on his tusks. Hiranyaksha charges towards the boar in rage with a mace. The two fiercely fight with maces. Finally, Varaha slays the demon after a thousand-year duel. Varaha rises from the ocean with the earth in his tusks and places her gently above it in her original position, as the gods and the sages sing Varaha's praises.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{previous}} BS stations, {{a separate}} station building was not constructed at Paddington. A small pedestrian entrance on the north-west {{corner of the}} junction of London Street and Praed Street provides access to the below-ground ticket hall. Following their successful introduction at Earl's Court in 1911, the station was the first {{on the line to}} be designed to use escalators instead of <b>lifts.</b> <b>The</b> ticket hall and platforms are decorated with tiling designs by David Hamilton installed during a £6 million refurbishment of the station between 1984 and 1987 incorporating elements of technical drawings by Marc Isambard Brunel and other engineers.|$|E
5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
50|$|As noted {{there is}} a spring assist to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> VertiBird. However, in actual {{operation}} the assist {{is not enough to}} <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> VertiBird off the ground. Most of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> comes <b>the</b> spinning rotor itself. Subsequently, dropping heavy items during flight will result in a very rapid ascension of the VertiBird unless the pilot has good flight skills.|$|R

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the reconstruction of the}} main line station above, a new ticket hall was excavated below the concourse with two sets of escalators replacing the <b>lifts.</b> <b>The</b> escalators provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level, which, in turn, gives access to the Northern line Charing Cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators; one set each serving the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern line Bank branch platforms. Interchanges between the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern Bank Line platforms are made via a passageway at the lower level so as to avoid the need to use the escalators. An emergency stair to the intermediate interchange level is located midway along the passageway. The Victoria line platforms opened on 1 December 1968 when the second section of the line was opened between Highbury & Islington and Warren Street. Disused passages remain with tiling and posters from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the children would have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his seventh}} {{season with the}} Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with the Giants in December 2006. At the time, {{it was the largest}} {{contract}} ever given to a pitcher. He posted double-digit wins in his first three seasons, and in 2010 he helped San Francisco win their first championship since 1954. However, he struggled the last month of the season and he was left off the postseason roster. After sitting out much of the 2011 season with a foot and ankle injury, he came back in 2012 and flourished, finishing with a 15–8 record, his best season in a Giants uniform. The same October, Zito helped lead the Giants to their second World Series title in San Francisco history by going 2–0 with a 1.69 ERA in three postseason starts. In his first career World Series start, he outdueled Tigers' ace Justin Verlander in Game 1, setting the stage for San Francisco's sweep to their seventh World Series title in franchise history. Zito struggled in 2013 but received a standing ovation from the fans in his final appearance as a Giant. Following the year, he became a free agent. Zito, a philanthropist, founded Strikeouts For Troops, a national non-profit that provides comforts of home and <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> spirits and morale of injured troops as well as offering support to military families.|$|E

5|$|Strand {{station was}} built {{on the site of the}} Royal Strand Theatre, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's {{architect}} Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station building is L-shaped, with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single semi-circular window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular lift shafts able to accommodate six trapezium-shaped lifts. Only one of the shafts was fitted out, with two <b>lifts.</b> <b>The</b> other two shafts rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards into the space of the shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Edge, and Triple H. As the match began, Edge chose to stand outside the ring, hoping that Cena and Triple H would simply fight the match themselves. Cena and Triple H, however, teamed up and turned against Edge. One spot in the match saw Edge catapult Triple H into the steel ringpost, which made Triple H bleed. Afterwards, Edge executed an Edgecution onto an announce table on Triple H and then focused on Cena. Cena, however, locked Edge in the STFU, but was broken when Triple H hit Cena {{in the head with}} a microphone. Triple H then went after Edge and hit him with a chair, sending him over the security wall and into the audience. Lita, who accompanied Edge, entered the ring with a chair to hit Triple H, but Triple H reversed it into a Spinebuster, a move where the wrestler <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> opponent, turning 180°, and then tosses her forward onto her back. Near the end of the match, Cena attempted an FU on Edge but Triple H delivered a low blow to Cena, which made Cena drop Edge out of the ring and attempted to execute a Pedigree. Cena, however, countered it into a jackknife roll-up. Cena won the match and successfully retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Triple H hit Cena, Edge, and the referee with a sledgehammer, and performed his signature taunt until performing his signature DX cross chops, receiving a standing ovation from the audience, closing the show.|$|E
5|$|Trevor {{eventually}} {{discovers that}} Michael set him and Brad up, and that Brad {{is not in}} jail but buried in Michael's fake grave. This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael, but needing him alive for one last heist. When that heist is successful, Trevor is so pleased that he <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> death vow but still hates Michael. Near {{the end of the}} game, Franklin is given a choice: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or let them live and face their enemies. If the latter is chosen, Trevor kills Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Steve Haines, before capturing Weston, and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin. Trevor once again considers Michael his friend, albeit a friend that he hates, which Michael accepts. If the second option is chosen, Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael's death. If the first option is chosen, Franklin meets up with Trevor, before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant. When Trevor crashes into an oil tank, causing himself to be covered in oil, either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil, setting Trevor alight and killing him. If Trevor and Michael are spared, they continue to spend time together with Franklin, during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad, and refers to himself and Michael as friends.|$|E
