5000|$|Various {{countries}} recognized Israel as a {{state in}} the 1940s and 1950s, {{but they did not}} recognize Israeli sovereignty over West Jerusalem. There is an international sui generis consular corps in Jerusalem. It is commonly referred to as the [...] "Consular Corps of the Corpus Separatum". The states that have maintained consulates in Jerusalem say that it was part of Mandate Palestine, and in a de jure sense, has not since become part of any other sovereignty. The Netherlands maintains an office in Jerusalem serving mainly Israeli citizens. Other foreign governments base Consulate General offices in Jerusalem, including Greece, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. Since the President of Israel resides in Jerusalem and confirms the foreign diplomats, the ambassadors have to travel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to submit <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credentials</b> upon being appointed.|$|R

5000|$|Little {{is known}} of John the Hungarian, except that he had some {{standing}} in Hulagu's court, was {{referred to in the}} Exultavit, and was possibly the intermediary between Hulagu and the Christians. However, when he arrived to Pope Urban, though John claimed to be Hulagu's envoy, he had no <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credentials.</b> He reportedly brought a letter written by Hulagu in Maragha on April 10, 1262, dated the Year of the Dog, and John's purpose was to transport the letter to King Louis IX of France. According to the historian Jean Richard, its wording [...] "bore signs of the intermediary of a western scribe, probably the Ilkhan's Latin notary, Rychaldus." [...] The letter followed the usual form of Mongol communications, expecting submission. It also referred to a gift received by the previous envoy Andrew of Longjumeau, and explained that the Mongols had previously thought that the Pope was the leader of the Christian people, until [...] "it had been realized where true power lay among the French." [...] The letter went on to describe previous Mongol campaigns such as against the Assassins, and suggested joint efforts between the Mongols and the Christians against their common enemy, the Egyptian Mamluks. The letter also expressed Hulagu's desire to return Jerusalem to the Christians. King Louis sent John and the letter along to Pope Urban, and John probably returned to Maragha in late 1262.|$|R

40|$|A {{question}} whether contesting <b>of</b> <b>credentials</b> {{is designed to}} protect the UN against actions of plenipotentiaries lacking satisfactory credentials, or it is an expression of objection to the power which granted the credentials is discussed in the present article. Chapter two bears on credentials in international law. As appears from analogy to law <b>of</b> treaties, <b>credentials</b> in a wide sense of that term, are a document accorded by a competent state authority, international organization or even an international conference furnishing a certain person or persons with power to represent in performing transactions regulated by international law. Chapter three treats of procedure <b>of</b> verifying <b>credentials</b> in the UN and presents the scope of competence <b>of</b> the <b>Credentials</b> Committee and the General Assembly in that respect. The UN practice in the range <b>of</b> <b>credentials</b> is presented in chapter four with a more detailed discussion of Chinese, Hungarian, Congese, Kampuchean and South-African cases. Presentation of the most crucial incidents related to credentials allowed a critical estimation of the UN actions in the final conclusions of the article. They are characterised by inconsistencies, voluntarism, and deviations from legal regulation. Presently, verifying credentials in the UN is not exclusively of a formal character. Representativeness of authority concerned is assessed upon aplication of various criteria (of effective authority and democracy) subject to varying circumstances. There {{is a great deal of}} anxiety in connection with the case of South African Republic that verification <b>of</b> <b>credentials</b> could be transformed into the instrument limiting an universal character of the organization. Delaying a decision on credentials sometimes for many years (the so-called Hungarian formula) has to be considered as an inconsistency with the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> the law.

40|$|Exchange <b>of</b> {{attribute}} <b>credentials</b> is a {{means to}} establish mutual trust between strangers that wish to share resources or conduct business transactions. Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN) is an approach to regulate the exchange <b>of</b> sensitive <b>credentials</b> by using access control policies. Existing ATN work makes unrealistic simplifying assumptions about credential-representation languages and credential storage. Moreover, while existing work protects the transmission <b>of</b> <b>credentials,</b> it fails to hide the contents <b>of</b> <b>credentials,</b> thus providing uncontrolled access to potentially sensitive attributes. To protect information about sensitive attributes, we introduce the notion of attribute acknowledgment policies (Ack policies). We then introduce the trust target graph (TTG) protocol, which supports a more realistic credential language, Ack policies, and distributed storage <b>of</b> <b>credentials.</b> ...|$|R
