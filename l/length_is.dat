5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch {{between the}} shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped glans penis. Near the top, the penis is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi.

5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm <b>length</b> <b>is</b> 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail <b>length</b> <b>is</b> 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot <b>length</b> <b>is</b> 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear <b>length</b> <b>is</b> 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens.

5|$|Although {{presented}} in two-dimensional side-scrolling format, the game retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos {{in the same}} combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box {{on top of a}} switch (thus activating it), or moving a box {{to use it as a}} jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal jumping. Game <b>length</b> <b>is</b> approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E

5|$|Business M-60 (Bus. M-60) {{is a state}} {{business}} spur {{running through}} the city of Niles and adjacent townships. The spur starts at the intersection with M-51 (Main Street, 11th Street) and runs eastward along a former routing of M-60 on Oak Street through a residential section of town. Near the Berrien–Cass county line, the highway passes south of the Jerry Tyler Memorial Airport. East of the airport, the street name changes from Oak Street to Yankee Road, and Bus.

5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short <b>length</b> <b>is</b> one that {{is lower than the}} mean free path of the photons. A long distance is one that is greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.|$|E

Step <b>length</b> <b>was</b> calculated as the average of right and left step lengths. Subsequently, the ratios of step length to height and step length to lower-limb <b>length</b> <b>were</b> derived. Cadence was defined as the number of steps taken in a given time, and walk ratio was calculated as the ratio of step length to cadence.|$|R

5|$|Dentin is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 μm near the pulp, to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900nm near the dentino-enamel junction. Although {{they may have}} tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their <b>length</b> <b>is</b> dictated by the radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.|$|E

The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 meters long, 4 meters wide and west-east oriented.
