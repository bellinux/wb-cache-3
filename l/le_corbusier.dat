5|$|Extract of {{a letter}} from <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> to Antonin Raymond, 7 May 1935.|$|E
5|$|Thompson's {{description}} of the mathematical beauty {{of nature and the}} mathematical basis of the forms of animals stimulated thinkers as diverse as Julian Huxley, C. H. Waddington, Alan Turing, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Eduardo Paolozzi, <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> Christopher Alexander and Mies van der Rohe.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Tange {{began the}} {{tertiary}} studies he desired at University of Tokyo's architecture department. He studied under Hideto Kishida and Shozo Uchida. Although Tange {{was fascinated by}} the photographs of Katsura villa that sat on Kishida's desk, his work was inspired by <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b> His graduation project was a seventeen-hectare (42-acre) development set in Tokyo's Hibiya Park.|$|E
5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design {{was based on a}} circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E
5|$|Influenced from {{an early}} age by the Swiss modernist, <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> Tange gained {{international}} recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. He was a member of CIAM (Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne) in the 1950s. He did not join the group of younger CIAM architects known as Team X, though his 1960 Tokyo Bay plan was influential for Team 10 in the 1960s, as well as the group that became Metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech {{architect}} {{who had worked}} for <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a full-scale model of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork. Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be melted down to make door handles and hinges.|$|E
5|$|Professor Johannes Krahn, {{who built}} several churches and early skyscrapers {{such as the}} Beehive House in Frankfurt am Main, {{designed}} a space recalling elements of an early Romanesque Basilica. In a simple shape, a single long nave is concluded by a semicircle choir around the altar. On the right side the wall opens to a side chapel, reminiscent of a transept. The outer walls are sandstone, visible both inside and outside. Light flows in from a band of windows under the plain wooden ceiling. The combination of materials {{has been compared to}} <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b> The building recalls the austere style of sacred architecture of the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The Sanskar Kendra, one of {{the several}} {{buildings}} in Ahmedabad designed by <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> is a city museum depicting its history, art, culture and architecture. The Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Memorial have permanent displays of photographs, documents and other articles relating to Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel. The Calico Museum of Textiles has a large collection of Indian and international fabrics, garments and textiles. The Hazrat Pir Mohammad Shah Library has a collection of rare original manuscripts in Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Sindhi and Turkish. There is Vechaar Utensils Museum which has of stainless steel, glass, brass, copper, bronze, zinc and German silver tools.|$|E
5|$|After independence, modern {{buildings}} {{appeared in}} Ahmedabad. Architects given commissions {{in the city}} included Louis Kahn, who designed the IIM-A; <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> who designed the Shodhan and Sarabhai Villas, the Sanskar Kendra and the Mill Owner's Association Building, and Frank Lloyd Wright, who designed the administrative building of Calico Mills and the Calico Dome. B. V. Doshi came to the city from Paris to supervise Le Corbusier's works and later set up the School of Architecture. His local works include Sangath, Amdavad ni Gufa and the School of Architecture. Charles Correa, who became a partner of Doshi's, designed the Gandhi Ashram and Achyut Kanvinde, and the Indian Textile Industries Research Association. Christopher Charles Benninger's first work, the Alliance Française, {{is located in the}} Ellis Bridge area. Anant Raje designed major additions to Louis Kahn's IIM-A campus, namely the Ravi Mathai Auditorium and KLMD.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{received}} the commission for the Reader's Digest Building from Mrs DeWitt Wallace {{on his return}} from Japan in 1949. She wanted a design that would show the best that America could offer. The site acquired for the building was opposite the Hirakawa Gate of the Imperial Palace. Its choice was treated with great resentment by the Japanese who felt that favouritism was shown by the Occupation authorities in allowing an American company to utilise a prominent site that would have served better as a park. Taking influence from <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> Raymond responded to this criticism by masterplanning the site by using a Ville Radieuse inspired layout with the building set in gardens with sculptures by the Japanese American sculptor, Isamu Noguchi.|$|E
5|$|The six storied Baden-Powell House is {{designed}} in the modern architectural style, as pioneered by the Swiss architect <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> from the late 1920s onwards, and predominating in the 1950s. At Baden-Powell House, Tubbs made the first floor overhang the ground floor, a LeCorbusier architectural design choice to free the building from the ground, such as seen in his Pavillon Suisse at the Cité Internationale Universitaire in Paris. Additionally, LeCorbusier's Sainte Marie de La Tourette priory in Lyon shows two floors of monk's cells with small windows, cantilevered over the more open floors below, another design choice used by Tubbs in the facade of Baden-Powell House. While Tubbs created Baden-Powell House in the modern architectural style of LeCorbusier, he used more architectural restraint in his own design choices. For example, he made the main visible building component brick rather than concrete. This heavier evolution of LeCorbusier's style was popular in England throughout the post-war years until replaced by the Brutalist style in the later 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Centre <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> – Located on {{the shore}} of the Lake Zürich nearby Zürichhorn, the Centre <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> (also named: Heidi Weber Museum), is an art museum {{dedicated}} to the work of the Swiss architect <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> inside the last house he designed.|$|E
25|$|In July 2016, {{the house}} and several other works by <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> were inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.|$|E
25|$|Peter Blake, The Master Builders: <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright. New York: Norton, 1960. Reprint, 1976.|$|E
25|$|In July 2016 UNESCO listed 17 {{works by}} <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> as World Heritage Sites, {{including}} the 1959 National Museum of Western Art building.|$|E
25|$|<b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> {{asked that}} his three Japanese apprentices: Kunio Maekawa, Junzo Sakakura and Takamasa Yoshizaka be {{responsible}} for developing the detail drawings and supervising the construction.|$|E
25|$|Though <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> {{and other}} architects used {{techniques}} that are akin to collage, collage as a theoretical concept only became widely discussed {{after the publication}} of Collage City (1978) by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter.|$|E
25|$|Laprade {{was part}} of the {{editorial}} board, and one of the contributors of the avant garde urban planning magazines Plans (1930-1932), then Prelude (1932-1936), with Hubert Lagardelle, Pierre Winter, Charles Trochu, Philippe Lamour, François de Pierrefeu, <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> and Marcel Martiny.|$|E
25|$|A second Purist {{exhibition}} {{was held at}} the Galerie Druet, Paris, in 1921. In 1924 Ozenfant opened a free studio in Paris with Fernand Léger, where he taught with Aleksandra Ekster and Marie Laurencin. Ozenfant and <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> wrote La Peinture moderne in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Walter Adolph Georg Gropius (18 May 1883 – 5 July 1969) was a German {{architect}} {{and founder of}} the Bauhaus School, who, along with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> and Frank Lloyd Wright, is widely {{regarded as one of the}} pioneering masters of modernist architecture.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to painting and sculpture, the Salon included {{works in the}} decorative arts such as the glassworks of René Lalique, Julia Bathory as well as architectural designs by <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b> Still an exhibition of world importance, the Salon d'Automne is now into its 2nd century.|$|E
25|$|In his teens, he met dancer Evan Weidemann at {{the home}} of his aunt, and this aroused his {{interest}} in avant-garde art. In the late 1920s, Horst studied at Hamburg Kunstgewerbeschule, leaving there in 1930 to go to Paris to study under the architect <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Department of Architecture and Design holds {{more than}} 140,000 works, from models to {{drawings}} from the 1870s {{to the present}} day. The collection covers landscape architecture, structural engineering, and industrial design, including the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> {{constructs}} Notre Dame du Haut signaling his postmodern {{return to}} an architectural expressionism of form. He also constructs the Unité d'Habitation, which emphasizes the architectural expression of materials. The brutalist use of béton brut (reinforced concrete) recalls the expressionist use of glass, brick, and steel.|$|E
25|$|In turn, the {{thinking}} in Nordic Classicism {{became one of}} the basis for the development of Modernism in the Nordic Countries. The idea that {{there would have been a}} continuity between vernacular and modernism has been seen as counter to received historical opinion about the rise of Modernism, beginning with <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> and his 5 Points for Architecture, which are seen as overturning 5 basic principles of Classicism. A demonstration in real time of the move from Nordic Classicism to a pure Functionalism is offered by Alvar Aalto's design for the Viipuri Library (1927–35), which went through a profound transformation from the original architectural competition proposal in 1927 (owing much to Gunnar Asplund) to the severely functionalist building, completed eight years later in a purist modernist style, influenced by <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b>|$|E
25|$|Originally {{trained in}} the neo-classical style of architecture, Fry grew to favour the new modernist style, and practised with eminent colleagues {{including}} Walter Gropius, <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> and Pierre Jeanneret. Fry was {{a major influence on}} a generation of young architects. Among the younger colleagues with whom he worked was Denys Lasdun.|$|E
25|$|Tourism in Indian Punjab centres {{around the}} {{historic}} palaces, battle sites, {{and the great}} Sikh architecture {{of the state and}} the surrounding region. Examples include various sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, the ancient fort of Bathinda, the architectural monuments of Kapurthala, Patiala, and Chandigarh, the modern capital designed by <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite honours {{and praise}} on the {{occasions}} of Hoffmann’s 80th and 85th birthdays, he was virtually forgotten {{by the time}} of his death. Although his true stature and contribution were acknowledged by such masters as Alvar Aalto, <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> Gio Ponti and Carlo Scarpa, the younger generation of architects and historians ignored him.|$|E
25|$|The G59 also fostered modern urban {{development}} visions. Ernst Baumann and Willi Neukom {{were given the}} task of developing a reuse plan for the G59 grounds. They considered a project {{similar to the one}} of <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b> Even though such artistic utopias had been widely discussed, the Seefeld and Enge districts preserved their structural layout.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> {{was asked}} by the Japanese {{government}} to design the National Museum of Western Art in Tōkyō. He was assisted by his three former students: Maekawa, Sakakura and Takamasa Yoshizaka. The design was based upon Le Corbusier's museum in Ahmedabad, and both of the museums are square and raised on piloti.|$|E
25|$|Henry Thomas Cadbury-Brown RA (20 May 1913 – 9 July 2009) was an English architect. He {{was educated}} at the Architecture Association {{where he was}} {{influenced}} by the architecture of <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> and Walter Gropius. After graduating he worked for architect Ernő Goldfinger and became his lifelong friend. He went on to set up his own successful practice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> {{designed}} a masterplan {{to include the}} area surrounding the museum. The design itself evolved into a building far exceeding the original brief and the library, a small lecture hall and a room for distinguished guests had to be removed. Nonetheless the removed elements were retained on the plans to provide guidance for future extension.|$|E
25|$|From 1930, Lambert-Rucki {{became one}} of the pioneers of Modern Religious Art. In 1931, he became {{an active member of the}} Union des Artistes Modernes (UAM), where he {{exhibited}} alongside René Herbst, Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (<b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier),</b> Robert Mallet-Stevens, the architect Georges-Henri Pingusson, Jean Fouquet (for whom he made jewelery), in exhibits that emphasized design over decoration.|$|E
25|$|Nadir Afonso, GOSE (4 December 1920 – 11 December 2013) was a Portuguese {{geometric}} abstractionist painter. Formally {{trained in}} architecture, which he practiced {{early in his}} career with <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> and Oscar Niemeyer, Nadir Afonso later studied painting in Paris and became one of the pioneers of Kinetic art, working alongside Victor Vasarely, Fernand Léger, Auguste Herbin, and André Bloc.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1950s, some salons {{were held}} by ladies mixing {{political}} men and intellectuals during the IVth Republic, like Mme Abrami, or Mme Dujarric de La Rivière. The last salons in Paris {{were those of}} Marie-Laure de Noailles, with Jean Cocteau, Igor Markevitch, Salvador Dalí, etc., Marie-Blanche de Polignac (Jeanne Lanvin's daughter) and Madeleine and Robert Perrier, with Josephine Baker, <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> Django Reinhardt, etc.|$|E
25|$|Some twentieth-century {{artists and}} architects, {{including}} <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> and Dalí, have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially {{in the form}} of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing. The golden ratio appears in some patterns in nature, including the spiral arrangement of leaves and other plant parts.|$|E
