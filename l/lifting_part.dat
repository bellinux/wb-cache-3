5000|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{think that}} one of Kierkegaard's greatest contributions to philosophy is his critique of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Indeed, many of Kierkegaard's works are written in response to or as a critique of Hegel. Although Kierkegaard strongly criticized some aspects of Hegelian philosophy, his work also shows that he was also positively influenced by Hegel, and had respect for Hegel himself. [...] Now everything is set in motion, and usually this also involves making the system popular — per systema influxus physici it lays hold of all men. How Kant was treated in his time is well known, and therefore I need only mention the infinite mass of lexicons, summaries, popular presentations, and explanations for everyman, etc. And how did Hegel fare later, Hegel, the most modern philosopher, who because of his rigorous form would most likely command silence? Has not the logical trinity been advanced in the most ludicrous way? And therefore it did not astound me that my shoemaker had found that it could also be applied to the development of boots, since, as he observes, the dialectic, which is always the first stage in life, finds expression even here, however insignificant this may seem, in the squeaking, which surely has not escaped the attention of some more profound research psychologist. Unity, however, appears only later, in which respect his shoes far surpass all others, which usually disintegrate in the dialectic, a unity which reached the highest level in that pair of boots Carl XII wore on his famous ride, and since he as an orthodox shoemaker proceeded from the thesis that the immediate (feet without shoes — shoes without feet) is a pure abstraction and took it dialectical as the first stage in the development. And now our modern politicians! By veritably taking up Hegel, they have given a striking example of the way one can serve two masters, in that their revolutionary striving is paired with a life-outlook which is a remedy for it, an excellent remedy for <b>lifting</b> <b>part</b> of the illusion which is necessary for encouraging their fantastic striving. And the actuality of the phenomenon will surely not be denied if one recalls that the words [...] "immediate or spontaneous unity" [...] occur just as necessarily in every scientific-scholarly treatise as a brunette or a blonde in every well-ordered romantic household. At the happy moment everyone received a copy of Holy Scriptures, in which there was one book which was almost always too brief and sometimes almost invisible, and this was, I regret — the Acts of the Apostles. And how curious it is to note that the present age, whose social striving is trumpeted quite enough, is ashamed of the monks and nuns of the Middle Ages, when at the same time, to confine ourselves to our own native land, a society has been formed here which seems to embrace almost the entire kingdom and in which a speaker began thus: Dear Brothers and Sisters. How remarkable to see them censure the Jesuitry of the Middle Ages, since precisely the liberal development, as does every one-sided enthusiasm, has led and must lead to that. And now Christianity — how has it been treated? I share entirely your disapproval of the way every Christian concept has become so volatilized, so completely dissolved in a mass of fog, that it is beyond all recognition. To the concepts of faith, incarnation, tradition, inspiration, which in the Christian sphere are to lead to a particular historical fact, the philosophers choose to give an entirely different, ordinary meaning, whereby faith has become the immediate consciousness, which essentially is nothing other than the vitale Fluidum of mental life, its atmosphere, and tradition has become the content of a certain experience of the world, while inspiration has become nothing more than God's breathing of the life-spirit into man, and incarnation no more than the presence of one or another idea in one or more individuals. — Journals IA 328 1836 or 1837 ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Several low- {{and middle-income}} {{countries}} have exempted patients from user fees in certain categories of population or of services. These exemptions are {{very effective in}} <b>lifting</b> <b>part</b> of the financial barrier to access to services, {{but they have been}} organized within unstable health systems where there are sometimes numerous dysfunctions. The objective {{of this article is to}} bring to light the disruptions triggered by exemption policies in health systems of low- and middle-income countries. Methods Scoping review of 23 scientific articles. The data were synthesized according to the six essential functions of health systems. Results The disruptions included specifically: 1) immediate and significant increases in service utilization; 2) perceived heavier workloads for health workers, feelings of being exploited and overworked, and decline in morale; 3) lack of information about free services provided and their reimbursement; 4) unavailability of drugs and delays in the distribution of consumables; 5) unpredictable and insufficient funding, revenue losses for health centres, reimbursement delays; 6) the multiplicity of actors and the difficulty of identifying who is responsible (‘no blame’ game), and deficiencies in planning and communication. Conclusions These disruptive elements give us an idea of what is to be expected if exemption policies do not put in place all the required conditions in terms of preparation, planning and complementary measures. There is a lack of knowledge on the effects of exemptions on all the functions of health systems because so few studies have been carried out from this perspective. </p...|$|E

40|$|Burrowing was {{investigated}} in two Antarctic infaunal bivalve molluscs, Laternula elliptica and Yoldia eightsi, representing amongst the least and most active {{members of the class}} Bivalvia in the Southern Ocean. Burrowing rate was expressed via the Burrowing Rate Index (BRI=[(3) rootwet weight/time to bury]x 10 (4)), and produced values of 0. 1 - 10. 6 for L. elliptica and 8. 8 - 49. 8 for Y. eightsi. These compare with values ranging from 3 to 2, 000 for N. American bivalves (mean= 222, SE= 42. 6, n= 81), and 200 to 2, 200 for Hong Kong bivalves (mean= 1, 140, SE= 346, n= 6). Values for the Antarctic species are, therefore, low compared to warmer-water bivalves, and the values below 1 for large L. elliptica are the lowest on record by around x 5. There is no compensation of burrowing activity for low temperature in these species. The relative BRI values for L. elliptica and Y. eightsi reflect the differences in their mode of life, with the former being large, sedentary and suspension-feeding, and the latter being smaller, mobile, ploughing through the sediment and feeding on sediment-surface organic matter. Burrowing in L. elliptica is unexpected, because other members of the Laternulidae do not burrow. This ability is most probably a response to the regular disturbance of sediments in Antarctica by ice, and the strong selective advantage to being able to resume a protected position after disturbance. The burrowing cycle in L. elliptica is composed of three main phases: (1) foot extension and sediment penetration; (2) foot dilation to form an anchor; (3) the drawing down of the shell by contraction of the pedal retractor muscles. Burrowing in Y. eightsi also has three phases: (1) foot extension and penetration of the sediment (digging); (2) rocking movements in the upright position; (3) shell anchorage. In excess of burrowing activity, L. elliptica exhibits a unique suite of movements when exposed at the surface. These comprise levering, where the tips of the siphons are pressed against the sediment to lift the shell from the substratum, looping, where the siphons are extended and rotated and, in the process, translocate the whole animal across the sediment, and jetting, where water is ejected forcibly through the siphons while their tips are directed towards the sediment, <b>lifting</b> <b>part</b> or all of the animal clear of the substratum. In the field, following exhumation by icebergs, these activities serve to place the animal in a favourable position for reburial, which is a clear advantage in disturbed polar environments where predatory nemerteans and asteroids are abundant...|$|E
40|$|In The Netherlands, {{the modern}} way of tomato {{production}} involves a high wire system. Here, metal hooks hold a rope that guides the growing tomato plant. Because the plants keep growing during the season, each rope {{is to be}} lowered periodically, which requires one-handed lifting. Because each plant weighs 4 - 6 kg and a complete cycle costs only 1 - 2 seconds, the task {{is considered to be}} strenuous and highly repetitive. Some alternative systems are available or under development, but their eventual load relieving effect is unknown. The present study considered some alternative systems from a theoretical viewpoint and investigated the effects of one particular alternative hook, the Tomguide. This hook eliminates most of the <b>lifting</b> <b>part</b> of the task because of application of a reel on which the rope is winded. The research involved seven experienced persons in six companies. All of the persons performed both tasks, i. e. the standard hook and the Tomguide. Muscular loading, experienced effort and working speed were measured during and after each task. Muscular loading was measured in four shoulder (trapezius and deltoid, left and right side) and two upper arm (biceps, left and right) muscles, applying electromyography (EMG). Static, median and peak load, relative to maximal activation, were calculated. Experienced effort was scored using a 10 -point rating scale and a body diagram showing 14 body regions. EMG results showed a significant decrease in peak activity for both upper arm muscles when using the Tomguide. Median activity was reduced only for the right upper arm. If all 6 muscles were pooled, peak activity was reduced significantly, while median activity showed a tendency, without reaching significance. No difference was measured for any of the individual shoulder muscles measured. Experienced effort decreased significantly for the shoulder and upper arm regions, both left and right, in case of the Tomguide. It was observed that the Tomguide task lead to an increase in working time by 27 %, compared to the standard hook, possibly partly due to insufficiently functioning of the mechanical brake on the reel. It is concluded that the Tomguide, and probably also comparable reel rope systems, contribute to a reduction of muscular load, in particular of the upper arm muscles, because lifting of the plants is strongly reduced. Because most workers copy their working height for the standard hook into the new situation, attention must be paid to instruction of the proper working height, in order to prevent unnecessarily high load of the shoulder muscles. Besides, final conclusions of the labour demand can only be drawn if the reel system applied is functioning well. The braking system of the Tomguide tested here did not allow for a relaxed working technique...|$|E
