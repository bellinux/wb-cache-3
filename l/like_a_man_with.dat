500|$|In the 1950 Technicolor western, Comanche Territory, O'Hara {{played an}} unusual {{role as the}} lead {{character}} of Katie Howards, a fiery saloon owner who dresses, behaves and fights <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>with</b> hair tied back. She [...] "mastered the American bullwhip" [...] during the filming, [...] in a role which Crowther believed was [...] "more significant than a setting sun" [...] in that she [...] "tackles her assignment with so much relish {{that the rest of}} the cast, even the Indians, are completely subdued." [...] She received first billing above co-star Macdonald Carey. O'Hara then appeared as Countess D'Arneau opposite John Payne in Tripoli, directed by O'Hara's second husband, William Houston Price. She was next cast by John Ford in the western Rio Grande, the final installment of his cavalry trilogy. It was the first of five films to be made over 22 years with John Wayne, including The Quiet Man (1952), The Wings of Eagles (1957), McLintock! (1963) and Big Jake (1971), the first three of which were directed by Ford. O'Hara declared that [...] "from our very first scenes together, working with John Wayne was comfortable for me". Her chemistry with Wayne was so powerful that over the years many people assumed that they were married, and newspapers occasionally published sensationalist stories from people claiming to be their love child. In April 1951, she received a call from Universal Pictures that she was cast as a Tunisian princess named Tanya in the swashbuckler film, Flame of Araby (1951). O'Hara [...] "despised" [...] the film and everything it stood for, [...] but had no choice but to make the film or be suspended. By that point of time, she began to grow tired of the roles she was offered and wanted to perform roles that had more depth than the ones she had done thus far.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{prior to}} the group's break up, Noel characterised Liam as [...] "rude, arrogant, intimidating and lazy. He's the angriest man you'll ever meet. He's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a fork {{in a world of}} soup." [...] The final straw for the band came at the Rock En Seine festival in Paris when an altercation between the {{brothers}} (subsequently described by Noel as [...] "no physical violence but {{there was a lot of}} World Wrestling Federation stuff") {{prior to the}}ir performance resulted in the destruction of one of Noel's guitars and saw him announce his departure from the group.|$|E
2500|$|Chocolate Factory {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 10 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times found the album [...] "elegant and strange". Mojo stated, [...] "Chocolate Factory seems positively inspired... An impressively varied opus", and BBC Online stated [...] " [...] doesn't sound <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> {{the weight of}} the world on his shoulders, but a revived soul in spiritual euphoria." [...] Sterling Clover of The Village Voice noted the album's [...] "quantity and consistency of sonic presence" [...] and praised Kelly's performance with respect to his songs' structures, stating [...] "Kelly has sussed how to ground himself in tight rhythmic bass and a solid backup chorus, refiguring them into layered and discontinuous sheets of sound". Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis cited Chocolate Factory as [...] "among the best work of his career" [...] and went on to write [...] "... as a singer, songwriter and producer, he's at the top of his game." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1976, Seger and the Silver Bullet Band {{released}} the album Live Bullet, recorded over two nights in Detroit's Cobo Arena in September 1975. It contained Seger's rendition of [...] "Nutbush City Limits" [...] {{as well as}} Seger's own classic take on life on the road, [...] "Turn the Page", from Back in '72. It also included his late 1960s successful releases – [...] "Heavy Music" [...] and [...] "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man". Critic Dave Marsh later wrote that [...] "Live Bullet {{is one of the}} best live albums ever made ... In spots, particularly during the medley of [...] "Travelin' Man"/"Beautiful Loser" [...] on side one, Seger sounds <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> one last shot at the top." [...] An instant best-seller in Detroit, Live Bullet began to get attention in other parts of the country, selling better than Seger's previous albums, getting progressive rock radio and album-oriented rock airplay, and enabling Seger to headline more shows. Yet still, Seger had a popularity imbalance. In June 1976, he was a featured performer at the Pontiac Silverdome outside Detroit in front of nearly 80,000 fans. The next night, Seger played before fewer than a thousand people in Chicago.|$|E
