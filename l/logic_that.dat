5|$|In the Introduction, Off {{explains}} the animal metaphors. Roméo Dallaire is the 'lion' because he acted courageously with {{an appearance of}} control and confidence. Lewis MacKenzie compared to a 'fox' because while he made a brave and dramatic defense of the airport, and was trusted by outside observers, his actions in recommending against intervention {{were based on the}} cunning <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> all sides were, at least, partly responsible for the conflict. Louise Arbour is portrayed as the 'eagle' for her pursuit of justice and her use of surprise SWAT-like arrests.|$|E
5|$|Jerold J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke, in {{the book}} The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode {{stresses}} abductive reasoning, a type of <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> goes from data or a description of something to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks to explain relevant evidence. Abductive reasoning follows the logic: a surprising fact, C, is observed (Result); If A, the hypothesis, were true, C would make perfect sense (Rule); Thus, {{there is reason to}} suspect that A is true (Case). An example that has been given is: the lawn is wet. But if it is raining, then it would be unsurprising that the lawn is wet. Therefore, it is raining. This logical method is favored by Mulder throughout most of the show. In this episode, however, it is Scully who first uses the method. She takes three separate facts—the massive size of some types of mushrooms, the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi, and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants—and formulates an abductive conclusion: she and Mulder are trapped underground, experiencing a hallucination, and slowly being digested.|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} from a theory that turned out trivial to a consistent replacement need not proceed in terms of inconsistencies, which are negation gluts. <b>Logics</b> <b>that</b> tolerate gluts or gaps (or both) with respect to any logical symbol may serve as the lower limit for adaptive <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> assign a minimally abnormal consequence set to a given premise set. The same obtains for <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> tolerate a combination of kinds of gluts and gaps. This result runs counter to the obsession with inconsistency that classical logicians and paraconsistent logicians share.|$|R
40|$|Para{{definite}} (`beyond the definite 2 ̆ 7) <b>logics</b> are <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> can be {{used for}} handling contradictory or partial information. As such, paradefinite logics should be both paraconsistent and paracomplete. In this paper we consider the simplest semantic framework for defining paradefinite logics, consisting of four-valued matrices, and study the better accepted <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> are induced by these matrices...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{expressive}} {{power of}} temporal branching time <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> use the modalities EX and EF is described. Forbidden pattern characterizations are given for tree languages definable in three logics: EX, EF and EX+EF.

25|$|Controller classes contain <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> {{links the}} models to their views, and {{maintains}} state {{to keep them}} synchronized.|$|E
25|$|In {{a digital}} circuit, an FSM may be built using a {{programmable}} logic device, a programmable logic controller, logic gates and flip flops or relays. More specifically, a hardware implementation requires a register to store state variables, {{a block of}} combinational <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> determines the state transition, and a second block of combinational <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> determines the output of an FSM. One of the classic hardware implementations is the Richards controller.|$|E

40|$|We {{show the}} first {{examples}} of recursively enumerable (even decidable) two-dimensional products of finitely axiomatisable modal <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> are not finitely axiomatisable. In particular, {{we show that}} any axiomatisation of some bimodal <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> are determined by classes of product frames with linearly ordered first components must be infinite in two senses: It should contain infinitely many propositional variables, and formulas of arbitrarily large modal nesting-depth. ...|$|R

25|$|Gödel's incompleteness theorems are two theorems of {{mathematical}} <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> demonstrate the inherent limitations of every formal axiomatic system containing basic arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|The formal <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> emerged {{early in}} the 20th century also requires, at minimum, unary {{negation}} and quantified variables ranging over some universe of discourse.|$|E
25|$|Sequence control, {{in which}} a {{programmed}} sequence of discrete operations is performed, often based on system <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> involves system states. An elevator control system {{is an example of}} sequence control.|$|E

40|$|Precontact logics are propositional modal <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> {{have been}} {{recently}} considered {{in order to}} obtain decidable fragments of the region-based theories of space introduced by De Laguna and Whitehead. We give the definition of Sahlqvist formulas to this regionbased setting and we prove correspondence and canonicity results. Together, these results give rise to a completeness result for precontact <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> are axiomatized by Sahlqvist axioms.

40|$|Focusing on {{corporate}} responsibility (CR) toward employees, {{this article discusses}} how multilayered institutional logics affect {{the relationship between the}} firm and its employee stakeholders. It considers what constitutes CR toward employees and explores the institutional <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> can shape whether employers treat their employees as merely means to a strategic end or as ends in themselves. Specifically, the article examines market-, state-, professional-, and firm-based institutional <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> influence how employers treat their employees. The conclusion suggests <b>that</b> external institutional <b>logics</b> both enable and constrain firms to adopt a more instrumental relationship with their employees. However, some forms of organizational identity may generate firm-based institutional <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> enable firms to resist these pressures. Suggestions for future research focusing on the institutional and organizational drivers behind understanding CR toward employees are offered...|$|R
25|$|In 1854, British {{mathematician}} George Boole {{published a}} landmark paper detailing an algebraic system of <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> would {{become known as}} Boolean algebra. His logical calculus was to become instrumental {{in the design of}} digital electronic circuitry.|$|E
25|$|In {{the logic}} L∞ω, {{arbitrary}} conjunctions or disjunctions are allowed when building formulas, {{and there is}} an unlimited supply of variables. More generally, the <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> permits conjunctions or disjunctions with less than κ constituents is known as Lκω. For example, Lω1ω permits countable conjunctions and disjunctions.|$|E
25|$|The {{table of}} {{primitive}} polynomials shows how LFSRs {{can be arranged}} in Fibonacci or Galois form to give maximal periods. One can obtain any other period by adding to an LFSR that has a longer period some <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> shortens the sequence by skipping some states.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{the history of}} the application of logic in a quite popular paradigm in contemporary computer science and artificial intelligence, viz. the area of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. In particular we discuss the <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> have been used to specify single agents, the so-called BDI <b>logics,</b> modal <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> describe the beliefs, desires and intentions of agents, after which we turn to <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> are used for specifying multi-agent systems. On the one hand these include extensions of BDI-like logics for multiple agents such as common knowledge and mutual intention, on the other hand, when there are multiple agents into play there are also issues to be dealt with that go beyond these extended individual attitudes, such as normative and strategic reasoning. We sketch also the history of this field. 1 Introductio...|$|R

40|$|Monomodal logic has {{exactly two}} maximally normal logics, {{which are also}} the only quasi-normal <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> are Post {{complete}}, and they are complete for validity in Kripke frames. Here we show that addition of a propositional constant to monomodal logic allows the construction of continuum many maximally normal <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> are not valid in any Kripke frame, or even in any complete modal algebra. We also construct continuum many quasi-normal Post complete <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> are not normal. The set of extensions of S 4. 3 is radically altered {{by the addition of}} a constant: we use it to construct continuum many such normal extensions of S 4. 3, and continuum many non-normal ones, none of which have the finite model property. But for logics with weakly transitive frames there are only eight maximally normal ones, of which five extend K 4 and three extend S 4. ...|$|R
25|$|Thomas Bayes {{attempted}} {{to provide a}} <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> could handle varying degrees of confidence; as such, Bayesian probability {{is an attempt to}} recast the representation of probabilistic statements as an expression of the degree of confidence by which the beliefs they express are held.|$|E
25|$|Among some Jews, {{a man who}} {{has reached}} the age of 83 will {{celebrate}} a second bar mitzvah, under the <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> in the Torah it says that a normal lifespan is 70 years, so that an 83-year-old can be considered 13 in a second lifetime. This practice has become increasingly uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Metalogic {{programming}} allows object-level and metalevel representations to be combined, as {{in natural}} language. It {{can also be}} used to implement any <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> is specified by means of inference rules. Metalogic is used in logic programming to implement metaprograms, which manipulate other programs, databases, knowledge bases or axiomatic theories as data.|$|E
5000|$|The Lindenbaum algebra of most <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> support {{conjunction}} and disjunction is a distributive lattice, i.e. [...] "and" [...] distributes over [...] "or" [...] {{and vice}} versa.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} automatically verifying programs that manipulate a dynamic heap, maintaining complex and multiple data-structures, given modular pre-post conditions and loop invariants. We discuss specification logics for heaps, and discuss two classes of automatic procedures for reasoning with these logics. The first identifies fragments of <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> admit completely decidable reasoning. The second is a new approach called the natural proof method that builds proof procedures for very expressive <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> are automatic and sound (but incomplete), and that embody natural proof tactics learnt from manual verification...|$|R
25|$|The audience, {{which had}} {{gathered}} to hear Karnad speak, had mixed {{reactions to the}} speech. Some, like organizer Anil Dharker, tried ineffectually to steer the speech to more politically correct waters. Others were amused by the episode, and some commented on the research and <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> {{had gone into the}} speech (unfortunately overshadowed by its 'scandalous' nature).|$|E
25|$|Heyting algebras {{play the}} same role for intuitionistic <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> {{interior}} algebras play for the modal logic S4 and Boolean algebras play for propositional logic. The relation between Heyting algebras and interior algebras reflects the relationship between intuitionistic logic and S4, in which one can interpret theories of intuitionistic logic as S4 theories closed under necessity.|$|E
25|$|Set {{theory is}} {{a branch of}} {{mathematical}} <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects {{that are relevant to}} mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, infinitary <b>logic</b> studies <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> allow {{infinitely}} long {{statements and}} proofs. In such a logic, one can regard the existential quantifier, for instance, as derived from an infinitary disjunction.|$|R
