50|$|Stejskal, Öckert, and Bjørklund (2013) {{studied the}} {{frequency}} and clinical relevance of metal allergy in 15 fibromyalgia patients. Metal allergy was measured by a <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test,</b> MELISA. Ten healthy age matched women were used as controls. Reduction of metal exposure in the fibromyalgia patients was achieved by replacement of dental metal restorations and by the avoidance of known sources of metal exposure. Objective health assessment was performed five years after treatment. Subjective health assessment was established by a questionnaire, completed two, five {{and in some cases}} ten years after the start of the study. Follow-up MELISA was also performed. All patients with fibromyalgia tested positive to {{at least one of the}} metals tested. Objective examination five years later showed that half of the patients no longer fulfilled the fibromyalgia diagnosis, 20% had improved and the remaining 30% still had fibromyalgia. All patients reported subjective health improvement.|$|E
50|$|Stejskal, Reynolds, and Bjørklund (2015) {{examined}} {{the frequency of}} metal allergy in 38 patients with connective tissue disorders. Of these patients, 16 had rheumatoid arthritis, 13 had Sjögren’s syndrome, and nine had systemic lupus erythematosus. A control group of 43 healthy age and sex-matched subjects {{were included in the}} study. Metal allergy was evaluated using the optimized <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> MELISA. For all subjects, the primary source of metal exposure was dental metal restorations. Most of the tested patients (87%) reacted to at least one metal, and many (63%) reacted to two or more of the tested metals. 43% of the healthy subjects in the study reacted to one metal, and 18% reacted to two or more metals. The increased frequency of metal allergy in the patient group compared with the control group was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). The most frequent allergens in the study were nickel, mercury, gold, and palladium.|$|E

40|$|In seven {{patients}} with chronic beryllium disease (Be) the Be <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> was positive in 100 %, independent of steroid therapy, and was reproducible. The Be macrophage migration inhibition test was only positive in four of seven patients (57 %) not on steroids, and was not reproducible. In 72 potentially exposed healthy beryllium workers the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> was negative in all subjects. The macrophage test was positive in four of 78 and again the results were not reproducible. The workers with positive results showed no differences in age, type or duration of employment from those with negative results and showed no evidence of disease. In addition, the macrophage test was positive in two of 45 non-exposed control subjects. We also confirmed the above advantages of the lymphocyte transformation technique by using tuberculin antigen (PPD). The PPD <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> gave positive results in approximately 60 % of healthy beryllium workers, but the PPD macrophage test was only positive in 7 %. We conclude that the Be <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> is the most sensitive and reproducible and advocate its use in the diagnosis of disease and in monitoring the health of potentially exposed workers...|$|E
40|$|The {{brucellin}} {{skin test}} and the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> were compared in heifers infected with virulent Brucella abortus strain 544, heifers vaccinated against brucellosis and unexposed cattle. Results of the in vitro <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> were consistently positive for all 9 Brucella-infected heifers while the skin test was consistently positive for 6 of the 9 heifers. In 7 heifers repeatedly vaccinated with B. abortus strain- 19 vaccine the in vitro test classified 3 animals as positive whereas the skin test identified all the animals as infected {{during most of the}} experimental period. Four heifers injected with a single dose of B. abortus strain 19 were consistently negative to the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> while the skin test classified all the animals as infected during most of the experimental period. The skin test gave strong reactions indicative of Brucella infection in heifers vaccinated with 'Duphavac' and 'Abortox' vaccines whereas the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> was consistently negative with these vaccines. The two tests were negative in unexposed cattle. It was concluded that the in vitro test correlated better with Brucella isolation than the in vivo test did and that the lack of agreement between the results of the two tests is likely to be due to the different antigens used in the assays...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{generalized}} exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) {{is a rare}} cutaneous eruption {{which is}} often provoked by drugs. CASE REPORT: We report 2 cases of AGEP which showed rapidly spreading pustular eruptions accompanied by malaise, fever and neutrophilia after the administration of systemic prednisolone (corticosteroid of group A, hydrocortisone type). The histological examination showing neutrophilic subcorneal spongiform pustules {{was consistent with the}} diagnosis of AGEP. In both cases the rash cleared within a week upon treatment with topical steroids (corticosteroid of group D 1, betamethasonedipropionate type and corticosteroid of group D 2, hydrocortisone- 17 -butyrate type). Three months after recovery, the sensitization to corticosteroids of group A was confirmed by epicutaneous <b>testing</b> and positive <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>tests.</b> CONCLUSION: These cases show that systemic corticosteroids can induce AGEP and demonstrate that epicutaneous <b>testing</b> and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>tests</b> may be helpful in identifying the causative drug. Our data support previous reports indicating an important role for drug-specific T cells in inducing neutrophil inflammation in this disease...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{sensitization}} to rabbit liver specific lipoprotein (RLSP) {{has been}} investigated using a <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> in patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH). A stimulation index greater than 2 was recorded in twenty out of twenty-five cases (eight of ten HBsAg positive and twelve of fiteen HBsAg negative) while values were lower than 2 in all the normal subjects. These results confirm the finding of sensitization to LSP in chronic active hepatitis irrespective of HBsAg status and show that rabbit LSP {{can be used as}} an alternative to the human antigen in the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test,</b> and is further evidence that this liver membrane lipoprotein has antigenic determinants which have species-cross-reactivity...|$|E
40|$|A {{whole blood}} <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> {{was used to}} examine cattle with varying degrees of {{infection}} with Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. Minimally infected animals characteristically responded to johnin purified protein derivative in the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test</b> but did not routinely react on serological and/or skin testing. Heavily infected animals showed considerable variation in their lymphocyte transformation responses to antigen and some of them were consistently unresponsive. Antigen induced lymphocyte transformation reactions were recorded in 7. 6 to 41. 5 % of uninfected animals whose infection status was determined by bacteriology and/or histopathology. The number of positive reactions recorded in uninfected animals depended on the population, the larger percentage being found in a herd with a proven history of paratuberculosis. The potential of lymphocyte transformation as a diagnostic test for bovine paratuberculosis is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{specific}} cell-mediated immune responses in human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections was studied by an in vitro <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test,</b> using a whole blood culture. CMV-induced in vitro lymphocyte proliferation was mainly {{dependent on the}} presence of sensitized T-cells. Three of five seronegative patients with B-cell deficiency showed positive lymphocyte responses to CMV antigen. In contrast, a patient with ataxia-telangiectasia who was shedding the virus in urine did not show a cellular response to either CMV or phytohemagglutinin. Age-related differences were found in the CMV <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>test.</b> The responses were generally low (P less than 0. 025) in infants and higher in older children and adults.

40|$|BACKGROUND Patients with Stevens-Johnson {{syndrome}} (SJS) or {{toxic epidermal necrolysis}} (TEN) {{are often}} exposed simultaneously to a few potentially culprit drugs. However, both the standard <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>tests</b> (LTT) with proliferation as the assay end-point as well as skin tests, if done, are often negative. OBJECTIVE As provocation tests are considered too dangerous, there is an urgent need to identify the relevant drug in SJS/TEN and to improve sensitivity of tests {{able to identify the}} causative drug. METHODS Fifteen patients with SJS/TEN with the ALDEN score ≥ 6 and 18 drug-exposed controls were included. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and cultured under defined conditions with drugs. LTT was compared to the following end-points: cytokine levels in cell culture supernatant, number of granzyme B secreting cells by ELISpot and intracellular staining for granulysin and IFNγ in CD 3 (+) CD 4 (+), CD 3 (+) CD 8 (+) and NKp 46 (+) cells. To further enhance sensitivity, the effect of IL- 7 /IL- 15 pre-incubation of PBMC was evaluated.

A lymphocyte proliferative response to titanium chloride was observed on two separate occasions; no responses to the other metals were shown. These results are consistent with hypersensitivity to titanium, and suggest, in this individual, a possible aetiological role between the inhalation of titanium and a granulomatous disease process...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>tests</b> (LTT) are {{time-consuming}} radioactive assays used in {{the clinic}} for the determination of allergic drug reactions and extensively in basic immunological research. In the present study we propose an alternative method in the monitoring of T-cell responses by isothermal microcalorimetric (IMC) measurements of overall cellular heat production {{as a function of}} time. For mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, we analyzed a concentration dependent effect of phytohemaglutinin (PHA) and both tests showed a good correlation. This was also the case for specific antigenic stimulation with Varidase(R) or tetanus toxoid. On the other hand, antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation analyzed by pre and post influenza vaccine (Inflexal(R) V) samples, showed no such correlation. Our study suggests that IMC measurements, despite the advantages of simplicity, on-line recording of metabolic activity and no use of radioactivity, may be limited to monitoring mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} protective immunogens against Microsporum canis infection, a purified recombinant keratinolytic metalloprotease (r-MEP 3) was tested as a subunit vaccine in experimentally infected guinea pigs. Both humoral and cellular specific immune responses developing towards r-MEP 3 were evaluated, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by in vitro <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>tests</b> respectively. Vaccination induced a strong antibody response, and a significant but transient lymphoproliferative response against the protein. However, the protocol failed to prevent fungal invasion or development of dermatophytic lesions. These results show that under the present experimental conditions, r-MEP 3 specific antibodies are not protective against a challenge exposure. They also suggest that in the same model, the induction of cell-mediated immunity towards r-MEP 3 is not sufficient, indicating {{the need for further}} research in the field of specific immune mechanisms involved in M. canis dermatophytosis.
