40|$|Patients {{considered}} to have a possible disorder of the circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were prospectively randomized on clinical and computed tomographic grounds into one <b>of</b> four categories: <b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a disorder of circulation of the CSF (n = 14); high <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a disorder of the circulation of the CSF (n = 10); <b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> shunt malfunction (n = 10); and high <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> shunt malfunction (n = 9). Patients with possible disorders of the circulation of the CSF who {{did not meet the}} entry criteria for each of these categories were excluded from this study. A ventricular catheter connected to a subgaleal Rickham reservoir not in continuity with a shunt system (if this was present) either was inserted into each patient or was in place from previous surgery. Infusion studies were conducted by the infusion of 1 ml/min of normal saline through a 25 -gauge needle inserted through the skin into the Rickham reservoir. A separate 25 -gage needle was inserted into the Rickham reservoir for continuous recording of intracranial pressure. There were 43 infusion studies that were included in the four categories. Recordings of baseline intracranial pressure for a high <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a disorder of the circulation of the CSF did not differ significantly from a <b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a disorder of the circulation of the CSF. Baseline intracranial pressure for a high <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> shunt malfunction was significantly higher than the <b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a disorder of the circulation of the CSF group and the <b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> shunt malfunction group; there was, however, marked overlap in values between these groups. On the other hand, resistance to infusion was no greater than 12 mm Hg ml- 1 /min- 1 for all patients with a <b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a disorder of the circulation of the CSF and no less than 14 mm Hg ml- 1 /min- 1 in both the high <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a disorder of the circulation of the CSF and the high <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> shunt malfunction. This result was significant. The results indicate that this test, which may be applied in an outpatient setting, could be a practical and useful addition to the current methods of the assessment of the circulation of the CSF. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Background: Diagnostic scoring is used {{to stratify}} {{patients}} with suspected appendicitis into three groups: high, intermediate, and <b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> appendicitis. The stratification {{can be used for}} selective imaging to avoid the harms of radiation without compromising diagnostic accuracy. The aim was to study how stratification by Adult Appendicitis Score affects diagnostic performance of imaging studies. Methods: Analysis of 822 patients who underwent diagnostic imaging for suspected appendicitis was made. Adult Appendicitis Score was used to stratify patients into groups of high, intermediate, and <b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> appendicitis. Diagnostic performance of computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) was compared between these patient groups. Results: After scoring, pre-test <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> appendicitis ranged from 9 - 16 % in <b>low</b> <b>probability</b> group to 75 - 79 % in high probability group in patients who underwent US or CT. Post-test <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> appendicitis after positive CT was 99, 91, and 75 % in high probability, intermediate <b>probability</b> and <b>low</b> <b>probability</b> groups, respectively, p < 0. 001.

They were noted for their attractive LPI (<b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> intercept), LPIin (<b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> identification), and LPD (<b>low</b> <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> detection) characteristics. Using ultra-wideband noise as a radar transmit signal has {{the added benefit of}} achieving high-resolution imagery, in both down-range and cross-range dimensions using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique. ^ A coherent ultra-wideband random noise radar system operating in the 1 – 2 GHz frequency range has been developed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. A unique signal processing procedure based upon heterodyne correlation techniques preserves phase coherence within the system, thereby enabling it to be used for synthetic aperture radar imaging. Original experimental setup facilitates a simple and low-cost mobile SAR implementation, best suited for short-range quasi-stripmap SAR imaging. This dissertation develops the theoretical formulation and addresses practical implementation of UWB random noise SAR. It also investigates the potential of a coherent continuous-wave (CW) bandlimited random noise radar as an inexpensive, electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) capable, radio-frequency interference (RFI) resistant imaging instrument. ...|$|R
