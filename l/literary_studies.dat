5|$|In {{the final}} century of the Empire, refugee Byzantine {{scholars}} were principally responsible for carrying, {{in person and}} in writing, ancient Greek grammatical, <b>literary</b> <b>studies,</b> mathematical, and astronomical knowledge to early Renaissance Italy. During this period, astronomy and other mathematical sciences were taught in Trebizond; medicine attracted the interest of almost all scholars.|$|E
5|$|The book {{attracted}} academic interest, {{and scholars}} discussed it {{in at least}} three distinct categories: language and style, often in relation to the politics of totalitarianism; trauma studies, given the psychological pressure on the novel's characters, who grow up under a totalitarian regime; and ethnographic and <b>literary</b> <b>studies</b> of the German minority in Romania. On the latter topic, Valentina Glajar, now at Texas State University, published an article in 1997. Müller's Herztier is one of the four titles discussed in Glajar's 2004 monograph The German Legacy, on German-language literature from Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|As <b>literary</b> <b>studies</b> {{developed}} into a discipline {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it; according to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld still did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman—one who was angry, one who resisted the gender roles of her time, and one who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories and it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice Barbauld had been.|$|E

25|$|Literary {{criticism}} (or <b>literary</b> <b>studies)</b> is the study, evaluation, {{and interpretation}} of literature. Modern literary criticism is often influenced by literary theory, which is the philosophical discussion of literature's goals and methods. Though the two activities are closely related, literary critics are not always, and have not always been, theorists.|$|E

25|$|Before graduating, St. Olaf {{students}} complete nearly 20 required {{courses in}} foundation studies (writing, a second language, oral communication, mathematical reasoning, physical well-being, {{as well as}} other courses) and core studies that include studies in Western culture, human behavior and society, biblical and theological studies, artistic and <b>literary</b> <b>studies,</b> and studies in natural science. Many of the courses are interdisciplinary. St. Olaf offers 39 major areas of study for the bachelor of arts degree, 4 for the bachelor of music degree and 19 areas of concentration.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, he and {{his friend}} Stephan Hermlin, went to the Soviet {{occupation}} zone. In Leipzig he accepted a professorship for <b>literary</b> <b>studies</b> and became an influential critic of the new German literature. It was {{possible for him to}} cross between the East German and the West German world. In the East, he worked through his lectures and discussion circles, and in West Germany he was a welcome guest at meetings of Group 47. He was also in contact with Bertolt Brecht during this time.|$|E
25|$|Literary {{criticism}} {{is thought to}} have existed as long as literature. In the 4th century BC Aristotle wrote the Poetics, a typology and description of literary forms with many specific criticisms of contemporary works of art. Poetics developed {{for the first time the}} concepts of mimesis and catharsis, which are still crucial in <b>literary</b> <b>studies.</b> Plato's attacks on poetry as imitative, secondary, and false were formative as well. Around the same time, Bharata Muni, in his Natya Shastra, wrote literary criticism on ancient Indian literature and Sanskrit drama.|$|E
25|$|Some critics work largely with {{theoretical}} texts, {{while others}} read traditional literature; {{interest in the}} literary canon is still great, but many critics are also interested in minority and women's literatures, while some critics influenced by cultural studies read popular texts like comic books or pulp/genre fiction. Ecocritics have drawn connections between literature and the natural sciences. Darwinian <b>literary</b> <b>studies</b> studies literature {{in the context of}} evolutionary influences on human nature. Many literary critics also work in film criticism or media studies. Some write intellectual history; others bring the results and methods of social history to bear on reading literature.|$|E

25|$|Many {{art historians}} use {{critical}} theory to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory {{is most often}} used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from literary scholars, and it involves {{the application of a}} non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. Feminist, Marxist, critical race, queer, and postcolonial theories are all well established in the discipline. As in <b>literary</b> <b>studies,</b> there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} Cousin {{seems to have}} turned with fresh {{interest}} to those <b>literary</b> <b>studies</b> which he had abandoned for speculation {{under the influence of}} Laromiguière and Royer-Collard. To this renewed interest we owe his studies of men and women of note in France in the 17th century. As the results of his work in this line, we have, besides the Des Pensées de Pascal, 1842, Audes sur les femmes et la société du XVII siècle 1853. He has sketched Jacqueline Pascal (1844), Madame de Longueville (1853), the marquise de Sable (1854), the duchesse de Chevreuse (1856), Madame de Hautefort (1856). Cousin was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.|$|E
25|$|Important {{decisions}} were {{taken at the}} Congress {{with a view to}} advancing the impact of Freud's work. A journal, the Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische und psychopathologishe Forschungen, was launched in 1909 under the editorship of Jung.

Plans for an international association of psychoanalysts were put in place and these were implemented at the Nuremberg Congress of 1910 where Jung was elected, with Freud's support, as its first president.|$|E
