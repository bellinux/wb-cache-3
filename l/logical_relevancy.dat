A set of causal logics based on the framework are proposed to specify causal propagations through <b>logical</b> <b>relevancy</b> and itereted effects of causation. It is shown that these logics capture the basic properties of causal reasoning...|$|E

Although {{the last decade has}} seen an increase in research on the challenges associated with the integration of IS/IT during the post-merger integration (PMI) phase, substantial gaps in our knowledge exist. Our literature review analyzes IS/IT studies in terms of their theoretical perspective, <b>logical</b> structure, knowledge <b>relevancy,</b> {{and the nature of the}} IS/IT phenomena studied. Finally, it identifies five methodological and theoretical issues that open the way to future research...|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{examples}} of writers in recent years who have made critical assessments of Greenleaf's work, and of legal apologists who model their arguments on his book. Howard Richard Packham is a retired foreign language instructor and former part-time estate planning attorney who holds to an atheist worldview. He has written an internet article criticising the technical arguments set forth by Greenleaf and others. http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_packham/montgmry.html Packham holds that what Greenleaf submits as eyewitness testimony is technically hearsay and therefore does not comprise direct evidence to demonstrate the resurrection of Jesus. He also holds that the criteria for the [...] "ancient documents rule" [...] is not met by the gospel documents and that the force of Greenleaf's argument is thereby undermined. Packham argues that the ancient documents rule technically only applies to a limited genre of legal documents, such as wills and contracts and other specific legal instruments, to which the gospels do not belong. However, there are problems in Packham's argument. The Ancient Documents Rule {{is not limited to}} express legal instruments, but covers any type of documents. The criteria for the Ancient Documents Rule is simple and straightforward. According to legal authorities, documents of any type must meet three criteria in order to qualify for the Ancient Documents Rule: 1) that the document is at least 20 years old, 2) presumed to be genuine, 3) come from proper custody (cf. Black's Law Dictionary, FRE 901(b)(8)). Greenleaf, as a writer of highest legal authority, concluded that the Gospels should be received under the ancient documents rule. In ยง9 of his Testimony of the Evangelists, Greenleaf cites the legal reception by the British Record Commission of the Domesday Book and Ancient Statues of Wales, as well as many other ancient writings. Packham maintains that in a court procedure it is up to a judge to decide if a document may be admitted. However, the issue of allowing any evidence is whether the evidence has enough value for the trier of fact to reach a conclusion, whether for or against (FRE 104 (b) notes). Packham also argues that admitting a document is not tantamount to saying that its contents have automatically been authenticated by the judge's decision. However, that means the written document is allowed into evidence in the case and that evidence of its contents have to be further weighed by the trier of fact. The interesting dilemma is that both advocates and opponents must cite the Gospels in order to admit or omit their contents. Thus the probative value, and the <b>logical</b> and conditional <b>relevancy</b> of the Gospel materials is exhibited. Packham liberally cites the Gospel material and biblical higher critics in order to make his points.|$|R
