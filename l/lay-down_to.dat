40|$|C 2 to C 4 olefins are {{traditionally}} produced from steam cracking of naphtha. The necessity for alternative production routes for these major commodity chemicals via non-oil-based processes has driven research in past {{times during the}} oil crises. Currently, there is {{a renewed interest in}} producing lower olefins from alternative feedstocks such as coal, natural gas, or biomass, in view of high oil prices, environmental regulations, and strategies to gain independence from oil imports. This review describes the major routes for the production of lower olefins from synthesis gas with an emphasis on a direct or single step process, the so-called FTO or Fischer−Tropsch to olefins process. The different catalysts for FTO are outlined and compared, and the key issues and requirements for future developments are highlighted. Iron-based catalysts are prevailing for FTO, and reproducible lower olefin selectivities of 50 wt % of hydrocarbons produced have been realized at CO conversions higher than 70 % for 60 to 1000 h on stream. Remarkably the high selectivity to lower olefins has been achieved over a broad range of process conditions (P, T, H 2 /CO ratio, GHSV). A major challenge for further development and application of FTO catalysts is the suppression of carbon <b>lay-down</b> <b>to</b> enhance catalyst lifetime and to preserve their physical integrity under demanding reaction conditions...|$|E

30|$|We {{presented}} {{the application of}} a 3 D surrogate fiber <b>lay-down</b> model <b>to</b> an industrial problem. The parameters are identified on the basis of experimental data. The calibrated model enables the efficient simulation of a whole virtual fiber web. Further modifications of the model will include, for example, the impenetrability of the fibers. This is examined in further studies. To predict material properties like permeability of the textile, the geometric model presented here has {{to be used as a}} basic model for a complex flow simulation to determine macroscopic properties of the textile.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} optimizing the throwing distance of a two-wheeled, self-balancing, remote controlled robot. The robot is maneuverable and comparable in size to a remote controlled toy car, but it moves around in an upright configuration using feedback control. In addition, {{it is capable of}} automatically picking up and throwing ping-pong balls. When throwing a ball, the body attached throwing arm is allowed to rotate quickly from a <b>lay-down</b> position <b>to</b> an upright position utilizing the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The equations of motions of a representative model of the dynamic system are derived with Lagrange equation and Rayleigh dissipation functions. The optimization consists of two parts. The shape optimization is based on the ball's exit condition from the arm, which wraps around an adjoint based motor input optimization. In simulation, this optimization scheme results in a significant increase in throwing distance while keeping the magnitude of the motor input within comparable rang...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to 1979, Secret Service vehicle convoys for VIPs {{in high-risk}} {{situations}} included a large sedan {{known as the}} [...] "muscle car" [...] in which five or six Secret Service special agents armed with submachine guns rode. The [...] "muscle car" [...] team was an ad hoc contingent drawn from special agents working at a local Secret Service office, {{as opposed to those}} regularly assigned to protective duties. They were instructed, {{in the event of an}} attack against the convoy, <b>to</b> <b>lay-down</b> a barrage of suppressive fire against the source of the attack so as to allow the dignitary's vehicle the opportunity to escape without being pursued or blockaded.|$|R
50|$|The group {{participated in}} AFSWC Development Directorate {{investigated}} {{projects such as}} adding a parachute to a bomb to delay delivery, which allowed for the combat crew to release the bomb and escape before it exploded. The goal {{of one of the}} early <b>lay-down</b> projects was <b>to</b> determine the feasibility of delivering a parachute-retarded thermonuclear weapon weighing more than 40,000 pounds, the heaviest nuclear weapons in the stockpile, from altitudes exceeding 40,000 feet. One early effort was the development of a system that could retard the fall of either a TX-14 or a TX-16 weapon, heavy airburst bombs, from altitudes of 40,000 feet to 4,000 feet in 167 seconds from a B-36 Peacemaker.In 1956, however, AFSWC was directed to establish a permanent USAF Air Task Group for atmospheric tests. Thus, in 1956, the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) was created, holding equal stature to the 4925th Test Group (Atomic). At that point, the atmospheric test participation of the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) was cut back and the group focused on the aircraft/weapon marriage mission. The group evaluated equipment for the installation of special weapons into aircraft.This included sway braces, bomb suspension and control systems, pylons and racks, handling and loading equipment, and control and monitor apparatus.|$|R
