5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under the coffin bone is the navicular bone, itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the <b>lower</b> <b>limb.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{added benefit of}} {{scanning}} <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> in addition to the usual whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan in patients with no known or suspected primary or metastatic melanoma involving the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 122 consecutive patients [174 2 -[¹⁸F]-fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET/CT] who underwent FDG PET/CT for staging of melanoma at different time points {{in the course of the}} disease from October 2005 to February 2009 at the Brest University Hospital. Reports of whole-body PET/CT scans including <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> were reviewed. PET/CT abnormalities on the lower extremities were tabulated by location and correlated with pathology, other imaging studies and at least a 6 -month clinical follow-up. The usefulness of <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> acquisition in clinical management was evaluated according to imagery findings. RESULTS: Among the 174 consecutive PET/CT scans performed in 122 patients, 33 scans in 28 patients highlighted abnormal FDG uptakes considered as equivocal or suggestive of malignancy in the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> In 28 cases, uptakes were located at once in the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> and in the rest of the body (lung, liver, mediastinal and sub-diaphragmatic lymph nodes, adrenal glands, bone) corresponding to disseminated disease. In five cases, PET/CT uptakes were located only in lower limbs; each pathological uptake corresponded to benign lesions. <b>Lower</b> <b>limbs</b> findings never impacted clinical and therapeutic decision.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical and functional state of the neuromuscular system and the blood supply to the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> of children with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) after consolidation.

25|$|Ornitholestes {{is often}} {{portrayed as a}} fast, long-legged theropod, but its <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> bones were fairly short.

As is typical of theropods, the feet were tridactyl (with three clawed weight-bearing toes). John H. Ostrom (1969) noted that the claw of digit II (the innermost toe) was larger than those of digits III and IV, and suggested that this digit may have borne a modified sickle claw similar to that of Deinonychus. However, as both Ostrom (1969) and Paul (1988) noted, the poor preservation of digit II makes this hypothesis difficult to confirm.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{symptom of}} copper {{deficiency}} is peripheral neuropathy, which is numbness or tingling that can {{start in the}} extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso. In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience & Rehabilitation (ACNR) published case report, a 69-year-old patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms. These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> reflexes, sensation to light touch and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation {{was lost in the}} sternum, and markedly reduced proprioception or sensation about the self’s orientation. Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient. This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral neuropathy can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{the large}} joints of the <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> are aligned in a {{straight}} line, which represents the mechanical longitudinal axis of the leg, the Mikulicz line. This line stretches from the hip joint (or more precisely {{the head of the}} femur), through the knee joint (the intercondylar eminence of the tibia), and down {{to the center of the}} ankle (the ankle mortise, the fork-like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli). In the tibial shaft, the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide, but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6°, resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174° in a leg with normal axial alignment. A leg is considered straight when, with the feet brought together, both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching. Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis (intermalleolar distance exceeds 3cm), and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis (intercondylar distance exceeds 5cm). These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} associations between maximum voluntary contraction torques of the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> and body composition for subjects with severe obesity. METHODS: Body composition was evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and maximum voluntary contraction torques of the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. One hundred thirty-two patients were enrolled (100 females and 32 males). Eighty-seven patients had a body mass index between 40 and 49. 9 kg/m 2 (the A group), and 45 patients had a body mass index between 50 and 59. 9 kg/m 2 (the B group). RESULTS: Absolute extension and flexion torques had weak associations with fat-free mass but a moderate association with absolute extension torque and fat-free mass of the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> There {{were no significant differences}} between the A and B groups with respect to absolute extension and flexion torques. For the A group, absolute extension and flexion torques were moderately associated with fat-free mass and with fat-free mass of the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> For the B group, there were only moderate associations between absolute extension and flexion torques with fat-free mass of the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that both groups exhibited similar absolute torque values. There were weak to moderate associations between absolute extension and flexion torques and fat-free mass but a moderate association with fat-free mass of the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> Individuals with severe obesity should strive for greater absolute torques, fat-free mass and especially fat-free mass of the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> to prevent functional limitations and physical incapacity...|$|R
