500|$|The new Mary Rose Museum was {{designed}} by architects Wilkinson Eyre, Perkins+Will and built by construction firm Warings. The construction has been challenging because the museum has been built over the ship in the dry dock which is a <b>listed</b> <b>monument.</b> During construction of the museum, conservation of the hull continued inside a sealed [...] "hotbox". In April 2013 the polyethylene glycol sprays were turned off {{and the process of}} controlled airdrying began.

2500|$|The system {{never managed}} to prove itself. The {{accounts}} of the SDR for 1848 suggest that atmospheric traction cost 3s 1d (three shillings and one penny) per mile compared to 1s 4d/mile for conventional steam power (because of the many operating issues associated with the atmospheric, few of which were solved during its working life, the actual cost efficiency proved impossible to calculate). [...] A number of South Devon Railway engine houses still stand, including that at Totnes (scheduled as a grade II <b>listed</b> <b>monument</b> in 2007 to prevent its imminent demolition, even as Brunel's bicentenary celebrations were continuing) and at Starcross, on the estuary of the River Exe, which is a striking landmark, and {{a reminder of the}} atmospheric railway, also commemorated as the name of the village pub.|$|E
