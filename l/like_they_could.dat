25|$|Warwickshire {{survived a}} scare as a virtual second XI still beat the Cambridge {{students}} by 18 runs. The {{first day at}} Fenner's was ruined by rain, with only 6 overs possible. Warwickshire batted first, losing three wickets for no runs to collapse to 48 for 4, but Jonathan Trott's three-hour 150 not out lifted the visitors to 296 for 6 declared. In reply, Zohail Sharif made an unbeaten fifty as the students {{made their way to}} 109 for 1 in just 24 overs. An overnight declaration from the students was followed by an equalling blazing accumulation of runs from Warwickshire led them to 127 for 1. In the reply, Cambridge came too close for comfort, though, and at 281 for 6 with 34 runs left to hit it looked <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do it - but opening batsman and off spinner Alex Loudon came to the rescue with three wickets for 48, as Cambridge collapsed to 296 all out and lost the match by 18 runs.|$|E

The song was given a tribal feeling with Madonna wearing Scottish kilts during the performance. The performance started with Madonna and her dancers doing a dance routine {{in front of the}} stage, then Madonna going on the revolving tiers of the stage to sing the song as confetti fell from above. The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary.

500|$|By June 2002, {{the band}} had {{completed}} A Rush of Blood to the Head, but thought their output sounded [...] "rubbish" [...] and {{reached an agreement}} with the label to postpone the release of the album until they were completely satisfied. Subsequently, many songs were discarded because they sounded <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have been on Parachutes. Martin has claimed {{that it would have been}} uninteresting: [...] "It would have shown that we're happy to sit back on what we'd done, and we're not. For us, it was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians." [...] Such ambitions put the band under strain: [...] "sometimes practice sessions ended abruptly with one or more members of Coldplay threatening to quit".|$|E
500|$|His {{portrayal}} in The Movie {{has also}} received praise: IGN's Andy Patrizio said that Spike [...] "opens up his soul a little" [...] during the film, while Chris Beveridge of Mania.com found Spike more likable {{in the film}} than {{in some parts of}} the series, comparing him to Lupin III and praising the moments where he could be himself and show more of his inner self. Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Review said that Spike's portrayal was one of the things that worked in the film, and DVD Talk's Neil Lumbard, alongside general praise of the characters, positively noted the further exploration of his personality. Anime News Network's Mike Crandol was less enthusiastic, saying that while Spike was the only one who got much attention during the film, some sequences felt <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> work without him.|$|E

500|$|Attempting {{to perfect}} their work, Coldplay had to [...] "step it {{up a few}} notches and work hard at it to get it right". The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X. When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else". Once finished, the band felt <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do their own songs and not have to think of anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks.|$|E

Marlene Stewart created the film's costumes, using traditional leather and linen but without an antique look. Its steampunk-like, retro-futuristic weapons were created by the weapon designer Simon Boucherie and Wirkola, who said they wanted Hansel and Gretel's weapons {{to look as if}} the characters hand-made them. Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted this crazy, mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements are there to [...] "add to the fun and tone of the film." [...] He said, [...] "We wanted the movie to feel timeless and for the movie to feel like a fairy tale, but still grounded. It {{was a lot of fun}} coming up with the different weapon designs and ways of killing witches. We mixed old and new elements. But no matter how modern some of the weapons are, they all have an old-fashioned feel and look <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> fit into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "a clunky, poorly {{constructed}} drama designed to spotlight the little-remarked role of black American soldiers in World War II." [...] James Rocchi, writing for Cinematical, gave the film a mixed review: [...] "When Miracle at St. Anna falters, it's in the moments that seem <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have been crafted {{by any other}} film maker; when Miracle at St. Anna succeeds, it's in the moments that {{could only have been}} crafted by Lee." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the film was [...] "overwrought, overproduced, overbusy and overlong" [...] and that [...] "Miracle at St. Anna finally suffers from the worst filmmaking sin of all: the failure of trust, in the story and the audience." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that the film [...] "aspires to be epic, but mostly it's just unfocused, sprawling and badly in need of editing" [...] and that [...] "t tries hard to be inspiring, but it has jarring tonal shifts, stereotyped characters and a lack of narrative perspective." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described the film as [...] "too long, lazily constructed, and crammed with too many characters and subplots for any director to develop fully outside of an HBO miniseries."

2500|$|While {{promoting}} Keep Your Head Down, Yunho and Changmin {{spoke up}} for the first time about their 2010 hiatus and breakup with JYJ.

Changmin added that the team had worked so hard {{to the point where they}} felt <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> finally [...] "harvest the fruits of [...] labor", yet instead of being happy they had to perform their final stage with heavy hearts. JYJ responded by saying that they did not regret their decision in leaving S.M. Entertainment. The lyrics of [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] also came under media scrutiny, with claims that they were directed at JYJ; however, TVXQ clarified that [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] was not a diss track, and that similar claims would still happen even if they were to release a different song with different lyrics. Yunho said, [...] "The song is about a man's mind towards a woman who had left him. We can sometimes find out that a certain song seems to talk about my own story. In this way it totally depends on the interpretation using our own thoughts." ...|$|E

He made his debut for the [...] "Gunners" [...] on 18 August – the opening day of the 2001–02 Premier League season, in a 4–0 win over Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium. During the season, Campbell was partnered at the back by either Tony Adams (who would retire {{at the end of the}} season) or Martin Keown. He made a return to White Hart Lane during a 1–1 draw on 17 November, and though he played well, he was shocked to see his older brother Tony in the crowd {{supporting}} Spurs as the fans shouted insults out to Campbell on the pitch. Campbell enjoyed immediate success with Arsenal, as he won both Premier League and FA Cup winners' medals as Arsenal won the Double in his first season at Highbury. In the FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium on 4 May, he played alongside Adams as the team kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory over Chelsea. Four days later, they secured the league title with a 1–0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford.|$|E

6000|$|But the Jews {{gradually}} forgot this, {{and their}} daily boast was, that God {{had nothing to}} do with the heathen; that He did not care for them, and actually hated them; that they, as it were, had the true God all to themselves for their own private property; and that He had neither love nor mercy, except for them and their proselytes, that is, the few heathens whom they could persuade and entice not to worship the true God after the customs of their own country--that would not have suited the Jews' bigotry and pride--but to turn Jews, and forget their own people among whom they were born, and ape them in everything. And so, as our Lord told them, after compassing sea and land to make one of these proselytes, they only made him after all twice as much the child of hell as themselves. For they could not teach the heathen anything worth knowing about God, when they had forgotten themselves what God was <b>like.</b> <b>They</b> <b>could</b> tell them that there was one God, and not two--but what was the use of that? As St. James says, the devils believe as much as that, and yet the knowledge does not make them holy, but only increases their fear and despair. And so with these Pharisees. They had forgotten that God was love. They had forgotten that God was merciful. They had forgotten that God was just. And therefore, while they were talking of God and pretending to worship God, they knew nothing of God, and they did not do God's will, and act like God; for (as we find from the Gospels) they were unjust, tyrannous, proud, conceited, covetous themselves; and while they were looking down on the poor heathens, these very heathens, the Lord told them, would rise up in judgment against them: for they, knowing little, acted up to the light which they had, better than the Pharisees who knew so much. And so it will be with us, my friends, if we fancy that God's great favours to us are a reason for our priding ourselves on them, and despising papists and foreigners instead of remembering that just because God has given us so much, He will require more of us. It is true, we do know more of the Gospel than the papists, how, though they believe in Jesus Christ, worship the Virgin Mary and the Saints, and idols of wood and stone. But if they, who know so little of God's will, yet act faithfully up to what they do know, will they not rise up in judgment against us, who know so much more, if we act worse than they? Instead of despising them, we had better despise ourselves. Instead of fancying that God's love is not over them, and so sinning against God's Holy Spirit by denying and despising the fruits of God's Holy Spirit in them, we had much better, we Protestants, be repenting of our own sins. We had better pray God to open our eyes to our own want of faith, and want of love, and want of honesty, and want of cleanly and chaste lives; lest God in His anger should let us go on in our evil path, till we fall into the deep darkness of mind of the Pharisees of old. For then while we were boasting of England as the most Christian nation in the world, we might become the most unchristian, because the most unlike Christ; the most wanting in love and fellow-feeling, and self-sacrifice, and honour, and justice, and honesty; wanting, in short, in the fruits of the Spirit. And without them there is no use crying: [...] "We are God's chosen people, He Has put His name among us, we alone hate idols, we alone have the pure word of God, and the pure sacraments, and the pure doctrine;" [...] for God may answer us, as he answered the Jews of old: [...] "Think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father: Verily, I say unto you, God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham." [...] "The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof." [...] Oh! my friends, let us pray, one and all, that God will come and help us, and with great might succour us, [...] "that whereas through our sins and wickedness we are sore let and hindered in running the race set before us, God's bountiful grace and mercy may speedily help and deliver us," [...] and enable us to live faithfully up to the glorious privileges which He has bestowed on us, in calling us [...] "members of Christ, children of God, and inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven;" [...] in giving us His Bible, in allowing us to be born into this favoured land of England, in preserving us to this day, in spite of all that we have thought, and said, and done, unworthy of the name of Christians and Englishmen.|$|E
