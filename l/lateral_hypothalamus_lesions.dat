40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effects of unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine lesions of the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens on eating and drinking evoked by electrical stimulation of the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> (ESLH). <b>Lesions</b> were made on either the `dominant' or `non-dominant' hemisphere as defined by an amphetamine-rotation test.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} sites where striatopallidal lesions produce two distinct sensory-triggered hyperkinetic syndromes: (1) exaggerated forelimb treading alone to oral taste infusions and (2) sensorimotor exaggerated treading plus enhanced aversive reactions to taste infusions. The behavioral characteristics of these syndromes have been described previously (Berridge, K. C. and Cromwell, H. C., Behav. Neurosci., 104 (1990) 778 - 795). Bilateral excitotoxin lesions were made using quinolinic acid (10 [mu]g in 1 [mu]l) in the caudate/putamen, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus or ventral pallidum/substantia innominata. In order to identify the precise center, borders, severity and size of lesion sites that caused these hyperkinetic treading syndromes, neuron counts (modified fractionator technique) and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity (GFAP-IR) densitometry were used in a stereological mapping analysis. The site of lesions that produced the hyperkinetic treading syndrome without enhanced aversion was found to be restricted to the globus pallidus (GP). Damage exceeding 60 % neuron loss bilaterally within a 0. 8 x 1. 0 x 1. 0 mm subregion of the ventromedial GP produced this syndrome. The site of lesions that produced the combined syndrome of hyperkinetic treading and aversive enhancement was ventral to the globus pallidus, within the ventral pallidum/substantia innominata (VP/SI). Damage exceeding 70 % neuron loss bilaterally within a 1. 0 x 0. 5 x 1. 0 m diameter subregion of the ventromedial ventral pallidum/substantia innominata produced this syndrome. This subterritory was located immediately lateral to the border of the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus.</b> Bilateral <b>lesions</b> to the caudate/putamen or nucleus accumbens did not produce either hyperkinetic treading syndrome. These results are discussed in terms of the connectivity of the ventral pallidal/substantia innominata and globus pallidus regions and in terms of neuropathological models of hyperkinetic disorders...|$|R

40|$|Anatomical {{evidence}} indicates {{the presence of}} projections from the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> to serotonergic (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). Using dual probe microdialysis and extracellular recordings in the DR, we show that the application of GABAergic agents in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> modulates the activity of 5 -HT neurons in the DR. GABA and bicuculline or baclofen, applied in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> significantly reduced and increased, respectively, the 5 -HT output in the DR. Likewise, the intrahypothalamic application of GABA and bicuculline reduced (14 / 20 neurons) and increased (8 / 12 neurons), respectively, the firing rate of 5 -HT neurons in the DR. A smaller percentage of neurons, however, were excited by GABA (3 / 20) and inhibited by bicuculline (1 / 12). Application of tetrodotoxin in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> suppressed the local 5 -HT output and reduced that in the DR. The 5 -HT output in the DR increased transiently soon after darkness. The hypothalamic application of GABA attenuated and that of bicuculline potentiated this spontaneous change with an efficacy similar to that seen in light conditions. These {{results indicate that the}} <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> is involved in the control of 5 -HT activity in the DR, possibly through excitatory (major) and inhibitory (minor) inputs.

40|$|Rats {{were trained}} to self-administer cocaine in a {{distinctive}} context (context A). They were then extinguished in a second context (context B) prior to test for cocaine-seeking in the original training context, context A (group ABA), context B (group ABB) or no test (group AB 0). Group ABA showed renewal of extinguished cocaine-seeking associated with c-Fos induction in basolateral amygdala, <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus,</b> and infralimbic prefrontal cortex. Groups ABA and ABB showed test-associated c-Fos induction in prelimbic prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens (core, shell, rostral pole), striatum, <b>lateral</b> amygdala, perifornical <b>hypothalamus,</b> and ventral tegmental area. Double immunofluorescence revealed that renewal-associated c-Fos was expressed in orexin-negative lateral hypothalamic neurons whereas test-associated c-Fos was expressed in orexin-positive perifornical hypothalamic neurons. Retrograde tracing from <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> with cholera toxin revealed only sparse dual-labeled neurons in basolateral amygdala and infralimbic prefrontal cortex, suggesting that these regions contribute to renewal of cocaine-seeking independently of their projections to <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus.</b> Retrograde tracing from the ventral tegmental area suggested that hypothalamic contributions to cocaine-seeking are likewise independent of projections to the midbrain. These results suggest that renewal of cocaine-seeking depends critically on basolateral amygdala, <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus,</b> and infralimbic prefrontal cortex. Whereas basolateral amygdala and <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> contributions may be common to renewal of extinguished cocaine-, alcohol-, and sucrose-seeking, infralimbic prefrontal cortex contributions appear unique to renewal of cocaine-seeking and may reflect the habitual nature of relapse to cocaine...|$|R

NERP- 2 (1 - 5 nmol), but not NERP- 1 (2 - 4 nmol), increased feeding in a dose-dependent manner when injected into the lateral ventricles or bilaterally into the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> but not into the arcuate or the paraventricular nucleus. The effect of NERP- 2 given into the lateral ventricles {{was found in the}} first, but not in the second 60 min after treatment, and was antagonized by SB- 408124, an orexin- 1 receptor antagonist given into the lateral ventricles or the arcuate nucleus, but not into the paraventricular nucleus. However, SB- 408124 was unable to reduce NERP- 2 -induced feeding when injected bilaterally into the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> before NERP- 2 given also bilaterally into the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus.</b> In contrast, NERP- 1, but not NERP- 2, induced penile erection in a dose-dependent manner when injected into the lateral ventricles or the arcuate nucleus, but not into the paraventricular nucleus or the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus.</b> The pro-erectile effect of NERP- 1 was not prevented by the prior injection of d(CH(2)) (5) Tyr (Me) (2) -Orn(8) -oxytocin or SB- 408124 into the lateral ventricles. The present results suggest that while NERP- 2 facilitates feeding by acting in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus,</b> possibly by increasing orexin activity in the arcuate nucleus, NERP- 1 facilitates penile erection by acting in the arcuate nucleus with a mechanism not related to orexin or oxytocin...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Neuronal {{activity}} {{related to}} brain-stimulation reward and to feeding was analyzed in rhesus monkeys and squirrel monkeys as follows. First, self-stimulation of the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus,</b> orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens was found. Second, {{a population of}} single neurones in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> {{was found to be}} trans-synaptically activated from one or several self-stimulation sites. It was also found that populations of neurones in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala were activated from {{at least some of the}} self-stimulation sites. Thus, in the monkey, there is evidence for an interconnected set of self-stimulation sites, stimulation in any one of which may activate neurones in the other regions. These sites include the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus,</b> amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex. Third, in one sample of 764 neurones in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> and substantia innominata which were activated from brainstimulation reward sites, 13. 6 ~ were also activated during feeding, by the sight and/or taste of food. The responses of the neurones with activity associated with taste occurred only while some substances (e. g. sweet substances such as glucose) were in the mouth, depended on the concentration of the substances being tasted, and were independent of mouth movements made by the monkeys. Fourth, the responses of these neurones occurred to food when the monkeys were hungry, but not when they were satiated. Fifth, self-stimulation occurred in the region of these neurones in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> and substantia innominata, and was attenuated by satiety. These results suggest that self-stimulation of some brain sites occurs because of activation of neurones in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> and substantia innominata activated by the sigh...|$|R

50|$|Through {{the diverse}} outputs of the orexin system, the orexin neurons in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> mediate {{an array of}} functions. Two of the most {{commonly}} noted functions of orexin peptides in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> are the promotion of feeding behavior and arousal (i.e., wakefulness). More generally, the orexinergic neural projections of the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> are involved in thermoregulation, regulating gastrointestinal motility and gastrointestinal function by way of the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve, reducing pain and nociception through several output structures (e.g., periaqueductal gray matter), modulating the rewarding property of stimuli through the ventral tegmental area projections and other outputs in the reward system, regulating energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine functions (e.g., HPA axis, HPG axis, and HPT axis) through other hypothalamic outputs, and regulating visceral functions (e.g., respiration, blood pressure, and micturition) via a group of structures in the brain stem, among other functions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{compared}} the transduction efficiencies of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, which was pseudotyped with an AAV 1 capsid and encoded the {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP), with a lentiviral (LV) vector, which was pseudotyped with a VSV-G envelop and encoded the discosoma red fluorescent protein (dsRed), to investigate which viral vector transduced the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> or the amygdala more efficiently. The LV-dsRed and AAV 1 -GFP vector were mixed and injected into the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> or into the amygdala of adult rats. The titers that were injected were 1 × 10 8 or 1 × 10 9 genomic copies of AAV 1 -GFP and 1 × 10 5 transducing units of LV-dsRed. Results Immunostaining for GFP and dsRed showed that AAV 1 -GFP transduced significantly more cells than LV-dsRed in both the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> and the amygdala. In addition, the number of LV particles that were injected can not easily be increased, {{while the number of}} AAV 1 particles can be increased easily with a factor 100 to 1000. Both viral vectors appear to predominantly transduce neurons. Conclusions This study showed that AAV 1 vectors are better tools to overexpress or knockdown genes in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> and amygdala of adult rats, since more cells can be transduced with AAV 1 than with LV vectors and the titer of AAV 1 vectors can easily be increased to transduce the area of interest. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The {{two groups}} also took {{different}} approaches towards their discovery. One team {{was interested in}} finding new genes that were expressed in the hypothalamus. In 1996, scientists from the Scripps Research Institute reported the discovery of several genes in the rat brain, including one they dubbed [...] "clone 35." [...] Their work showed that clone 35 expression {{was limited to the}} <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus.</b> They extracted selective DNA found in the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus.</b> They cloned this DNA and studied it using electron microscopy. Neurotransmitters found in this area were oddly similar to the gut hormone, secretin, a member of the incretin family, so they named hypocretin to stand for a hypothalamic member of the incretin family. These cells were first thought to reside and work only within the <b>lateral</b> <b>hypothalamus</b> area, but immunocytochemistry tactics revealed the various projections this area truly had {{to other parts of the}} brain.
