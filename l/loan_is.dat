5|$|When Archie returns, he {{attempts}} to reconcile with Peggy, but {{comes up with a}} plan to steal the Mitchells' business, The Queen Victoria public house, with Janine's help. However, Janine, along with Ryan, whom she is dating, plans to steal it from Archie at the last minute. Peggy's daughter Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook), who has been in Brazil on the run from police due to her involvement in the murder of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), returns to Walford, thinking the charges have been dropped. She is subsequently arrested, and the Mitchells put up £250,000 bail to have her released. Archie convinces Sam to leave again, paying for her to go. Phil is then forced to take out a loan from Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ian accepts, on the condition that if the <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> not paid back within a certain time, he becomes owner of The Queen Victoria. Archie and Janine learn of this and try to get Ian to sell the loan to them. When Ian's wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) leaves him, Janine gets him drunk and has sex with him, making an audio recording of them together. Archie and Janine blackmail Ian into selling them the loan and Archie tells the Mitchells they are trespassing. Once Archie finds out that Janine plans to fleece him, he proposes to her to keep her from going astray. Ryan is hurt by this setback and ends his relationship with her. Ronnie stands up to Archie and he pushes her into the bar, not knowing she is pregnant, though Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) then reveals it. Ronnie has a miscarriage and Peggy tells Archie he has killed another of Ronnie's children, warning him to stay away from her. Peggy eventually hands over the keys and the family of Peggy, Phil, Ronnie, Roxy, Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones) and Roxy's baby Amy Mitchell leave on 24 December 2009. They end up being taken in by Jack, who vows revenge on Archie.|$|E

25|$|Income {{tax refund}} {{anticipation}} loans are not technically payday loans (because they are repayable upon receipt of the borrower's income tax refund, not at his next payday), {{but they have}} similar credit and cost characteristics. A car title <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> secured by the borrower's car, but are available only to borrowers who hold clear title (i.e., no other loans) to a vehicle. The maximum amount of the <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> some fraction of the resale value of the car. A similar credit facility seen in the UK is a logbook loan secured against a car's logbook, which the lender retains. These loans may be available on slightly better terms than an unsecured payday loan, since they are less risky to the lender. If the borrower defaults, then the lender can attempt to recover costs by repossessing and reselling the car.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} ALTA {{mortgage}} policies covering single or one-to-four family housing mortgages. These cover {{the elements of}} loss listed above plus others.

25|$|Redlining {{has helped}} {{preserve}} segregated living patterns {{for blacks and}} whites in the United States because discrimination motivated by prejudice is often contingent on the racial composition of neighborhoods where the <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> sought and {{the race of the}} applicant.

25|$|APR is {{dependent}} on the time period for which the <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> calculated. That is, the APR for one loan with a 30-year loan duration cannot be compared to the APR for another loan with a 20-year loan duration. APR can be used to show the relative impact of different payment schedules (such as balloon payments or bi-weekly payments instead of straight monthly payments), but most standard APR calculators have difficulty with those calculations.|$|E
25|$|Growth of the Internet internationally {{has enabled}} both {{business}} micro-lending through {{sites such as}} Kickstarter {{as well as through}} global micro-lending charities where lenders make small sums of money available on zero-interest terms.

25|$|This is {{sometimes}} called a loan policy and it is issued only to mortgage lenders. Generally speaking, it follows the assignment of the mortgage loan, meaning that the policy benefits the purchaser of the loan if the <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> sold. For this reason, these policies greatly facilitate the sale of mortgages into the secondary market. That market {{is made up of}} high volume purchasers such as Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation as well as private institutions.|$|E

Third Federal Savings and <b>Loan</b> <b>is</b> in the top 25 saving and loan institutions in the United States.

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used sukuk structures replicate the cash flows of conventional bonds. Such structures are listed on exchanges, commonly the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange in Europe, and made tradable through conventional organisations like Euroclear or Clearstream. A key technique to achieve capital protection without amounting to a <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> a binding promise to repurchase certain assets; e.g. {{in the case of}} Sukuk Al Ijara, by the issuer. In the meantime a rent is being paid, which is often benchmarked to an interest rate (LIBOR is the most common though its use is criticized by some Sharia Scholars).|$|E
25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the <b>loan,</b> <b>is</b> mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E

These <b>loans</b> <b>are</b> directed toward those individuals and families who did not qualify for need-based loans due {{to the amount of}} their personal assets. There is usually a higher interest rate associated with non-need based loans. Because these <b>loans</b> <b>are</b> not need-based, the U.S. government does not pay the interest for the student while enrolled in school; they are often referred to as unsubsidized loans. The Unsubsidized Stafford Loan and Grad PLUS <b>loan</b> <b>are</b> non-need based <b>loans</b> {{available for}} both undergraduate and graduate students who do not qualify for need-based financial aid.|$|R
25|$|In many cases, borrowers write a post-dated check (check with {{a future}} date) to the lender; if the borrowers don't {{have enough money}} in their account by the check's date, their check will bounce. In Texas, payday lenders are {{prohibited}} from suing a borrower for theft if the check is post-dated. One payday lender in the state instead gets their customers to write checks dated for the day the <b>loan</b> <b>is</b> given. Customers borrow money because they don't have any, so the lender accepts the check knowing that it would bounce on the check's date. If the borrower fails to pay on the due date, the lender sues the borrower for writing a hot check.|$|E
25|$|Another {{round of}} {{expansion}} started in 2007. A third runway opened on 29 October 2007, {{to relieve congestion}} on the other two runways.

50|$|Stafford <b>Loans</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} both as subsidized and unsubsidized <b>loans.</b> Subsidized <b>loans</b> <b>are</b> {{offered to}} students based on demonstrated financial need.

50|$|Typical <b>loans</b> {{domestic}} <b>loans</b> <b>were</b> {{issued for}} a time period of several months to a few years.

The longer term horizon explains the need for detailing {{the conditions of the}} issuance and the specifics of the promissory note loans, as the risks of default are higher for a long term maturity debt.|$|R
