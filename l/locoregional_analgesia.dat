40|$|Total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is a {{surgery that}} provokes intense postoperative pain and requires specialized care. Delays in postoperative mobilization induce tis-sue retraction, adherences, and atrophy. 2 As a result, {{the return to}} successful function after a TKA requires sufficient analgesia to allow early rehabilitation. 1, 2 In order for a patient to be comfortable postoperatively, the anesthesiologist is expected to provide analgesia that allows early rehabilitation and contributes {{to the success of}} the surgical procedure. Management of the patient by the various members of the attending team must be coordinated to allow the multimodal rehabilitation to profit from analgesic techniques. 3 In such a context, <b>locoregional</b> <b>analgesia</b> (LRA) techniques are often used and are an important element of the recovery process. The anesthesiologist in charge of patients undergoing TKA must be familiar with these techniques. Successful postoperative analgesia requires early patient management that should begin at the time of preoperative consultation. This issue of Anesthesiology Rounds illustrates our view of the analgesic management of patients undergoin...|$|E
30|$|Dexmedetomidine is {{a potent}} and highly {{selective}} α- 2 adrenoceptor agonist with sympatholytic, sedative, amnestic, and opioid-sparing analgesic effect. It was considered a safe adjunct in many clinical anesthetic applications. It {{has been used as}} an adjunct to general anesthesia when given as an intravenous premedication at a dose of 0.33 – 0.67  μg/kg 1  min before surgery (Ebert et al. 2000). Dexmedetomidine was also used as an adjunct to local anesthetics in <b>locoregional</b> anesthesia and <b>analgesia</b> (Memis et al. 2004).|$|R
40|$|Dental {{disease is}} common, {{particularly}} in geriatric animals, and often requiring general anaesthesia for dental procedures. The use of multimodal analgesia {{may help to}} minimise morbidity in patients as part of balanced anaesthesia, and provide effective perioperative <b>analgesia.</b> <b>Locoregional</b> anaesthesia {{can be used to}} reduce the amount of inhalational anaesthetic agent required, and provide better analgesia both during and after surgery, facilitating smoother anaesthetics and potentially better recoveries. This article will discuss the commonly used drugs, equipment, anatomy and techniques required to provide effective nerve blocks for dental procedures...|$|R
40|$|For ondansetron, dexamethasone, and {{droperidol}} (when {{used for}} prophylaxis), each {{is estimated to}} reduce risk of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) by approximately 25 %. Current consensus guidelines denote that patients with 0 – 1 risk factors still have a 10 – 20 % risk of encountering PONV, but do not yet advocate routine prophylaxis for all patients with 10 – 20 % risk. In ambulatory surgery, however, multimodal prophylaxis has gained favor, and our previously published experience with routine prophylaxis has yielded PONV rates below 10 %. We now propose a “zero-tolerance” antiemetic algorithm for outpatients that involves routine prophylaxis by first avoiding volatile agents and opioids to the extent possible, using <b>locoregional</b> anesthesia, multimodal <b>analgesia,</b> and low doses of three nonsedating off-patent antiemetics. Routine oral administration (immediately on arrival to the ambulatory surgery suite) of perphenazine 8 mg (antidopaminergic) or cyclizine 50 mg (antihistamine), is followed by dexamethasone 4 mg i. v. after anesthesia induction (dexamethasone is avoided in diabetic patients). At the end of surgery, ondansetron (4 mg i. v., now off-patent) is added. Rescue therapy consists of avoiding unnecessary repeat doses of drugs acting by the same mechanism: haloperidol 2 mg i. v. (antidopaminergic) is prescribed for patients pretreated with cyclizine or promethazine 6. 25 mg i. v. (antihistamine) for patients having been pretreated with perphenazine. If available, a consultation for therapeutic acupuncture procedure is ordered. Our approach toward “zero tolerance” of PONV emphasizes liberal identification of and prophylaxis against common risks...|$|R
