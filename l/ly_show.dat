Spectrophotometric quantification of LY accumulation {{was performed in}} {{the presence or absence}} of transferrin, a marker of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Internalization of <b>LY</b> <b>showed</b> a curvilinear kinetics: the high initial rate of LYuptake (575 ng LY/ mg protein /hr) decreased almost 5 -fold within 15 min, reaching plateau at 126 ng/ mg protein /hr. Transferrin induced a small increase (7. 5 %) in the fluid phase uptake rate (after 5 min) followed by a small decrease at longer incubation times. Lucifer Yellow and transferrin (visualized by streptavidin– FITC) were localized in Paramecium by 3 -D reconstruction by confocal microscopy. <b>LY</b> <b>showed</b> a scattered, diffuse fluorescence typical of fluid phase uptake whereas transferrin accumulated in membrane-surrounded endosomes. Wortmannin did not affect LY accumulation but decreased it when transferrin was present in the incubation medium. This suggests an effect on the transferrin uptake pathway, presumably on the stage of internalization in “mixing” endosomes to which transferrin and LY were targeted. Phorbol ester diminished LY accumulation by 22 % and this effect persisted up to 25 min of incubation. PKC inhibitor did not affect LY uptake. However, in the presence of transferrin, the LY uptake increased within the first 15 minutes followed by a rapid 20 % decrease in comparison to the control. Such an effect of PKC modulators suggests that PMA action on fluid phase uptake is not directly mediated by PKC...|$|R

However, {{our knowledge of the}} distribution patterns of VLDLR variants among breeds and their relationship to egg production is still incomplete. In this study, eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that account for 87 % of all VLDLR variants were genotyped in Nick Chick (NC, n= 91), Lohmann Brown (LohB, n= 50) and Lueyang (LY, n= 381) chickens, the latter being an Chinese indigenous breed. Egg production by NC and LY chickens was recorded from 17 to 50 weeks. Only four similar haplotypes were found in NC and LohB, of which two accounted for 100 % of all NC haplotypes and 92. 5 % of LohB haplotypes. In contrast, there was considerable haplotypic diversity in LY. Comparison of egg production in <b>LY</b> <b>showed</b> that hens with NC-like haplotypes had a significantly higher production (p < 0. 05) than those without the haplotypes.

A systematic strategy that included a sequence alignment-based first screening of residues and a homology model-based second screening, followed by site-directed mutagenesis to alter individual screened residues, was used to study the molecular determinants for the catalytic efficiency of B. licheniformis l-AI. One conserved amino acid, Y 333, in the substrate binding pocket of the wild-type B. licheniformis l-AI was identified as an important residue affecting the catalytic efficiency of B. licheniformis l-AI. Further insights into the function of residue Y 333 were obtained by replacing it with other aromatic, nonpolar hydrophobic amino acids or polar amino acids.

A total of 76 cows with uterine prolapse were investigated, 10 of which had died before treatment. According to the posture, cows were divided into standing (Standing: n = 11) and recumbent (Recumbent: n = 55). Recumbent cows were subdivided randomly into lying (Lying: n = 24), lifting up using a cow-lift (Cow-lift: n = 18), and raising hind legs using a tractor (Raising: n = 13). Recovery rate after treatment of all cows was 60. 6 %. The recovery rate of Recumbent (52. 7 %) was significantly (P < 0. 01) lower than Standing (100 %). Among the recumbent cows, <b>Lying</b> <b>showed</b> the lowest recovery rate (37. 5 %), which was significantly lower than the recovery rate (64. 5 %) of the combined Cow-lift and Raising groups.

Haploinsufficiency for GRHL 2 has been implicated in autosomal-dominant deafness, but mutations have not yet been associated with any skin pathology. We investigated two unrelated Kuwaiti families in which a total of six individuals have had lifelong ectodermal defects. The clinical features comprised nail dystrophy or nail loss, marginal palmoplantar keratoderma, hypodontia, enamel hypoplasia, oral hyperpigmentation, and dysphagia. In addition, three individuals had sensorineural deafness, and three had bronchial asthma. Taken together, the features were consistent with an unusual autosomal-recessive ectodermal dysplasia syndrome. Because of consanguinity in both families, we used whole-exome sequencing to search for novel homozygous DNA variants and found GRHL 2 mutations common to both families: affected subjects in one family were homozygous for c. 1192 T>C (p.

40|$|Background: Nemaline {{myopathy}} (NM) {{is a rare}} genetic muscle disorder, but one of {{the most}} common among the congenital myopathies. NM is caused by mutations in at least nine genes: Nebulin (NEB), alpha-actin (ACTA 1), alpha-tropomyosin (TPM 3), beta-tropomyosin (TPM 2), troponin T (TNNT 1), cofilin- 2 (CFL 2), Kelch repeat and BTB (POZ) domain-containing 13 (KBTBD 13), and Kelch-like family members 40 and 41 (KLHL 40 and KLHL 41). Nebulin is a giant (600 to 900 kDa) filamentous protein constituting part of the skeletal muscle thin filament. Around 90 % of the primary structure of nebulin is composed of approximately 35 -residue alpha-helical domains, which form super repeats that bind actin with high affinity. Each super repeat has been proposed to harbor one tropomyosin-binding site. Methods: We produced four wild-type (WT) nebulin super repeats (S 9, S 14, S 18, and S 22), 283 to 347 amino acids long, and five corresponding repeats with a patient mutation included: three missense mutations (p. Glu 2431 Lys, p. Ser 6366 Ile, and p. Thr 7382 Pro) and two in-frame deletions (p. Arg 2478 _Asp 2512 del and p. Val 3924 _Asn 3929 del). We performed F-actin and tropomyosin-binding experiments for the nebulin super repeats, using co-sedimentation and GST (glutathione-S-transferase) pull-down assays. We also used the GST pull-down assay to test the affinity of WT nebulin super repeats for WT alpha- and beta-tropomyosin, and for beta-tropomyosin with six patient mutations: p. Lys 7 del, p. Glu 41 Lys, p. Lys 49 del, p. Glu 117 Lys, p. Glu 139 del and p. Gln 147 Pro. Results: WT nebulin was shown to interact with actin and tropomyosin. Both the nebulin super repeats containing the p. Glu 2431 Lys mutation and nebulin super repeats lacking exon 55 (p. Arg 2478 _Asp 2512 del) showed weak affinity for F-actin compared with WT fragments. Super repeats containing the p. Ser 6366 Ile mutation showed strong affinity for actin. When tested for tropomyosin affinity, super repeats containing the p. Glu 2431 <b>Lys</b> mutation <b>showed</b> stronger binding than WT proteins to tropomyosin, and the super repeat containing the p.

The addition of OGlcNAc to proteins is regulated by the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). This enzyme is ubiquitously expressed in mammals. The human OGT spans approximately 43 kb of genomic DNA, and to date, 3 OGT isoforms have been sequenced (two nuclear and one mitochondrial). In mammals, OGT exist as different isoforms, such as in the rat and the mouse, differing by 30 nucleotides in their N-terminal (exon 2). In this study, the mouse OGT isoforms were investigated. In addition, the expression of the full OGT transcript and various transcripts was studied by real-time PCR in mouse tissues (liver, heart, kidney, testis, lung, spleen, ear, stomach, intestine, bone, tail and brain). The highest level of full length mouse OGT was found in spleen followed by testis and lung. The human OGT was shown to have highest expression in pancreas. Further investigations showed that mice express both isoforms (one which uses both exon 2 A and 2 B and one which skips exon 2 A and only uses exon 2 B). The first isoform showed highest expression in heart and aorta and the second one in liver and lung, suggesting that mouse OGT exists in different isoforms of varying abundance. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are the major regulators of protein biological functions. PTMs are catalyzed by their respective enzymes which are sequence specific. Depending on the environment and signaling contexts, proteins are modified and instantly functional. In this study, the protein consensus sequences of 4 different modifications were investigated by utilizing the bio-informatic tool MAPRes. This tool mines association rules of a modified residue in peptides. Phosphorylated Ser/Thr/Tyr showed a polar sequence environment withPro at various positions. O-GlcNAc modified Ser/Thr occured in an environment with vicinal Val (- 1 position) and Pro (- 2 and - 3 positions), acetylated Lys occured in a basic environment with a preference for His or Tyr at + 1 and Ser at + 7 positions. Methylated <b>Lys</b> also <b>showed</b> a preference for basic amino acids, but compared with acetylated Lys, which have a high preference for vicinal <b>Lys,</b> methylated <b>Lys</b> <b>showed</b> a higher preference for Arg. Methylated Arg showed a high preference for Gly both up- and downstream the peptide chain. In addition, the Yin Yang site sequence environment was also investigated and showed that such sites were located in a polar environment with Pro at various positions. These results suggest that Pro is a very important amino acid in the vicinity of modified amino acids. Furthermore the position of Pro could be determinant in deciding whether a residue is phosphorylated, O-GlcNAc modified or both (Yin Yang site) ...|$|R

40|$|Nephrotoxicity due to renal {{reabsorption}} of radiolabeled peptides {{limits the}} tumor dose in peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT). Therefore, we evaluated {{the ability of}} several agents to inhibit the renal accumulation of different radiopeptides. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (4 per group) were injected intravenously with 1 MBq of (111) In-labeled octreotide (OCT), minigastrin (MG), bombesin (BOM), or exendin (EX), together with a potential inhibitor of renal uptake (lysine [Lys], poly-glutamic acid [PGA], and Gelofusine [GF], a gelatin-based plasma expander) or phosphate-buffered saline as a control. Organ uptake at 20 h after injection was determined {{as the percentage of}} injected activity per gram (%IA/g). Lys, PGA, and GF were also combined to determine whether an additive effect could be obtained. The localization of the peptides in the kidneys was investigated by autoradiography using a phosphor imager. RESULTS: OCT accumulation in the kidney was inhibited by Lys and GF (40. 7 %- 45. 1 %), whereas PGA was ineffective. On the other hand, renal uptake of BOM, MG, and EX was inhibited by PGA and GF (15. 4 %- 85. 4 %), whereas Lys was ineffective. The combination of GF and <b>Lys</b> <b>showed</b> additive effects in inhibiting OCT uptake, whereas PGA and GF had additive effects for the inhibition of EX uptake. The amount of kidney uptake correlated with the number of charged amino acids. All radiopeptides were localized in the renal cortex, as indicated by autoradiography. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of renal accumulation of the radiopeptides tested could be achieved by either Lys or PGA but not by both at the same time, suggesting 2 different uptake mechanisms. The differences in renal accumulation of radiopeptides {{may be related to the}} number of charges of a molecule. GF is the only compound that inhibited renal accumulation of all radiopeptides tested. Additional experiments are needed to further elucidate these findings and to optimize inhibition of renal accumulation of radiopeptides to reduce the kidney dose in PRRT...|$|R

Kelvin probe force {{microscopy}} (KPFM) is {{a powerful}} atomic force microscope (AFM) -based technique to meas ure the local variations of surface potential at the nanoscale. It operates by detecting the difference of the work function between a fixed substrate and a conducting movable probe. By modulating the applied potent ial on the probe until the electric force between sample and tip is extinguish ed, {{it is possible to}} deter mine the local potential of the surface. KPFM has been extensively us ed to characterize the electrical properties {{of a wide variety of}} samples, from semiconductors to biomolecules. As KPFM spatial resolution is intrin sically limited by the long range of the electrostatic interaction, many contri butions on this technique are aimed to improve this feature. Some of them include operating in high vacuum and the development of specialized probes to operate in ambient conditions as, for example, the use of carbon nanotubes or coaxial AFM probes that are electrically shielded everywhere exc ept the very end of the tip. Here we present the use of standar d silicon tips modified by the deposition of gold nanoparticl es. These tips have recent <b>ly</b> <b>shown</b> to improve the aspect ratios and spatial resolution of AFM images. The silicon tips are modified by deposition of nan oclusters of nominal diam eter of 2 - 3 nm under ultrahigh vacuum conditions using an ion cluster source. In an attempt to extend this enhancement of the resolution and sensitivity to the electrical measurements under ambient conditions, we have performed a KPFM analysis of several samples that include Au and Ag nanoparticles, graphene flakes on silicon dioxide, single-wall carbon nanotubes and double-stranded DNA molecules. The results are compared with similar measurements performed with conventional metallic tips (PtIr 5 coated tips). We show that both, topography and surface potent ial images present evid ent improvements when recorded with Au-nanoparticle modified tipsPeer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Paired receptors are {{families}} of membrane proteins characterized by similar extracellular regions but different transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, meaning that some members can give inhibitory signals and others activating signals. Well-characterized {{examples include the}} KIR, SIRP, Ly 49, Nkpr, and Siglec families. The difference in the repertoire of these genes in mouse and man indicates that these families have evolved rapidly. For example, KIRs are found in humans and not mice, and <b>Ly</b> 49 <b>shows</b> the converse. These genes are often very polymorphic, e. g. KIR {{and the number of}} genes can vary as <b>shown</b> for <b>Ly</b> 49 in different mouse strains.
