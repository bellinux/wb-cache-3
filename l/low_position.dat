5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a <b>low</b> <b>position</b> throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{long and}} narrow skull was small in {{proportion}} to the body. It had a small antorbital fenestra, the hole between the nose and eye common to most archosaurs, including modern birds, though lost in extant crocodylians. The skull's <b>low</b> <b>position</b> suggests that Stegosaurus may have been a browser of low-growing vegetation. This interpretation is supported by the absence of front teeth and their likely replacement by a horny beak or rhamphotheca. The lower jaw of Stegosaurus jaws of Stegosaurus had flat downward and upward extensions that would have completely hidden the teeth when viewed from the side, and these probably supported a turtle-like beak in life. The presence of a beak extended along much of the jaws may have precluded the presence of cheeks in these species. Such an extensive beak was probably unique to Stegosaurus and some other advanced stegosaurids among ornithischians, which usually had beaks restricted to the jaw tips. Other researchers have interpreted these ridges as modified versions of similar structures in other ornithischians which might have supported fleshy cheeks, rather than beaks. Stegosaurian teeth were small, triangular, and flat; wear facets show that they did grind their food.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times {{as long as it}} is high. There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The <b>low</b> <b>position</b> of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E

25|$|Despite his eventful career, his <b>low</b> <b>position</b> on the {{seniority}} lists {{meant that}} Spear never {{lived to be}} promoted to flag rank. He died in 1837, still a post-captain. He had been twice married, marrying his first wife Grace Grant, a descendant of Charles Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aboyne, in 1809. After her death he married Grace Grant, a cousin of his first wife.|$|E
25|$|The {{second most}} {{powerful}} production car ever featured on Top Gear, the 1001 PS (987bhp; 736kW) Bugatti Veyron, was taken {{around the track}} by The Stig in Series 12, Episode 4, after 3 years of waiting. However, it disappointed the team by only managing fifth place on the Power Board (currently 16th), an unexpectedly <b>low</b> <b>position</b> ultimately attributed to the car's kerb weight of , {{more than any of}} the four faster cars. In Series 15 Episode 5 however, the Stig took the 1,200 PS Super Sport version around the track in 1:16.8, thus setting a new lap record.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the War Against Japan, Wang was {{in charge}} of the 1st Section (propaganda) of the 31st Corps Political Department, a logical {{progression}} when his 208th and 209th Divisions were reorganized into the corps-level unit. From November 1945 to June 1946, Wang was with his units on garrison duty in Hangzhou. He was then reassigned to the seemingly <b>low</b> <b>position</b> of Director of Student Affairs at Chia-hsing (Jiaxing) Youth Middle School, a specially established training and education institution for demobilized soldiers of the Youth Army. He was, however, still directly under the orders of Chiang Ching-kuo.|$|E

Gould showed considerable technical skill in performing and recording a wide repertoire including virtuosic and romantic works, such as his own arrangement of Ravel's La valse and Liszt's transcriptions of Beethoven's fifth and sixth symphonies. Gould worked from a young age with Guerrero on a technique known as finger-tapping: a method of training the fingers to act more independently from the arm.|$|E
25|$|Halsted {{appears to}} have had no active {{seagoing}} service {{after the end of}} the wars with France. He married Miss A. Fowler and had two sons and one daughter. Of his sons, his eldest, Lawrence William, obtained a commission in the 87th Regiment of Foot, while George Anthony followed his father into the navy, having reached the rank of lieutenant by 1830. Due to his <b>low</b> <b>position</b> on the seniority lists, John Halsted did not live long enough to achieve flag rank. He died, still a post-captain, at Exeter on 2 November 1830, at the age of 62.|$|E
25|$|A major {{contrast}} between landscape {{painting in the}} West and East Asia has been that while in the West until the 19th century it occupied a <b>low</b> <b>position</b> in the accepted hierarchy of genres, in East Asia the classic Chinese mountain-water ink painting was traditionally the most prestigious form of visual art. Aesthetic theories in both regions gave the highest status to the works seen to require the most imagination from the artist. In the West this was history painting, but in East Asia it was the imaginary landscape, where famous practitioners were, at least in theory, amateur literati, including several Emperors of both China and Japan. They were often also poets whose lines and images illustrated each other.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Walter Smith had been {{appointed}} manager, Scotland had dropped to a record <b>low</b> <b>position</b> in the FIFA World Rankings. Smith was credited with creating a [...] "club atmosphere" [...] within the national squad. Scotland performed well {{in the early stages}} of a tough UEFA Euro 2008 qualification group, but Smith resigned from the Scotland job in January 2007 to manage Rangers. Alex McLeish was hired to replace Smith. Scotland continued to pursue qualification for Euro 2008 under McLeish, but were eliminated after losing against Italy in the final match. McLeish left the Scotland job soon afterwards, to manage Birmingham City. Despite failing to qualify for a tournament, the improved results under both Smith and McLeish lifted Scotland to 13th place in the world rankings.|$|E
500|$|In North America, {{the song}} only managed to peak at 49 {{on the main}} Billboard chart in the U.S. {{on the issue of}} 24 February 2007 and spent 12 weeks on the chart.

Despite its <b>low</b> <b>position,</b> [...] "Smile" [...] managed to slowly sell over 500,000 copies in paid digital {{download}} and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 9 February 2009; it remained Allen's highest-charting single in the country until [...] "5 O'Clock" [...] which featured Allen, peaked at number 10 in 2011. Nonetheless, [...] "Smile" [...] remains Allen's highest-charting song as a solo artist in the United States, as well as one of three entries (after [...] "Fuck You" [...] and [...] "The Fear"). It also peaked at 86 on the Canadian Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} form of the flame fougasse was the safety fougasse. This design allowed the {{propelling}} charge to be stored separately until needed. The safety fougasse was constructed as follows: a small section was excavated from the side of a slope, leaving a shallow platform of earth, and a barrel of incendiary mixture was placed horizontally in a <b>low</b> <b>position</b> with one round face pointing towards the target. At the back, a section of stove or drain pipe was placed vertically against the rear face of the barrel. The lower end of the pipe was blocked off with a thin cover and positioned a few inches above the bottom of the barrel. The top of the pipe was fitted with a loose cap to keep water out. This pipe is what makes it a [...] "safety" [...] fougasse because it allows later installation of the propelling charge. Soil was then built up over the weapon until all that could be seen were the front disk of the barrel and top of the pipe.|$|E

It uses a gear configuration of neutral in the <b>lowest</b> <b>position,</b> and then the ascending gears going upwards from there; as opposed to most modern motorcycles which feature 1st gear in the <b>lowest</b> <b>position,</b> neutral up 1 half-click and then the ascending gears going upwards.|$|R
500|$|Similarly, {{the single}} charted {{strongly}} {{throughout the rest}} of Europe. In Austria, it became Minogue's first single since [...] "I Believe in You" [...] to appear inside the top ten of the Ö3 Austria Top 40 chart after it debuted at number 10. It later peaked at number five and stayed on the chart for 20 consecutive weeks. The song entered the Ultratop chart in the French-speaking Wallonia region of Belgium at a <b>low</b> <b>position</b> of 31, but peaked at number eight two weeks later. [...] "All the Lovers" [...] entered and peaked at number three on the SNEP chart in France, becoming Minogue's highest-debuting single in the country. Its total stay on the chart lasted for 29 weeks. In Germany, it peaked at number 10 on the Media Control Charts for two weeks and achieved Minogue's longest charting period for a solo-single in the country, appearing for 25 weeks in total. On the Hungarian Airplay Chart, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] reached number two, thus tying with [...] "In Your Eyes" [...] as her highest-peaking single in the country.

2500|$|As a way {{of dealing}} with his {{loneliness}} and homesickness at this time, Konuma began going to the cinema. He majored in film studies in the Art Department of Nihon University. Soon after graduation, in 1961, Konuma went to work at Nikkatsu Studios, {{about the same time as}} producer Yuki and directors Kōyū Ohara and Noboru Tanaka. The quartet were known by their individual characters as, [...] "Diligent Yuki, slovenly Ohara, faithful Tanaka, reckless Konuma." [...] Konuma started as a [...] "fifth" [...] assistant director, which meant he was in charge of the clipboard.
