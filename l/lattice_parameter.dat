This paper describes the identification of two distinct S phases with different <b>lattice</b> <b>parameters,</b> in a series of Al- 2. 5 Cu- 1. 5 Mg alloy samples, isothermally aged at temperatures between 200 and 400 degrees C for various times, using high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction.

The O'-sialon phase, which formed in the early stage of synthesis when oxygen partial pressure was relatively high, became less stable in the present annealing condition and decomposed.
