The food prescriptions and proscriptions were based on the traditional concept of maintaining body homeostasis through avoidance of: (1) excess 'hot'/'cold' or 'wet'/'dry' qualities of body energy; (2) disturbance of energy flow; or (3) inadequate energy levels. Various health problems were classified as being due to imbalances of these energy states. Excess 'hot'/'cold' or 'wet'/'dry' ailments were dealt with by increased consumption of foods of the opposite character; those due to disturbance of the normal flow of energy was avoided by the reduced intake of 'irritating' or 'poisonous' foods; and various tonics were believed to raise the amount of energy flow in the body. A rich knowledge of complex dietary rules was found to be prevalent among the lay public because the traditional rules filled explanatory and behavioural niches left open in Western medicine. Dietary manipulation was used to complement Western medicine in the multiple stages of the disease process by playing a predominant role {{at the beginning and end}} of the period of pathogenesis. ...|$|E

40|$|Inequality can be {{understood}} as a social fact, or as a concept used to claim the existence of a social fact. These two orientations are intimately related; inequal-ity is a social fact only insofar as people use the concept of “inequality ” accord-ing to social conventions for its use, thereby contributing to the meaningful, socially structured, and meaningfully socially structured character of society. A social constructionist approach to inequality requires attending to the con-cept “inequality ” as a cultural, sociolinguistic resource used to understand and describe social relations. Such use simultaneously recognizes and accom-plishes inequality as an intersubjective reality. By attending to inequality as a concept, the empirical study of inequality can be grounded conceptually in the natural language which inevitably informs analytic as well as <b>lay</b> <b>methods</b> of reasoning, and grounded empirically by reference to situated, practical lan-guage use as a constitutive feature of social identity, social relations, and social problems...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Sacrococcygeal {{pilonidal}} sinus is {{a chronic}} condition {{for which the}} treatment options remain controversial based on the high recurrence rates. Before 1997, excision and primary closure {{was the most popular}} method offered in our local community surgical practice. In this study, we aim to evaluate the results of treatment outcomes of the <b>lay</b> open <b>method</b> offered in 1997 to our local community patients and compare it to the excision and primary closure method, hoping it may help in opening up wider frontiers in the surgical practice on our local community to provide the best health care. Materials and Methods: Between January 1997 and December 2011, 600 patients with chronic sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus were included in our study. 443 were male and 157 were female (age range: 16 &# 150; 39). The <b>lay</b> open <b>method</b> was performed on 300 patients who agreed to the newly offered procedure, and excision with primary closure was performed on the other 300 patients that refused surgery with the <b>lay</b> open <b>method.</b> Results: The recurrence rate was 0 % for the lay open technique, and 3 % for the excision with primary closure method. All patients had undergone 5 years of follow-up. Conclusion: When the lay open technique is performed in a meticulous and carefully prepared manner with superb postoperative care and regular follow-up, it is more promising than excision with primary closure in treating chronic sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus, and may successfully achieve a zero (0 %) recurrence rate, low postoperative complications, and acceptable cosmetic wounds.

40|$|Hedgerows provide key {{wildlife}} habitat in intensive agricultural landscapes, but are declining {{in length and}} structural condition {{due to a lack}} of rejuvenation management, neglect and over-frequent trimming with mechanised flails. Here, we test cheaper, alternative methods to traditional hedge <b>laying</b> <b>methods</b> using a multi-site manipulative field experiment. In the first quantitative test of new approaches to hedge rejuvenation management, hedge regrowth, structure, berry provision for over-wintering wildlife and cost of rejuvenation were assessed in response to five methods, for three years following rejuvenation. Three ‘laying’ methods and coppicing were effective at improving hedgerow condition by stimulating basal regrowth, thus increasing the density of woody material at the base and reducing gap size. The pros and cons of coppicing are discussed in relation to its impact on different wildlife groups, and it is recommended in limited circumstances. Differences between the three ‘laying’ methods reduced over time, so a cheaper conservation hedging method is recommended as an alternative to traditional hedge laying. This new approach to hedge management offers the potential to restore twice the length of hedgerow currently rejuvenated under agri-environment schemes...|$|R

40|$|In current 3 -dimensional multi-pass {{repair weld}} {{simulations}} each pass is generally modelled {{as a single}} continuous weld bead using either a simultaneous bead deposition or a progressive bead deposition moving heat source approach. In reality the length of typical manual metal arc (MMA) repair welds often necessitates {{the use of multiple}} weld beads for any individual pass. To investigate the modelling assumptions associated with this approximation a series of results are presented that simulate the deposition of a multi-bead, single MMA weld pass on a stainless steel flat plate. The simulations make use of a fabricated single bead weld test specimen to define the welding conditions. A number of different heat source models and bead sequencing scenarios have been investigated. These include moving heat source simulations, simultaneous bead <b>laying</b> <b>methods</b> (also called "block-dumped" methods) and combinations of the two. The work provides a useful insight into how certain modelling approximations affect weld residual stress distributions. It is concluded that moving heat source end effects are not sensitive to modelling assumptions made in weld beads remote from the stop end. However, residual stress predictions at the mid-length of a multi-bead weld pass on a flat plate are sensitive to the modelling assumptions. In particular, modelling each bead of a multi-bead weld pass can increase the stresses at mid-length relative to a simulation that deposits the whole pass in one go. One further observation made is that modelling the central bead of a multi-bead weld pass using a block-dumped technique (allowing a symmetry boundary condition to be used perpendicular to the weld bead) can result in inaccurate or misleading results...|$|R
40|$|The health {{political}} discourse on self-care {{is dominated by}} the view that the selfmanaging patient represents a more democratic and patient-centric perspective, as he or she is believed to renegotiate the terms on which patient participation in health care has hitherto taken place. The self-managing patient is intended as a challenge to traditional medical authority by introducing <b>lay</b> <b>methods</b> of knowing disease. Rather than a meeting between authoritative professionals and vulnerable patients, the self-managing patient seeks to open up new spaces for a meeting between experts. The present paper questions these assumptions through an ethnographic exploration of a patient-led self-management program called the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program. The program is concerned with what its developers call the social and mental aspects of living with a chronic disease and uses trained patients as role models and program leaders. Drawing inspiration from Annemarie Mol’s term ‘logic’, we explore the rationale of ‘situations of selfmanagement’ and identify what we call a ‘logic of change’, which involves very specific ideas on how life with a chronic condition should be dealt with and directs attention towards particular manageable aspects of life with a chronic condition. This logic of change entails, we argue, a clash not between ‘medical’ and ‘lay’ forms of knowledge but between different logics or perceptions of how transformation can be achieved: through open-ended and ongoing reflection and experimentation in social settings or through standardised trajectories of change. Returning to the literature on lay forms of knowledge and illness perspectives, we question whether programs such as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program – despite its apparent patient-centric perspective – reproduces classical hierarchical relations between lay and expert knowledge, albeit in new forms...|$|R
