5|$|The James Dean biopic began {{development}} at Warner Bros. {{in the early}} 1990s. At one point, Michael Mann was contracted to direct with Leonardo DiCaprio starring in the lead role. After Mann's departure, Des McAnuff, Dennis Hopper and Milčo Mančevski were considered as directors. Rydell was hired as director in 1996, but the film continued to <b>languish</b> in development hell.|$|E
5|$|In May 1969, {{discontent with}} Krieger's {{economic}} policies led to riots {{in the cities}} of Corrientes, Rosario and Córdoba. Krieger was removed, but the Onganía administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy. By 1970, the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints, leading to a wage-price spiral. As the economy started to <b>languish</b> and import substitution industrialization ran out of steam, urban migration slowed. Per capita income fell, {{and with it the}} standard of living. Perón’s third term of office was characterized by an expansive monetary policy, which resulted in an uncontrolled rise in the level of inflation.|$|E
5|$|Development for The Rocketeer {{started as}} far back as 1983, when Stevens sold the film rights. Steve Miner and William Dear {{considered}} directing The Rocketeer before Johnston signed on. Screenwriters Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo had creative differences with Disney, which caused the film to <b>languish</b> in development hell. The studio also intended to change the trademark helmet design; Disney CEO Michael Eisner wanted a straight NASA-type helmet, but Johnston convinced the studio otherwise. Johnston also had to convince Disney to let him cast unknown actor Billy Campbell in the lead role. Filming for The Rocketeer lasted from September 19, 1990 to January 22, 1991. The visual effects sequences were created and designed by Industrial Light & Magic, and were supervised by animation director Wes Takahashi.|$|E
50|$|Flourishing has {{significant}} positive aspects magnified {{when compared to}} <b>languishing</b> adults and when <b>languishing</b> adults are compared to depressed adults, as explained by Keyes. For example, <b>languishing</b> adults have {{the same amount of}} chronic disease as those that are depressed whereas flourishing adults are in exceptionally better physical health. <b>Languishing</b> adults miss as many days at work as depressed adults and, in fact, visit doctors and therapists more than depressed adults.|$|R

5|$|During the 18thcentury {{the castle}} {{was allowed to}} <b>languish.</b> The {{south-west}} tower was falling apart and around 1752 part of the curtain wall east of the gatehouse was demolished (it was rebuilt {{towards the end of}} the century). The town and its historic ruins were by now attracting interest as a tourist destination, largely due to Bishop Thomas Percy's poem, The Hermit of Warkworth. In the mid 19thcentury Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland, undertook some preservation work. His successor, Algernon Percy, contracted Anthony Salvin to restore the keep. The work undertaken between 1853 and 1858 was not as extensive as Salvin had planned, and was limited to partially refacing the exterior and adding new floors and roofs to two chambers, which became known as the Duke's Chambers, on the second floor. The duke occasionally used the chambers for picnics when he visited from Alnwick Castle. Algernon Percy funded excavations at the castle in the 1850s which uncovered the remains of the collegiate church within the bailey.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} remarked that the maniacs {{of the male}} sex in all hospitals, who assist in cutting wood, making fires, and digging in a garden, and the females who are {{employed}} in washing, ironing, and scrubbing floors, often recover, while persons, whose rank exempts them from performing such services, <b>languish</b> away their lives {{within the walls of}} the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Beets {{are one of}} {{the most}} boron-intensive of modern crops, a {{dependency}} possibly introduced as an evolutionary response its pre-industrial ancestor's constant exposure to sea spray; on commercial farms, a 60 tonne per hectare (26.8 ton/acre) harvest requires 600grams of elemental boron per hectare (8.6 ounces/acre) for growth. A lack of boron causes the meristem and the shoot to <b>languish,</b> eventually leading to heart rot.|$|E
25|$|After this European {{exploration}} {{continued in}} 1824 when Sir John Gardiner Wilkinson explored and mapped the city remains. The copyist Robert Hay and his surveyor G.

The copies made by Hay and Laver <b>languish</b> largely unpublished in the British Library, where an ongoing project to identify their locations is underway.|$|E

Saint Pierre and Miquelon are now trying to diversify their economy into tourism and other areas.|$|E
25|$|The CPPCG {{was adopted}} by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 1948 and came into effect on 12 January 1951 (Resolution 260 (III)). After the {{necessary}} 20 countries became parties to the Convention, it came into force as international law on 12 January 1951. At that time however, only two of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (UNSC) were parties to the treaty, which caused the Convention to <b>languish</b> for over four decades.|$|E

25|$|A Writers Guild of America strike {{forced the}} project to <b>languish</b> in {{development}} {{for more than a}} year. Begelman left MGM because several of his projects had performed poorly at the box office. This put all of his future projects, Buckaroo Banzai included, in jeopardy. Begelman formed Sherwood Productions and exercised a buy-out option with MGM for the Banzai script. He took it to 20th Century Fox who agreed to make it with a $12 million budget. Mac Rauch ended up writing three more drafts before they had a shooting script.|$|E
25|$|The family's {{finances}} did not flourish, and Aunt Branwell {{spent the}} money with caution. Emily had a visceral need {{of her home}} and the countryside that surrounded it, and to leave it would cause her to <b>languish</b> and wither. Charlotte and Anne, being more realistic, did not hesitate in finding work and from April 1839 to December 1841 the two sisters had several posts as governesses. Not staying long with each family, their employment would last for some months or a single season. However, Anne did stay with the Robinsons in Thorp Green where things went well, from May 1840 to June 1845.|$|E
25|$|The new-look Islanders {{were picked}} by most analysts to <b>languish</b> towards {{the bottom of}} the standings. Eyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward Ryan Smyth from the Edmonton Oilers at the trade {{deadline}} on February 27, 2007. Injuries to DiPietro and a distracting stick swinging incident that resulted in Simon's suspension {{for the rest of the}} season provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention. They qualified for the post-season, assisted by a late-season winning steak and a 3–2 shootout victory against the New Jersey Devils in their final regular season game. Despite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the Presidents' Trophy-winning Buffalo Sabres.|$|E
50|$|One {{reason to}} study and {{cultivate}} flourishing is {{to learn about the}} antonym of <b>languishing</b> and depression. Cultivating flourishing does not eliminate depression; instead, depression is {{on the opposite side of}} the scale from flourishing. However, it is important to note how much more beneficial flourishing is in comparison to either depression or <b>languishing,</b> which can be considered as the midpoint between the two concepts.|$|R

25|$|The Convention {{came into}} force as {{international}} law on 12 January 1951 after the minimum 20 countries became parties. At that time however, {{only two of}} the five permanent members of the UN Security Council were parties to the treaty: France and the Republic of China. The Soviet Union ratified in 1954, the United Kingdom in 1970, the People's Republic of China in 1983 (having replaced the Taiwan-based Republic of China on the UNSC in 1971), and the United States in 1988. This long delay in support for the Convention by the world's most powerful nations caused the Convention to <b>languish</b> for over four decades. Only in the 1990s did the international law on the crime of genocide begin to be enforced.|$|E
25|$|One major {{question}} {{in the history of}} Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us. The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by Strabo in his Geography and Plutarch in his Parallel Lives. The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to Neleus of Scepsis. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to Scepsis, where his heirs let them <b>languish</b> in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when Apellicon of Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When Lucius Cornelius Sulla occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus and then by the philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1864, Farren {{moved to}} the Olympic Theatre, where she stayed for several years, playing {{in a number of}} pieces, {{including}} The Hidden Hand by Tom Taylor; My Wife's Bonnet by John Maddison Morton; the burlesques Prince Camaralzaman, or, the Fairies' Revenge and Faust and Marguerite; and Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, as the Clown. She also played the title role in Lydia <b>Languish,</b> Charlotte in High Life Below Stairs, Nerissa in The Merchant of Venice, Nan in Good for Nothing by J. B. Buckstone, Jo in Nicholas Nickleby, and Sam Willoughby in The Ticket-of-Leave Man, again earning praise for her comic portrayals. The manager of the Olympic, Horace Wigan, and playwright Tom Taylor, each of whom directed shows at the theatre, taught Farren much about stagecraft and encouraged her to experiment and expand her acting. During this time, she also played roles in other theatres, such as Pert in London Assurance in 1866. In the second half of 1868, she joined the company at the Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, playing, among other things, Nancy Rouse in a F. C. Burnand's burlesque Fowl Play.|$|E
