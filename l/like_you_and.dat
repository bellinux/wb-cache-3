500|$|After {{releasing}} the [...] "No Guru" [...] album, Morrison's music appeared less gritty and more adult contemporary with the well-received 1987 album, Poetic Champions Compose, {{considered to be}} one of his recording highlights of the 1980s. The romantic ballad from this album, [...] "Someone Like You", has been featured subsequently in the soundtracks of several movies, including 1995's French Kiss, and in 2001, both Someone <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> <b>and</b> Bridget Jones's Diary.|$|E
500|$|His {{career was}} safe, but the episode briefly {{affected}} Gielgud's health; {{he suffered a}} nervous breakdown some months afterwards. He never spoke publicly about the incident, and it was quickly sidelined by the press and politely ignored by writers during his lifetime. Privately he made donations to gay campaign groups, but did not endorse them in public. In his later years {{he said to the}} actor Simon Callow, [...] "I do admire people <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Ian McKellen for coming out, but I can't be doing with that myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Stanley's {{achievements}} in office were mixed. He established various specialist departments to manage output in numerous industries and reorganised {{the structure of}} the Board. However, despite previous successes with unions, his negotiations were ineffective. Writing to Leader of the House of Commons and future Prime Minister Bonar Law in January 1919, Lloyd George described Stanley as having [...] "all the glibness of Runciman and that is apt to take in innocent persons <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me... Stanley, to put it quite bluntly, is a funk, and {{there is no room for}} funks in the modern world." [...] Stanley left the Board of Trade and the government in May 1919 and returned to the UERL.|$|E

500|$|Artist Richard Chopping {{once again}} {{provided}} the cover art for the novel. On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts. As to the dagger, I really have no strong views. I had thought of the ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on people <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me, {{but if you have a}} nice dagger in mind please let us use it. The title of the book will be Thunderball. It is immensely long, immensely dull and only your jacket can save it!" ...|$|E
500|$|Barbirolli's {{repertoire}} {{was not as}} wide as that of many of {{his colleagues}} because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted. His colleague Sir Adrian Boult liked and admired Barbirolli but teased him for his meticulousness: [...] "We can't all be <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> spend months studying these things and then have days of rehearsals before we conduct them. For some of us they're only sporting events." [...] Barbirolli was shocked by such levity. His approach was illustrated by the care he took with Mahler's symphonies. His biographer Michael Kennedy commented, [...] "it is ironical that the effort of composing the symphonies shortened Mahler's life; interpreting them certainly put an enormous strain on Barbirolli in his last decade." [...] He found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years, and he would spend hours meticulously bowing all the string parts in preparation for his performances. His first performance of Mahler's Ninth took nearly 50 hours of rehearsal.|$|E
500|$|Though Spielberg {{complied}} with {{a request from}} Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors, he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that [...] "somewhat anonymous" [...] performers would help the audience [...] "believe this was happening to people <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me", whereas [...] "stars {{bring a lot of}} memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes... corrupt the story." [...] The director added that in his plans [...] "the superstar was gonna be the shark". The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of then-president of Universal Sid Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha's Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer.|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, Gunn {{revealed}} that Tyler Bates would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write {{some of the}} score first {{so that he can}} film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film. In February 2014, Gunn {{revealed that}} the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as [...] "Hooked on a Feeling", on a mixtape in Quill's Walkman, which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost. In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the 60s and 70s were [...] "cultural reference points", saying, [...] "It’s striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [...] is a real person from planet Earth who’s just <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me. Except that he’s in this big outer space adventure." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Take a Bow" [...] {{received}} general acclaim. Taraborrelli {{called it}} a [...] "melancholy and beautifully executed ballad". Author Chris Wade wrote in his book The Music of Madonna that [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was a standout from the album. He complimented Madonna and Babyface's vocals, while calling the music [...] "stunning". He declared {{it as one of}} the singer's [...] "purest songs, totally free of any gimmicks, self consciousness or knowing sexual references; a graceful end to the album." [...] Encyclopedia Madonnica writer Matthew Rettenmund {{called it a}} [...] "sentimental ballad with showbiz theme" [...] while finding similarities in the song to that of [...] "Superstar" [...] by The Carpenters. In his review of Bedtime Stories, Billboards Paul Verna called it a [...] "holiday feast for Top 40, rhythm crossover, and AC". Also from Billboard, Larry Flick gave the single a particularly positive review; [...] "The follow-up to the top five smash 'Secret' [...] is as perfect as top 40 fare gets. This single has a delightful, immediately memorable melody and chorus, engaging romance-novel lyrics and a lead vocal that is both sweet and quietly soulful. A lovely way for [...] to kick out '95". J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun stated that the song, about [...] "innocent romance" [...] has a [...] "gently cascading melody". Peter Calvin from The Advocate praised the lyrical flow of the song, saying that the [...] "effect is truly heartbreaking. The song... shows that ultimately Madonna... is just <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me".|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Winterfield {{looked at}} his dog, and changed the subject. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> dogs, Mr. Romayne?" [...] he asked. [...] "I see my spaniel's eyes saying that he <b>likes</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> his tail begging you to take some notice of him." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1956, Robeson {{was called}} before HUAC after {{he refused to}} sign an {{affidavit}} affirming {{that he was not}} a Communist. In his testimony, he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to reveal his political affiliations. When asked why he had not remained in the Soviet Union because of his affinity with its political ideology, he replied, [...] "because my father was a slave and my people died to build , I am going to stay here, and have a part of it just <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> no fascist-minded people will drive me from it!" [...] At that hearing, Robeson stated [...] "Whether I am or not a Communist is irrelevant. The question is whether American citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or sympathies, may enjoy their constitutional rights." [...] Robeson's passport was subsequently revoked. Campaigns were launched to protest the passport ban and the restriction of his right to travel over the next four years, but it was to no avail. In 1957, unable to accept invitations to perform abroad, Paul Robeson sang for audiences in London, where 1,000 concert tickets for his telephone concert at St Pancras Town Hall sold out within an hour, and Wales via the transatlantic telephone cable TAT-1: [...] "We have to learn the hard way that there is another way to sing".|$|E
2500|$|The 7 July 2003 {{issue of}} Time Asia {{magazine}} carried a feature article entitled The Lion in Winter, which examined Singapore's prevailing bleak economic climate against a wider backdrop of Asian NIE malaise at the time. In the article, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong {{was quoted as}} saying, [...] "So let it evolve, and in time the population will understand {{that some people are}} born that way. We are born this way and they are born that way, but they are <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me." [...] He also stated that though homosexual acts remained illegal in Singapore, gay people would now be allowed to serve in 'sensitive positions' in the civil service. This started a major controversy in the media. The statement was greatly welcomed by the gay population of Singapore, but there was a strong reaction from those opposed to homosexuality. These included the National Council of Churches of Singapore, which issued a statement that homosexuality was incongruous with the scriptures of Christianity, and an independent group of 20 Christians from different denominations, voluntary organisations and professions, led by Pastor Yang Tuck Yoong, of the Cornerstone Community Church. This group held a meeting to discuss a strategy and plan of action for Christians to tackle what they termed as a [...] "volatile situation", and Yang's church issued a statement [...] "Don't Keep Silent" [...] on 20 July, calling on the Church in Singapore to [...] "take a stand". Following this, many letters opposing homosexuality were published in Singapore's daily, The Straits Times.|$|E

2500|$|As their {{fame and}} {{prestige}} {{increased in the}} late 1960s, The Beatles—and John Lennon in particular—added their voices to the Anti-war. In the documentary , Tariq Ali attributes the Beatles' activism to the fact that, in his opinion, [...] "The whole culture had been radicalized: [...] was engaged with the world, and the world was changing him." [...] "Revolution", 1968, commemorated the worldwide student uprisings. In 1969, when Lennon and Yoko Ono were married, they staged a week-long [...] "bed-in for peace" [...] in the Amsterdam Hilton, attracting worldwide media coverage. At the second [...] "Bed-in" [...] in Montreal, in June 1969, they recorded [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] in their hotel room. The song was sung by over half a million demonstrators in Washington, D.C. at the second Vietnam Moratorium Day, on 15 October 1969. In 1972 Lennon's most controversial protest song LP was released, Some Time In New York City, the title of whose lead single [...] "Woman Is the Nigger of the World", a phrase coined by Ono in the late 1960s to protest sexism, set off a storm of controversy, and in consequence received little airplay and much banning. The Lennons {{went to great lengths}} (including a press conference attended by staff from Jet and Ebony magazines) to explain that they had used the word [...] "nigger" [...] in a symbolic sense and not as an affront to African Americans. The album also included [...] "Attica State", about the Attica Prison riots of September 9, 1971; [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] and [...] "The Luck Of The Irish", about the massacre of demonstrators in Northern Ireland and [...] "Angela", in support of black activist Angela Davis. Lennon also performed at the [...] "Free John Sinclair" [...] benefit concert in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on December 10, 1971. on behalf of the imprisoned antiwar activist and poet who was serving 10 years in state prison for selling two joints of marijuana to an undercover cop. On this occasion Lennon and Ono appeared on stage with among others singers Phil Ochs and Stevie Wonder, plus antiwar activists Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale of the Black Panthers party. Lennon's song [...] "John Sinclair" [...] (which can be heard on his Some Time In New York City album), calls on the authorities to [...] "Let him be, set him free, let him be <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me". The benefit was attended by some 20,000 people, and three days later the State of Michigan released Sinclair from prison.|$|E
