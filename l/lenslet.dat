Using a directional lenticular <b>lenslet</b> filter, the display generates nine 3D views.

The reviewers also note that the 3D resolution for a 1080p signal looks more like 720p and lacks parallax, which reduces immersion.|$|E
5000|$|Integral imaging is a {{technique}} for producing 3D displays which are both autostereoscopic and multiscopic, meaning that the 3D image is viewed {{without the use of}} special glasses and different aspects are seen when it is viewed from positions that differ either horizontally or vertically.

Each is focused onto a photon sensor (typically a CCD array or CMOS array or quad-cell). The local tilt of the wavefront across each lens can then be calculated from {{the position of the}} focal spot on the sensor. Any phase aberration can be approximated by a set of discrete tilts.

40|$|A {{lenticular}} film {{system designed}} to suppress image degrading crossover during dual screen radiographic exposure is proposed and evaluated. The lenticular screen consists of two sheets of crossed cylindrical <b>lenslets</b> each with a frequency of 25 lenslets/mm. A numerical analysis via optical ray tracing compares the theoretical frequency response of the proposed system {{to that of a}} conventional radiographic film. It shows an enhancement in the response by a factor of two, for frequencies 1 - 4 c/mm. Experimental measurements made on simulations of the proposed system using Kodak film type, SO- 241 confirm the predicted improvement in the mid-frequency range. The proposed lenticular system reduces the need to absorb crossover illumination with a tinted film base by imaging crossover illumination with <b>lenslets</b> molded into the film base. By using the crossover illumination as part of the image forming exposure, a reduced radiation dose is required to obtain comparable or improved image quality...|$|R
50|$|In non-scanning, {{a single}} 2-D sensor output {{contains}} all spatial (x,y) and spectral (λ) data. HSI devices for non-scanning yield the full datacube at once, without any scanning. Figuratively speaking, a single snapshot represents a perspective {{projection of the}} datacube, from which its three-dimensional structure can be reconstructed. The most prominent benefits of these snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems are the snapshot advantage (higher light throughput) and shorter acquisition time. A number of systems have been designed, including computed tomographic imaging spectrometry (CTIS), fiber-reformatting imaging spectrometry (FRIS), integral field spectroscopy with <b>lenslet</b> arrays (IFS-L), multi-aperture integral field spectrometer (Hyperpixel Array), integral field spectroscopy with image slicing mirrors (IFS-S), image-replicating imaging spectrometry (IRIS), filter stack spectral decomposition (FSSD), coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI), image mapping spectrometry (IMS), and multispectral Sagnac interferometry (MSI).

30|$|The {{viewing angle}} of {{integral}} imaging system {{is limited by}} the size of each elemental image and the distance between the <b>lenslet</b> and the EIA. In an integral imaging system, the <b>lenslet</b> array acts as a spatial beam splitter. Each <b>lenslet</b> unit is equivalent to a macro pixel so the <b>lenslet</b> unit is always not large. Most of the commercially available <b>lenslet</b> arrays are made of single-layer optical glass or optical plastic. They have no aberration correction capability and the monolayer <b>lenslet</b> array has a small viewing angle of about 30 degrees. To overcome the limitation of viewing angle, various methods have been proposed [5 – 10, 14, 15]. However, most of these algorithms have some limitations and their performances heavily depend on some specific conditions. The viewer tracking has a complex control system and modifying the configuration of the lens array can also extend the viewing angle, such as the fresnel lens array and negative index planoconcave lens array [18, 19]. Conventional fisheye lenses can map flat image onto wide field of view, but suppressing field curvature and their aberrations needs multi-layer components, and thus imposes harsh design tradeoffs.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a huge}} {{demand on}} {{miniaturized}} cameras {{in the field of}} mobile consumer electronics. These cameras are currently based on miniaturized single aperture optics. In order to further decrease the thickness of miniaturized camera systems, a multichannel imaging principle needs to be used. These artificial compound eye cameras permit a further decrease in thickness by a factor of two in comparison to miniaturized single aperture optics with same resolution and pixel size. Their fabrication process is currently based on the reflow of photoresist. Due to physical limitations of this technique, only spherical and ellipsoidal surface profiles of the single <b>lenslets</b> are achievable. Consequently, the potential for correcting optical aberrations is restricted leading to limited image quality and resolution. This can be improved significantly by the use of refractive freeform arrays.

40|$|Plenoptic {{cameras and}} Shack-Hartmann {{wavefront}} sensors are lenslet-based optical systems {{that do not}} form a conventional image. The addition of a lens array into these systems allows for the aberrations generated by {{the combination of the}} object and the optical components located prior to the lens array to be measured or corrected with post-processing. This dissertation provides a ray selection method to determine the rays that pass through each <b>lenslet</b> in a lenslet-based system. This first-order, ray trace method is developed for any lenslet-based system with a well-defined fore optic, where in this dissertation the fore optic is all of the optical components located prior to the lens array. For example, in a plenoptic camera the fore optic is a standard camera lens. Because a lens array at any location after the exit pupil of the fore optic is considered in this analysis, it is applicable to both plenoptic cameras and Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors. Only a generic, unaberrated fore optic is considered, but this dissertation establishes a framework for considering the effect of an aberrated fore optic in lenslet-based systems. The rays from the fore optic that pass through a <b>lenslet</b> placed at any location after the fore optic are determined. This collection of rays is reduced to three rays that describe the entire <b>lenslet</b> ray set. The <b>lenslet</b> ray set is determined at the object, image, and pupil planes of the fore optic. The consideration of the apertures that define the <b>lenslet</b> ray set for an on-axis <b>lenslet</b> leads to three classes of lenslet-based systems. Vignetting of the <b>lenslet</b> rays is considered for off-axis lenslets. Finally, the <b>lenslet</b> ray set is normalized into terms similar to the field and aperture vector used to describe the aberrated wavefront of the fore optic. The analysis in this dissertation is complementary to other first-order models that have been developed for a specific plenoptic camera layout or Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor application. This general analysis determines the location where the rays of each <b>lenslet</b> pass through the fore optic establishing a framework to consider the effect of an aberrated fore optic in a future analysis...|$|E

A Fresnel <b>lenslet</b> array pattern is {{written on a}} phase-only LCoS spatial light modulator device (SLM) to replace the regular analog <b>lenslet</b> array in a conventional integral imaging system. We theoretically analyze the capture part of the proposed system based on Fresnel wave propagation formulation.

Because of the multiple focal planes introduced by the discrete lenslets, multiple image planes are observed. The use of discrete <b>lenslet</b> arrays also causes some other artifacts on the recorded elemental images.
