5|$|After the Communist Party {{seized power}} in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city {{became part of}} the Eastern Bloc. The city annexed new <b>land,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} rose significantly, becoming 90% Slovak. Large residential areas consisting of high-rise prefabricated panel buildings, such as those in the Petržalka borough, were built. The Communist government also built several new grandiose buildings, such as the Most Slovenského národného povstania bridge and the Slovak Radio headquarters.|$|E

5|$|An {{interchange}} {{is planned}} between MD 12 and US 113 south of Snow Hill {{in order to}} improve safety and traffic flow as a follow up to widening US 113; however, the project is currently on hold. This proposed interchange is to be a dumbbell interchange, a variation of the diamond interchange with two roundabouts on MD 12 where it intersects the ramps to US 113. The proposed cost needed to build this interchange is $24.2 million, which includes engineering, acquisition of <b>land,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> actual construction.|$|E

5|$|Following several {{constitutional}} conferences, the Constitution Act officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially {{with four}} provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Canada assumed control of Rupert's <b>Land</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> North-Western Territory {{to form the}} Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion {{and the creation of}} the province of Manitoba in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.|$|E
5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his <b>land,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British would be obliged {{to protect him from}} incursions by the Boers.|$|E
5|$|However {{just before}} the announcement, the Drinking Water Inspectorate {{announced}} that it was increasing the safe level of the chemical in drinking water. Hemel Hempstead MP, Mike Penning accused the government of changing the rules to suit the situation in which PFOS levels in drinking water in the area may rise in the future. Most of the fuel burned outrather than spilling into the soil, so the impact on surrounding <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water table was limited.|$|E

5|$|In 1523, Hernán Cortés {{organised}} two expeditions towards Central America from Mexico, one by <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{other by}} sea. He commissioned {{the first to}} Pedro de Alvarado and the second to Cristóbal de Olid. Alvarado initiated the conquest of Guatemala, and then set out on an expedition into Honduras. Olid began the conquest of Honduras' interior, arriving in 1524, but soon set himself up independently of Cortés.|$|E

5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1893 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory purchase of <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> raising of capital. To keep the powers alive, the BS announced a new bill in November 1895, which included an application for an extension of time. The additional time and permission to raise an extra £100,000 of capital was granted when the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1896 received royal assent on 7 August 1896.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the land}} {{near the mouth of}} Mahoning Creek is developed. A strip of land {{crossing}} the watershed in its central section is also developed. The southernmost part of the watershed is largely agricultural land.

5|$|Oil-shale {{extraction}} {{can damage}} the biological and recreational value of <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ecosystem in the mining area. Combustion and thermal processing generate waste material. In addition, the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale, as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels.|$|E

5|$|The Act covers five {{areas of}} trust law: {{the duty of}} care imposed upon trustees, trustees' power of investment, the power to appoint nominees and agents, the power to acquire <b>land,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> power to receive {{remuneration}} for work done as a trustee.

5|$|The Crusade was {{initiated}} by appeal from Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, who requested western aid to help repel the invading Seljuk Turks from Anatolia.
