5|$|This theory {{states that}} Nakagawa was {{unaware that the}} vessel he was attacking was a {{hospital}} ship, and that the sinking was an unfortunate accident. This view was supported by several Japanese officers, {{both before and after}} the revelation that Nakagawa was responsible. Amongst them was Lieutenant Commander Zenji Orita, who took command of I-177 after Nakagawa. Orita did not hear anything from the crew about having sunk a hospital ship, not even rumours, and believed that if I-177 had knowingly attacked Centaur, he would have <b>learned</b> <b>this</b> from the crew's gossip.|$|E

5|$|William Warburton's {{treatise}} The Divine Legation of Moses, published from 1738 to 1741, {{included an}} analysis of ancient mystery rites that drew upon Sethos for much of its evidence. Assuming that all mystery rites derived from Egypt, Warburton argued that {{the public face of}} Egyptian religion was polytheistic, but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal a deeper, monotheistic truth to elite initiates. One of them, Moses, <b>learned</b> <b>this</b> truth during his Egyptian upbringing and developed Judaism to reveal it to the entire Israelite nation.|$|E
5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he <b>learned</b> <b>this</b> information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, Spivey {{was arrested}} in New York, and was {{released}} pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point shaver, and was upset that the payment {{for his role in}} shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original grand jury testimony, which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told the grand jury that Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal, stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury; Spivey said he <b>learned</b> <b>this</b> from Line. The trial lasted for 13days before the case went to a jury. By a 9–3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused a mistrial. The grand jury eventually dropped the charges against Spivey.|$|E

Their language is represented by Hebrew, as in Ortah. Ice People introduce themselves by describing their genealogy into the remote past ending by saying they are related to a god. Magic that works well in Derlavai will not work well in the Land of the Ice People; the Algarvians <b>learned</b> <b>this</b> to their disadvantage when they tried murdering Kaunians there.

25|$|The other {{strand of}} {{dramatic}} tradition was classical aesthetic theory. This theory was derived ultimately from Aristotle; in Renaissance England, however, the theory was better known through its Roman interpreters and practitioners. At the universities, plays were staged {{in a more}} academic form as Roman closet dramas. These plays, usually performed in Latin, adhered to classical ideas of unity and decorum, {{but they were also}} more static, valuing lengthy speeches over physical action. Shakespeare would have <b>learned</b> <b>this</b> theory at grammar school, where Plautus and especially Terence were key parts of the curriculum and were taught in editions with lengthy theoretical introductions.|$|E

The RAF, having <b>learned</b> <b>this</b> lesson, were now {{executing}} their offensive by conducting night bombing operations on an increasingly large scale, with 1,000 bomber raids being assembled from 1942. Deep-penetration raids into Germany would be suspended until long range escorting fighters became available. The P-38 with 568 litre drop tanks were rushed back to operations over Europe after a year's absence to contend with the Jagdwaffe. Until the turn of the year the Luftwaffe would maintain air superiority over its homeland.|$|E
25|$|As {{an owner}} of a {{pioneering}} new school with the a need for original publications in Tamil prose to teach subjects for all grades, he felt {{a need for a}} printing press. He and his colleague Sadasiva Pillai went to Madras, India in 1849 to purchase a printing press. On the way they stopped at Tiruvatuturai Ateenam in Tanjavur, India, an important Saiva monastery. He was asked by the head of the monastery to preach. After listening to his preaching and understanding his unusual mastery of the knowledge of Agamas, the head of the monastery conferred on him the title Navalar (<b>learned).</b> <b>This</b> honorary degree from a prestigious Saiva monastery enhanced his position amongst Saivas and he was known as the Navalar since then.|$|E
25|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, Bourdieu employs some {{terminology used}} in economics {{to analyze the}} processes {{of social and cultural}} reproduction, of how the various forms of capital tend to transfer {{from one generation to the}} next. For Bourdieu, formal education represents the key example of this process. Educational success, according to Bourdieu, entails a whole range of cultural behaviour, extending to ostensibly non-academic features like gait, dress, or accent. Privileged children have <b>learned</b> <b>this</b> behaviour, as have their teachers. Children of unprivileged backgrounds have not. The children of privilege therefore fit the pattern of their teachers' expectations with apparent 'ease'; they are 'docile'. The unprivileged are found to be 'difficult', to present 'challenges'. Yet both behave as their upbringing dictates. Bourdieu regards this 'ease', or 'natural' ability—distinction—as in fact the product of a great social labour, largely on the part of the parents. It equips their children with the dispositions of manner as well as thought which ensure they are able to succeed within the educational system and can then reproduce their parents' class position in the wider social system.|$|E

5000|$|Mastery {{learning}} is a method of instruction in which students thoroughly learn all material they are studying. Students do not progress on to learning new material until they have mastered current material. This gives students a feeling of control, and indeed, of mastery. In language <b>learning</b> <b>this</b> is particularly important, as this feeling of control {{is directly related to}} the ability to <b>learn.</b> <b>This</b> is demonstrated by Krashen's research on the [...] "affective filter".|$|R
25|$|The provincial {{government}} and police were criticised by the locals for having allowed the attack to take place, especially since police roadblocks {{on the way}} to Beslan were removed shortly before the attack. Many blamed rampant corruption that allowed the attackers to bribe their way through the checkpoints; in fact, this was even what they had openly boasted to their hostages. Others say the militants took the back roads used by smugglers in collusion with the police. Yulia Latynina alleged that Major Gurazhev was captured after he approached the militants' truck to demand a bribe for what he thought was an oil-smuggling operation. It was also alleged the federal police knew of the time and place of the planned attack; according to internal police documents obtained by Novaya Gazeta, the Moscow MVD knew about the hostage taking four hours in advance, having <b>learned</b> <b>this</b> from a militant captured in Chechnya. According to Basayev, the road to Beslan was cleared of roadblocks because the FSB planned to ambush the group later, believing the rebels' aim was to seize the parliament of North Ossetia in Vladikavkaz.|$|E
