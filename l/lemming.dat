5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs {{in the park and}} the {{landscape}} protection area each year. Bears can also be found in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, American mink and European pine marten. The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway <b>lemming</b> and wood <b>lemming</b> are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} new revolute and torsional lamina emergent mechanism (<b>LEM)</b> flex-ure {{designs that}} are suited {{for use in}} metals. Previous <b>LEM</b> flexures have been designed for use in highly elastic materials, such as polymers. In extending <b>LEM</b> flexure designs to metals, a <b>LEM</b> flexure design criteria is also introduced. The <b>LEM</b> flexure criteria is based on relative perfor-mance between the <b>LEM</b> flexure and a performance datum which the <b>LEM</b> flexure must improve upon. This performance datum, or benchmark, is a section of lamina that is of the same overall length, width, and thickness as the <b>LEM</b> flexure. An analysis of the revolute and torsional metal <b>LEM</b> flexures, based on the <b>LEM</b> flexure criteria, is performed and both are found to success-fully meet the criteria. A brief comparative performance study is also carried out between a basic crank-slider mechanism to which the revolute and torsional metal <b>LEM</b> flexures have and have not been applied. The revolute and torsional metal <b>LEM</b> flexures are found to improve the crank-slider performance...|$|R

5|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected <b>lemming</b> to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage {{for the rest of the}} lemmings.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian coats are colored for {{a variety}} of reasons, the major {{selective}} pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication and physiological processes such as temperature regulation. Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), collared <b>lemming</b> (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, {{is the result of a}} symbiotic relationship with algae. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.|$|E

25|$|Pasvik {{is at the}} {{intersection}} between western and eastern species, and between the forest tundra and Arctic tundra. Common frog is the only amphibian and the viviparous lizard is the only reptile. There are 34 species of mammals in the national park. The only non-wild animals are reindeer. Mice are the most commons, especially the Eurasian pygmy shrew. The only true Arctic species is the Norway <b>lemming.</b> Larger species include the brown bear, a declining number of wolverines, and moose, {{in addition to other}} common, smaller mammals. The American mink is an introduced species which has become quite common.|$|E

25|$|The most {{successful}} and first club dedicated solely to football {{in these early}} years was Malmö BI (then abbreviated MBI, and now called FC Rosengård after various changes of name), {{which was founded in}} 1904 by former MVK players, and based at Malmö IP. The ground also became home to IFK Malmö's football division, which was formed in 1903. A third club, Malmö FF, took up residence at the stadium following its own foundation on 24 February 1910 by 19 men at the Malmö IP restaurant. Several members of IFK Malmö's athletics division left the club on 26 August 1908 due to differences in opinion regarding its administration; the dissidents formed Malmö Allmänna Idrottsförening (MAI) two weeks later. Swedish javelin thrower Eric <b>Lemming</b> set two new world records in the first international competition that MAI hosted on 10–11 July 1909.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal life}} {{in these areas}} is also {{relatively}} rich. The zone is particularly important to the brown bear, which likes to hibernate the winter away in dens along the mountainside. In spring, the brown bears descent to the plains, and only return to the mountain when the berries do. These terrains are also favored stomping grounds of the Eurasian lynx. Both species, brown bear and Eurasian lynx, are protected in Sweden. Besides the red fox, the other predators, which are the wolverine, the gray wolf and the Arctic fox, are much rarer {{and do not have}} a fixed location in the park. The park shelters an important population of moose that pass the summer on the mountain, but prefer to spend the winter in areas less snowy. There are no more wild reindeerin the park, which is part of those few Swedish mountains not included in the area of pasture of domestic reindeer. Muskox, which left the area almost 4000 years ago, were reintroduced in Norway and sometimes wander near the park. Among the smaller animals, one can cite the red squirrel, the European pine marten, and the mountain hare. Like other Swedish mountains, the Norway <b>lemming</b> is present in Fulufjället, but in a patchy fashion, extremely numerous some years and almost absent others. This phenomenon is still not entirely understood.|$|E
