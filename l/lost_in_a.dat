The fortress was constructed in the heat of summer within a few months when few Turkish posts were present. This came as a huge blow to Ottoman efforts whose Albanian operations were thus inhibited.|$|E

The first NATO E-3 was delivered in January 1982. The eighteen E-3s were operated by Number 1, 2 and 3 Squadrons of NATO's E-3 Component, based at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen.

A day after it opened on 29 October, it began receiving patients from the First Battle of Ypres. Much of the unit's tents which accommodated the male personnel of the hospital were <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> blizzard on 11 November 1914, and the men moved to the Golf club house of the Hôtel du Golf et Cosmopolite in Wimereux, which was eventually leased by the hospital, and became its officers' mess.|$|E

The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|E

The second prototype crashed on 25 March 1945 when the pilot failed to recover from a dive from , probably also due to compressibility effects.
