5|$|During {{the night}} of 10/11 April, XLIX Mountain Corps was ordered to bridge the Savinja river at Celje, then advance towards Brežice on the Sava, and LI Infantry Corps was {{directed}} to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the 14th Panzer Division which would then drive west to Karlovac. The Italians were expected to commence offensive action by attacking southwards to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the 14th Panzer Division {{in the vicinity of}} Karlovac.|$|E
5|$|The brigade now {{came under}} command of XXI Corps and at 01:45 on 8 November {{was ordered to}} move west of Beit Hanun and <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Australian Mounted Division, which was {{advancing}} from the east. As they moved {{to the east of}} Beit Hanun, the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment, which was still attached to the brigade, came under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire, preventing the brigade from advancing further. The Turkish bombardment continued until 12:20, when they were observed withdrawing. The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and Mysore Lancers were ordered to encircle and cut off their retreat, however dug in Turkish positions at the Wadi Hesi once again halted the brigade advance. At 15:00 that day the brigade eventually made contact with the 4th Light Horse Brigade, completing the <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Australian Mounted Division.|$|E
5|$|These probes {{intensified}} on 30 March, {{as one of}} the 25th Infantry Battalion's companies {{was strongly}} attacked by the Japanese. The Australian position had been weakened by having about a third of its strength out on patrol {{at the time of the}} attack. Unable to return to the perimeter while the company was under fire, they were forced to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> one of the other companies further north. Meanwhile, the company was attacked four times throughout the day. The first three attacks were repulsed before the last attack came at 13:00, preceded by a heavy mortar bombardment. Twelve Japanese were killed in the attack, while one Australian was killed and two were missing in action. Nevertheless, the Australian position had been made untenable and they were forced to withdraw and <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the company to the north. In doing so they left behind three mortars and a quantity of ammunition which the Japanese later brought into action against them.|$|E

5|$|About 23:00, German 2nd Army {{headquarters}} {{directed the}} 14th Panzer Division to penetrate past Zagreb towards Karlovac to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Italian 2nd Army, and also directed the 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division {{to drive to}} the north of Belgrade to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the First Panzer Group which was thrusting towards Belgrade from the east. At midnight, 2nd Army headquarters declared that the Yugoslav northern front had been decisively defeated, and tasked corps engineer units to consolidate bridging across major rivers, particularly over the Sava at Brežice west of Zagreb to facilitate the advance of the 14th Panzer Division towards Karlovac. The main body units of the XLVI Motorised Corps moved forward to Virovitica and Slatina, and 2nd Army headquarters moved forward to establish itself in Maribor, protected by the 538th Frontier Guard Division. At midnight, General der Panzertruppe Heinrich von Vietinghoff issued orders for the 8th Panzer Division to continue towards Belgrade via Osijek, but directed the 16th Motorised Infantry Division to thrust west as far as Sremska Mitrovica then turn south to drive towards Sarajevo via Zvornik.|$|E
5|$|After their {{defeat the}} Royalists {{effectively}} abandoned Northern England, losing {{much of the}} manpower from the northern counties of England (which were strongly Royalist in sympathy) and also losing access to the European continent through the ports on the North Sea coast. Although they partially retrieved their fortunes with victories {{later in the year}} in Southern England, the loss of the north was to prove a fatal handicap the next year, when they tried unsuccessfully to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Scottish Royalists under the Marquess of Montrose.|$|E
5|$|All of the 22nd Battalion, bar Elliott's platoon, {{were killed}} or {{captured}} during the fighting at Ruweisat Ridge. Some of the other battalions that participated in the battle also incurred heavy losses. Elliott managed to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> elements of the 21st Battalion, the commander of which recommended him for the VC. Elliott was evacuated to hospital where he spent three months recovering from his various wounds before {{he returned to his}} battalion in September.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{landings}} on 17September were successful, over {{the night of}} 17–18September, divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart was reported missing so Brigadier Philip Hicks of 1st Airlanding Brigade assumed command of the division on September18. Subsequent problems in Arnhem forced Hicks to change the divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge as strong German defences had stopped the other battalions. Hicks decided that the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment and 11 Para would <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the 1st Parachute Brigade {{in an attempt to}} reach their objective.|$|E
5|$|Belgian plans did {{not call}} for the {{garrison}} of the fort and the attached defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could be withdrawn, the bridges destroyed and the garrison ready to fight a delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> other Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944 it {{joined the}} élite British Special Air Service (SAS) Brigade and was renamed the 5th SAS Regiment in March, {{even though it}} was only battalion-strength. The 5th SAS was {{deployed}} on numerous missions behind enemy lines. In July 1944, the small groups from 5th SAS were dropped by parachute into northern France to perform reconnaissance and sabotage missions and to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the French Resistance. Amongst their missions was to harass the German retreat from the Falaise Gap.|$|E

General Jevrem Cokić submitted the plan of the Dubrovnik offensive to Adžić for his approval.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June, the 1st Krajina Corps of the VRS {{began the}} {{offensive}} codenamed Operation Corridor 92. Its first {{objective was to}} break through the HVO and HV-held positions between Modriča and Gradačac, and <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the East Bosnian Corps. The secondary effort consisted of attacks towards Derventa and Bosanski Brod. The first objective was achieved after two days of heavy combat on 26 June. Afterwards, the VRS advanced towards Modriča and captured the town on 28 June. The secondary advances, facing considerably stiffer resistance by the HVO and the HV, gained little ground.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June, {{government}} forces attempted {{to move out}} of the air base and <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> troops at the university but failed after encountering heavy insurgent resistance in the al-Deum area.

His troops reached the 16. Armee at Tukums by midday.|$|E
5|$|Tallard's march {{presented}} a dilemma for Eugene. If the Allies {{were not to}} be outnumbered on the Danube, Eugene realised he must either try to cut Tallard off before he could get there or he must hasten to reinforce Marlborough. if he withdrew from the Rhine to the Danube, Villeroi might also make a move south to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Elector and Marsin. Eugene compromised: leaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofen, he marched off {{with the rest of his}} army to forestall Tallard.|$|E
5|$|The French 7th Army, on the {{northern}} flank of the Belgian line, protected the Bruges–Ghent–Ostend axis and, covering the Channel ports, had advanced into Belgium and into the Netherlands with speed. It reached Breda in the Netherlands, on 11 May. But German parachute forces had seized the Moerdijk bridge on the Hollands Diep river, south of Rotterdam, {{making it impossible for}} the French to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Dutch Army.

The inhabitants of Tecpan Puyumatlan offered fierce resistance against the Spanish-led expedition, and Gonzalo de Alvarado wrote that the Spanish suffered many losses, including the killing of messengers sent to summon the natives to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After failing to locate Cortés, the Alvarados returned to Guatemala.|$|E
