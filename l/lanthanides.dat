5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other <b>lanthanides</b> due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other <b>lanthanides</b> by ion exchange, as can other <b>lanthanides.</b> The solution is then applied to a resin, which different <b>lanthanides</b> bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different <b>lanthanides,</b> it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} notable {{differences}} between the chemistry of yttrium {{and that of the}} <b>lanthanides</b> is that yttrium is almost exclusively trivalent, whereas about half the <b>lanthanides</b> can have valences other than three; nevertheless, only for four of the fifteen <b>lanthanides</b> are these other valences important in aqueous solution (CeIV, SmII, EuII, and YbII).|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{have similar}} {{properties}} to <b>lanthanides.</b> The 6d and 7s electronic shells are filled in actinium and thorium, and the 5f shell is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4f shell is {{filled in the}} <b>lanthanides.</b> The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5f shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940. As in <b>lanthanides</b> (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).|$|E

50|$|<b>Lanthanide</b> triflates are {{synthesized}} from <b>lanthanide</b> oxide and aqueous triflic acid. In {{a typical}} preparation, a 1:1 (v/v) solution of trilfic acid in water {{is added to}} a slight stoichiometric excess of <b>lanthanide</b> oxide. The mixture is stirred and heated at 100 °C for a few hours, and the excess <b>lanthanide</b> oxide is filtered off. The excess oxide ensures all of the triflic acid is consumed. The water is removed under reduced pressure (or simply boiled away) to leave a hydrated <b>lanthanide</b> triflate, Ln(H2O)9(OTf)3.|$|R
5|$|Among the <b>lanthanides,</b> {{lanthanum}} is exceptional as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the <b>lanthanides</b> only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic, unlike the strongly paramagnetic later <b>lanthanides</b> (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent <b>lanthanides</b> are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C. The <b>lanthanides</b> become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a soft metal. Lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. Lanthanum is the least volatile of the <b>lanthanides.</b> Like most of the <b>lanthanides,</b> lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310°C, lanthanum changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865°C, it changes to a body-centered cubic structure.|$|E
5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} <b>lanthanides</b> beyond {{samarium}} and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted {{in the air to}} oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the <b>lanthanides</b> will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other <b>lanthanides</b> behind.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of all {{elements}} {{is based on}} properties of earlier actinides, which show a much wider variety of chemistry (for instance, in range of oxidation states) within their series than the <b>lanthanides,</b> and comparisons to scandium and yttrium are even less useful. However, these elements are destabilized, {{and if they were}} stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws, they would be similar to <b>lanthanides</b> as well. Also, the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding <b>lanthanides,</b> with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.|$|E
40|$|Luminescent <b>lanthanide</b> {{complexes}} {{have great}} potential for practical applications such as fluoroimmunoassay, polymer-based optical signal amplifiers, active materials in lasers and bio-imaging. Interest in the <b>lanthanide</b> cations as luminescent probes stems from their unique photophysical properties such as sharp emission bands, photostability and long luminescence lifetimes. In order to generate {{a sufficient number of}} photons allowing sensitive detection, <b>lanthanide</b> cations must be sensitized with suitable antennae that possess the appropriate electronic structure and that can sufficiently protect the cation from high energy vibrations to prevent the non-radiative deactivation of the <b>lanthanide</b> luminescence. In this thesis, it has been demonstrated that a series of salophen derivatives can be used as an efficient sensitizer for near-infrared emitting <b>lanthanide</b> cations, and derivatives of naphthalimide-attached polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers can be used as suitable ligands for visible and near infrared emitting <b>lanthanide</b> cations. These systems fulfill the requirements for <b>lanthanide</b> luminescence by forming stable coordination with <b>lanthanide</b> cations, protecting <b>lanthanide</b> cations from non-radiative deactivation and having suitable energy levels for efficient energy transfer to specific <b>lanthanide</b> cations. By introducing functional groups on the surface of dendrimer complex, the physical and photophysical properties of the complex can be controlled. It has been demonstrated that the versatility of dendrimer-lanthanide complexes as backbones for a broad variety of applications...|$|R

40|$|Several <b>lanthanide</b> cations are {{luminescent}} in {{the visible}} {{and in the}} near-infrared (NIR) regions, with unique and advantageous luminescence properties compared to organic fluorophores, which make luminescent <b>lanthanide</b> complexes desirable {{for a range of}} applications including light amplification, optical telecommunications, biological imaging and bioanalytical techniques. To overcome the limitation of low absorptivity and weak luminescence of free <b>lanthanide</b> cations in solution, <b>lanthanide</b> complexes are formed with chromophoric groups that are capable of absorbing incident light, and transferring the resulting energy to the <b>lanthanide</b> cation thus sensitizing luminescence ("antenna effect"). Additionally, <b>lanthanide</b> cations must be protected from solvent molecules whose vibrational overtones efficiently deactivate <b>lanthanide</b> cation excited states through non-radiative routes. The research work presented here has focused on developing <b>lanthanide</b> species with improved photophysical properties, utilizing a variety of approaches to reach two main goals: providing efficient sensitization of <b>lanthanide</b> cations via the antennae effect and superior protection against non-radiative deactivation. In a relatively traditional coordination chemistry approach, natural product molecules of the flavonoid family were used as antennae for NIR emitting <b>lanthanide</b> cations. Using a nanomaterials approach to achieve improved protection from quenching, visible emitting <b>lanthanide</b> cations were incorporated into CdSe semiconductor crystals, which bring their own electronic properties, including broad absorbance bands with high epsilon values and size dependent band gaps. Thus, the nanocrystals are used to provide protection from quenching as well as sensitize <b>lanthanide</b> cations through the antennae effect. In an alternate nanomaterials approach NIR emitting Yb 3 + and Nd 3 + were incorporated into NaYF 4 inorganic nanoparticle matrices that were coated with organic tropolonate sensitizing groups. The nanoparticle matrix protects the <b>lanthanide</b> cations from non-radiative deactivation while the surface bound chromophores provide antennae effect sensitization. In addition, upconverting NaYF 4 :Yb,Er nanocrystals were synthesized and their potential to serve as energy acceptors from a naphthalimide based antenna or energy donors to Quantum Dots were investigated. Finally, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were explored as method to sensitize NIR and visible emitting <b>lanthanide</b> cations by incorporating the <b>lanthanide</b> cations at metal sites in the MOF structure and/or as occupants of the pores of zinc based MOFs...|$|R
40|$|This work utilises the {{interactions}} between <b>lanthanide</b> complexes and anions in solution to explore the nature of coordination chemistry in the f-elements, and to define fundamental behaviour in paramagnetic complexes, as well as investigating the factors responsible for ensuring high <b>lanthanide</b> luminescence quantum yields. Chapter one describes characteristic <b>lanthanide</b> properties {{with a focus on}} luminescence and the current understanding of <b>lanthanide</b> complexes. Illustrating the response of luminescent <b>lanthanide</b> complexes to a range of analytes in aqueous solution. Chapter two explores the factors affecting luminescence quantum yield in arylacylDO 3 A complexes as well studying the pH behaviour of these species, showing that the whole energy transfer cascade involved in sensitisation of <b>lanthanide</b> luminescence must be considered when optimising the properties of <b>lanthanide</b> complexes. Chapter three describes the effect of fluoride binding in <b>lanthanide</b> tetra-amide complexes appended with fluorinated benzyl groups on the <b>lanthanide</b> crystal field, demonstrating that the effect of a strong axial donor on the overall ligand field can determine the nature of the magnetic anisotropy at the <b>lanthanide</b> centre. This in turn determines both the optical spectra and the NMR spectra of the complexes. The results obtained illustrate that the whole structure of the complex (and not just the donor set) need to be considered when defining the behaviour of the <b>lanthanide</b> complex. Chapter four investigates the interaction between fluoride and <b>lanthanide</b> complexes of the Lehn cryptand. In this case, the relatively symmetric donor set associated with the cryptand, combined with exchange between isomers, gives rise to small observed anisotropies in the absence of fluoride that are dramatically enhanced by fluoride binding. A range of fluoride responsive behaviour has been identified. Chapter five describes the synthesis and study of a group of halogenated phenacylDO 3 A <b>lanthanide</b> complexes. It is shown how such complexes respond to changes in cyanide concentration but are essentially inert towards fluoride {{as a consequence of the}} reduced residual charge on the <b>lanthanide</b> centre. The interaction with cyanide is assigned to the formation of a cyanohydrin which is assisted by the proximate <b>lanthanide</b> ion, which acts as a Lewis acid. Chapter six draws together the work described in earlier chapters. Chapter seven provides experimental procedures along with characterisation data for the compounds studied. </p...|$|R

5|$|The La3+ ion is similarly-sized to {{the early}} <b>lanthanides</b> of the cerium group (those up to {{samarium}} and europium) that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and bastnäsite (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium (mostly Ce, La, and Y). Bastnäsite is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy <b>lanthanides,</b> and the purification of the light <b>lanthanides</b> from it is less involved.

40|$|<b>Lanthanide</b> {{complexes}} emit {{as sharp}} emission bands, have long luminescence lifetimes for temporal discrimination from background fluorescence and strong resistance to photobleaching. These attractive properties make <b>lanthanide</b> compounds potentially applicable {{in a variety}} of devices, including optical displays and sensors. However, luminescent <b>lanthanide</b> cations weakly absorb light, and require proximal chromophores to absorb excitation light. Energy is subsequently transferred to the <b>lanthanide</b> cations, resulting in the sensitization of their emission. Usually, the energy levels in a given chromophore are fixed and cannot be adjusted. In this thesis, oligofluorene ligands, comprised of either one (mono) or three (ter) fluorene units in the backbone, exhibited a tunable nature of their electronic levels directly controlled by the number of fluorene units. By varying the length of the fluorene backbone in these ligands, the donating level(s) of the chromophore was (were) discretely tuned to the accepting level(s) of a particular <b>lanthanide</b> (Eu and Tb). Furthermore, the <b>lanthanide</b> cation was coordinated to a cage-like polyaminocarboxylate moiety within the ligand, which protected the cation from non-radiative deactivation. Matching the energies of the donating electronic states of an oligofluorene ligand with the appropriate accepting levels of a <b>lanthanide</b> cation lead to efficient oligofluorene to <b>lanthanide</b> energy transfer with quantum yields of 7 %, such as in the TF 1 :Eu 3 + complex.
