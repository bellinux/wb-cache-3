25|$|Despite the tribulations {{created by}} the Second World War, Richmond was able to {{maintain}} a commendable level of consistency on the field. The club had quite a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>players</b> in reserved occupations who remained at home, while the administration became adept at securing star players who were temporarily in Melbourne on war service. Dyer was a fearsome presence {{in his role as}} playing coach, but he was unable to improve Richmond's ability to win finals matches. A loss in the 1942 VFL Grand Final to Essendon (after starting as favourite) meant that over the previous 18 years, Richmond had won two flags but been runner-up eight times. Jack Titus set a still unbeaten record of playing in six losing Grand Final teams. In 1943, Richmond broke through to beat Essendon in a thrilling Grand Final by five points, a win that the club dedicated to ex-player Bill Cosgrove, an RAF pilot who had been killed in action {{a few weeks before the}} match. But another Grand Final loss followed in 1944, when Dyer's team failed against Fitzroy on a very hot day.|$|E
500|$|On December 3, 1956, Chamberlain {{made his}} varsity debut. In his first varsity game the center scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, {{breaking}} both all-time Kansas records in an 87–69 win against the Northwestern team of future NBA teammate Joe Ruklick. Teammate Monte Johnson testified to his athleticism: [...] "Wilt ... had unbelievable endurance and speed ... {{and was never}} tired. When he dunked, he was so fast that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>players</b> got their fingers jammed [...]" [...] Reportedly, Chamberlain also broke Johnny Kerr's toe with a slam dunk. By this time, Chamberlain had developed several offensive weapons that became his trademarks: his finger roll, his fade-away jump shot, which he could also hit as a bank shot, his passing and his shot-blocking. Leading a talented squad of starters, including Maurice King, Gene Elstun, John Parker, Ron Lonesky and Lew Johnson, the Jayhawks went 13–1 until they lost a game 56–54 versus Oklahoma State, who held the ball the last {{three and a half}} minutes without any intention of scoring a basket, which was still possible {{in the days before the}} shot clock (introduced 1984 in the NCAA). As he did at Overbrook, Chamberlain again showcased his diverse athletic talent. He ran the 100-yard dash in 10.9seconds, shot-putted 56feet, triple jumped more than 50feet, and won the high jump in the Big Eight track and field championships three straight years.|$|E

[...] He also runs everything down. [...] "He's got a great heart", said Larry Stefanki, who coached Andy Roddick and has previously worked with John McEnroe, Marcelo Ríos, Fernando González and Tim Henman. [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>players</b> today are fast and fit, but just don't seem to play every point at 100%. [...] It's like they're almost on cruise control and then want to play hard {{when it gets to}} 4-all or 5-all", Stefanki said. [...] "I think because Jesse's so small and he doesn't want to give any free points, he tries every point 100%. That's a big asset out there." [...] At 5' 9" [...] and 150 pounds, Levine is smaller than most professional tennis players.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rest of the}} 1990s was {{a dismal}} period for Northerns. They lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>players</b> to Transvaal, most notably Uli Schmidt - a legend {{in his own right}} and son of former Springbok and Northerns flanker Louis Schmidt (often called the first Blue Bull). Other players {{included}} Gavin Johnson, Rudolf Straeuli, Theo van Rensburg, Heinrich Rodgers, Johan Roux, Gerbrand Grobler and Hannes Strydom. The biggest upset came when two Northern Transvaal stalwarts for many years, Ray Mordt and Kitch Christie accepted offers from Transvaal boss Louis Luyt to coach. Christie, after being asked to leave by the Northerns administration halfway through the 1990 season, moulded the players into a great unit and achieved success in 1993 and 1994 at Currie Cup level before becoming Springbok coach to win the World Cup in 1995. Most of the players who followed him would represent his Transvaal side before doing duty at a national level. Without doubt one of the darkest periods in Northern Transvaal's history! ...|$|E
