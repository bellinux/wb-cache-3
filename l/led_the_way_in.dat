5|$|Punk {{emerged in}} South Africa as direct {{opposition}} to the conservative apartheid government and racial segregation enforcement of the time. Bands like Wild Youth and National Wake <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> the late 1970s and early 1980s, followed by Powerage and Screaming Foetus from Durban and Toxik Sox in Johannesburg in the mid 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as having a good work ethic and the ability to carry the ball and retain possession for the team. He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> his team's assists.|$|E
5|$|The 1926–27 season saw the NHL divided for {{the first}} time into two divisions, and they made the playoffs, winning the Canadian Division title. They {{advanced}} to the semi-finals and defeated the Canadiens, 4–0, and 1–1, en route to facing the Boston Bruins for the Cup. In the first series for the Stanley Cup with only NHL opponents, Ottawa defeated Boston with scores of 0–0, 3–1, 1–1 and 3–1, with the final game taking place in Ottawa; it would be the Senators' final Stanley Cup championship. Alex Connell <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> goal, allowing only three goals in the four games. Cy Denneny <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> scoring with four goals, including the Cup winner. The Senators won three trophies as NHL champions, along with the Stanley Cup, the club also won two other trophies, the O'Brien Cup and the Prince of Wales Trophy, the last time the trophies were given to winners of the NHL championship. They would be given out to divisional winners in the following season. After the series, the Senators players received a parade in Ottawa, a civic banquet and an 18–carat gold ring with fourteen small diamonds in the shape of an 'O'. See the article 1927 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E

50|$|Rank {{outsider}} Allen Gift <b>led</b> all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final {{challenged by}} call Me Baby {{from the third}} bend. Blue Gooner showed early pace and Crack Him Out moved wide at the first bend ending the chances of Pilot Alert and Windgap Java.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the words}} of Busse to Wenck, the Ninth Army was {{planning}} to push west [...] "like a caterpillar". According to General Busse's plan, the heavy King Tiger tanks of the 502nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion should lead this caterpillar. The metaphor is quite apt because, as <b>the</b> head <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> rear-guard <b>in</b> the tail {{was going to be}} engaged in just as heavy fighting trying to disengage from following Soviet forces.|$|R
5|$|With the Eagles, Bell <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> {{cooperating}} with the other NFL owners to establish the National Football League Draft in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players. He subsequently became sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the team and bought {{a share in the}} Pittsburgh Steelers. During World War II, Bell astutely argued against the league suspending operations until the war's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{initially}} <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> skyscraper design, {{with many}} {{constructed in the}} center of the financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed the products of the Chicago school of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E
5|$|Dylan {{introduced}} a literary element to rock through {{his fascination with}} the Surrealists and the French Symbolists, and his immersion in the New York City art scene of the early 1960s. The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such as the Doors, Steppenwolf and the Ides of March, were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture. Dylan also <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock {{groups such as the}} Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles. In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies inspired those of Yes, and British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention, who emphasised instrumental virtuosity. Some of these artists, such as the Incredible String Band and Shirley and Dolly Collins, would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and early music.|$|E
50|$|On 12 March 1916, the {{regiment}} received orders to join General John J. Pershing {{as part of}} the Mexican Punitive Expedition to pursue Pancho Villa. Nine days later, <b>the</b> 1st Squadron <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> arriving <b>in</b> Mexico on 21 March. Later, the 1st Squadron rode 22 hours straight to the rescue of United States forces besieged in Parral.|$|R

5|$|Airfields, harbors and {{shipping}} {{were also the}} targets on October 12, this time in northern Formosa. These {{would be the first}} strikes Fighting 18 executed in the face of both significant anti-aircraft fire and airborne interception by enemy planes. The first fighter sweep of the day launched into overcast skies at 06:17 and headed for Shinchiku Airfield with VF-18 flying low cover. Unfortunately, the Japanese were alerted to the formation's presence ahead of time, and the morning's protective cloud cover dissipated above Shinchiku. Flak of all calibers was intense as a result. Harris and the other Intrepid fighters <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in,</b> pushing over in glide bombing attacks on hangars around the strip. After the bombs dropped, the fighters headed north for their next target, Matsuyama Airfield. On the way to Matsuyama the cloud cover thickened once more. Just shy of Taien Airfield, VF-18 pilots spotted six Japanese bombers working their way down through a layer of clouds, seemingly on a landing approach. Intrepids fighters caught and destroyed the whole bomber formation in two minutes. Harris was credited with shooting down two of them.|$|E
5|$|The normal peacetime British Army cavalry {{formation}} was the brigade, {{but twice}} a cavalry division had been formed. The {{first time was}} during the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882. The second was during the Second Boer War (1899–1901) in South Africa, the last major conflict fought by the British Army before the First World War. During the fighting in South Africa, it was the 7,000-strong colonial mounted contingent, not the 5,000-strong regular cavalry, that <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> tactical development. They were better trained, better armed, and more efficient, if only {{because they had been}} correctly trained to use the right weapons and tactics for the conflict. Since 1880 British cavalrymen had been armed with only carbines and swords, although some carried a lance; it was not until 1903 that the cavalry were issued rifles, the same ones used {{by the rest of the}} army. The regular cavalry regiments were considered so poor in quality that General Sir Redvers Henry Buller, commanding the advance into Northern Natal, left his six cavalry regiments behind at Ladysmith, trusting in the irregular mounted forces to carry out patrols in their stead.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{celebrated its}} centennial {{as a nation}} in 1876. Hartranft saw that Pennsylvania <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> the celebration that was {{centered}} in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park.|$|E
50|$|The {{third round}} ended the {{challenge}} of defending champion Balliniska Band following two dislocated toes. The fastest heat winner was Geoff De Mulder's Dale Lad {{in a time of}} 29.30. The quarter-finals resulted in another win for Lacca Champion who remained unbeaten and Irish sprinter Glenroe Hiker <b>led</b> all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> his heat but Paradise Spectre went out.|$|R
60|$|So Ozma <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> hand <b>in</b> {{hand with}} Dorothy, and {{they passed through}} the arched doorway of rock and entered a long passage which was lighted by jewels set in the walls and having lamps behind them. There {{was no one to}} escort them, or to show them <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> but all <b>the</b> party pressed through the passage until they came to a round, domed cavern that was grandly furnished.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} things about his summer-autumn Derby campaign is that he reversed the style of racing that he had used to such great effect as a two-year-old and spring three-year-old. Instead of coming from off the pace as he had in those two campaigns, he set <b>the</b> pace and <b>led</b> all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Waikato Guineas, Championship Stakes and Derby.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the 1980s fashion <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> {{the look}} and feel of bras. Western TV shows {{featured}} classy, powerful, and well-formed ladies, usually donning low cut tops to show an enhanced chest with an equally classy matching bra.|$|E
25|$|Since 1884, The Filson Historical Society (originally {{named the}} Filson Club), with its {{extensive}} collections, has <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> preserving Louisville's history.

25|$|In 1962, Nhu {{appointed}} Tuyến and Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, {{a communist}} double agent from a Catholic background, {{to oversee the}} Strategic Hamlet Program, which attempted to isolate the Viet Cong by barricading villagers inside fortified compounds, theoretically locking the communists out. Tuyến <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> promoting the concept to the populace.|$|E
6000|$|Next day, so soon as {{they had}} lunched, he <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> towards Maltby's, <b>in</b> Crosshampton Lane. Something in his bearing put a {{question}} into Prothero's mind. [...] "Benham," [...] he asked, [...] "have you ever driven before?" ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> and <b>in</b> {{a minute}} they {{stood at the}} edge of a little ravine some fifteen feet deep running through the wood. The girls were {{carefully}} carried down to the bottom. The change in the temperature, now they were sheltered from the wind, was very great. All three girls were conscious, the motion and the heat of the guides' bodies having revived both the Fortescues; none of them were, however, able to stand.|$|R
60|$|Once on {{the plain}} outside the stockaded portion of the works, Sergeant Corney <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> by going <b>in</b> a southerly {{direction}} for a distance of an hundred yards or more, and then striking sharply off toward the west, where was to be found the nearest cover.|$|R
25|$|Under Mara's leadership, Fiji {{became a}} giant in {{sugarcane}} production. Between 1970 and 1987, the sugarcane crop more than doubled, from under 250,000 metric tons to 502,000. The sugar industry {{continues to be}} the mainstay of Fiji's economy, and more than 90% of Fiji's sugar is exported. Mara's government <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> negotiating special preferential marketing agreements with nations importing Fijian sugar, through the Lome Convention.|$|E
25|$|In 1927-8 Ahmad Kasravi <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> {{establishing}} the ancestry of the Safavids dynasty {{with the publication}} of three influential articles, and disputed the validity of the 'official' Safavid family tree contained in the Safvat al-Safa, and argued convincingly that the ancestors of Shaykh Safi al-Din, who founded the Safavid Order (tariqa), were indigenous inhabitants of Iran. Today, the consensus among Safavid historians is that the Safavid family hailed from Persian Kurdistan.|$|E
25|$|Webber <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> scoring (20.1 ppg), {{rebounding}} (10.3) {{and blocks}} (1.9) and shot 51.8 {{percent from the}} floor to make his first All-Star team. Howard averaged 19.1 ppg and 8.0 rpg, while Strickland averaged 17.2 ppg and 1.74 spg and finished fifth {{in the league in}} assists with 8.9 per game. Mureşan dominated the middle and led the NBA in field goal percentage (.599). Washington received contributions from Calbert Cheaney (10.6 ppg) and Tracy Murray (10.0 ppg).|$|E
60|$|He {{got up on}} to {{the side}} and helped them both to the deck, and, with a great attempt at cheery conversation, <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> below, where, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of an {{impressive}} silence, he explained that the ladies would have to share the state-room between them.|$|R
50|$|The pathfinders of the 101st Airborne Division <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> on D-Day <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night drop {{prior to}} the invasion.

They left from RAF North Witham having trained there with the 82nd Airborne Division.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s and 90s, it was Niall Mackenzie and Steve Hislop who <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Mackenzie competed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 500cc Grand Prix {{championship}} (now MotoGP) {{for nine}} years from 1986 to 1994, only twice finishing outside the top ten. He {{went on to win}} the British Superbike Championship no less than three times.|$|R
25|$|Warrandyte {{was founded}} as a Victorian town, {{located in the}} once gold-rich rolling hills east of Melbourne, and {{is now on the}} {{north-eastern}} boundary of suburban Melbourne. Gold was first discovered in the town in 1851 and together, with towns like Bendigo and Ballarat, <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> gold discoveries during the Victorian gold rush. Today Warrandyte retains much of its past in its surviving buildings of the Colonial period and remains a twin community with North Warrandyte, which borders the Yarra River to its north.|$|E
25|$|JPL was {{transferred}} to NASA in December 1958, becoming the agency's primary planetary spacecraft center. JPL engineers designed and operated Ranger and Surveyor missions to the Moon that prepared {{the way for the}} Apollo program. JPL also <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> interplanetary exploration with the Mariner missions to Venus, Mars, and Mercury. In 1998, JPL opened the Near-Earth Object Program Office for NASA; as of 2013, it has found 95% of asteroids that are a kilometer or more in diameter that cross Earth's orbit.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Sir Arthur Edwin Young KPM (15 February 1907 – 20 January 1979) was a British police officer. He was Commissioner of Police of the City of London from 1950 to 1971 and {{was also}} the first head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to be styled Chief Constable. Young was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} post of Chief Inspector of Constabulary. In the early 1950s, he played a crucial role in policing decolonisation in the British Empire.

50|$|In the Northeast {{official}} bodies, such as DNOCS and CODEVASF, <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> beginning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s. In 1968, the Executive Group on Irrigation and Agrarian Development (GEIDA) was set up, and {{two years}} later it instituted the Multi-annual Program of Irrigation (PPI). The majority of resources were directed to the Northeast. These federal initiatives, however, did not achieve success. In 1985 a new guidance and in 1996 a new direction produced the New Model of Irrigation Project. The Project intended to broaden the use of irrigation in agriculture and drew on more than 1,500 national and foreign experts.|$|R
60|$|Here Sir Gervaise laughed heartily at {{the picture}} of the awkward {{creature}} to which his own imagination had given birth; Greenly joining in the merriment, partly from the oddity of the conceit, and partly from the docility with which commander-in-chief's jokes are usually received. The feeling of momentary indignation which had aroused Sir Gervaise to such an expression of his disgust at modern inventions, was appeased by this little success; and, inviting his captain to sup with him,--a substitute for a dinner,--he <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> below <b>in</b> high good-humour, Galleygo having just announced that the table was ready.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{looked up}} and then rose mechanically as the Colonel resumed his coat and waistcoat, but not his collar and cravat, which lay limp and dejected among his papers. Then, sheltering himself beneath a large-brimmed Panama hat, and hooking his cane on his arm, he <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> fan <b>in</b> hand, into the road, tiptoeing in his tight, polished boots through the red, impalpable dust with his usual jaunty manner, yet not without a profane suggestion of burning ploughshares. The stranger strode in silence by his side in the burning sun, impenetrable in his own morose shadow.|$|R
