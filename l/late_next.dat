2500|$|So it’s now {{one year}} to the day since we dropped ‘I Love It’ and started the ‘Drinking from the Sun’ journey. Thanks to {{everyone}} that’s supported us over the last 12 months, it’s been amazing. We hope you join us <b>late</b> <b>next</b> year for ‘Walking Under Stars’. Thankyou, Suffa, Pressure & Debris ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Late</b> <b>next</b> morning, on 26 October, Pitt {{caught up}} with the {{privateer}}. Unable to escape, the privateer’s captain ran her ashore. Some four to five hours earlier, Drake, under the command of Robert Nicholas, had come in sight and maneuvered to block the privateer's escape, but did not herself enter into the combat. The privateer lowered her boats and her captain and all but the mortally wounded among her crew were able to get to shore. Drake then assisted Pitt in hauling off the privateer.|$|E
60|$|Not until <b>late</b> <b>next</b> morning did Lawson corral all the horses. That day we lounged in camp mending broken bridles, saddles, stirrups, lassoes, boots, trousers, leggins, {{shirts and}} even broken skins.|$|E

60|$|Despite the dejection {{to which}} I {{had become a}} prey, I slept no less soundly that night than was my wont, and indeed {{it was not until}} <b>late</b> <b>next</b> morning when someone knocked at my door that I awakened.|$|E
60|$|He was up <b>late</b> <b>next</b> morning, {{and made}} but a poor breakfast. His after- dinner nap was disturbed, and tea was over {{before he had}} regained his wonted calm. An hour later {{the arrival of a}} dignified and reproachful Mr. Farrer set him blazing again.|$|E
60|$|She {{went up to}} bed and {{lay awake}} half the night, and, rising <b>late</b> <b>next</b> morning in consequence, took {{advantage}} of her daughter’s absence to peer under the bed. The parcels had disappeared. She went downstairs, with her faded but alert old eyes watching Cecilia’s every movement.|$|E
60|$|After breakfast, {{which she}} made <b>late</b> the <b>next</b> morning, she found Maxwell {{waiting for her}} on the piazza.|$|R
50|$|It {{was officially}} {{announced}} that Triple Eight {{would return to}} Manufacturer status with MG Motor, running a pair of MG6 GT cars to the <b>latest</b> <b>Next</b> Generation Touring Car specification. Jason Plato joined the team from Chevrolet, alongside Andy Neate, who had joined from Team Aon. This meant that although Triple Eight were the reigning Independent Driver and Team champions, they would be ineligible to defend their titles due to the MG's manufacturer support.|$|R
50|$|In 2016 Auster {{began work}} on her <b>latest</b> album, <b>Next</b> Time, with {{producer}} Tore Johansson due out {{in the spring of}} 2017.|$|R
6000|$|Mart rose <b>late</b> <b>next</b> morning. [...] "I {{had a bad}} night," [...] he explained. [...] "The mixed liquors I tuck {{got into}} me wound, I guess. It woke me twice, achin' and burnin'. You're lookin' tired yersilf, little girl. This high life seems to be wearin' on the both of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the warning}} came too <b>late.</b> <b>Next</b> moment the boat ran {{with a thud}} into a monster cuttlefish. Grummidge seized a boat-hook, shouted, [...] "Stern all!" [...] and hit the {{creature}} with all his might, while Stubbs made a wild grasp at a hatchet which lay {{under one of the}} thwarts.|$|E
6000|$|... “Tell John to {{ride over}} with that early to‐morrow morning, and ask Miss Wayne for an answer,” {{he said to}} the servant, who {{wondered}} at his face, and then walked slowly with hopelessness in his very pose towards his room, where, as it happened, he slept heavily until <b>late</b> <b>next</b> morning.|$|E
50|$|Nothing ever restrains {{them from}} {{amusement}} which usually commences {{early in the}} evening, and is seldom suspended till <b>late</b> the <b>next</b> morning.|$|R
60|$|It {{was all too}} late! too <b>late!</b> the <b>next</b> {{few hours}} might atone for the past {{but they could not}} call it back.|$|R
6000|$|Alas! she {{was just}} two seconds too <b>late.</b> The <b>next</b> instant she felt her waist seized firmly from behind, whilst a merry voice shouted-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Late</b> <b>next</b> evening Dr. Merrick reached Perugia. He drove {{straight}} from the station to the dingy flat in the morose palazzo. At {{the door of his}} son's room, Herminia met him, clad from head to foot in white, as she had sat by the bedside. Tears blinded her eyes; her face was wan; her mien terribly haggard.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>late</b> <b>next</b> {{night when}} the {{corporal}} reached the police outpost, and on the following morning Esmond and Major Coulthurst sat at a little table in the latter's dwelling. The corporal, who had told his story concisely, had just gone out, and Coulthurst, who rolled an unlighted cigar between his fingers, was grave in face. Esmond glanced at him inquiringly.|$|E
60|$|The {{young men}} slept <b>late</b> <b>next</b> morning, knowing that no move {{could be made}} that day. When {{they came out of}} the tents, they found that the natives had lost no time. Before daybreak hunting parties had gone out, and a store of game was piled near the fire; or rather fires, for a dozen were now burning, and the strangers were being {{initiated}} in the art of cooking by their hosts.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will have}} {{artillery}}," [...] said Captain Wilkins, an officer, {{who had served}} for some time in Oude. [...] "These talookdars have all got artillery. They were ordered to give it up, and a good many old guns were sent in; {{but there is not}} one of these fellows who cannot bring a battery at the very least into the field. By to-morrow night, or at the <b>latest</b> <b>next</b> day, we may have some thirty or forty pieces of artillery round this place." ...|$|R
50|$|Sylvester {{wakes up}} <b>late</b> the <b>next</b> day. Dawn is already gone. He can hardly {{concentrate}} at work {{as he tries}} in vain to contact her.|$|R
6000|$|Popanilla breakfasted rather <b>late</b> the <b>next</b> morning, and {{on looking}} over the evening papers, which were just published, his eyes lighted on the {{following}} paragraph:-- ...|$|R
60|$|It was <b>late</b> <b>next</b> {{morning when}} Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep. There {{was no other}} {{person in the room}} but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a {{saucepan}} for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>late</b> <b>next</b> {{day when}} they awoke. Hans {{likewise}} missed his way, and though he afterwards discovered his mistake, they {{found it impossible to}} regain the track of their companions before sunset. All that day they were compelled to travel without tasting a drop of water, and their poor horses became so fatigued as to be scarcely equal to more than a walking pace. As Hans knew that water was not far off, he pushed on after sunset, so as to have the shorter distance to travel to it in the morning.|$|E
60|$|<b>Late</b> <b>next</b> morning Buck led {{the long}} team up the street. There was nothing lively about it, no snap or go {{in him and}} his fellows. They were {{starting}} dead weary. Four times he had covered the distance between Salt Water and Dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he was facing the same trail once more, made him bitter. His heart {{was not in the}} work, nor was the heart of any dog. The Outsides were timid and frightened, the Insides without confidence in their masters.|$|E
60|$|Ralph {{mechanically}} {{did as he}} was told; {{and fell}} off again into a heavy sleep, from which he did not awake until <b>late</b> the <b>next</b> afternoon.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] Frida cried, sobbing. [...] "It's all Robert, Robert! As soon as ever {{you were}} gone, {{he called me}} into the library--which always means he's going to talk over some dreadful {{business}} with me--and he said to me, 'Frida, I've just heard from Phil that this man Ingledew, who's chosen to foist himself upon us, holds opinions and sentiments which entirely unfit him from being proper company for any lady. Now, he's been coming here a great deal too often of <b>late.</b> <b>Next</b> time he calls, I wish you to tell Martha you're not at home to him.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Two {{persons were}} strangely {{affected}} and stirred to unexpected {{action by the}} news of Thurston's injury, and {{the first of these}} was Julius Savine. It was <b>late</b> <b>next</b> night when his brother's messenger arrived at the ranch, for Thomas had thought of nothing but the sufferer's welfare at first, and Savine lay, a very frail, wasted figure, dozing by the stove. His sister-in-law sat busy over some netting close at hand. Both were startled when a man, who held out a soiled envelope, came in abruptly. Savine read the message and tossed the paper across to Mrs. Savine before he rose shakily to his feet.|$|E
60|$|They had by {{this time}} left Amiens on the right, and by nightfall were {{well on their way}} towards Calais. Early in the morning they had {{purchased}} some bread at a village through which they passed; Walter's Norman-French being easily understood, and exciting no surprise or suspicion. At nightfall they slept in a shed within a mile of the ruins of the castle of Pres, and <b>late</b> <b>next</b> evening entered the English encampment at New Town. After going to his tent, where he and Ralph changed their garments and partook of a hearty meal, Walter proceeded to the pavilion of the prince, who hailed his entrance with the greatest surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Minutes are precious, Mr. Morris," [...] she said; [...] "you are {{two minutes}} <b>late.</b> The <b>next</b> train to London stops here {{in half an}} hour--and I must go back by it." ...|$|R
50|$|Since 2014, with {{ceremony}} inception Nomination {{results have}} been announced to public in early April, prior to the ceremony that held late in the same month and televises <b>late</b> in <b>next</b> month.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not till}} <b>late</b> the <b>next</b> day that Simon Bunce was seen riding his rough pony over the moor. Hal {{repaired}} {{to him at}} once, with the breathless inquiry, 'Where is he?' ...|$|R
