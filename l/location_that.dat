5|$|A week out of Lima, the Beagle {{reached the}} Galápagos Islands on 15 September 1835. The next day Captain FitzRoy dropped anchor {{near the site}} of the modern town of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on Chatham Island. At the <b>location</b> <b>that</b> is now known as Frigatebird Hill/Cerro Tijeretas, Darwin spent his first hour on shore in the Galapagos islands.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 2/9th {{advanced}} {{a further}} , reaching Sanderson's Bay, {{before deciding to}} set up their night <b>location.</b> <b>That</b> night Japanese ships again shelled Australian positions {{on the north shore}} of the bay, but without causing any casualties among the defenders.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sites were}} {{proposed}} {{as the main}} Expo grounds. One <b>location</b> <b>that</b> was considered was Mount Royal Park, {{to the north of}} the downtown core. But it was Drapeau's idea to create new islands in the St. Lawrence river, and to enlarge the existing Saint Helen's Island. The choice overcame opposition from Montreal's surrounding municipalities, and also prevented land speculation.|$|E

5|$|Bayer catalogued five {{stars in}} the constellation, giving them the Bayer designations Alpha to Epsilon. John Flamsteed added Eta, Iota and four Roman letters; of these, only Iota is still used as the others were dropped in {{subsequent}} catalogues and star charts. Flamsteed gave 16 stars Flamsteed designations, of which numbers 1 and 16 are not used—1's coordinates were in error as there was no star present at the <b>location</b> <b>that</b> corresponds to any star in his Catalogus Britannicus; Baily presumed that the coordinates were mistranscribed 32s in error by Flamsteed and in fact referred to 7.4 magnitude HD 10407. Baily also noted that 16 Trianguli was closer to Aries and included it in the latter constellation.|$|E
5|$|East Stirlingshire {{has played}} at several grounds over its history. In the club's early {{existence}} as Britannia, it played {{one of its}} first known matches at Burnhouse against a Falkirk 2nd XI, which ended in a 7–0 defeat for the team. Burnhouse {{is thought to be}} the <b>location</b> <b>that</b> was to become Merchiston Park, where the club played many of its matches in the late 19th century. Some home matches were also played at Randyford Park in the town.|$|E
5|$|Edwin faced Penda and Cadwallon at the Battle of Hatfield in {{the autumn}} of 632 or 633 and was {{defeated}} and killed.

Edwin's resting place), his head being eventually buried at York {{and the rest of his}} body at Whitby. Of his two grown sons by Cwenburh of Mercia, Osfrith died at Hatfield, and Eadfrith was captured by Penda and killed some time afterwards.|$|E

5|$|M-60 was {{originally}} designed in 1919 {{with the rest}} of the state highway system in Michigan. It ran roughly along its current route connecting downtown Niles to downtown Jackson. In the mid-1920s, the western end was extended to New Buffalo; since then several bypasses of the smaller towns along the highway were added. One of these bypasses resulted in the creation of an alternate route (Alternate M-60, Alt. M-60) through Concord; that route has since been decommissioned. When Niles was bypassed in the 1950s, a business loop (Business M-60, Bus. M-60) was created through town. After the western end was truncated to its current <b>location,</b> <b>that</b> business loop was converted to a business spur.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, {{but there seems to}} be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium <b>location</b> <b>that</b> will help them adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|Ross Goodall {{uploaded}} {{the message}} from Capaldi to the video-sharing website YouTube on 6 November 2014. He commented at the video's YouTube <b>location</b> <b>that</b> he {{was surprised at the}} online response, and {{that at the time of}} initial posting was unaware it would become viral. He later explained that he had uploaded it only to share it with family members on completion of the memorial services for Thomas's grandmother. Thomas's father wrote that the video greatly affected his son, and enabled him to cope with grief and feel comforted. He praised Capaldi for his kind act and explained that the video improved his son's mental well-being throughout the ordeal.|$|E
50|$|Location {{theory has}} become an {{integral}} part of economic geography, regional science, and spatial economics. Location theory addresses questions of what economic activities are located where and why. Location theory or microeconomic theory generally assumes that agents act in their own self-interest. Firms thus choose <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> maximize their profits and individuals choose <b>locations</b> <b>that</b> maximize their utility.|$|R

5|$|The town arose as {{the wealth}} and fame of the abbey grew. After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the abbot planned out over 300 new houses within a grid-iron pattern at a <b>location</b> <b>that</b> {{was close to the}} abbey precincts. Edmund's cult was {{promoted}} and flourished, but it declined in subsequent years and the saint did not reappear in any liturgical calendars until the appearance of Abbo of Fleury's Passio Sancti Eadmundi in the 12th century. King John is said to have given a great sapphire and a precious stone set in gold to the shrine, which he was permitted to keep upon the condition that it was returned to the abbey when he died.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they {{grew up listening to}} his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper and they felt {{he was the only one}} who could help them capture the size and scope of what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise <b>location</b> <b>that</b> would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August.|$|E
5|$|Tim Downs scouted {{possible}} {{areas for}} location filming. He {{looked for a}} <b>location</b> <b>that</b> could stand in for three different venues without the production having to move or change hotels: the film's opening scene; the God planet's establishing shots; and the Nimbus III Paradise City. Downs {{was familiar with the}} Mojave desert and thought that locations near Ridgecrest, California, would serve the production's needs, so he took photos based on sketches Rodis had provided of what the locations might look like. Downs also shot photos with filters and tried to accomplish dust effects with his car to replicate ideas for how some sequences would be shot. When Downs returned with the photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found would be perfect for the film.|$|E

5|$|Until the 18th century, Bombay {{consisted}} of seven islands separated by shallow sea. These seven islands {{were part of}} a larger archipelago in the Arabian sea, off the western coast of India. The date of city's founding is unclear—historians trace back urban settlement to the late 17th century after the British secured the seven islands from the Portuguese to establish a secure base in the region. The islands provided the British with a sheltered harbour for trade, in addition to a relatively sequestered <b>location</b> <b>that</b> reduced the chances of land-based attacks. Over the next two centuries, the British dominated the region, first securing the archipelago from the Portuguese, and later defeating the Marathas to secure the hinterland.|$|E
5|$|While the {{procession}} was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons {{who were not}} in fact present or had died earlier. He did so because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of {{the final years of}} the Commonwealth. He also felt that there was no real historic moment or <b>location</b> <b>that</b> fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a <b>location</b> <b>that</b> kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
