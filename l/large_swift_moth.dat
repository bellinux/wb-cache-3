50|$|Several Lepidoptera {{caterpillars}} {{are found}} to feed on Grewia species. These include the common nawab (Polyura athamas) and the <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> Endoclita malabaricus. The Bucculatricidae leaf miner Bucculatrix epibathra is apparently only found on G. tiliaefolia.|$|R
50|$|Erythrina {{leaves are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} the <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> Endoclita damor and the woolly bears Hypercompe eridanus and Hypercompe icasia. The mite Tydeus munsteri is a pest on the coastal coral tree (E. caffra).|$|R
50|$|The conifer <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> (Korscheltellus gracilis) is a <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> {{considered}} a forest pest in {{eastern and central}} North America, from Canada south to North Carolina. Larvae feed primarily on roots of evergreen trees, and are weakly polyphagous, able to survive on deciduous trees (e.g. birches, Betula) but preferring balsam fir and red spruce. They penetrate bark, but lesions on roots are shallow. These wounds may, however, provide easy entry for pathogenic fungi and nematodes. K. gracilis {{has been shown to}} reduce survival on saplings, but adult trees have been found with more than 30 feeding scars on their roots. But trees that are weakened by air pollution or changes in soil chemistry may invite K. gracilis infestation. Adults can be found in woody areas between June and August. They are cryptically colored, but are active for 20-40 minutes each dawn and twilight, and occasionally come to light. In the conifer <b>swift</b> <b>moth,</b> courtship, mating, and egg laying occur during evening hours; only oviposition occurs in the morning. They are Exoporia, and females scatter eggs while in flight. It takes two years for the larvae to mature, so populations tend towards two-year cycles. Females emit pheromones to attract males, from organs on their hind wings.|$|R
50|$|Heteroneura is {{a natural}} group (or clade) in the insect order Lepidoptera that {{comprises}} over 99% of all butterflies and moths. This is the sister group of the infraorder Exoporia (<b>swift</b> <b>moths</b> and their relatives), and is characterised by wing venation which is not similar or homoneurous in both pairs of wings.|$|R
50|$|Various Allium {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of the leek moth and onion fly {{as well as some}} Lepidoptera {{including}} cabbage <b>moth,</b> common <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> (recorded on garlic), garden dart moth, large yellow underwing moth, nutmeg moth, setaceous Hebrew character moth, turnip moth and Schinia rosea, a moth that feeds exclusively on Allium species.|$|R

5|$|Parsnip {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some {{lepidopteran}} species, including the parsnip swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes), the common <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> (Korscheltellus lupulina), the garden dart moth (Euxoa nigricans), and the ghost moth (Hepialus humuli). The larvae of the parsnip moth (Depressaria radiella), native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, construct their webs on the umbels, feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds.|$|R

25|$|Between 27 and 40 {{invertebrates}} (including nine moths) in the UK feed on bracken. These {{include the}} sawfly, a planthopper (Dytroptis pteridis), the map-winged <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillar, brown silver-line moth caterpillar (Petrophora chlorosata) and Paltodora cytisella. The numbers feeding on the bracken increase {{as the season}} progresses due to the decreasing levels of toxin, {{and the production of}} nectaries in the spring, food for ants which in turn may kill any herbivorous insects in the vicinity.|$|R
5000|$|Phymatopus (Originally: Noctua [...] Linnaeus, 1758) is a genus of moths {{belonging}} to the hepialidae family (commonly referred to as <b>swift</b> <b>moths</b> or ghost moths), which consists of around 500 species and 30 genera. [...] They can be found across Eurasia and North America. Species can be distinguished by the different morphology of male genitalia and different forewing patterns, which vary in stripe colour and size and arrangement of spots. The stripes themselves consist of spots separated by dark veins which are fringed by thin black lines from both inner and outer sides.|$|R
50|$|Baccharis {{are used}} as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, such as the <b>swift</b> <b>moths</b> Phymatopus californicus and P. hectoides. Those of the leaf-miner moths Bucculatrix dominatrix and B. seperabilis feed {{exclusively}} on Bush Baccharis (B. pilularis), B. ivella has been found on Eastern Baccharis, and B. variabilis is a polyphagous species which has been recorded on various Baccharis. The Coleophora case-bearers C. linosyridella and C. viscidiflorella are polyphagous species whose larve have been recorded on the Bush Baccharis {{as well as other}} plants. Caterpillars of the owlet moth Schinia ocularis feed exclusively on Broom Baccharis (B. sarothroides).|$|R
50|$|The white-throated needletail (Hirundapus caudacutus), {{also known}} as needle-tailed swift or spine-tailed <b>swift,</b> is a <b>large</b> <b>swift.</b> It is {{commonly}} reputed to reach speeds of up to 170 km/h (105 mph), though {{this has not been}} verified.|$|R

5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common <b>swift</b> <b>moth)</b> attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|R

5|$|Abantiades latipennis, {{known as}} the Pindi moth, is a species of moth in the Hepialidae family. It may also be {{referred}} to as a <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> or a ghost moth, as this is a common name associated with Hepialidae. Endemic to Australia and identified in 1932, it is most populous in temperate rainforest where eucalypti are prevalent, as the larvae feed primarily on the roots of these trees. Females lay eggs during flight in a scattering fashion. The larvae live for over eighteen months underground, while adult moths survive for approximately one week, as they have no mouthparts with which to feed. The moths are preyed upon by a number of predators, including bats and owls. Brown in colour overall, males are paler and the identifying silver bars of the male's wings are more prominent than those of the female's, with dark margins. Male adults are generally smaller.|$|R

Young birds are duller than adults, and the collar is reduced or absent.|$|R
