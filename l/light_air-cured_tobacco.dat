40|$|Four {{types of}} tobacco are {{produced}} in Virginia: flue-cured, dark fire-cured, <b>light</b> <b>air-cured</b> (burley) and dark air-cured (sun-cured). Virginia produces 28 {{percent of the}} flue-cured tobacco grown in the United States. Flue-cured tobacco is used almost exclusively in cigarettes. Approximately 40 percent of that grown in Virginia is exported as non-manufactured leaf. Almost 8 percent of all dark fire-cured tobacco is produced in Virginia. The majority of dark fire-cured tobacco is exported for the manufacture of smoking tobacco, chewing tobacco, and cigars. The primary domestic use is for dry snuff. Virginia farmers produce 4 percent of the <b>light</b> <b>air-cured</b> (burley) <b>tobacco</b> grown.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 The {{percentage}} of Alaska Natives who use smokeless tobacco (SLT) is 4 {{times that of}} non-Native Alaskans and 45 times higher for Alaska Native women than non-Native women. The use of SLT is concentrated in Southwest Alaska where 32 % of all adult Alaska Natives use SLT. Out of those users, 35 % use only iqmik, a unique form of SLT in Alaska, which {{is a combination of}} tobacco leaf mixed with Phellinus igniarius (punk fungus). There is little evidence of the pathological effects of iqmik to assist in the development of an evidenced-based intervention regarding the harmful effects of iqmik. The current lack of evidence reinforces a belief that iqmik is less harmful than other tobacco alternatives. The overall objective of this thesis is to elucidate the effect of iqmik and iqmik-mediated metal exposure on oxidative stress and nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB) induced inflammation in human gingival epithelial cells. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) accumulate in human gingival epithelial cells from iqmik treatments, inducing oxidative stress and promoting an intracellular environment that alters NF-κB proinflammatory signaling targets. Our findings indicate that iqmik is a greater source of heavy metals, such as Cd, Co and Ni, than <b>air-cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaf. Human gingival epithelial cells accumulate more Cd, Co and Ni from the punk ash component of iqmik than from the <b>air-cured</b> <b>tobacco.</b> These metals have the capacity to accumulate in cells from iqmik treatments and generate and propagate the production of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activates NF-κB significantly altering its signaling targets, more so than tobacco alone. The results of this thesis identify iqmik as a unique health hazard compared to other tobacco products and enhances our understanding of how iqmik may contribute to oral pathologies...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} types of {{smokeless}} tobacco. Chewing <b>tobacco</b> is shredded, <b>air-cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> with flavoring. Dipping tobacco ("moist snuff") is air or fire-cured, finely cut tobacco. Dry snuff is ground or pulverised tobacco leaves. In the Indian subcontinent, the Middle-East and South-East Asia, tobacco may be combined in a quid or paan with other ingredients such as betel leaf, Areca nut and slaked lime. Use of Areca nut is associated with oral submucous fibrosis. An appearance termed Betel chewer's mucosa describes morsicatio buccarum with red-staining of mucosa due to betel quid ingredients. In Scandinavian countries, snus, a variant of dry snuff, is sometimes used. In the United States of America, {{the most common form}} of smokeless tobacco is dipping tobacco, although chewing tobacco is sometimes used by outdoor workers and dry snuff is common among females in the Southern states. The overall prevalence of smokeless tobacco use in the USA is about 4.5%, but this is higher in Mid-Western and Southern states.|$|R
40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to arylamines such as benzidine, 2 -naphthylamine, and 4 -aminobiphenyl {{is associated with}} exceptionally elevated risks of bladder cancer (up to 100 -fold or more). In one plant, all 15 workers involved in distilling naphthylamine developed bladder cancer, suggesting that for high levels of {{exposure to}} potent carcinogens individual susceptibility is irrelevant.

In addition, cohort and case-control studies suggest that several job titles or exposures may involve elevated risks of bladder cancer. Some of these jobs or exposures (such as in the aluminum industry) are associated with exposure to arylamines. Arylamines are found also in tobacco smoke, and different sources of evidence suggest that they can explain the risk of bladder cancer, which has been shown clearly in smokers. Epidemiologic analyses of timing of exposure in workers occupationally exposed to arylamines or in <b>air-cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> smokers suggest that arylamines exert both an early- and a late-stage activity, compatible with a two-mutation theory of bladde...|$|R

40|$|Moveable (or portable) curing frames {{offer the}} tobacco grower another option for {{successfully}} reducing labor and costs for pro-ducing <b>air-cured</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Reducing labor and costs {{is essential to}} continuing profitable tobacco production. Two designs that use the cantilever-beam concept for sup-porting two rails of stick tobacco on a central beam are shown and explained in this publication. Further details of construction and covering are shown in the following drawings. Advantages Low-cost, low-labor, sturdy, and moveable tobacco curing frames have been studied extensively by agricultural engineers at the University of Kentucky for many years. As {{a result of these}} studies, moveable curing frames have been shown to: • provide a means of reducing the curing structure and labor costs, • cure tobacco equivalent to normal barn curing, and • offer a means of being located close to the field. Being able to locate the curing frames close to the field reduces transport time during the busy harvest period. Filling directly from the stick row reduces conventional loading and unloading time and expense. Working at ground level elimi-nates the dangers of climbing and working on tier rails in the tall barns. Precautions Moveable curing frames have some additional weather risks that can be minimized by diligent application and management of the plastic and by anchoring the frames against high winds.

40|$|The black shank (Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae) fungus {{is a very}} {{destructive}} tobacco disease {{which is}} responsible for great losses to farmers worldwide. This disease is also a problem in South Africa, as the most popular South African <b>air-cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> cultivar, CDL 28, is very susceptible to black shank. This diallel study focussed on finding the most suitable black shank resistance source to include in a resistance breeding programme with CDL 28. Four cultivars were crossed in all possible combinations and planted as an F 1 field and greenhouse trial. The F 1 's were selfed to obtain a segregating F 2 population, planted in a greenhouse, to be compared with the mean values of the F 1 trials. The field trial was exposed to natural infection while the greenhouse trials were root inoculated. The general combining ability effects of the four parent cultivars differed significantly from each other. The specific combining ability effects of the F 1 trials were non significant. These experimental results suggest that additive genetic effects were involved in black shank resistance. The Beinhart 1000 - 1 source of resistance was significantly better than the Florida 301 source. Burley 37, which possesses the Florida 301 as well as another source of resistance performed better than Domkrag with only the Florida 301 source of resistance. In order to incorporate black shank resistance in CDL 28, Beinhart 1000 - 1 and Burley 37 {{can be used in a}} backcross breeding programme with CDL 28 which can solve the problems encountered in the cultivation of CDL 28 in the presence of black shank.

40|$|Tobacco {{is known}} to contain a class of nitrosamines known as tobacco-specific nitrosamines or TSNA. Nitrosation of {{naturally}} occurring tobacco alkaloids is commonly accepted as the mechanism of TSNA formation in tobacco. Because green and freshly harvested tobaccos are virtually free of TSNA, formation and accumulation of TSNA are generally considered to occur during the curing process. Most recent hypotheses have focused on microbial reduction of nitrate to nitrite and other oxides of nitrogen (NOcompounds) that react with tobacco alkaloids to form TSNA during curing. This natural microbial process remains the prevalent hypothesis for TSNA formation in burley and other <b>air-cured</b> <b>tobaccos.</b> However, a different mechanism {{for the formation of}} TSNA in flue-cured tobacco, independent of microbial activity, is documented in this paper. It is common practice to flue-cure Virginia or blonde tobacco in bulk barns that incorporate forced air ventilation and temperature control. For the last thirty-five years, many modern bulk barns in North America generally have used liquid propane gas (LPG) with direct-fired burners that exhaust combustion gases directly into the barn where the tobacco is exposed to those gases. Our studies indicate that LPG combustion by-products in the exhaust stream, namely NO, react with naturally occurring tobacco alkaloids to form TSNA. Heat exchange curing methods preclude exposure of the tobacco to combustion gases and by-products, thereby eliminating this significant source of TSNA formation, without degrading leaf quality or smoking character. Research findings from 1998 and 1999 are presented to demonstrate the role of NOgases in TSNA formation and the significance of direct-fired curing as a primary source of TSNA formation in flue-cured tobacco. Also, data from an extensive barn conversion program in 2000, which resulted in a 94 % average reduction in TSNA levels in cured flue-cured leaf, are presented...|$|R

5000|$|More unprotonated {{nicotine}} {{in tobacco}} smoke increases smoke [...] "strength", [...] "impact", or [...] "kick". However, the irritation and harshness of smoke at higher pH {{makes it harder}} for smokers to inhale it. Cigarette design ensures that the smoke has enough unprotonated nicotine to rapidly transfer nicotine into the brain but not so much of it as to be too harsh for the smoker. Variability in the acid-base nature of tobacco leaf is considerable. Flue-cured ("bright") tobacco typically produces acidic smoke, whereas <b>air-cured</b> ("burley") <b>tobacco</b> typically produces basic smoke. The natural acids in tobacco smoke (e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid) can protonate nicotine, while the natural bases (e.g., ammonia) tend to neutralize the acids and keep more nicotine in the unprotonated form. Acidic tobacco additives such as levulinic acid are used as [...] "smoothing" [...] agents to reduce smoke harshness.|$|R
40|$|Once iconic American symbols, tobacco {{farms are}} {{gradually}} disappearing. It {{is difficult for}} many people to lament {{the loss of a}} crop that has come to symbolize addiction, disease, and corporate deception; yet, in Kentucky, the plant has {{played an important role in}} economic development and prosperity. Burley tobacco—a <b>light,</b> <b>air-cured</b> variety used in cigarette production—has long been the Commonwealth’s largest cash crop and an important aspect of regional identity, along with bourbon, bluegrass music, and Thoroughbred horses. In Burley: Kentucky Tobacco in a New Century, Ann K. Ferrell investigates the rapidly transforming process of raising and selling tobacco by chronicling her conversations with the farmers who know the crop best. She demonstrates that although the 2004 “buyout” ending the federal tobacco program is commonly perceived to be the most significant change that growers have had to negotiate, it is, in reality, only one new factor among many. Burley reveals the tangible and intangible challenges tobacco farmers face today, from the logistics of cultivation to the growing stigma against the crop. Ferrell uses ethnography, archival research, and rhetorical analysis to tell the complex story of burley tobacco production in twenty-first-century Kentucky. Not only does she give a voice to the farmers who persevere in this embattled industry, but she also sheds light on their futures, contesting the widely held assumption that they can easily replace the crop by diversifying their operations with alternative crops. As tobacco fades from both the physical and economic landscapes, this nuanced volume documents and explores the culture and practices of burley production today. Awarded the 2014 Wayland D.
