50|$|Pratylenchus is a genus of {{nematodes}} known commonly as <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes.</b> They are parasitic {{on plants}} and {{are responsible for}} root lesion disease on many taxa of host plants in temperate regions around the world. <b>Lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> are migratory endoparasites that feed and reproduce in the root and move around, unlike the cyst or root-knot nematodes, which may stay in one place. They usually only feed on the cortex of the root. Species are distinguished primarily by the morphology of the stylets.|$|R

40|$|Australasian Plant Pathology Society 2008 A {{survey of}} 76 wheat and 12 barley crops was {{conducted}} during 1999 and 2000 {{to determine the}} importance of root lesion (Pratylenchus spp.) and cereal cyst (Heterodera spp.) nematodes as potential risks to cereal crops in south-west Victoria, Australia, a rapidly expanding high rainfall cropping region. During the growing season, crops were sampled and inspected for symptoms of infestation by cereal cyst <b>nematode.</b> Root <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> were extracted from roots and quantified. The results showed that cereal cyst nematode was of minor importance to cereal crops in this region. Even though root <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> were either absent or present at low levels within the roots of most wheat and barley crops, they were present at potentially damaging levels in 16 % of crops, and the data showed higher nematode densities following two consecutive crops than following 2 years of pasture.

50|$|Root <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> infect a {{great variety}} of hosts. Pratylenchus penetrans alone has over 350 host plants. They include {{agricultural}} crops such as soybeans, potatoes, corn, bananas, and wheat. The genus is found most often in corn. Signs of disease are similar in most plants and generally include necrotic lesions of the roots. The lesions can also be entrances for pathogenic bacteria and fungi, which produce secondary infections. Above ground the plant becomes stunted, chlorotic, and wilted, and it often dies. A crop field may be patchy as plants wither and die. Root <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> can cause significant yield losses.|$|R

5000|$|Pratylenchus {{are second}} only behind Meloidogyne {{in terms of}} crops infested {{and the extent of}} crop damage and loss. Pratylenchus brachyurus is widely spread {{throughout}} the warmer regions of the world. [...] In Brazil it is the most widely distributed root <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> on coffee. They introduce necrosis in the cortex of the root which is detrimental to the plant. Lesion nematodes severely damage a plant and open points of entry for other bacteria and fungus to enter the root. [...] In the US it is mainly found in southern regions and in Florida it is found in nearly every county. A study in 1969 showed that it is found in 90% of the citrus groves in Florida. [...] Due to P. brachyurus being able to infest a wide range of crops and being so damaging, it is of high economic importance.|$|E
5000|$|Some general {{symptoms}} that are produced on infected plants include poor growth and chlorotic foliage. [...] These secondary symptoms are often due to plant root stress. [...] These make it rather difficult to diagnose nematode diseases in general. The roots when infected produce necrotic lesions, which are darkened areas of dead tissue, {{on the surface}} and throughout the cortex of the infected roots. These lesions turn the root to reddish-brown to black and are initially spotty. As the nematode continues to feed, the lesions can coalesce to become large necrotic areas of tissue that may eventually girdle the root. The population size of the nematode affects the degree of symptoms. Low to moderate populations may cause no visible above ground symptoms, while high populations can lead to stunting, nutrient and water deficiencies, and eventual die-back of the plant. [...] On potato, infection of root <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> can cause a secondary invasion by Verticillium dahliae leading to Potato Early Dying. [...] Onions are another important host of P. penetrans. Onions are an important vegetable for consumption in the United States and upon infection the nematodes can limit yield and quality of the bulbs. Populations of more than 0.01 nematodes per cubic centimeter of soil resulted in injury to onions. There is a negative relationship between the increasing inoculum levels on onion root and top fresh weight at harvest.|$|E
40|$|The {{northern}} root-knot (NRK) and lesion nematodes are the {{two primary}} nematode pathogens of vegetables grown in New York . Currently, there are no known resistant varieties and the crop rotations practiced are generally not effective. Also, it is often not cost-effective to rotate with less profitable non-host crops, thus nematicides are heavily relied upon. Three grower training sessions in the on-farm assessment of root-knot and <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> infestations were held in Orange , Oswego and YatesCounties on 16 May, 27 and 29 June, respectively. Over 50 growers attended the sessions to learn how-to sample targeted fields, set-up and maintain the bioassay plants, record the severity of diagnostic visual symptoms and make the appropriate management decision, if needed. In cooperation with Cornell vegetable extension educators, 13 fields were soil sampled and assessed for nematodes using the developed bioassays. Several growers also conducted their own on-farm assessments. Five growth chamber experiments were conducted to further relate symptom severity on the soybean bioassay roots with natural <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> infestation levels. The {{results indicated that the}} number of lesions caused by <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> on soybean roots were correlated to soil infestation levels of this nematode, although there was considerable variability among the tests and further investigation is needed.

40|$|Damage to {{sugarcane}} {{caused by}} root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne spp.) {{is well documented}} in infertile coarse-textured soils, but crop losses have never been assessed in the fine-textured soils on which more than 95 % of Australia’s sugarcane is grown. The impact of nematodes in these more fertile soils was assessed by repeatedly applying nematicides (aldicarb and fenamiphos) to plant and ratoon crops in 16 fields, and measuring their effects on nematode populations, sugarcane growth and yield. In untreated plant crops, mid-season population densities of <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> (Pratylenchus zeae), root-knot nematode (M. javanica), stunt nematode (Tylenchorhynchus annulatus), spiral nematode (Helicotylenchus dihystera) and stubby-root nematode (Paratrichodorus minor) averaged 1065, 214, 535, 217 and 103 nematodes/ 200 mL soil, respectively. Lower mean nematode population densities were recorded in the first ratoon, particularly for root-knot nematode. Nematicides reduced populations of <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> by 66 – 99 % in both plant and ratoon crops, but control of root-knot nematode was inconsistent, particularly in ratoons. Nematicide treatment had {{a greater impact on}} shoot and stalk length than on shoot and stalk number. The entire community of pest nematodes appeared to be contributing to lost productivity, but stalk length and final yield responses correlated most consistently with the number of lesion nematodes controlled. Fine roots in nematicide-treated plots were healthier and more numerous than in untreated plots, and this was indicative of the reduced impact of <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode.</b> Yield responses averaged 15. 3 % in plant crops and 11. 6 % in ratoons, indicating that nematodes are subtle but significant pests of sugarcane in fine-textured soils.

40|$|The root <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> Pratylenchus penetrans is {{considered}} one of the most economi-cally important species within the genus. Host range studies have shown that nearly 400 plant species can be parasitized by this species. To obtain insight into the transcriptome of this migratory plant-parasitic nematode, we used Illumina mRNA sequencing analysis of a mixed population, as well as nematode reads detected in infected soybean roots 3 and 7 days after nematode infection.
