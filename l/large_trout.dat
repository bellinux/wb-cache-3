25|$|Spey casting is {{used for}} fishing large rivers for salmon and <b>large</b> <b>trout</b> such as steelhead and sea trout. Spey {{technique}} is also used in saltwater surf casting. All of these situations require the angler to cast larger flies long distances. The two-handed Spey technique allows more powerful casts and avoids obstacles on the shore by keeping most of the line {{in front of the}} angler.|$|E
25|$|Small trout {{caught on}} a barb-less hook can be {{released}} simply by: grasping the eyelet of the fly, and rotating the eyelet toward the bend (the U-bend). This pulls the point backwards, back through the way it entered. Push the eyelet directly toward the bend until the point {{is removed from the}} fish. <b>Large</b> <b>trout</b> can be grasped gently and forceps can be used to grip the bend and push backwards, away from the direction the hook currently points. If necessary, squirming trout can be held on their backs. This often subdues the fish and provides enough time to remove the hook.|$|E
25|$|The most commons {{species of}} fish in the river are Coregonus lavaretus, European perch and {{northern}} pike, all three which have been the basis for sustenance fishing. Less commons species include burbot, grayling and brown trout. Five thousand trouts are set out each year to sustain the population. Especially the lake Kaskamajärvi has a <b>large</b> <b>trout</b> population. The lower portion of the river previously had some Atlantic salmon, but these have all but disappeared since the hydroelectric stations were installed. Uncommon fish species include European river lamprey, three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and common minnow. Vendace is an introduced species in Lake Inari and has spread to the reserve.|$|E

500|$|In the 1880s, large {{brook trout}} were common in Kettle Creek, {{but due to}} overfishing, such <b>large</b> <b>trout</b> were no longer found in the creek after 1918 to 1920. The Kettle Creek {{watershed}} contains eight percent of the Class A Wild Trout Streams in Pennsylvania. The levels of trout biomass at the headwaters can {{be as high as}} [...] per hectare. Brown trout were first introduced to the watershed in the late 1800s. They became common in the watershed in the 1940s. Rainbow trout began to be stocked in the creek in Clinton County in 1936 and Potter County in 1946. Yellow perch began to be stocked in the lower reaches of Kettle Creek between the mid-1930s and early 1940s. A total of 35 species of fish are found in the watershed, of which 21 are native species and 14 are not.|$|E
500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy {{grasshoppers}} found under a log he names a [...] "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee {{and makes a}} sliced onion sandwich.

Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that [...] "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" [...] that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a <b>large</b> <b>trout,</b> [...] "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack.

2500|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} Beaver Creek Valley State Park {{was caught in}} a dispute between fishing and birdwatching interests. [...] To improve the habitat for <b>large</b> <b>trout,</b> {{fisheries}} staff were setting rocks {{along the banks of the}} creek to prevent erosion and create overhangs where the fish could hide. [...] However Louisiana waterthrushes and sometimes cerulean warblers nest at the base of creekside trees, some of which were being removed to make space for the rocks. [...] After a public battle over the state's wildlife management policies, the upper and lower sections of East Beaver Creek were modified and the middle section left alone.|$|E

The Park Service is involved in restoring the population of bighorn sheep, which are considered endangered in the area; in 2014 several bighorns were released into the Sequoia-Kings Canyon area. Grizzly bears originally roamed the park as well, but were hunted to extinction by the early 1900s. The forks of the Kings River at these middle and lower elevations are also well known for their wild trout; the Kings is known as [...] "one of the finest <b>large</b> <b>trout</b> fisheries in the state".|$|E
2500|$|Once hooked, a small trout can {{be easily}} {{retrieved}} [...] "on the reel" [...] or by simply pulling in the fly line with the reel hand while pinching {{the line between the}} rod handle and the index finger of the rod hand. It is important to keep the rod tip high, allowing the bend of the rod to absorb the force of the fish's struggles against the line. Larger trout will often take line in powerful runs before they can be landed. Unlike spin fishing where the line is already on the reel, playing a large fish with fly line and a fly reel can present a special challenge. Usually, when a fish is hooked, there will be extra fly line coiled between the reel and the index finger of the rod hand. The challenge is to reel up the loose fly line onto the reel without breaking off a large fish (or getting the line wrapped up around the rod handle, one's foot, a stick or anything else in the way). With experience, really <b>large</b> <b>trout</b> can be put on the reel simply by applying light pressure on the outgoing line using the fisher's fingers. Once the extra line is on the reel, an angler can use the reel's drag system to tire the fish. It is important to use heavier tippet material if it won't spook the fish. The reason why this is important is an exhausted fish can easily die if released too soon. Heavier tippet material enables the angler to land the fish while not over exhausting it.|$|E

40|$|The koaro (Galaxias brevipinnis) is {{important}} in New Zealand's whitebait fishery but aspects of its ecology and life-history are poorly understood. Factors affecting koaro distribution and life-history were investigated in Manson Creek, a lake tributary stream. Six 20 metre sites were electrofished during the summers of 199912000 and 2000 / 0 1. All koaro > 90 mm (FL) captured were tagged. Mean koaro size and density were higher at upstream sites. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) abundance was significantly lower upstream, but <b>trout</b> were <b>larger</b> upstream. Koaro distribution can be partly attributed to abiotic factors (more riparian forest and pools upstream). However, interactions with brown trout could also affect their distribution. All koaro were recaptured {{at the site of}} initial tagging indicating they utilised a well defined homerange. Mean growth of recaptured koaro was greatest at upstream sites, where koaro density was lowest. Juvenile koaro captured during autumn were the result of spring spawning. Koaro interactions with juvenile brown trout and habitat preferences (shade and velocity) were tested in stream channels. Koaro showed no microhabitat preference even in the presence of trout. However, koaro spent significantly more time alone in trout treatments compared to troutless treatments. Thus, trout affected koaro microhabitat choice more strongly than the microhabitat type. The influence of small and medium sized brown trout on the growth and mortality of small and large koaro was investigated during a one month growth experiment. Mean growth of small koaro was less in trout treatments and least in treatments containing the <b>largest</b> <b>trout,</b> suggesting that trout negatively affect growth of small koaro, possibly through competitive interactions. Less koaro survived in the <b>largest</b> <b>trout</b> treatments, suggesting that <b>larger</b> <b>trout</b> may have preyed upon smaller koaro. This study was undertaken to expand on the knowledge of koaro ecology and life-history in a landlocked population, and how the introduced brown trout may affect distribution, growth and survival of koaro...|$|R
