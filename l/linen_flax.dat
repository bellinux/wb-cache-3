5000|$|Doek is Dutch for cloth, {{which was}} {{evolved into the}} English word [...] "duck" [...] in {{reference}} to sail canvas. Duck was typically made from cotton or <b>linen</b> (<b>flax),</b> with some use of hemp. These natural fibers have poor resistance to rot, UV light and water absorption. Linen is stronger, but cotton is lighter. Linen was the traditional fiber of sails until it was supplanted by cotton during the 19th century. At first cotton {{was used as a}} matter of necessity in the United States as it was indigenous and the supply of flax was periodically interrupted by wars such as the War of 1812, during which demand for sailcloth for military use was high. As sail size grew linen was too heavy to be practical so cotton became more popular. Cotton did not substantially replace linen worldwide {{until the end of the}} age of sail; however, in some cases the strength of linen was preferred for some types of sails. It was not until the late 20th century that natural fibers were replaced by synthetics in mainstream use. Cotton sailcloth is still used for sportswear, upholstery and draperies. The traditional width for carded cotton sailcloth in the US was 23 inches (58 cm) while the British standard was 24 inches (61 cm).|$|E
5000|$|Economic {{categories}} {{are only the}} theoretical expressions, the abstractions of the social relations of production, M. Proudhon, holding this upside down like a true philosopher, sees in actual relations nothing but the incarnation of the principles, of these categories, which were slumbering - so M. Proudhon the philosopher tells us - in the bosom of the “impersonal reason of humanity.” M. Proudhon the economist understands very well that men make cloth, linen, or silk materials in definite relations of production. But what he has not understood is that these definite social relations are just as much produced by men as <b>linen,</b> <b>flax,</b> etc. Social relations are closely bound up with productive forces. In acquiring new productive forces men change their mode of production; and in changing their mode of production, in changing the way of earning their living, they change all their social relations. The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill society with the industrial capitalist. The same men who establish their social relations in conformity with the material productivity, produce also principles, ideas, and categories, in conformity with their social relations. Thus the ideas, these categories, are as little eternal as the relations they express. They are historical and transitory products. (...) The production relations of every society form a whole. - The Poverty of Philosophy http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02.htm ...|$|E
5000|$|The area {{became a}} {{streetcar}} suburb of Paterson {{in the years}} following the Civil War, with the central area known as Haledon, while the area surrounding the large pond along High Mountain Road was called Oldham. The Paterson and Haledon Horse Rail Road Company, formed in 1871, laid trolley tracks from Paterson along the current-day Belmont Avenue, which were electrified by 1888. Many of the trolley company's owners were among the founders of the Cedar Cliff Land Company, which bought up large portions of the area, and the street names in the borough reflect these industrialists and businessmen: Morrissee, Hoxey, Van Dyke, John Ryle and Barbour. The flat, lower part of the community was laid out in city-sized lots of 25' by 100' while the hillsides were plated as sites for larger Victorian [...] "villas" [...] for such individuals as Vice President Garret A. Hobart (now the location of William Paterson University) and the Barbour family of <b>linen</b> <b>flax</b> manufacturers. Haledon's villa development was always rather limited and throughout much of the 20th century Haledon was a typical blue-collar community set by the small property sizes planned by the Cedar Cliff Land Company. A never-constructed grand hotel was planned for the highest point of the community above the intersection of the current day Central and West Haledon Avenues. The Cedar Cliff Land Company ran newspaper advertisements targeted at upwardly mobile immigrants who worked in Paterson's silk industry, offering the city-sized lots for sale at auctions (with free lunches and brass bands) held at St. Mary's Parish Hall, and also opened the Cedar Cliff Silk Mill, which became one of several silk mills in the community. The residential appeal of Haledon was to escape the crowded industrial city and still have access to the textile mills by using the trolley. As a result of the land sales of Cedar Cliff Land Company and also of independent landowner William Bushmann, the town was settled by immigrants who came as skilled workers from textile centers in Europe.|$|E

Journal Of Chromatography A, 34, 428 - 429 The biosynthesis of selected cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates was examined in higher plants. <b>Linen</b> <b>flax</b> seedling shoots (linum usitatissimum L.) were used exclusively to study linamarin biosynthesis while prunasin biosynthesis was studies in both peach shoots (Prunus persica Batsch) and cherry laurel shoots (P. laurocerasus L.). Isoprppylglucosinolate and benzylglucosinolate were studied in scurvy grass seedlings (Cochlearia officinalis L.) and garden cress seedling shoots (Lepidum sativum L.) respectively. Altogether 9 isotopically labelled compounds were prepared {{as part of the}} study and 14 were administered to plant tissue. The quantity of cyanogenic glucosides was determined by measuring hydrogen cyanide following enzymic hydrolysis. The specific activity or dilution of the labelled compound after incorporation into the glucosides was determined and sued to judge the effectiveness of the administered compound as a precursor of the glucosides. Benzaldehyde from prunasin was measured as its semicarbazone and the isothicyanates. Obtained by enzyme hydrolysis of the glucosinolates, were identified by conversion to thiourea derivatives. Paper and thin layer chromatography and electrophoresis were used to separate non-volatile radioactive compounds. Isobutyraldoxime-U- 14 C, 2 -oximinoisovaleric acid-U- 14 C, isobutyronitrile- 1 - 14 C and 2 -hydroxyisobutyronitrile- 1 - 14 C were all incorporated into linamarin to extents comparable to that from L-valine-U- 14 c. By the use of 15 N labelled compounds the C-N bond of isobutyraldoxime and 2 -oximinoisovaleric acid was shown to remain intact during the cornversjon to linarnarin. Isobutyramide- 1 - 14 C and hydrogen cyanide- 14 c were not significantly incorporated into linamarin. Phenylacetaldoxime-U- 14 C, 2 -oximino- 3 -phenylpropionic acid- 2 - 14 C and phenylacetonitrile- 1 - 14 c were converted to prunasin to greater extents than was L-phenylalanine-U- 14 C. Radioactivity from D,L-mandelonitrile- 1 - 14 C and, to a lesser extent, from hydrogen cyanide- 14 -C was also incorporated into the nitrile moiety of prunasin. Phenylacethydroxamic acid- 1 - 14 C was not significantly converted to prunasin. Linen 'lax seedling shoots were examined for both volatile and non-volatile intermediates. Radioactive precursors of linamarin were administered in the presence of other suspected intermediates or inhibitors of linamarin biosynthesis. Both isobutyraldoxime and isobutyronitrile were shown to be formed in the shoots from L-valine-U- 14 C. A non-volatile compound which accumulated {{in the presence of a}} few inhibitors Of linamaran biosynthesis was studied in detail. Treatment with acid under mild conditions yielded isobutyraldehyde while emulsin gave isobutyraldoxime. It was resistant to linamarase. Isobutyronitrile was a product of pyrolysis. The proposed structure for this compound is isobutyraldoxime- 0 -glucoside. Isobutyraldoxime-U- 14 C and phenylacetaldoxime-U- 14 C were both better precursors of the corresponding glucosinolates than were L-valine-U- 14 C or L-phenylalanine-U- 14 C. 2 -Oximinoisovaleric acid-U- 14 C was not significantly incorporated into isopropylglucosinolate. It is concluded that aldoximes are intermediates in the biosynthesis of both cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates. Other intermediates proposed in cyanogenic glycoside biosynthesis are nitriles and 2 -hydroxynitriles in that order, N-Hydroxyamino acids may be intermediates between amino acids and aldoximes. 2 -Oximino acids may also be intermediates in cyanoglycoside biosynthesis although it is possible that the observed incorporation was by way of prior non-enzymic conversion to nitriles. The experiments with labelled administered compounds have outlined a pathway of cyanogenic glycoside biosynthesis which may now be profitably studied for confirmation at the enzymic level...|$|E

After harvesting, the plant stems were retted to loosen the outer layers and internal fibres, stripped, pounded and then smoothed. Following this, the materials were woven.

In Pliny's opinion, the whitest (and best) was imported from Spanish Saetabis; at double the price, the strongest and most long-lasting was from Retovium. The whitest and softest was produced in Latium, Falerii and Paelignium. Natural linen was a [...] "greyish brown" [...] that faded to off-white through repeated laundering and exposure to sunlight. It did not readily absorb the dyes in use at the time, and was generally bleached, or used in its raw, undyed state.|$|R

Eventually, Flanders became the major center of the linen industry in the European Middle Ages. In North America, flax was introduced by the colonists and it flourished there, but by the early twentieth century, cheap cotton and rising farm wages had caused production of flax to become concentrated in northern Russia, which came to provide 90% of the world's output.
