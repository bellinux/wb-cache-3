500|$|The deep-level {{platforms}} {{were opened}} on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP, now the Piccadilly line) which ran between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith. The platforms are placed eastbound above westbound and were originally served by lifts from street level stopping at both platform levels. Eastbound GNP trains and DR trains would have {{shared the same}} platform with the two routes separating at a junction immediately {{to the east of}} the station. Westbound trains would have had separate platforms at the lower level with the routes merging at a junction west of the station. Although construction of the section of the DR tube route east of South Kensington had been postponed, a partial, [...] long, section of the westbound DR platform was built along with the two for GNP use. Though closed-off {{from the rest of the}} station, it was linked to the <b>lift</b> <b>lobby</b> and was tiled to match the other platforms. Enlarged tunnel sections for the junctions were constructed with the original running tunnels and remain visible from passing trains. A new surface building on Pelham Street for the lifts was designed by Leslie Green with the GNP's distinctive ox-blood red glazed terracotta façade.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} design constraints and potential of applying the remote source solar lighting {{system to the}} enclosed <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies</b> of high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. No natural light is usually provided to these <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies,</b> which depend on electric lighting for illumination. The application of conventional light pipes requires minimum 3 m headroom and is not feasible to be applied in the high-rise residential buildings of 2. 8 m floor height in Hong Kong. A remote source solar lighting system is specifically designed to solve the headroom problem. The daylighting system uses small diameter side-emitting fiber optic as light transmission medium. The factors of solar altitude, solar azimuth angle and solar irradiance are investigated. The shadowing effects caused by neighboring buildings and the supporting framework are analyzed in details. Design parameters of the natural daylight system are defined. Design guidelines and a model design are developed as a reference for building designers in designing a remote source solar lighting system. The design addresses both the functional application {{as well as the}} esthetic design. The remote source daylighting system can be integrated into the architectural design of the external facade and <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies.</b> Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 2009, the ban was {{extended}} to all children's playgrounds, exercise areas, markets, underground and multi-storey carparks, ferry terminals and jetties. It was also extended to non-air-conditioned areas in offices, factories, shops, shopping complexes and <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies,</b> and within 5 m of entrances and exits.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} comprises {{several groups}} of <b>lifts.</b> <b>Lobbies</b> {{are on the}} 3rd and 17th floor, and are connected to Queen's Road East and Kennedy Road respectively. A mini-skylobby is on the 56th floor {{and serves as a}} transfer floor for diners heading to the 60/F and 62/F restaurants. The building's white 'bumps' between the windows have built in window-washer guide rails.|$|R
50|$|Internally, to {{the rear}} of the ground floor, a second turning timber staircase, part of the 1970s refurbishment, leads to the {{auditorium}}. A set of swing doors, also part of the 1970s renovations, lead to the auditorium foyer. Openings to the southern side of the section lead to a <b>lift</b> <b>lobby</b> and out to the covered courtyard.|$|E
50|$|Q1 was {{completed}} {{towards the end}} of year 2005. Its main point of difference to other high-rise in Surfers Paradise is its glass-enclosed sleek look. Q1 <b>lift</b> <b>lobby</b> is separated into two high speed lift groups. Four high speed lifts service levels B2 to level 42. Three separate high speed lifts service levels 43 to the penthouse on level 74.|$|E
50|$|The Dornoch Terrace {{entrance}} comprises a tiled undercroft {{with substantial}} square columns, {{adjacent to a}} leasable space with a faceted glass wall. This entrance links, via a waiting lounge, <b>lift</b> <b>lobby,</b> corridor and concrete bridge, to a large concrete viewing terrace on the top storey of the Garden Block. The Garden Block is entered via a porte cochere and glazed foyer in the undercroft.|$|E
50|$|Such sensors {{are also}} used for restrooms. Owing to the {{variability}} of occupancy time in a restroom, a simple fixed timer was unworkable. This {{ability to cope with}} variably occupancy times is also useful when stairwells, <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies</b> and corridors must grant disabled access as they no longer discriminate in favour of an assumed transit time for an able-bodied person.|$|R
50|$|The Jervois is {{a luxurious}} {{boutique}} hotel that combines {{a total of}} 49 suites. All suites are only accessible via private <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies</b> and feature floor to ceiling windows that offer views of Hong Kong. Typical floors have two suites per floor with double corner windows while the top five floor have only one suite per floor with 360 degrees views of Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong Central and Victoria Peak.|$|R
50|$|Accommodation of the {{building}} consists of a single level basement, ground floor foyer, two ground floor tenancies, {{while the rest of}} {{the building}} mainly consists of office space. A mezzanine level is also found in the building. Upper levels {{of the building}} features a central service core which accommodates female and male amenities, tea rooms, and multiple <b>lifts</b> and <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies.</b> The Woden Town Centre is notorious for the wind tunnel caused by the Lovett Tower.|$|R
50|$|The {{service tower}} on the building's west side housed the tower's services, {{including}} its four high-speed lifts, a <b>lift</b> <b>lobby,</b> electricity, plumbing, toilets, tea room and two escape stairwells. The containment {{of the services}} within the service tower enabled the 4200 sq ft of office space on each floor to be contiguous. The service tower rose 27 ft above {{the roof of the}} main building.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has a circular floor plan. Although {{the front entrance}} is on the 'ground floor', commuters are taken {{through a set of}} escalators to the 3rd floor <b>lift</b> <b>lobby.</b> Hopewell Centre stands on the slope of a hill so steep that the {{building has}} its back entrance on the 17th floor towards Kennedy Road. There is a circular private swimming pool {{on the roof of the}} building.|$|E
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{contains}} the main banking chamber with a mezzanine level, partly renovated. Much of the plaster detailing {{in the chamber}} remains. The vestibule and adjoining <b>lift</b> <b>lobby</b> have finely figured marble linings. The second and third floors retain the original office layout and finishes, but other levels have been modified to accommodate larger tenancies. The relatively austere basement contains carefully detailed security grilles and a strong room.|$|E
50|$|Heinz Felsch, {{with the}} support of his wife Brigitte Felsch-Reiff, worked on larger scale {{commissions}} of architectural art from the mid-1960’s to the late 1970’s, which were mainly mosaic wall friezes in the lobbies of newly built hospitals and schools. There are still two of the previously three larger wall mosaics in the <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies</b> of the Policlinic Reil in Halle. A further 17-meter long wall mosaic frieze can still be seen in a school in Braunsbedra near Halle.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floors}} houses {{facilities}} from offices to trading floors with some floors having private <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies.</b> Four sky gardens {{are located on}} the 5th, 12th, 15th and 22nd floors of the building, {{in response to the}} Urban Redevelopment Authority's GFA incentives and also to show the concept of extended greenery. On the fifth floor, it houses restaurants, a gym, swimming pool, jogging track and a few offices. The sky garden occupies the majority of the floor.|$|R
50|$|From {{this time}} on, the couple’s {{professional}} lives were closely linked {{and they both}} worked on larger scale commissions of architectural art from the mid-1960’s to the late 1970’s.

5000|$|Work {{commenced}} in May 2009 {{to install}} two lifts from the ticket {{hall to the}} Victoria line platforms and an existing interchange passageway giving access to the Piccadilly and Jubilee lines platforms from the lower <b>lift</b> <b>lobby.</b> This work was completed ahead of schedule in August 2011 when the new lifts were brought into service, along with a third lift between street level {{on the south side}} of Piccadilly and the ticket hall. All platforms have level access to the trains, making the station fully accessible (the first one within the Circle line).|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Newgate Street was {{a narrow}} road with some of its mediaeval {{character}} remaining. To reduce land purchase and compensation payments, the CLR routed its tunnels directly under public roads. At St. Paul's the narrowness of the road required the tunnels to be placed one above the other with the westbound tunnel uppermost. The lifts originally operated to a level between the two platforms, with stairs up or down to the platforms as necessary. A high-level access passageway is visible at the lowest level leading to the disused <b>lift</b> <b>lobby.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{art works}} at Parliament House were {{on loan from}} the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The {{rebuilding}} project {{was seen as an}} opportunity acquire new works and a percentage of the overall budget was set aside for their purchase. Four women received commissions for works to be hung in prominent areas of the new building. In the dining area used for State receptions hang two tapestries by Fay Bottrell. In the main <b>lift</b> <b>lobby</b> Margaret Grafton’s tapestry depicts the coat of arms of New South Wales. A series of wall hangings by Heather Dorrough are in the staff dining room, while the historically referenced depiction of Parliament House by Kitzpatrick hangs in the Fountain Court.|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong is a densely {{populated}} metropolitan city with limited land supply. The land cost is high. Majority of the residential buildings are developed into high-rise {{with a central}} core design of enclosed <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies</b> without natural lighting. Electricity is required to provide illumination continuously for 24 h. A remote source solar lighting system using side-emitting fiber optic as illuminators is designed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases for providing illumination to these <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies.</b> Experiment was carried out to test {{the performance of the}} daylighting system and proved that the remote source solar lighting system could displace an average of 3 hof electric lighting in a day and reduce 6. 7 × 106 kg of carbon dioxide emission in a year. A study on the cost of the remote source solar lighting system was conducted and compared to the cost of the conventional lighting systems. Both the maintenance cost and environmental benefit that could be offered by the remote source solar lighting system were also studied in detail. Although the side-emitting technology of fiber optic is still primitive, further development can improve the emission efficiency and allow the remote source solar lighting system to operate more effectively. The potential of applying the remote source solar lighting system to conserve environment is promising. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

It will join Lentor Ave and intersect the Seletar Expressway. Major bus stops will {{be equipped with}} <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies</b> at Lentor Avenue, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 and Marymount Road. It will also pass through the two military training areas - Lentor and Seletar East, both {{of which will be}} cleared by 2017. It will pass Toa Payoh Rise, join Thomson Road and Bukit Timah Road running parallel to the Central Expressway. The NSE will carry on along Ophir Road, joining the East Coast Parkway at its southern terminus. In addition, there will be new bus lanes and cycling lanes.|$|R
40|$|Transitional spaces {{refer to}} those spaces located {{in-between}} {{interior and exterior}} environments acting as both buffer spaces and physical links, such as entrance canopies, foyers, <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies,</b> corridors, stairwells, etc. As transitional spaces may constitute {{a significant portion of}} the building volume and have large implications to occupants’ experience and building energy consumption, many research studies have come up in recent years to examine their conditions and characteristics. This research aims to investigate the thermal conditions and subjective thermal perceptions of occupants in the different types of transitional spaces. Semi-opened and fully enclosed <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies</b> and corridors in The University of Hong Kong (HKU) campus were chosen for the field study. Theoretical study, survey questionnaires and simple energy simulation have been implemented to examine the thermal comfort requirements, people’s perceptions and energy impact of transitional spaces. It was found that an opened area is easily influenced by variable weather conditions as it is close to natural environment while an enclosed one is totally separated from the exterior environment and commonly air-conditioned. This may lead to different subjective thermal responses in these two types of spaces. It was also discovered that people can accept wider thermal environment in transitional spaces and their thermal response varies with dressing, activity level, past thermal experience and prior thermal preference. It is believed that the current comfort standards and criteria are not designed for transitional spaces. The proposed thermal comfort ranges for transitional spaces were examined in this study using modified adaptive comfort model. This could be used to consider possible changes to the current design guidelines and standards. If the transitional spaces are designed with appropriate energy saving strategies such as passive design, hybrid ventilation and flexible HVAC controls, it can help achieve more energy efficient and healthy buildings in the future. postprin...|$|R

On her birthday, Wen He happens to have a bracelet which {{he wants to give}} to Wen Qing after Wen Qing's bracelet broke. Zhenzhu thinks it is a birthday present and eagerly takes it. This makes Wen Qing angry and jealous. That night, Wen He tries to make it up to her by buying another bracelet and explaining himself. He is successful. However, Wen Xin happens to be standing near the <b>lift</b> <b>lobby</b> when Wen He puts on the bracelet for Wen Qing. She unwittingly discovers their relationship and leaks it out to Wen Shui.|$|E
50|$|The welding {{activity}} routinely triggered alarms {{from the}} building's smoke detectors, {{so much so}} that staff at the China Arts & Crafts store that occupied the bottom three floors had wrapped plastic around the fire alarms to muffle the sound. Furthermore, workers were found to have cut metal with a welder, contrary to building codes. Thus, when a stray piece of hot metal fell from the thirteenth floor, sparking a fire in the second floor <b>lift</b> <b>lobby,</b> no one paid much attention, believing that {{it was part of the}} normal welding activity. A welder discovered the fire, and alerted the fire department. A second emergency call was made one minute later, when a dental assistant on the 13th floor discovered dense smoke in the hallway.|$|E

40|$|Resource {{depletion}} {{and global}} warming dictate needs to reduce energy consumption, however energy used for the environmental space conditioning of buildings remains substantial; even in well-designed examples. Therefore {{the ways in which}} buildings are utilized, and occupant expectations of comfort in building environments should be researched to determine alternative means for optimizing performance. This paper deals with transition spaces (entrance foyers, circulation zones, <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies,</b> stairways and atria) and thermal comfort experiences. It both reviews existing reported research into comfort in such spaces, and introduces new information from a range of studies completed in recent years. It assesses the usefulness and applicability of design standards which exist, but which are primarily concerned with more permanently (rather than transitorily) occupied spaces within buildings. Three main categories of transition space are identified: entrance zones; circulation zones; and zones of longer residence-time such as atria. The analysis indicates that different design standards, or variations on existing standards, should be considered for application in each type of space. The outcomes of this work suggest opportunities to reduce environmental conditioning and therefore energy use in such spaces; spaces which can make up a significant fraction of the overall floor area/volume of workplace buildings...|$|R
5000|$|Phase III {{comprises}} four high-rise {{buildings and}} is under construction. Phase III is directly {{attached to the}} LOHAS Park MTR stations. Phases I and II {{are connected to the}} MTR station via long covered walkways which are segregated from road traffic level by being fully elevated throughout the route. Phase III is situated at the Northern side of LOHAS Park. Phase III apartments facing North can enjoy the unrestricted view to the permanent recovered greenery. The greenery is partially encircled by the new Tseung Kwan O cycling track which links LOHAS Park to the Tseung Kwan O town centre. Part of the greenery is now the Wan Po Road Pet Garden. A new covered walkway is under construction which may offer direct access to the MTR station from the Wan Po Road. Currently, access to the LOHAS Park MTR station by other housing estates residents at the Northern side of the Wan Po Road need to pass through the Phase I The Capitol (...) estate facilities (lifts and walkways). Heavy pedestrian traffic may have affected the facilities and large scale floor tile refurbishment in the public <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies</b> are undergoing as of Aug 2014.|$|R
40|$|Density {{increases}} are generally accepted as reducing the carbon involved in urban transport. This {{relationship has been}} shown consistently between cities (through the Global Cities database) and within cities like Sydney and Melbourne. However the density increases in buildings are more controversial with several studies suggesting that high rise buildings are much more greenhouse intensive due to their shared spaces such as <b>lift</b> <b>lobbies</b> and underground car parks and their extra embodied energy in the structure. There is thus confusion amongst policy makers who see a trade-off between increasing density for transport Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHGe) savings but reducing density for building GHGe. This confusion is further exacerbated {{by the lack of}} data supporting this viewpoint or indeed, any specific threshold beyond which an increase in density would mean an increase in GHGe. The resolution of this trade-off is examined by showing a) that the increase in GHGe associated with high rise living is not as significant as some of the recent Australian literature suggests; b) the transport gains in GHGe are far greater due to density than any losses in GHGe due to the high rise buildings; and c) when appropriate low carbon design is applied, the attributes of density and high rise significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with low density, detached dwelling, especially when the dramatic reductions due to co-generation are factored in...|$|R
