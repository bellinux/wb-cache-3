5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) {{and the size of}} its <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> (572 litres). But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1943, in {{preparation}} for the Battle of Kursk, Hitler visited the Eastern Front at Smolensk. Originally the plan was for certain officers to shoot Hitler collectively at a signal given in the officers' mess during lunch. However, that plan was cast aside. Instead a second plan devised by General Henning von Tresckow's Nazi resistance group was carried out. Upon leaving, staff officer Heinz Brandt, who was traveling in Hitler's entourage, agreed to take a box containing two bottles of cognac to Colonel Helmuth Stieff who was stationed at Hitler's headquarters. The package was given to Brandt by Tresckow. The cognac bottles were actually a bomb placed into a casing, with a timer fuse. The plane took off with both Hitler and Brandt on board, but it arrived safely at the Wolf's Lair field headquarters in East Prussia. The bomb most likely failed to detonate because the extremely low temperatures in the unheated <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> of the plane prevented the fuse from operating properly.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E

5000|$|The Poccar, {{named as}} [...] "pocket car", {{featured}} <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> {{built into the}} exterior door panels. Both side doors were cut horizontally 3 the middle, and the lower portion dropped like a tailgate. In addition to the two lockable <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> built into the doors, there was ample luggage space inside and room for four passengers. The rear seat could also be folded down flat for increased cargo capacity. The side door <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> protruded into the interiors of the doors, and served as armrests. Electronic instruments on the dashboard were clustered in a semi-circular pod which was clearly visible through {{the upper half of}} the steering wheel.|$|R
5000|$|... 1st/2nd class day car: 48 {{first class}} seats in 12 compartments, 144 second class seats in 24 compartments, bar, lounge, reading room, <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments,</b> 12 toilets.|$|R
25|$|On August 16, 1972, a bomb {{exploded}} in the <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> of El Al Flight 444 shortly after takeoff from Rome. The plane returned to Rome safely and no casualties were recorded.|$|E
25|$|Coach {{services}} use coaches (long-distance buses) for suburb-to-CBD or longer-distance transportation. The {{vehicles are}} normally equipped with more comfortable seating, a separate <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment,</b> video and possibly also a toilet. They have higher standards than city buses, but a limited stopping pattern.|$|E
25|$|In 1964 six NZR 56-foot {{carriages}} {{from the}} South Island were transferred north and fitted with Webasto kerosene-burning heaters for the service. They seated 336 on two-person bench-type Scarrett seats: class A passenger cars seated 56 and AL car-vans (with <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment)</b> seated 47.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the 329 power cars, 220 VB 98 trailer cars with <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments,</b> 100 VB 98s without <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> and 321 VS 98 driving cars were produced. In the DB they were mainly used in a VT+VB+VS configuaration. However, there were also two-unit VT+VS formations as well as longer rakes of up to six units: VT+VB+VS+VT+VB+VS. In 1968 they were reclassified into Class 798, the trailers became 998.0-3 and driving cars 998.6-9. On the latter the serial numbers were increased by 600 (e.g. VS 98 001 became 998 601-9).|$|R
5000|$|For fair weather use {{the fairing}} {{can be removed}} in moments {{by means of a}} toe-activated snap coupling. The two <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> can also be removed quickly without tools.|$|R
50|$|Cargo was {{transported by}} air in {{specialized}} cargo aircraft {{and in the}} <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> of passenger aircraft. Air freight is typically the fastest mode for long distance freight transport, but also the most expensive.|$|R
25|$|The usual Daimler luxury {{fittings}} included: {{heating and}} ventilating equipment, windscreen washer, cigar lighter, lockable glove compartment, two courtesy lights when any door is opened, special reading lights for passengers, spring-balanced lid for the <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> which is illuminated {{when the car}} sidelights are in use, etc.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} the attack, Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said that the bomb was carried in the {{backpack}} {{of a man who}} was filmed on security cameras at the airport. Tsvetanov added that the bomb was detonated in the <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> of the bus, and that the blast was caused by 3 kilograms of TNT powder.|$|E
25|$|The third Algol {{engine was}} in {{the nose of the}} {{fuselage}}; behind it the cockpit was just ahead of the leading edge. The flat sided fuselage consisted of two parts, bolted together, and contained a cabin for ten passengers with a lavatory and <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment.</b> The tail surfaces were straight edged and conventional, with a balanced rudder.|$|E
50|$|The {{body frame}} was mostly {{made of wood}} with steel sheeting, the roof was made of wood with canvas over it, the guard and <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> had a width of 8 ft 7in, with pressed steel duckets between the {{differences}} in widths from <b>luggage</b> to passenger <b>compartments.</b> The decision about the gangways was decided in January 1924 with Pullman Gangways being adopted.|$|R
50|$|A handy bus is {{a smaller}} bus {{designed}} to carry 23 people to events, to schools {{or for a}} day care. Some handy buses have a wheelchair-accessible lift for special needs students. Some handy buses have <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1999, seven DMF {{first class}} {{vehicles}} {{were converted to}} include checked <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments,</b> with a partition in {{the centre of the}} car. The compartments were taken out of service when the checked luggage service was withdrawn some years ago.|$|R
25|$|Bulgarian leaders, {{including}} President Rosen Plevneliev, {{rushed to}} the site. The Foreign Ministry said authorities believed that the blast was a terrorist attack. According to the initial reports of Bulgarian authorities, the blast {{was caused by a}} bomb in a <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment.</b> However, it was later argued by a Bulgarian official that the blast was probably carried out by a male suicide bomber with fake US documents.|$|E
25|$|Broomsticks {{are treated}} as a major {{consumer}} product in the wizarding world. There are numerous manufacturers and models of brooms, including Cleansweeps and Comets, all of which vary in their capabilities. These range from expensive high-performance models to toy broomsticks for young children that fly {{only a few feet}} off the ground to family-sized broomsticks that seat multiple people and include a <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> below the seating area.|$|E
25|$|Since the twin-turbo V6 engine {{occupies}} {{almost as}} much space as their 3-cylinder engines, the fuel tank had to be relocated to {{the nose of the}} car, where a <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> used to be. It {{comes in the form of}} a Formula 1-type foamrubber fuelbladder. The bigger engine also forced a change from separate coil springs and dampers to concentric units to support the de Dion rear suspension.|$|E
50|$|Since 2011, a cargo {{service by}} bus is {{offered in the}} Uckermark district, named kombiBUS. The service is however {{operated}} with conventional buses with underfloor <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> and with trailers, so they have technically {{little in common with}} actual brucks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} sustained severe damage. The fuselage was cracked {{just behind}} the wings, the number 1 engine and main landing gear were sheared off, and the nose gear collapsed. [...] The fire caused overhead <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> to melt onto seats.|$|R
50|$|Modifications or {{conversions}} by Bristol Aircraft Ltd. Modifications {{could be}} made on Chipmunk Mk 20, Mk 21, Mk 22 and 22A aircraft. The Chipmunks could be fitted with <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> in the wings, a blown canopy, landing gear fairings and enlarged fuel tanks.|$|R
25|$|The ARV Super2 has {{received}} favourable reviews which {{describe it as}} an aircraft with excellent visibility that is pleasant to fly. The small wing area and the fairly high wing loading produces handling that is responsive but stable. A drawback is the shortage of luggage space which makes the ARV unsuitable for touring. The second prototype, G-STWO, has a fuselage <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> aft of the fuel tank which is accessed from the starboard aside, but no other ARVs have this feature.|$|E
25|$|The Vulcan railcars had a driver's {{compartment}} at each end, so {{they did}} not need to be turned at the terminus for the return journey. They originally had 28 and 22 seats in the two passenger compartments. In the mid-1950s the smaller compartment in each vehicle was reduced by 2 seats and replaced with a small guard's compartment, thus reducing the total number of passengers from 50 to 48. A <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> had space for about 1 ton of luggage, and an onboard toilet was provided.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1999 Bert Templeton stepped down as the Barrie head coach after being behind the bench for four years. He was {{replaced}} by Bill Stewart. The 1999–2000 season was successful on the ice but had many off-ice problems. There was internal dissension centering on Ryan Barnes, Shawn Cation, Mike Jefferson and Sheldon Keefe (all four had David Frost as an agent), and Coach Bill Stewart would later be suspended by the OHL when it was {{found out that he}} smuggled an imported Russian player across the Canada–United States border in the <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> of the team bus.|$|E
50|$|In India, those {{delivering}} milk usually use milk churns, {{a practice}} that has ceased in western countries. On the road they are put on any kind of vehicle. In big cities such as Mumbai, milk churns are often transported in <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> in local trains.|$|R
50|$|In {{vehicles}} with open <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments,</b> some are fitted with metal grids or guards to retain loose items {{in case of}} collision, or to simply create a bulkhead between the load in the trunk - for example animals - separated from the otherwise unprotected passenger space.|$|R
50|$|The Bravo 3 (unofficial name) is {{identical}} to the 1 in construction and design, differing only in terms of the lower deck. The Bravo 3 features extensive <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> to the rear, with the lower deck being significantly shorter, resulting in a lower maximum capacity of 75 for the 13.75m model.|$|R
25|$|As {{originally}} built, the DM class {{motor cars}} seated 56 passengers and D class trailer cars seated 72. However, during renovation of these trains {{in the late}} 1970s-early 1980s, two seats located next to the driver's cabs in each car were removed and a barrier was installed level with the cab, reducing the seating in each car to 54 passengers per DM car and 70 passengers per D car. Some DM cars had the double seats in the rear section {{in front of the}} <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment</b> removed and the seats parallel with the sides extended to provide space for prams.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} the night sleeping in his seat on a train trip from Buffalo to Westfield, New York, George Pullman was inspired to design an improved passenger railcar that contained sleeper berths for all its passengers. During the day, the upper berth was folded up somewhat like a modern airliner's overhead <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment.</b> At night the upper berth folded down and the two facing seats below it folded over to provide a relatively comfortable bunk for the night. Although this was somewhat spartan accommodation by today's standards, {{it was a great}} improvement on the previous layout. Curtains provided privacy, and there were washrooms {{at each end of the}} car for men and women.|$|E
25|$|The AS332 Super Puma {{is powered}} by a pair of Turbomeca Makila 1A1 {{turboshaft}} engines which drive the rotorcraft's four-bladed main rotor and five-bladed tail rotor as well two separate hydraulic systems and a pair of electrical alternators. Fuel is housed in six internal fuel tanks, additional auxiliary and external tanks can be equipped for extended flight endurance. For safety, the fuel tanks use a crashworthy plumbing design and fire detection and suppression systems are installed in the engine bay. The monocoque tail boom is fitted with tail rotor strike protection, the forward portion of the boom accommodated a <b>luggage</b> <b>compartment.</b> The retractable tricycle landing gear is designed for high energy absorption qualities.|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} {{controversy}} when the F.I.A. made last minute rules changes concerning the <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> and windscreens on the Grand Touring (GT) cars. The FIA ruled that these cars should be racing closer the factory specifications than some actually where. This caused some {{problems for the}} smaller cars like the Oscas.|$|R
5000|$|Buses for busier routes were double-deck, {{while some}} had <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> for {{carrying}} mail bags. For tourist excursions, vehicles - known as [...] "Jersey Cars" [...] - were open, with seats arranged in tiers so that passengers {{sitting at the}} back could see {{over the heads of}} those in front. More familiar coach types were introduced later and were used on excursions and long-distance [...] "Land Cruises".|$|R
50|$|In 1946, DeSoto marketed the Suburban as {{a station}} wagon, {{but it was}} an {{extended}} sedan with a trunk lid that was hinged below the rear window. The model was promoted as offering station wagon utility with the passenger and <b>luggage</b> <b>compartments</b> in one large section with an 8 ft reasonably flat floor and equipped with folding rear seats to provide flexibility similar to hatchbacks.|$|R
