Chevrolet require all engines to survive 200 hours at full load. The Cosworth lasted over 500 hours. For a clutch burst test, Cale Wade revved the engine to 9,400 rpm under its own power without damage to clutch or engine. Three cars, in three different configurations, resumed mileage accumulation in September 1974.|$|E
40|$|The modern mass {{produced}} automobile is {{a remarkable}} device, much more reliable, safe and comfortable than the cars of the past. Almost every user is aware that electrification, use of computer chips and <b>lead-free</b> <b>fuel</b> have played their parts {{in the development of}} the modern automobile, but relatively few are aware that the body of the car has likewise been changed by modern developments. What is under the paint is mostly metal, but of what kind is it? This article traces the history of the motor car body from the time when space frame technology allowed many automobile manufacturers to coexist to the present day when the all-welded uni-body is dominant and there are significantly fewer car companies. Weight saving is a continuing theme in the article, and such is the competitive pressure for lighter, stronger and safer vehicles that none of the materials used in a car body have been in existence for more than 15 years. The article considers the competing claims of plastics, aluminum and steel, and concludes that the material under the paint of a modern automobile is most likely to be steel, a situation which is unlikely to change in the near future. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The engine is prone to vibration, which is damped by large rubber engine mounts. The 1972 Rochester DualJet two-barrel carburetor required an air pump for emission certification and was replaced in 1973 with a Holley-built 5210C progressive two-barrel carburetor. The 1973 emission control revisions reduced power from the optional engine by , and its noise levels were lowered. A high energy ignition was introduced on 1975 engines.|$|R
5000|$|Rover made {{an attempt}} {{to break into the}} North American market with the P6, {{beginning}} with the Rover 2000 TC. One version of the P6 that was exported was the NADA (North American Dollar Area) model, equipped to a higher standard than UK cars. These are also often referred to today as being [...] "Federal Specification". Notable differences outside the car were wraparound bumpers, three air scoops {{on the top of the}} bonnet, front and rear wing reflectors and the [...] "Icelert" [...] on the front grill. The [...] "Icelert" [...] was a sensor which warned the driver of falling outside temperatures and the possibility of ice forming on the road. Inside, depending on the location, the US 3500S was also equipped with electric windows, power steering and air conditioning, all of which are extremely unusual in UK market P6 cars. The NADA P6 introduced features which would later appear on the UK Mark II car including a new instrument cluster and seat piping. Despite being badged as [...] "3500S" [...] cars, the export models were all fitted with the Borg Warner 35 automatic transmission. The cars were not popular with American buyers, but were sold in Europe instead as they were already converted to left-hand drive. In true British Leyland fashion, several UK cars also ended up with single scoops on their bonnets in {{an attempt to}} use up the surplus parts from the now defunct export models. Rover discontinued selling the P6 in North America in 1971: in that year the US had taken fewer than 1,500 Rovers. The company told their US dealers that modifying their cars to meet new US federal safety and pollution requirements would be prohibitively expensive, while experience elsewhere suggests that the Rover four-cylinder engine was particularly hard to adapt for reduced octane <b>lead-free</b> <b>fuels</b> without an unacceptable reduction in the car's performance.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. The {{water quality}} of {{stormwater}} runoff from various road surfaces in Durban, KwaZulu- Natal was characterised by monitoring programmes established at four study areas. The investigation focussed on obtaining representative stormwater samples {{in order to}} quantitatively identify pollutant constituents transported within stormwater runoff from road surfaces during rainfall events. Stormwater runoff is {{a leading cause of}} degradation in the water quality of receiving water bodies. A review of sampling methods and equipment, informed by the objectives and resources of this investigation, resulted {{in the development of a}} stormwater runoff sampler. An economical flow weighted composite sampler was designed, developed and tested. The sampler produces one representative composite event mean concentration sample. Controlled laboratory experiments, computer simulations and field tests were conducted in order to test and calibrate the sampler. The product of the event mean concentration and total runoff volume estimated provide an estimation of the total pollutant loading from a particular drainage area. Twenty stormwater runoff event mean concentration (EMC) and atmospheric deposition samples were collected over an eighteen month period. The characterisation of stormwater runoff for this investigation included heavy metals, oxygen demanding substances, sediments and physico-chemical analysis for pH, conductivity and water hardness. Chemical analysis indicates that the pollutant levels of constituents sometimes exceeded EMCs reported internationally. The majority of contaminant EMCs exceeded the South African wastewater discharge general and special limits. The results also indicate a 60 % reduction in lead (Pb) levels since the introduction of <b>lead-free</b> <b>fuel</b> in South Africa in January 2006. The findings from this investigation will provide decision-makers with an improved local data base for estimating the impacts of road transportation systems on water quality. A comparison between the four study areas also provides guidance concerning the variability of stormwater quality from different road surfaces and usage patterns...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe city of Johannesburg in South Africa {{was founded}} in 1886 after thediscovery of the rich gold {{deposits}} of Witwatersrand Basin. Most of the miningactivity stopped {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the city more than a decade ago, andaround 200 mine tailing dumps, some as tall as 50 m, are still exposed in themetropolis. Some of them are now reprocessed because of the considerableimprovements in the extractive metallurgy of gold. Although <b>lead-free</b> <b>fuel</b> isavailable in South Africa, leaded gasoline still holds 80 % market share. Automotive exhaust gases are thus an important contributor to lead in theatmosphere. Many other sources may be involved, such as widely-used domesticcoal burning, dust from unpaved road in poor townships, and surface miningoperations. Consequently, in historically Black residential suburbs adjacent tomining areas, heavy metals associated to dust emissions from dumps and miningextraction can be added to those emitted by other human activities and mayenhance the breathable pollution risk level for populations living nearby. On the basis of elemental and lead isotopic analyses of gasoline, coals,mine dumps, and about thirty epiphytic lichen samples, we attempted to assessthe origin of lead in Johannesburg’s atmosphere. Isotopic compositions ofpotential sources are highly contrasted with 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios ranging from 1. 06 to about 2. 9, and 208 Pb/ 206 Pb between 0. 6 and 2. 20. Such a wide range is veryrarely encountered because uranium-rich sources like mine dumps areinfrequently involved in the surface cycle of lead. In our case, this specificityconsiderably extends the discrimination power of the isotopic method, especiallywhen the isotopic information is combined with elemental concentrationsexpressed as La/Pb ratios. It appears that the normalization procedure of metalconcentrations to lanthanum is necessary because the sole absolute elementalconcentrations in lichens did not bring useful information on atmosphericdeposition. Lead associated with dusts transported by winds from the numerousmine sites is recorded in small amount in the immediate vicinity of the dumps,but becomes quickly insignificant just a few kilometres away. Lead associatedwith domestic coal burning fly ash could never be clearly identified probablybecause of its low contribution. Throughout the city, all of these sources areobliterated by leaded antiknock compounds which are added to the gasoline,constituting the main source of lead emissions in Johannesburg’s atmosphere...|$|E

The [...] "Amoco" [...] lead-free gasoline was sold at American's stations in the eastern and southern U.S. alongside American Regular gasoline, which was a leaded <b>fuel.</b> <b>Lead-free</b> Amoco {{was introduced in the}} Indiana Standard marketing area in 1970. The Red Crown Regular and White Crown Premium (later Gold Crown Super Premium) gasolines marketed by parent company Standard Oil (Indiana) in its prime marketing area in the Midwest before 1961 also contained lead.|$|R
