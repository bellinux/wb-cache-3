40|$|This paper {{introduces}} NASA's Integrated Demand Management (IDM) {{concept and}} {{presents the results}} from an early proof-of-concept evaluation and an exploratory experiment. An initial development of the concept was focused on integrating two systems - i. e. the FAA's newly deployed Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) tool called the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP) and the Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) system with Extended Metering (XM) capabilities to manage projected heavy traffic demand into a capacity-constrained airport. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation experiment was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the initial development of the concept by adapting it to an arrival traffic problem at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) during clear weather conditions. In this study, the CTOP was utilized to strategically plan the arrival traffic demand by controlling take-off times of both short- and long-haul flights (long-hauls specify aircraft outside TBFM regions and short-hauls specify aircraft within TBFM regions) {{in a way that}} results in equitable delays among the groups. Such strategic planning allows less airborne delay to occur within TBFM by feeding manageable <b>long-haul</b> <b>traffic</b> demand while reserving sufficient slots in the overhead streams for the short-haul departures. The manageable traffic demand indicates the TBFM scheduler assigns no more airborne delay than its assigned airspace is capable of absorbing. TBFM then uses its time-based metering capabilities to deliver the desirable throughput by tactically rescheduling the TBFM entered long-haul flights and short-haul departures. Additional research was also performed to explore use of Required Time of Arrival (RTA) capabilities as a potential control mechanism for the airborne flights to improve arrival traffic delivery accuracy of scheduled <b>long-haul</b> <b>traffic</b> demand. The study results show that both short- and long-haul flights received similar ground delays. In addition, there was a noticeable reduction in the total amount of excessive unanticipated last-minute ground delays, i. e. delays that are frequently imposed on the short-haul flight in current day operations due to saturation in the overhead stream, commonly referred to as 'double penalty'. Furthermore, the concept achieved the target throughput while minimizing the expected cost associated with overall delays in arrival traffic. Assessment of the RTA capabilities showed that there was indeed improvement of the scheduled entry times into TBFM regions by using RTA capabilities. However, with respect to reduction in delays incurred within TBFM, there was no observable benefit of improving the precision of long-haul flights entry times...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a brief {{excursion}} into the comparative history {{of competition in}} the railroad industries of the United States and Britain. It starts from the observation that {{when faced with the}} unprecedented dynamics and costs of duopolistic and oligopolistic competition, railroad leaders in both countries searched for stability. The response in America appears to have moved from informal cooperation to pools and finally, once these had failed, to large-scale consolidations. In Britain the response and outcome were somewhat different. Having sought stability through pools, rates agreements, leases, working agreements, and corporate investment, and having found these wanting in certain respects, railway leaders were unable, for political reasons, to contemplate mergers. In any case market conditions in Britain set a close boundary on the operating economies that were achievable through cooperation. The major factors here were coastal shipping competition, especially for <b>long-haul</b> <b>traffic</b> after 1870 when sea freight rates fell, and a high level of dependency on small traders who offered small, often short-haul consignments. There were, however, a number of similarities. For example, in both countries pooling agreements could not readily contain or accommodate changes ' in the shares of traffic carried by the partners. And in both countries there were legal and political problems, although their character and impact on the railroads differed significantly...|$|E
40|$|Ever-growing {{demand for}} speed and {{bandwidth}} coupled with increasing energy consumption in current networks are driving {{the need for}} intelligent, next-generation networking architectures that can overcome fundamental spectral and energy limitations. Metro-only internet traffic in particular is experiencing unprecedented growth rates and increasing {{twice as fast as}} <b>long-haul</b> <b>traffic.</b> The current quasi-static peak capacity pro- visioned network is ill-equipped to support this rise of unpredictable, high bandwidth but short-duration traffic flows. A promising solution to address the emerging networking challenges is agile optical networking. Agile optical networking leverages novel photonic devices and multi-layer switching capabilities along with network awareness and intelligence to allocate re- sources in accordance to changing traffic demands and network conditions. However, network agility requires changing the wavelength configuration in the optical layer in real-time to match the traffic demands. Rapidly changing the wavelength loading conditions in optical amplifiers result in debilitating power fluctuations that propagate through the network and can lead to network instability, a problem that is avoided in current networks by using long reconfiguration times encompassing many small adjustments. An agile optical network, once successfully implemented, will be characterized by unpredictable transmission impairments. Power levels along any path in an agile network is constantly fluctuating due to the continuously changing wavelength configuration; consequently, power dependent transmission impairments are also constantly fluctuating. Real-time knowledge {{of the state of the}} physical layer is thus critical for managing signal quality and reliability in an agile optical network, requiring the development of cost-effective, energy-efficient monitoring solutions that can support advanced modulation formats. This dissertation focuses on developing solutions for the two key requirements for a stable agile optical network. Techniques that allow wavelength reconguration on the order of seconds while maintaining stable network operation and minimal data loss are presented. Functionality of an existing advanced optical performance monitor is extended to include autonomous monitoring of both single and multiple channel systems, so that it can be used in agile optical network for real-time introspection of the physical layer...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 28 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 6 - 9 July 2009 "Sustainable Transport", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Modern transport systems are essential to exploit expanding agricultural, commercial and mining activities for the public good. Railway development and road improvements have gone hand in hand. During the 19 th and early 20 th century, railways expanded rapidly to provide low cost transport over great distances and to handle high traffic volumes over busy corridors and arterial routes. Roads were at first merely feeders to railways, expediting the collection and delivery of goods. As motor vehicle technology and road construction techniques improved in the 1920 's the road became {{an alternative to the}} railway which came under increasing competitive pressure, particularly in the matter of lighter traffic density rural branch lines. Railway administrators in South Africa tended to view these lines in isolation, often ignoring their value in generating main line traffic. Because of this a programme of branch line closures began in the 1980 's which led to an accelerated growth in road transport, not only in urban and rural areas but later for <b>long-haul</b> arterial <b>traffic</b> as well. But at what cost? This study investigates 'external' costs which are recognised as an important consideration in determining full transport costs of the overland transport modes. Unfortunately, many studies which have been undertaken during the last 20 or more years have approached the issues from different perspectives with varying methodologies and objectives. This has led to conclusions being expressed which have often been incomparable and misleading. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{relationships between}} cities, {{and more specifically}} the largest Texas cities, and the global economy. Data on headquarters location and corporation sales over a 20 -year period (1984 - 2004) supported the hypothesis that globalization is not homogeneous, regular or unidirectional, but actually showed contrasted phases. Texas cities have been raising in global rankings, due to corporate relocations and, to lesser extent, the growth of local activities. By year 2004, Dallas and Houston ranked among the top- 20 headquarters cities measured by corporation sales The Texas Urban Triangle {{had one of the}} major global concentrations of oil- and computer-related corporation headquarters; conversely, key sectors like banking, insurance and automotive were not significant. Standardized employment data in major U. S. metropolitan areas was examined through principal components analyses. Overall, larger places showed higher degrees of diversity, and no trend toward economic convergence. The TUT also presented a degree of intra-regional diversity comparable to other urban regions. Findings confirmed the relevance of oil- and information-related activities, along with construction, and weakness of activities linked to finance and corporate management. Traffic and air linkages in Texas cities were contrasted to other American gateways. Dallas and Houston have been major nodes in global air transportation, with very important roles as transit hubs for domestic (the former) and short international (the latter) flights. For <b>long-haul</b> international <b>traffic</b> both cities were second-level American gateways, with Houston mobilizing better connected to Western Europe and Mesoamerica, and Dallas to South America and East Asia. Dallas central location strengthened its role in the domestic market, as the center of one of the five major subsystems in the country and a top gateway in enplanements, number of linkages and connectivity measures. The Texas air travel network hierarchical organization was relatively unbalanced, with two strong nodes at the top, three little-relevant middle nodes, and several very poorly interconnected gateways at the bottom. Finally, the high supply of regional flights between primary destinations, namely Dallas and Houston, resulted in significant effects of time-space convergence.

Almost all of world’s <b>long-haul</b> internet <b>traffic</b> is carried by these optical backbone networks. Despite {{the fact that the}} internet bubble ended in the early 2000 s, its traffic has been constantly increasing at an astounding rate of 75 % per year. In addition to that, new emerging video-centric applications such as IPTV will continue to increase the demand on the underlying optical backbone networks. As a result, ten to twenty years from now, optical networks will have to carry vastly increased amounts of data. However, recent research shows that fundamental limits in optical backbone networks are being approached. These limits are imposed by noise generated from inline amplifiers used to boost up the signal and the intrinsic nonlinearity of conventional standard single mode fiber (S-SMF). In order to meet long-term needs and challenges, therefore, research in wideband optical subsystems enabling high capacity long-haul transmission must be urgently pursued. One approach to break through the current capacity limit is a combination of using advanced modulation formats like coherent optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CO-OFDM) and fiber nonlinearity mitigation techniques. In OFDM, the orthogonal property of the sub-carriers allows formation of an almost rectangular spectrum, which increases spectral efficiency. However, at the high powers required for higher order modulation formats, the nonlinearity in the fiber causes nonlinear mixing between the subcarriers, restricting the maximum allowable power below nonlinear threshold, and hence constraining the total capacity and distance. The PhD thesis proposed using mid-span spectral inversion (MSSI) that uses optical phase conjugation (OPC) module to mitigate the fiber nonlinearity in CO-OFDM systems. Using MSSI, the spectrum of the first-half of the link (from the Tx to the OPC module) will be inverted by Four-Wave Mixing (FWM) of the OFDM signal with a pump wave. The spectrally inverted signal is then selected to pass through {{the second half of the}} link. Because the signal is spectrally inverted, the second half of the link should undo the dispersion and nonlinearity of the first half of the link. During the project, a detailed analytical formalism to describe the performance of the OPC module has been developed. This aids the design and improvement of fundamental performance of OPC module. The first experimental demonstration of using MSSI in a coherent system has been made using dual polarization CO-OFDM systems carrying 1. 21 -Tb/s over 800 km. A design outline for optimum performance using MSSI has been developed. Two novel methods for improving the fundamental performance of MSSI have been proposed. The first method splits the nonlinear element into two parts, inserting a notch filter to remove the pump and then reinserting the pump into the second part of the nonlinear element. The second method uses a phase shift filter between the two nonlinear elements, to improve robustness in practical implementation. Both methods offer 1 dB of maximum signal quality improvement in a 10 × 80 -km 4 -QAM 224 -Gb/s CO-OFDM system. In summary, this work has demonstrated by simulation and experiments that MSSI offers benefits to coherent optical systems, including OFDM systems. It has developed analytical formalisms that identify the performance-limiting mechanisms in optical phase conjugators based on third order nonlinearity, and has introduced two methods of mitigating these mechanisms. MSSI fell from favour in the mid- 2000 s due to its complexity. However, after this successful demonstration of fiber nonlinearity compensation using MSSI in a coherent system, MSSI has now drawn considerable attention recently. Subsequently, there have been demonstrations of Raman-enhanced MSSI and multiple phase-conjugations based coherent systems at the 2014 conference on Optical Fiber Communications (OFC) ...|$|R
5000|$|Plans to {{drop the}} night service were {{articulated}} in 1903, but discarded. However, the poor timing for passengers from Drammen and Vestfold, in addition to surplus cost of keeping sleeping cars, forced the night service to a halt from 1918. Instead a late evening service was run, terminating at Brevik at 01:25. To secure compatibility with the Bratsberg Line, which had been opened in 1917, the section of track past Grenland to Eidanger and onwards to Brevik was converted to standard gauge in 1921. When it opened on 16 June it succeeded a period of four years where the segment from Eidanger to Skien had dual gauge. From the same year the Oslo service was re-routed via the Bratsberg Line and Kongsvinger to Oslo. A spur to the cement factory at Dalen {{was built in the}} early 1920s, but removed again during the late 1940s. In general the local trains to Skien were hauled using a NSB Class 32 steam locomotives, and the express train by NSB Class 30. With the extension of the Sørlandet Line to Kragerø with the 1927 opening of the Kragerø Line, Brevik was no longer the outermost railway station along the southern coast. <b>Long-haul</b> and postal <b>traffic</b> was lost, and by 1934 the coastal ferry service was terminated. In cooperation with commercial interests, NSB ran a summer service from Kongsberg marketed as the [...] "bathing train" [...] to attract inlanders to the coast. Patronship peaked in 1920, when 362,384 passengers traveled on the line. Initially the freight traffic was minimal, with between three and four thousand tonnes in the early 1920. This was soon boosted and hit 25,000 tonnes in the 1930s. A halt at Ørvik opened on 26 June 1923 and on 27 July 1933 halts were opened at Prestealléen, Mule, Valen and Dalen. A spur to Heistad Fabrikker opened in 1936. The Brevik Line opened with electric traction from 19 June 1949, along with the Bratsberg Line through Grenland. Thus electric trains from Oslo could reach Brevik via that route. The Vestfold Line would not be electrified until the mid-1950s. With the electrification the line saw a major increase in traffic—by 1951 there were eighteen round trips and nineteen from 1957, operating at a fixed, hourly headway. Following the 1962 opening of the Brevik Bridge the railway saw a sharp decline in patronage as the bus service was rerouted, capturing more of the traffic. Thus NSB decided to terminate the commuter trains to Skien from 1 February 1964. The express trains followed suit and since 26 May 1968 there has only been freight trains on the line. A spur line to Isola Fabrikker opened on 1966 and a new spur line to the cement factory opened on 30 September 1974, replacing an aerial tramway. Norcem has since been the main customer for freight trains on the line, with 900,000 tonnes of limestone hauled in 1998. Proposals for reopening the line were launched in 1989, but never materialized. Grenland Harbour upgraded the port terminal at Tangen during the late 1980s and a branch to the Grenland Terminal was opened in 1993, with the port authority hoping that an international ferry service would be started. However, the plans never materialized. Two El 13 locomotives collided at Norcem on 18 September 1998, although neither motorman was seriously injured. CargoNet started a weekly container train service each from Brevik to Oslo and Bergen in 2014, allowing for transit from ship traffic.|$|R
