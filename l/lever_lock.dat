2500|$|DA/SA pistols are {{versatile}} mechanisms. These firearms {{generally have}} a manual safety that additionally {{may serve to}} decock the hammer. Some have a facility (generally a lever or button) to safely lower the hammer. As a disadvantage, these controls are often intermingled with other controls such as slide releases, magazine releases, take-down levers, takedown <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> buttons, loaded chamber indicators, barrel tip-up levers, etc. [...] These variables become confusing and require more complicated manuals-of-arms. One other disadvantage {{is the difference between}} the first double-action pull and subsequent single-action pulls.|$|E

50|$|A 3 <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> is {{a common}} type of <b>lever</b> <b>lock,</b> but is {{generally}} used for low security applications such as internal doors as their tolerances are much lower (there are fewer combinations of key available, so {{they are likely to}} unlock doors they shouldn't).|$|E
50|$|<b>Lever</b> <b>locks</b> {{are more}} {{commonly}} found in Argentina, the United Kingdom and parts around Scandinavia.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lever</b> tumbler <b>lock</b> uses {{a set of}} levers {{to prevent}} the bolt from moving in the lock. In its {{simplest}} form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past. <b>Lever</b> <b>locks</b> are commonly recessed inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks.|$|R

50|$|Interviews from Merpati {{officials}} {{revealed that}} the first two aircraft had several problems on the Power <b>Lever</b> <b>Lock</b> System, whereas the automatic power <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> system sometimes failed to open after landing. In May 2008, the board of instructors had agreed to revise the Normal Checklist that the Power Lock system selects to “OPEN” before landing. However, further analysis {{revealed that the}}re were no faults in the engines.|$|E
50|$|The Chubb Detector Lock is a {{variation}} of the <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> which was designed to detect and prevent picking attempts.|$|E
50|$|Power frames have {{miniature}} levers {{and control}} the signals and points electrically. In some cases, the interlocking was still done mechanically, but in others, electric <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> were used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lever</b> <b>locks</b> {{generally}} use a bitted key. Some locks used on safes use a double-bitted key, as do some {{door locks}} {{of a type}} often used in Southern and Eastern Europe.|$|R

50|$|In US English usage, 'skeleton key' is also {{occasionally}} used to mean {{a standard}} <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> key. It is sometimes misapplied to refer to any antique key.|$|E
50|$|A <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> {{is made up}} of a set of 'levers' (typically {{between two}} and five) which are raised to {{different}} heights by the key when it is turned. Once all the levers have been moved to the correct height, the locking bolt is free to slide across and secure the door. The teeth or bittings of the key have flat tops rather than being pointed. <b>Lever</b> <b>lock</b> keys tend to be bigger and less convenient for carrying, although lever locks are considered to be harder to pick and so are recommended by most insurance companies.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{security}} <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> (such as the 5 lever) {{usually have}} notches {{cut into the}} levers. These catch the locking bolt and prevent it from moving if picking is attempted (similar to the security pins in a pin tumbler lock).|$|R
50|$|<b>Lever</b> <b>locks</b> can be drilled, {{but usually}} a {{template}} or stencil {{is required to}} mark the drilling point, as the lock mechanism is commonly mortised into the door {{and so it is}} harder to determine the point at which to drill.|$|R
5000|$|A magnetic-coded lock is a lock {{device that}} uses pins in {{combination}} with magnets to prevent entry by either non-matching keys by teething or magnetic polarity. Magnetic-coded locks encompass knob <b>locks,</b> cylinder <b>locks,</b> <b>lever</b> <b>locks,</b> and deadbolt locks as well as applications in other security devices.|$|R
50|$|When {{the correct}} key is inserted, it will clear the wards and rotate about the center post. The key may then strike a lever, {{activating}} a latch or sliding bolt, {{or it may}} itself push against the latch or bolt. In a double acting <b>lever</b> <b>lock,</b> the key may additionally push against a spring-loaded lever which holds the sliding bolt in place.|$|E
50|$|Smith & Wesson {{restraints}} are, {{depending on}} the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and double locks to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different double locking systems: the characteristic slot lock {{as well as a}} push pin lock or their newly patented M&P <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Noticed by the {{abnormal}} {{situation on}} the thrust lever, investigators then examined it. The power levers should have prevented to move from flight idle to ground idle during flight by the function of Electric Magnetic Lock Systems and Mechanical Power Lever Stop Slot. At the accident aircraft {{was found that the}} electric magnetic lock system (Power <b>Lever</b> <b>lock)</b> was on open position. With power <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> on open position, the solenoid of the electric magnetic lock system disengage and allow the power lever moves to ground idle in flight whenever the mechanical power lever stop slots lifted. Based on simulator test conducted by the NTSC, if the engine entered this condition, the aircraft would lose lift and eventually descended rapidly. The movement of power lever to ground idle will result to the propeller pitch angle changes to low pitch angle which produces significant drag. The NTSC stated that because it happened on 112 ft, it was impossible to not crash.|$|E
50|$|The lever frame {{contains}} interlocking {{designed to}} ensure that the levers cannot be operated to create a conflicting train movement. Each interlocking installation is individual and unique to the location controlled. The interlocking may be achieved mechanically or by electric <b>lever</b> <b>locks,</b> or (more usually) a combination of both.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} levers may vary, but is usually an odd number for a lock {{that can be}} opened from {{each side of the}} door in order to provide symmetry. A minimum number of levers may be {{specified}} to provide an anticipated level of security (see 5 <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> section).|$|R
50|$|The lever frame {{principle}} of operation was perpetuated {{in the earliest}} power signalling installations. Since the signals and points worked electrically, no mechanical effort was needed to move the levers, which could therefore be miniaturised. In some cases, the interlocking was still done mechanically, but in others, electric <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> were used.|$|R
5000|$|The Everitt was an American {{automobile}} manufactured from 1909 until 1912. Produced by Everitt (he {{sold his}} former B F Everitt auto body manufacturing business to Walter Briggs {{and it became}} Briggs Manufacturing Company) and Metzger after Studebaker took over the E-M-F Company, it was a 30 hp four with a so-called [...] "thiefproof" [...] gear <b>lever</b> <b>lock.</b> It was also built in Canada as the Tudhope.|$|E
50|$|The lever tumbler lock, {{which uses}} a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock, was perfected by Robert Barron in 1778. His double acting <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> {{required}} the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still currently used today.|$|E
50|$|These keys {{were common}} in both {{cabinetry}} and door locks in early Colonial America and remained in common usage within the United States through the 1940s, giving way after World War II to the pin tumbler lock. Most keys {{of this type}} and their locks were formed of brass, although pewter was sometimes used. They were commonly available at hardware and other stores. Today, <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> keys are associated with fine cabinetry.|$|E
5000|$|For 2011, Proto {{ended the}} Proto Matrix Rail series {{and made the}} Reflex Rail and the Rail to take over. The Reflex Rail is the higher quality of the two and {{functions}} similar to the other PMRs, but had a minor overhauling changing the milling, adding a rubber [...] "contact" [...] pad {{in front of the}} gun, simplifying the bolt system, adding a <b>lever</b> <b>locking</b> feedneck, and replacing the eye covers with an eye pipe. The Rail is the cheaper of the two and is similar to a Smart Parts Ion in terms of operation, but has an almost identical bolt to the Reflex Rail. The Rail also has an eye pipe, but does not have a <b>lever</b> <b>locking</b> feedneck, on off airport, and has a composite ultralite frame as opposed to the aluminum ultralite frame on the Reflex.|$|R

5000|$|A 5 <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> {{is often}} {{required}} for home insurance and often {{recommended by the}} police for home security. There are various grades but the current British Standard (BS3621:2007) is usually required for insurance purposes. Valerie Olifent notes that [...] "The doors of many historic churches still carry an old wooden lock although often you find that a modern 5-lever mortice lock has been installed alongside it to meet insurance requirements." [...] BS3621:2007 requires a bolt throw of 20 mm rather than the 14 mm of the earlier British Standard.|$|E
50|$|The warded lock {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} lock designs which can be found as far back as ancient China and Rome. During the Middle Ages they were used prolifically on monasteries where, because money and time were not issues, their {{complexity}} grew. Warded locks are still in use today in the UK and Ireland for low security applications, and on heritage sites such as ancient monuments and churches to preserve original features, with primary security being provided by other means such as a <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism installed alongside.|$|E
50|$|Mortise locks have historically, {{and still}} {{commonly}} do, use <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> as a mechanism. Older locks {{may have used}} warded locks. This {{has led to a}} popular confusion between the two; the term 'mortice lock' is widely known and used, but usually in reference to lever keys. In recent years the Euro cylinder lock has become common, using a pin tumbler lock in a mortice housing.|$|R
