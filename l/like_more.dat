5|$|Tyrannosaurids walked {{exclusively}} on their hindlimbs, so their leg bones were massive. In {{contrast to the}} forelimbs, the hindlimbs were longer compared to body size {{than almost any other}} theropods. Juveniles and even some smaller adults, <b>like</b> <b>more</b> basal tyrannosauroids, had longer tibiae than femora, a characteristic of fast-running dinosaurs like ornithomimids. Larger adults had leg proportions characteristic of slower-moving animals, but not to the extent seen in other large theropods like abelisaurids or carnosaurs. The third metatarsals of tyrannosaurids were pinched between the second and fourth metatarsals, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds <b>like</b> <b>more</b> of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

The advantages of purchasing a dacha in a village usually are lower costs, greater land area, and larger distances between houses. The disadvantages may include lower-quality utilities, less security, and typically a farther distance to travel.|$|E

25|$|Horney {{looked at}} {{neurosis}} {{in a different}} light from other psychoanalysts of the time. Her expansive interest in the subject led her to compile a detailed theory of neurosis, with data from her patients. Horney believed neurosis to be a continuous process—with neuroses commonly occurring sporadically in one's lifetime. This was in contrast to the opinions of her contemporaries who believed neurosis was, <b>like</b> <b>more</b> severe mental conditions, a negative malfunction of the mind in response to external stimuli, such as bereavement, divorce or negative experiences during childhood and adolescence.|$|E

25|$|The pink {{sandstone}} {{sculptures of}} Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) {{to reach a}} very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in Afghanistan, in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art {{that the world is}} now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.

25|$|The player may pick a faction to play as, {{and then}} engages in turn-based combat {{with the other}} A.I.-controlled factions.

They may only {{be made on the}} main battlefield overview screen, and, like provincial reinforcements, cost planetary requisition, a resource gained on a per-turn basis based on how many provinces the player controls. Honour guard units transfer over provinces and may be used repeatedly.

The Library No.I took on installations and inventory of the Library No.IV. In 1926 the Library No.I moved within the school compound into larger rooms equipped with all new library technology of the time, such as a card catalogue on a turning table, movable shelves, book charts etc. An extra children reading room, named 4.Kinderlesehalle, was part of the extended premise. As to the users of her library in 1926 the director of the Library No.I noted that tradespeople and craftspeople formed the bulk of them.|$|E
25|$|Many {{statements}} {{have been}} made concerning the relationship between transsaccadic memory and visual short-term memory. Researchers have noted several similar characteristics between the two systems, leading several to believe that transsaccadic memory is in fact visual short-term memory or a part of visual short-term memory. Transsaccadic memory has a limited capacity of three to four items, a slow decay rate and maskable characteristics. Basically, transsaccadic memory can hold three to four items for each saccade, and the retention of items decays or disappears from consciousness slowly after {{the presentation of the}} stimulus. However, once a mask stimulus, such as a blank screen, is presented immediately after the stimulus, the items retained prior to the mask can be replaced and/or eliminated faster by the mask. All of these factors are typical characteristics of visual short-term memory. The content stored in transsaccadic memory are less-image <b>like,</b> <b>more</b> abstract and are sparse representations of the objects, which is found to be similar to the type of representations in visual short-term memory. Transsaccadic memory is different from visual short-term memory in that it takes into account the changes of the target's location due to the eye moving to new saccades. The information retained between saccades do not take into account positional information very well. Nevertheless, relational and identity information are well retained. Prime and colleagues (2006) hypothesize, transsaccadic memory utilizes egocentric mechanisms, like selective attention, to reduce the visual search of the target and allow for spatial information between saccades to be retained and updated by incorporation of information across saccades.|$|E

40|$|Gender {{stereotypes}} and stereotypes associated with sexual orientation {{have received a}} great deal of research attention, but studies to date have failed to bring together three seemingly connected ideas: likeability, stereotype congruity, and stereotype strength. In order to assess the stereotypes of and attitudes toward gay and straight men, participants rated the likeability of targets whoexhibited either feminine or masculine characteristics. Participants also rated gay men and straight men on a stereotype strength measure, which assessed the extent to which each group was perceived as adhering to or violating their group's stereotypes. Results showed that women <b>liked</b> all targets <b>more</b> than men <b>liked</b> the targets and that women <b>liked</b> gay targets <b>more</b> than men did. Results did not indicate that feminine gay men were <b>liked</b> <b>more</b> than masculine gay men nor did it indicate that masculine straight men were <b>liked</b> <b>more</b> than feminine straight men. Results showed that femininity is a strong component of the gay male stereotype just as masculinity is a strong component of the straight male stereotype.
