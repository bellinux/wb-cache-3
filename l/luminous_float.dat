50|$|Hestavar, the Bright City: a <b>luminous</b> {{metropolis}} which <b>floats</b> above {{sandy beaches}} and crystal-clear lagoons, {{the center of}} astral civilization. Home to Erathis, Ioun and Pelor.|$|R
60|$|On Old Year's Night Maria {{danced to}} please them; raps began, people {{watching}} {{on either side}} of a wall heard the raps on the other side. On 8th January, Mrs. Shchapoff fainted when a large, <b>luminous</b> ball <b>floated,</b> increasing in size, from under her bed. The raps now followed her about by day, {{as in the case of}} John Wesley's sisters. On these occasions she felt weak and somnolent. Finally Mr. Shchapoff carried his family to his town house for much-needed change of air.|$|R
6000|$|He {{returned}} {{in a few}} minutes with a small blue book in his hand, from which he began to read with gusto: [...] "'I saw, as it were, a white <b>luminous</b> ball <b>floating</b> over the floor; then rising straight upward, very rapidly, as though issuing from a trap-door, appeared B. B., born, so to speak, out of the flooring outside the curtain, which had not stirred. He tries, as it seems to me, to come among us, but he has a limping, hesitating gait. At one moment he reels as if about to fall, limping on one leg; then he goes toward the opening of the curtains of the cabinet. Then, without (as I believe) opening the curtains, he sinks down, disappears into the floor.'" ...|$|R
60|$|At last I grew weary. I came to piled {{heaps of}} {{decaying}} seaweed and cart tracks running {{this way and}} that, and then I had missed the road and was stumbling among sand hummocks quite close to the sea. I {{came out on the}} edge of the dimly glittering sandy beach, and something phosphorescent drew me to the water's edge. I bent down and peered at the little <b>luminous</b> specks that <b>floated</b> in the ripples.|$|R
50|$|Unable {{to use a}} steel armature, as in her {{previous}} permanent commissions, a UHMWPE support structure was developed. This resulted in a lightweight, low-impact design which could be temporarily attached to existing architectural structures, and also allowed the sculpture to better respond to the wind. The fluidly moving form of the sculpture contrasts with the rigid architectural surfaces, and at night darkness conceals the support cables while colored lighting creates {{the appearance of a}} <b>floating</b> <b>luminous</b> form.|$|R
60|$|Lawford hesitated at the door, looking rather strangely back. 'No,' he said, 'there are matches upstairs.' He {{shut the}} door after him. The {{darkness}} seemed cold and still as water. He went slowly up, with eyes fixed wide on the <b>floating</b> <b>luminous</b> gloom, and out of memory seemed to gather, as faintly as in the darkness which they had exorcised for him, the strange pitiful eyes of the night before. And as he mounted a chill, terrible, physical peace seemed to steal over him.|$|R
6000|$|Cain. [...] 'Tis {{a fearful}} light! [...] No sun--no moon--no lights innumerable-- [...] The very {{blue of the}} empurpled night [...] Fades to a dreary twilight--yet I see [...] 180 [...] Huge dusky masses; but unlike the worlds [...] We were approaching, which, begirt with light, [...] Seemed full of life even when their {{atmosphere}} [...] Of light gave way, and showed them taking shapes [...] Unequal, of deep valleys and vast mountains; [...] And some emitting sparks, and some displaying [...] Enormous liquid plains, and some begirt [...] With <b>luminous</b> belts, and <b>floating</b> moons, which took, [...] Like them, the features of fair earth:--instead, [...] All here seems dark and dreadful.|$|R
60|$|The spring came bravely, even {{in south}} London, {{and the town}} was filled with magic. I never knew the sumptuous purple of evening till I saw the round arc-lamps fill with light, and roll like golden bubbles along the purple dusk of the high road. Everywhere at night the city {{is filled with the}} magic of lamps: over the river they pour in golden patches their <b>floating</b> <b>luminous</b> oil on the restless darkness; the bright lamps float {{in and out of the}} cavern of London Bridge Station like round shining bees in and out of a black hive; in the suburbs the street lamps glimmer with the {{brightness}} of lemons among the trees. I began to love the town.|$|R
60|$|An inarticulate, unfathomable {{depression}} {{rolled back}} on him, like a mist {{out of the}} sea. He hastily undressed, put watch and door-key and Critchett's powder under his pillow, paused, vacantly ruminated, and then replaced the powder in his waistcoat pocket, said his prayers, and got shivering to bed. He did not feel hurt at Sheila's leaving him like this. So long as she really believed in him. And now--Alice was home. He listened, trying not to shiver, for her voice; and sometimes heard, he fancied, the clear note. It was this beastly influenza that made him feel so cold and lifeless. But all would soon come right--that is, if only that face, <b>luminous</b> against the <b>floating</b> darkness within, would not appear the instant he closed his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even Katie {{stood the}} test. But {{before going into}} that, {{let me tell you}} some of his other experiments. He says (among other amazing things) that he has seen a chair move on its own account, without contact with a medium. He saw Daniel Home--another medium with whom he had sittings--raised by {{invisible}} power completely from the floor of the room. 'Under rigid test condition,' he writes, 'I have seen a solid, self-luminous body the size of an egg float noiselessly about the room!' But wait! I will quote from my notes his exact words." [...] Here I produced my note-book, and read as follows: [...] "'I have seen a <b>luminous</b> cloud <b>floating</b> upward toward a picture. Under the strictest test conditions, I have more than once had a solid, self-luminous, crystalline body placed in my hand by a hand which did not belong to any person in the room. In the light, I have seen a luminous cloud hover over a heliotrope on a side-table, break a sprig off, and carry it to a lady; and on some occasions I have seen a similar luminous cloud condense to the form of a hand and carry small objects about. During a s√©ance in full light, a beautifully formed small hand rose up from an opening in a dining-table and gave me a flower. This occurred in the light in my own room, while I was holding the medium's hands and feet. I have retained one of these perfectly life-like and graceful (spirit) hands in my own, firmly resolved not to let it escape, but it gradually seemed to resolve itself into vapor, and faded in that manner from my grasp.'" ...|$|R
