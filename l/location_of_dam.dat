40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} investigates and {{analyses}} {{the behavior of}} a small concrete gravity dam during the strong ground horizontal motions due to an earthquake with ANSYS 12. The model in thesis is the structure of Dezfool regulatory gravity dam. The height of the spillway is about 10 meters up to elevation of the spillway crest and it is in the class of small dams. The <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>dam</b> is in Iran, North of Khuzestan province, near city of Dezfool. It hasn't ever shakes under the influence of powerful ground motions in the area. Because of lowness and special firmness of the structure it behaves like a solid body, therefore the structure should be compared with many different earthquake accelerations and then the maximum vibration of the body is considerable. After linear dynamic analysis with ANSYS the results show the stresses on the body of the dam are relative to particularity of each earthquake like magnitude, epicenter distance and PGA. The body of Dezfool regularity dam consists of 172 plane 82 elements and It is modeled two dimensional in ANSYS. The procedure of analyses is linear time-history dynamic analysis. The acceleration records of ground motions in the ANSYS dynamic time- history analysis are real records of occurred earthquakes. The other data which are used in ANSYS modeling are approximately unreal and exaggerated and they are used for magnifying the influence of earthquake on the dam's body...|$|E

40|$|Cultural {{resource}} management salvage archaeology {{of the past}} 50 years has resulted in high resolution geographic data concerning the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> housepit archaeological sites. For this study, statistical tests (Quadrat and Spearman Rank Correlation) were completed for the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> 116 housepit archaeological sites in relation to three rapids and three dams along {{a section of the}} Middle Columbia River, stretching approximately 60 miles from the Rock Island Dam at the north end {{to the beginning of the}} Hanford Reach at the south end. Housepit locations were tested against the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> rapids to test for correlation between favorable fishing locations and housepit locations. Housepit locations were also tested against the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>dams</b> to test for correlation between a potential bias in the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> discovered archaeological sites and housepit location. These tests found that housepit sites are significantly clustered, that their locations are correlated to the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> rapids along this section of the Columbia River, and that their locations are not correlated to the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>dam</b> construction. These results are consistent with both previous data and the ethnographic record, supporting the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> housepit village sites near favorable fishing locations...|$|R

40|$|Water {{resource}} management based on dam construction, diversion, and other engineered hydraulic structures improves conditions for humans living in arid and semi-arid areas. However, the effects <b>of</b> <b>damming</b> on fluvial and coastal ecosystems are well-know, {{as it is}} the fact that economic and social development based on water management might enhance the pressure on such environments. This study gives a first basin scale representation of the possible effects of water {{resource management}} on hydrology and water quality of a typical semi-arid watershed/ estuarine system in Northeastern Brazil. Although the dam cascade suggests a hydrological alteration of the stream flow, the upstream <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>dams</b> in the Cocó watershed does not apparently alter the total discharge to the estuary. Water quality threats, such as high fecal coliform levels and low dissolved oxygen indicated that although water management supported extensive economic and social development, it resulted in considerable degradation of aquatic systems if no attention was paid to environmental and sanitary conditions.
