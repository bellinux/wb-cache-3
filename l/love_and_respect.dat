5|$|Lady {{gives birth}} to three puppies, but after two die of unexplained causes, Lady lavishes all her {{attention}} on the surviving pup, Wolf. She later develops distemper and is taken away by the veterinarian, so Lad takes over the raising of his son, solemnly teaching him the Law of the Place. Wolf comes to <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> his father and soon forgets his mother, though Lad continues to search for her daily. A month later, Wolf falls through the ice of the semi-frozen lake, and Lad nearly drowns while saving him. When Lad staggers to shore, he is ecstatically greeted by the recovered Lady.|$|E
5|$|They {{were created}} either as pendants, that is {{conceived}} as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation {{may have been a}} later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> he felt toward them is evident.|$|E

25|$|His {{passion for}} Russian history and butterflies, his genuine scholarship, {{along with his}} <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> for France and its {{political}} systems made him an atypical Romanov. His liberalism did not prevent him from writing to Leo Tolstoy to protest a pamphlet the famous writer was distributing containing what the grand duke considered an unfair and inaccurate criticism of his grandfather Nicholas I. Widely considered an eccentric, he was well regarded by many family members including Empress Maria, who valued his opinions.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 9th century, respect for Saint Martin was {{well-established}} in Ireland. His monastery at Marmoûtiers became the {{training ground for}} many Celtic missions and missionaries. Some believe that St. Patrick was his nephew and that Patrick {{was one of many}} Celtic notables who lived for a time at Marmoûtiers. St. Ninian definitely studied at Marmoûtiers and was profoundly influenced by Martin, carrying a deep <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> for his teacher and his methods back to Scotland. Ninian {{was in the process of}} building a church when news reached him of Martin's death. Ninian dedicated that church to Martin.|$|E
25|$|The Puja {{practice}} is structured {{as an act}} of welcoming, hosting, honoring the deity of one's choice as one's honored guest, and remembering the spiritual and emotional significance the deity represents the devotee. Jan Gonda, as well as Diana L. Eck, states that a typical Puja involves one or more of 16 steps (Shodasha Upachara) traceable to ancient times: the deity is invited as a guest, the devotee hosts and takes care of the deity as an honored guest, praise (hymns) with Dhupa or Aarti along with food (Naivedhya) is offered to the deity, after an expression of <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> the host takes leave, and with affection expresses good bye to the deity. The worship practice may also involve reflecting on spiritual questions, with image serving as support for such meditation.|$|E
25|$|Marcus {{had much}} <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> for his adoptive father. The tribute he gives Pius {{in the first}} book of the Meditations is the longest of any. He would have more {{influence}} on the young Marcus than any other person.From my father: gentleness and unshaken resolution in judgments taken after full examination; no vainglory about external honours; love of work and perseverance; readiness to hear those who had anything {{to contribute to the}} public advantage; the desire to reward every man according to his desert without partiality; the experience that knew where to tighten the reign, where to relax. Prohibition of unnatural practices, social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation, and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; not that he was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lip-service; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers nor with man any courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour, but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search for novelty.|$|E

500|$|While the Concordat {{restored}} {{much power}} to the papacy, the balance of church–state relations had tilted firmly in Napoleon's favour. He selected the bishops and supervised church finances. Napoleon and the pope both found the Concordat useful. Similar arrangements were made with the Church in territories controlled by Napoleon, especially Italy and Germany. Now, Napoleon could win favor with the Catholics while also controlling Rome in a political sense. Napoleon said in April 1801, [...] "Skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests. They can both contain them and use them". French children were issued a catechism that taught them to <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> Napoleon.|$|E
500|$|... "Love On Top" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Beyoncé for her fourth studio album 4 (2011). Inspired from her state of mind while playing Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic Cadillac Records, Beyoncé wrote the song alongside Terius Nash and Shea Taylor; its production was handled by Taylor and Beyoncé. A throw-back to 1980s music, the uptempo R song exhibits style {{similar to that of}} Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston and The Jackson 5, among others. While incorporating four key changes, Beyoncé adopts a high range when repeating the song's chorus {{towards the end of the}} song. She sings about a man whom she can always call, even after facing grief and hard work, finally earning his <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>respect.</b>|$|E

500|$|A {{primary source}} that Blassingame did not consult {{in his study}} was the WPA slave {{interviews}}. While he admits that [...] "slave interviews rival autobiographies in their revelations about the internal dynamics of bondage, ... the heavy editing of the WPA interviews makes them far more difficult to utilize than black autobiographies." [...] He elaborates on his criticism of the interviews in a 1975 article in the Journal of Southern History. He describes how white interviewers often deleted material contrary to the paternalistic image of the antebellum South which they wanted to present. Blassingame concludes, [...] "Uncritical use of the interviews will lead almost inevitably to a simplistic and distorted view of the plantation as a paternalistic institution where the chief feature of life was mutual <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> between masters and slaves." ...|$|E
500|$|A side {{benefit of}} Tchaikovsky's {{friendship}} with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov was an increased {{confidence in his}} own abilities as a composer, along with a willingness to let his musical works stand alongside those of his contemporaries. Tchaikovsky wrote to von Meck in January 1889, after being once again well represented in Belyayev's concerts, that he had [...] "always tried to place myself outside all parties and to show in every way possible that I <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>respect</b> every honorable and gifted public figure in music, whatever his tendency", and that he considered himself [...] "flattered {{to appear on the}} concert platform" [...] beside composers in the Belyayev circle. This was an acknowledgment of wholehearted readiness for his music to be heard with that of these composers, delivered in a tone of implicit confidence that there were no comparisons from which to fear.|$|E
