Pressure from London sugar merchants fearing a decline in sugar prices forced a series of negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less {{than a year after}} Havana was seized, the Peace of Paris was signed by the three warring powers, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for Cuba on France's recommendation to Spain, The French advised that declining the offer could result in Spain losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British.

25|$|The gradual Christianization of the Bulgarian population, {{the fact}} that the service was {{initially}} practiced in Greek, which only the elite knew, resulted in a low level of understanding of the religion among the peasantry. Due to the constant wars during the time of Simeon I, the lands near the Byzantine border (Thrace) were devastated, and the people living there were left without occupation. The constant change of authority over these lands, and the higher taxes during the time of Tsar Peter I, gave birth to a great social discontent {{at the beginning of the}} 10th century.

40|$|Inclusion in {{the labour}} market is one {{key element of}} the UK Home Office refugee {{integration}} strategy. Refugees in the UK are a diverse group and represent multiple occupations and professions. One particular group of interest is refugee doctors. The British Medical Association (BMA) estimates that there are around 2000 refugee doctors in the UK. This highly skilled professional group represents a potentially valuable human resource to the National Health Service (NHS). Indeed, minimal investment is required {{to benefit from the}} considerable medical experience and skills that refugee doctors bring to the UK. Professionally qualified refugees, such as doctors and dentists, nevertheless face a number of obstacles to economic integration. This includes recognition of qualifications, training and employment regulations. For many refugee doctors these hurdles have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> professional <b>disappointment,</b> frustration and humiliation. In recognising and seeking to address such barriers to employment, a number of specific national and local policy initiatives in the UK have been implemented to promote the economic inclusion of refugee doctors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Managing user {{expectations}} of personal robots becomes particularly challenging when the end-user {{just wants to}} know what the robot can do, and neither understands nor cares about its technical specifications. In describing what a robot can do to such an end-user, we explored the questions of (a) whether or not such users would respond to expectation setting about personal robots and, if so, (b) how such expectation setting would influence human-robot interactions and people’s perceptions of the robots. Using a 2 (expectation setting: high vs. low) x 2 (robot type: Pleo vs. AIBO) between-participants experiment (N= 24), we examined these questions. We found that people’s initial beliefs about the robot’s capabilities are indeed influenced by expectation setting tactics. Contrary to the hypotheses predicted by the Self-Fulfilling Prophecy and Confirmation Bias, we found that erring on the side of setting expectations lower rather than higher <b>led</b> <b>to</b> less <b>disappointment</b> and more positive appraisals of the robot’s competence.

50|$|On 28December 1988, Saharanpur {{district}} {{lost the}} region of Haridwar, which {{was made into a}} new district within the Saharanpur division. Subsequently, Haridwar district was taken out of Saharanpur division and merged with what is now Uttarakhand, a new state that was carved out of Uttar Pradesh on 9November 2000. With this territorial reorganisation, Saharanpur lost many important places of religious and cultural heritage, including the city of Roorkee, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>disappointment</b> among the Saharanpur people. Political debate is still simmering on whether parts of Saharanpur, including the city itself, can be merged with Uttarakhand. Another political view is that a new state of Harit Pradesh should be carved out of the present Western Uttar Pradesh region.|$|E
50|$|Aji's {{appointment}} as minister {{of law in}} 1966 was initially viewed as a victory by supporters {{of the rule of}} law; this later <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>disappointment</b> when, after his appointment, he became an opponent of judicial review. While his predecessor as chief justice Subekti had been a champion of judicial independence, Aji aided in the subordination of the supreme court to the executive branch and his successor as minister of law, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja. His exertion of pressure on courts to avoid giving citizens too many rights in tort cases were one factor that led to the establishment of formal administrative courts in the country, though his politics of patronage are still credited with whittling away the judiciary's independence by the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|In 1890 it {{was shown}} that {{resistance}} to diphtheria toxin could be transferred from one animal to another by transfer of serum (1). From this discovery, passive antibody therapy was developed as an effective treatment for infectious diseases and for neutralization of toxins, {{and continues to be}} used to this day. Meanwhile, there have been continued efforts to use antibodies for cancer therapy, starting with the pioneering work of Hericourt and Richet in 1895 (2), which was the forerunner of the "magic bullet" concept. However, all of the early work on tumor therapy <b>led</b> ultimately <b>to</b> <b>disappointment</b> (3). The problems were readily acknowledged, i. e., lack of specificity and reproducibility, lack of purity, and the xenogeneic immune response. Developments over the past 20 years, as described throughout this book, have effectively overcome all of these technical problems, often in very ingenious ways. The difficulty we have now is different. There are just too many potential new antibody-based treatments for them all to be properly evaluated in the clinic. Many will still fail because of factors that are hard to predict from experiments: unexpected toxicity, biological heterogeneity of the target disease, or lack of access to the appropriate tissue...|$|R

6000|$|Yet {{there was}} {{something}} in Marjorie, as in most human beings, that demanded some general idea, some aim, to hold her life together. A girl upon the borders of her set at college was fond of the phrase [...] "living for the moment," [...] and Marjorie associated with it the speaker's lax mouth, sloe-like eyes, soft, quick-flushing, boneless face, and a habit of squawking and bouncing in a forced and graceless manner. Marjorie's natural disposition was to deal with life in a steadier spirit than that. Yet all sorts of powers and forces were at work in her, some exalted, some elvish, some vulgar, some subtle. She felt keenly and desired strongly, and in effect she came perhaps nearer the realization of that offending phrase than its original exponent. She had a clean intensity of feeling that made her delight in a thousand various things, in sunlight and textures, and the vividly quick acts of animals, in landscape, and the beauty of other girls, in wit, and people's voices, and good strong reasoning, and the desire and skill of art. She had a clear, rapid memory that made her excel perhaps a little too easily at school and college, an eagerness of sympathetic interest that won people very quickly and <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>disappointments,</b> and a very strong sense of the primary importance of Miss Marjorie Pope in the world. And when any very definite dream of what she would like to be and what she would like to do, such as being the principal of a ladies' college, or the first woman member of Parliament, or the wife of a barbaric chief in Borneo, or a great explorer, or the wife of a millionaire and a great social leader, or George Sand, or Saint Teresa, had had possession of her imagination for a few weeks, an entirely contrasted and equally attractive dream would presently arise beside it and compete with it and replace it. It wasn't so much that she turned against the old one as that she was attracted by the new, and she forgot the old dream rather than abandoned it, simply because she was only one person, and hadn't therefore the possibility of realizing both.|$|R

5000|$|H.L. Kerr {{explored}} the Larder Lake area in 1904, {{but did not}} find gold. He returned with his partner Bill Addison in 1906, and discovered traces of gold near the north arm of Larder Lake, next to Robert Reddick's claims. Within months, 40 gold mining companies were established, and there was tremendous optimism and financial speculation. A mining investment company published an advertisement in the Ottawa Citizen in 1907 stating: [...] "The Larder Lake district {{is believed to be}} the richest gold country ever known, and it is just now being opened up. Soon will commence the most tremendous outpouring of gold known to civilization." [...] Three-thousand men made their way to the area via canoe and portage to look for work, settling in a camp known as [...] "Larder City". Excitement <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>disappointment,</b> as no large deposits of gold were found, and most of the town was abandoned by 1911. A mine brought into production between 1907 and 1911 was able to produce just $314 worth of gold, though that small output was used to mint Canada's first $5 gold pieces.|$|E
5000|$|Chapter three {{entitled}} From the Moon to Mars: The Search for Extraterrestrial Life. A Carbonaceous Meteorite {{which was}} found in Hungary in 1857, which was examined by Friedrich Wöhler {{was found to have}} organic compounds which he believed were Extraterrestrial in origin. The book moves on to Marcellin Berthelot who in 1864 claimed to have found [...] "petroleum-like hydrocarbons" [...] in a meteorite found near Orgueil. Louis Pasteur also ran experiments on this meteor and concluded it was sterile and not capable of generating life. The discovery of the Murchison meteorite also led to the finding of 70 amino acids most of which are not native to earth's biosphere. The authors look into the work done on samples brought back from the Apollo program missions. Geoffrey Eglinton one of the authors had been given a sample and although he knew there had never been life on the moon they had hoped to find organic compounds. None were found within those samples, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>disappointment.</b> These findings led the authors to speculate on the possibility of answering the question of whether there has ever been life on Mars and if future missions will bring back viable samples for testing.|$|E

The published order of Sullivan's books was, however, deceptive, as his first-written novel, Destiny's End (1988), had suffered delays and modifications {{at the hands of the}} publisher to which it had first been contracted. The book proved to be a complexly moody depiction of humanity at the end of its tether in an array of Dying-Earth venues, as Secret Masters from the stars with quasimagical Technologies manipulate the course of events. Other sf of interest included The Parasite War (1989), which garishly intensifies the premises of V with a few scattered humans engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Aliens who have nearly destroyed the planet; The Martian Viking (1991), in which a prisoner escapes from Mars and roams space and time with stern but rowdy Vikings; and Lords of Creation (1992), which combines palaeontological fantasy including dinosaur eggs and another alien Invasion." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{low quality}} of guns made it {{necessary}} to approach to the game as close as 30 m. For example, poachers in the Salzburg region then were around 30 years old men, not yet married and usually alone on their illegal trade. Hunting {{was used in the}} 18th century as a theatrical demonstration of aristocratic rule of the land and had a strong impact on land use patterns as well. Poaching in so far inferred not only with property rights but clashed symbolically with the power of the nobility. During the years between 1830 and 1848 poaching and poaching related deaths increased in Bavaria. The revolution of 1848 was interpreted as a general allowance for poaching in Bavaria. The reform of hunting law in 1849 reduced legal hunting to rich land owners and the bourgeoisie able to pay the hunting fees and <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>disappointment</b> and ongoing praise of poachers among the people. Some of the frontier region, where smuggling was important, showed especially strong resistance. In 1849, the Bavarian military forces were asked to occupy a number of municipalities on the frontier to Austria. Both, in Wallgau (today a part of Garmisch-Partenkirchen) and in Lackenhäuser, (close to Wegscheid in the Bavarian forest) each household had to feed and accommodate one soldier for a month as part of a military mission to quell the uproar.
