5|$|St Mawes Castle is {{situated}} on a headland over the Carrock Roads, overlooked by higher {{land to the}} rear. At {{the top of the}} site is the entrance to the castle, the high-level gun batteries and the 16th-century Henrician Castle; the terraced site slopes down to the water, where gun batteries and the 16th-century blockhouse <b>look</b> <b>out</b> across the water.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm spotters to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of the {{lighthouse}} {{on a very}} stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E
5|$|Locus 011 and Locus 057 {{may have}} been watchposts, they were {{situated}} at the points where the Quiriguá and the Jubuco rivers entered the Motagua Valley and {{may have been}} used to control passing traffic on these routes. Locus057 was situated {{on one of the most}} probable routes to Copán {{and may have been}} a watchpost to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for enemy warriors after the defeat of Copán by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{the species}} nor the sites have any current legal protection, {{and it could}} be under {{significant}} threat of survival in the long term from inappropriate gardening or care. Seed samples of the Radyr hawkweed have been provided to the Millennium Seed Bank, the international conservation project coordinated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and plants are being carefully cultivated. The plant normally flowers between May and early July and Radyr residents are urged by botanists to be on the <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for further examples of the endangered species while walking in the area.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Spanish Room, {{the library is}} the most {{atmospheric}} of rooms, upon the wall of which are hung the huge keys of the destroyed Corfe Castle, handed back to Mary Bankes after her defence of Corfe Castle during the Civil War. The state bedroom is extremely ornate and has housed such important guests as Kaiser Wilhelm II who stayed with the family for a week in 1907. The main staircase is beautifully carved from stone and features three huge statues which <b>look</b> <b>out</b> onto the gardens from their seats. These depict Sir John Bankes and Lady Bankes, the defenders of Corfe Castle, and their patron, Charles I.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead {{to look after the}} king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E

5|$|Brian Tierney is {{the fourth}} of five sons of James and Claire Tierney. Growing up in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, he {{attended}} Waldron Mercy Academy and later The Episcopal Academy. When he was seven, {{his family moved to}} Springfield Township, Pennsylvania. In 1975, at the age of eighteen, Tierney unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for township commissioner of Springfield. During the campaign supporters of his opponent in the Democratic primary had torn down his campaign posters and stole other campaign items. Tierney became a Republican after the primary when a few Republicans who said they would <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for his stuff during his primary campaign, invited him to a party meeting.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{the river}} by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks <b>look</b> <b>out</b> to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs {{up to the}} main road, which it follows for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too {{dangerous}} and this road must be followed {{most of the way}} from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back {{to the level of the}} railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tides.|$|E
5|$|Jeffries, {{realising}} his {{force was}} suffering heavy casualties, quickly organised a bombing party of fourteen men {{and set about}} outflanking the pillboxes. Accompanying Jeffries was Sergeant James Bruce, a 39-year-old Scottish-born miner {{who had worked for}} Jeffries' father at the Abermain Collieries. According to popular legend, Bruce had promised to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for his boss's son, and remained at Jeffries' side throughout the attack. Working around the position, the party attacked the emplacement from the rear, capturing four machine guns and thirty-five prisoners; thus reviving the advance. Jeffries then led his company forward under heavy artillery and machine gun fire to reach their first objective.|$|E

5|$|The highest hills are Càrnan (273m or 896ft), Hecla (Old Norse: Hooded shroud) (219m or 719ft) and Macphee's Hill (224m or 735ft). The {{last was}} named when a relief ship sent by MacNeil of Barra {{was sent to}} {{discover}} why communications from the island had ceased. A crewman called Macphee was sent ashore and returned to report that the residents had all died of disease. Fearing the plague, his shipmates refused to allow him back on board. He survived for a year, and climbed the hill every day to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for a rescue. When the island was re-settled The MacNeil granted him land there.|$|E
5|$|As {{the story}} begins, {{a woman named}} Emmy Altava is hired to be Professor Layton's {{assistant}} at the fictional Gressenheller University. Upon her introduction to him, he reveals that he is currently heading towards a town named Misthallery. According to a letter allegedly sent by his close friend, Clark Triton, a specter is attacking the village at night. As the pair reach Clark's house, though, they find that the letter was sent not by Clark, but by his son, Luke, who has learned how to predict the specter's attacks and wished to enlist Layton's help in {{putting an end to}} them. Luke sneaks out of his house to join Layton and Emmy's investigation. After they finish exploring Misthallery for the day, they go to spend the night at a local hotel. As they <b>look</b> <b>out</b> from the window in their room, they hear the sound of a flute and see a large, shadowy figure emerge from the mist, which proceeds to forge a path of destruction through the town, including their hotel room, before vanishing without a trace.|$|E
5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, <b>look</b> <b>out</b> over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|Marlene (Merle Dandridge) is {{the leader}} of the Fireflies, a militia {{movement}} hoping to wrest control of the Quarantine Zones from the military. She was tasked by Ellie's mother, a close friend of hers, to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for her daughter, but Ellie only met her after her infection. After being wounded in Boston, she offers to sell Joel and Tess the merchandise Robert stole from them and sold to her in return for smuggling Ellie out of the Quarantine Zone. Joel meets Marlene again at the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City, where scientists are running tests on Ellie. Marlene reveals that they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel disagrees with the operation and fights back. After Joel rescues Ellie, Marlene tries to stop him from leaving, insisting that taking Ellie will merely delay her death until a more gruesome one occurs, and Ellie's return to her would help to create a cure against the infection. Joel disregards her and instead shoots her in the stomach. She begs for her life, but Joel executes her with a shot to the head, ensuring that no-one is left to come after them.|$|E
5|$|Max's {{daughter}} Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) becomes {{angry at}} Max for never mentioning Bradley, leading to his confessing {{that he knows}} Bradley did not kill Archie. Lauren starts to suspect Max as he has become violent towards other people, but he tells her he promised {{to look after the}} real killer, who is no longer a danger. When Lauren sees Stacey dancing with Max, she accuses her of trying flirting with Max, but Stacey says they are just friends and he promised he would always <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for her. Lauren realises that Stacey is the killer and tells Max she knows this. She confronts Stacey, who confesses, and Lauren records it on her mobile phone.

5|$|The next morning, Ashley {{plays on}} the beach and builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered state of consciousness, and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and <b>look</b> <b>out</b> at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E
