She opened the purse and found a suicide note, after which she <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} and saw the body below. The woman reported her findings to the Los Angeles police and laid {{the items on the}} steps of the Hollywood police station.|$|E
25|$|On 18 December, Parma hosted Lecce in a {{match that}} was set {{to be the last}} before Christmas break, but the re-organised Matchday 1 game was now to be played during the week that followed. Jonathan Biabiany's 18th minute run into the box was halted unfairly by the Lecce defence, leading to a chance from the spot for Sergio Floccari who duly {{converted}} to bag his first goal for the club. Just before the hour mark, David Di Michele scored from short range to level the scores, before scoring a magnificent second with a spectacular bicycle kick {{from the edge of the}} penalty area three minutes later. Juan Cuadrado then scored Lecce's third with 13 minutes left in the game with a fine left-footed effort blasted past Antonio Mirante, who was making his 200th professional appearance, as Parma <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> barrel at another game without a win. A goalkeeping error three minutes from full-time allowed Graziano Pellè to reduce the deficit, his first goal for the club. Deep into injury time, the ball fell to Daniele Galloppa following a poorly cleared corner and he rifled it him to salvage a third consecutive draw for the Ducali.|$|E

2500|$|Legend says in {{the early}} 16th century, the local Osage Indians were on a bear hunt, chasing two black bears along the White River until one went up a tree for safety. But a well placed arrow took it out. [...] They {{continued}} to chase the other bear up Roark Mountain, and the bear fell onto a ledge in the sinkhole. The hunting party didn't want to all jump down to kill the bear and have to drag it back up so, a brave young tribe member climbed down to the ledge with his hunting dog and knife. He stabbed the bear and the bear lunged back. The bear, dog and the boy fell through the sinkhole landing in the Cathedral Room. The Indians then <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hole and saw nothing. They heard strange sounds; echoing sounds of their voices, bats flying around, water trickling and they felt warm air, all of which made them {{think it was an}} evil place. The Indians thought they had found the entrance to Hades and named the cave the Devil's Den. [...] They marked trees around the Devil's Den with their danger sign (a sideways V), and never returned.|$|E
2500|$|Late in {{the first}} day, when [...] was {{finishing}} his first journey across the sky, one of the hermaphrodite twins, , stopped breathing. [...] Afraid, the people left her alone. [...] In the morning, the Coyote named First Angry and the people went to find the twin, but [...] was gone. [...] One man <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> reed into the Third World, and there he saw [...] sitting {{by the side of}} the river combing her hair. [...] He called to his friend, and he looked and also saw her. [...] The people asked Coyote what to do. [...] He took a black rock, , and threw it into , the Black Water Lake. [...] He said that if the rock came up and floated, the spirit of the dead person would return to the Fourth World and there would be no death. [...] If the rock sank, the spirit would stay in the world below and there would be death. The rock sank, and the people knew then that the twin was dead, and First Man remembered the agreement they had made with the sun. [...] Four days later the two witnesses who had looked down on the dead twin also died. [...] The people learned that it is dangerous to look at the dead. The people were all mad at Coyote for this and gathered around to beat him. Coyote said they could beat him, but first he had something to say. [...] "I threw the rock in the water knowing that it would sink." [...] The people darkly muttered about this to one another, the whole of them deciding that Coyote really did deserve a good beating. But quick thinking Coyote finished his explanation. [...] "Without death the world would soon be overpopulated. The elders would never die and would stay stuck in their infirm bodies. There would be no room for new children. We would run out of food and shelter with so many people to feed and care for." [...] The gathered group was silent for a bit while all of them contemplated Coyote's rationale and found him to be wise and intelligent.|$|E
