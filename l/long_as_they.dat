Optical aids are allowed as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are not {{mounted on the}} pistol, which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF {{as well as by}} coaches, who sometimes stress their usefulness in shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{only those}} wishing to use {{specialised}} material unavailable in other public or academic libraries {{would be given}} a Reader Pass. The Library has been criticised for admitting numbers of undergraduate students, {{who have access to}} their own university libraries, to the reading rooms. The Library replied that it has always admitted undergraduates as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have a legitimate personal, work-related or academic research purpose.|$|E
5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> wanted to {{so that he}} could get a grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going on too long he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|E

5|$|Souls {{provide a}} variety of effects, and are {{separated}} into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls. The player can only have one type of Bullet, Guardian, and Enchant soul equipped at any given time. Bullet souls are Soma Cruz's replacement for Sub Weapons in this game, and enable the player to consume a set amount of magic points to use an ability, often some form of projectile. Guardian souls provide continuous effects, including transforming into mythical creatures and summoning familiars. Guardian souls continually drain magic points so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are activated. Enchant souls are continuously active so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are equipped, and provide increases in statistics or other innate abilities—such {{as the ability to}} walk on water. Ability souls give the player innate abilities, which are often required to traverse certain areas of the castle. Because the souls are automatically activated and stay active unless the player specifically disables them, they do not consume magic points.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies, {{like the}} Milky Way, produce new generations of stars as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have dense {{molecular}} clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation {{will come to}} an end.|$|E

50|$|Full gold crowns {{last the}} <b>longest,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are {{fabricated}} <b>as</b> {{a single piece}} of gold. PFMs, or porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns possess an additional dimension in which they are prone to failure, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> incorporate brittle porcelain into their structure. Although incredibly strong in compression, porcelain is terribly fragile in tension, and fracture of the porcelain increases the risk of failure, which rises as the number of surfaces covered with porcelain is increased. A traditional PFM with occlusal porcelain (i.e. porcelain applied to the biting surface of a posterior tooth) has a 7% higher chance of failure per year than a corresponding full gold crown.|$|R

Crosses with other breeds, including Quarter ponies, Shetland ponies, Anglo-Arabs, Spanish Mustangs and Welsh ponies, are accepted on an individual basis.|$|E

50|$|During Nurhaci's {{efforts to}} unite the Jurchen people, the Naras {{resisted}} because they had always been rather well-treated by the Ming government. Instead they tried to appease Nurhachi by offering him a daughter {{from each of the}} tribal rulers, the most famous of which were Lady Abahai (阿巴亥) of the Ula tribe and Monggo (孟古) of the Yehe tribe. Nonetheless, Nurhaci eventually began his assault against the Naras, and the Hada, Ula and Hoifa tribes soon fell. The Yehe Naras were able to resist the <b>longest</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were the largest and strongest of the tribes, but even they soon had to enlist the help of the Ming empire.|$|R

5|$|Allied {{aircraft}} specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe {{bases and}} aircraft {{for the first}} time as a result of the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse {{for the first time}}, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E
5|$|Another account {{mentions}} the Maha-matrikas (the great mothers), {{a group of}} the wives of six of the Saptarishis (7 great sages), who were accused of being Skanda's real mothers and thus abandoned by their husbands. They request Skanda to adopt them as his mothers. Skanda agrees and grants them two boons: to be worshipped as great goddesses and permission to torment children as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are younger than 16 years and then act as their protectors. These six goddesses {{as well as the}} Saptamatrikas are identified or associated with Vedic Krittikas, the constellation Pleiades.|$|E

[...] It read: [...] "Actors in RTÉ soap operas such as Glenroe and Fair City will be prevented from portraying well-known characters... for advertising purposes this year... In effect the ban will mean that actors such as Mick Lally and Joe Lynch will be free to earn money from advertisements and from supermarket openings <b>as</b> <b>longs</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> do not portray the characters they play in the Glenroe series." ...|$|R

5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
