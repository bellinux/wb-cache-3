40|$|In {{the study}} on the {{appearance}} of L. E. cells and other phagocytic phenomena conducted with 54 patients consisting of hepatitis and liver cirrhosis the following results were obtained. 1. Among them four cases proved to be positive to the <b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>cell</b> phenomenon. In the group who did not show the appearance of L. E. cells, those with liver cirrhosis revealed the highest incidence of pseudo-L. E. cell appearance. 2. With the four cases proved to be positive to the <b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>cell</b> phenomenon {{a series of studies}} were carried out on their clinical pictures, the results of clinical tests, liver tissue pictures and serological tests and {{it was found that the}} Case 1 and 2 belonged to the category of lupoid hepatitis, the Case 3 aside from the <b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>cell</b> phenomenon, did not differ so markedly from general liver cirrhosis, and the Case 4 appeared to be the case of an incomplete type of systemic lupus erythematosus complicated with liver disorders due to blood transfusion but the histological picture of the liver revealed peculiar, active hepatitis showing granuloma formation. 3. In these four cases the manner of <b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>cell</b> appearance and the progress of disease did not parallel with each other. While the relation to the anti-liver antibody remains obscure, three out of the four showed a marked precipitin arc of β(2 M) -globulin. 4. A noteworthy fact was that those negative to the <b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>cell</b> phenomenon but with persistent appearance of pseudo-L.

40|$|Conley and Hartmann (1, 2) have {{reported}} {{the existence of}} a disorder of blood clotting in two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. In both cases there were severe hemorrhagic symp-toms associated with prolongation of the clotting time and the presence of a substance interfering with the interaction of thromboplastin and pro-thrombin. Previous studies in this laboratory (3) had suggested that the <b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>cell</b> factor required throm-boplastin or some component thereof, in order to act on leukocytes. A possible relationship between these two sets of data suggested itself: the <b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>cell</b> factor, re-acting in some way with thromboplastin, could inhibit thromboplastin in turn from reacting with prothrombin. If this hypothesis were valid, every blood containing the <b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>cell</b> factor should show impaired thromboplastin function. The clotting disorder described might thus be a char-acteristic feature of systemic lupus. To test this hypothesis, a systematic survey of blood coagulation in every available patient with systemic lupus erythematosus was undertaken. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-three consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were studied. Most of these were from the Wards and the Out-Patient Department of The Mount Sinai Hospital; some were private patients or patients in other hospitals. ...|$|E

40|$|The lupus {{erythematosus}} cell (<b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>cell)</b> pheno-menon is usually regarded, if properly interpreted, as being almost specific for systemic lupus erythe-matosus (Wilkinson and Sacker, 1957).

Careful repeated examination of the blood of patients with classical rheumatoid arthritis may reveal the presence of L.

At {{the time of their}} first recognition by Gross (2) and Ginzler and Fox (3), the hematoxylin-stained bodies were thought to originate from cell nuclei, a judgement which has since been confirmed (4); for the L.

Recent studies by Klemperer (5) and Gueft and Laufer (6) have indicated that the L.

40|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} (AIH), initially {{known as}} chronic active or active chronic hepatitis (and by various other names), first came under clinical {{notice in the}} late 1940 s. However, quite likely, chronic active hepatitis (CAH) had been observed prior to this and was attributed to a persistently destructive virus infection of the liver. An earlier (and controversial) designation in 1956 as lupoid hepatitis was derived from associated <b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>cell</b> test positivity and emphasized accompanying multisystem features and immunological aberrations. Young women fea tured prominent ly in ear l y descriptions of CAH. AIH was first applied in 1965 as a descriptive term. Disease-characteristic autoantibodies were defined from the early 1960 s, notably antinuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA) and liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) antibody. These are still widely used diagnostically but their relationship to pathogenesis is still not evident. A liver and disease specific autoantigen has long been searched for but unsuccessfully. Prolonged immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone and azathioprine in the 1960 s proved beneficial and remains standard therapy today.

40|$|Since the {{original}} demonstration by Hargraves of the Feulgen positive {{nature of the}} lupus erythe-matosus (<b>L.</b> <b>E.)</b> <b>cell</b> (1), {{it has become increasingly}} evident that the specific nature of the L.

Friou, Finch and Detre in particular (3, 4), and others (5, 6) have shown by means of the fluorescent antibody tech-nique of Coons and Kaplan (9) that there is nu-clear localization of serum gamma globulin of pa-tients with L. E. The present communication on the L. E. phe-nomenon is divided into two parts. The first part, utilizing L. E. tests done with isolated cell nuclei and purified L.

The second part contains quantita-tive studies with fluorescent-labeled L. E. gamma globulin which suggest that the L. E. factor is not identical in all patients, and that the L.

40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms underlying myogenic induction by insulin-like {{growth factor}} I (IGF-I) are distinct from its proliferative effects on myoblasts. To determine the postmitotic role of IGF-I on muscle cell differentiation, we derived <b>L</b> 6 <b>E</b> 9 muscle <b>cell</b> lines carrying a stably transfected rat IGF-I gene {{under the control}} of a myosin light chain (MLC) promoter-enhancer cassette. Expression of MLC-IGF-I exclusively in differentiated <b>L</b> 6 <b>E</b> 9 myotubes, which express the embryonic form of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and no endogenous IGF-I, resulted in pronounced myotube hypertrophy, accompanied by activation of the neonatal MyHC isoform. The hypertrophic myotubes dramatically increased expression of myogenin, muscle creatine kinase, beta-enolase, acid IGF binding protein 5 and activated the myocyte enhancer factor 2 C gene which is normally silent in this cell line. MLC-IGF-I induction in differentiated <b>L</b> 6 <b>E</b> 9 <b>cells</b> also increased the expression of a transiently transfected LacZ reporter driven by the myogenin promoter, demonstrating activation of the differentiation program at the transcriptional level. Nuclear reorganization, accumulation of skeletal actin protein, and an increased expression of beta 1 D integrin were also observed. Inhibition of the phosphatidyl inositol (PI) 3 -kinase intermediate in IGF-I-mediated signal transduction confirmed that the PI 3 -kinase pathway is required only at early stages for IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy and neonatal MyHC induction in these cells.

The cellular distribution of two structural plasma-membrane components such as beta 1 -integrin or the alpha 1 subunit of the Na(+) -K(+) -ATPase were unaffected by wortmannin in both the absence and the presence of insulin. As a whole, our results indicate that PI 3 -kinase is necessary to basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in <b>L</b> 6 <b>E</b> 9 and Sol 8 myoblasts. Moreover, immunofluorescence assays suggest that in both cellular models there is a constitutive GLUT 1 trafficking pathway (independent of insulin) that involves PI 3 -kinase and which, when blocked, locks GLUT 1 in a perinuclear compartment...|$|R

40|$|The rat alpha 1 -acid {{glycoprotein}} (AGP) gene is transcriptionally {{regulated by}} dexamethasone, interleukin 1 (IL- 1), hepatocyte-stimulating factor, and beta 2 interferon. The steroid and peptide hormones stimulate {{expression of the}} AGP gene synergistically as well as independently. The regulatory sequence responsible for dexamethasone-stimulated expression has been localized previously to a region that is 120 to 64 base pairs (bp) upstream of the transcription start site (H. Baumann and <b>L.</b> <b>E.</b> Maquat, Mol. <b>Cell.</b> Biol. 6 : 2551 - 2561, 1986). To identify the regulatory sequence that is responsive to the peptide hormones, different lengths of the AGP gene 5 '-flanking DNA were linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and then assayed for hormone-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression in transiently transfected HepG 2 cells. We demonstrate that an enhancer region that is responsive to IL- 1, hepatocyte-stimulating factor, and beta 2 interferon lies within a 142 -bp sequence located 5, 300 to 5, 150 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This distal regulatory region can confer hormone inducibility to a heterologous promoter; exert its affect in either orientation; and function, to a lesser degree, in nonhepatic but IL- 1 -responsive cells...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a revisional {{study of the}} subgenus Evylaeus of the genus Lasioglossum in Japan. We propose a system of species-group classification based on Japanese Evylaeus as follows: 1) the carinate-Evylaeus superspecies-group is divided into five species-groups and two species-subgroups; 2) the carinaless-Evylaeus superspecies-group is divided into 11 species-groups and two species-subgroups. In this paper (Part I), the carinate-Evylaeus superspecies-group is treated. It contains 18 species. The specimens that have been misidentified as Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) vulsum (Vachal) in Japan are classified as <b>L.</b> (<b>E.)</b> hoffmanni (Strand). A lectotype is designated for <b>L.</b> (<b>E.)</b> hoffmanni. The male of <b>L.</b> (<b>E.)</b> naitoi Ebmer et Maeta is described for the first time. Seven species are recorded from the following localities for the first time: <b>L.</b> (<b>E.)</b> affine (Smith), <b>L.</b> (<b>E.)</b> apristum (Vachal), <b>L.</b> (<b>E.)</b> duplex (Dalla Torre), <b>L.</b> (<b>E.)</b> hoffmanni (Strand) and <b>L.</b> (<b>E.)</b> sibiriacum (Blüthgen) from South Korea; <b>L.</b> (<b>E.)</b> nipponense (Hirashima) from Taiwan; and <b>L.</b> (<b>E.)</b> percrassiceps (Cockerell) from South Korea and Taiwan. All of the Japanese species of the carinate-Evylaeus superspecies-group are re-described or provided with a supplementary description with photographs, illustrations and SEM photographs of important characters. Keys to both sexes of the Japanese species of this group are provided. Remarks and diagnoses on concerning taxonomy, geographical distribution, flight and flower records, social structure, and biological references for each species are given...|$|R

Despite such advances, there i s still a need for further reduc-tions in the stack cost, through improvements in the performance of the mem-brane electrode assembly. However, improved stack performance must be demonstrated not only with pure hydrogen fuel but also, moreparticularly, with reformate fuel, where tolerance to poisoning by carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide needs to be improved.
