500|$|Notorious {{scenes in}} the play include [...] "the china scene", a {{sustained}} double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection {{with two of his}} lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner [...] "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> it lest I should beg some. But I will find it out, and have what I came for yet" [...] (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made [...] "china" [...] a dirty word in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I beg you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> you {{as often as you}} can", pleaded Churchill in a letter to Sarah Jennings, [...] "which I am sure you ought to do if you care for my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E

500|$|... "Blow" [...] is a electropop and dance-pop {{song that}} uses a synth infused beat as a backing. [...] The song opens with {{laughing}} followed by a command to dance. As the chorus of the song starts in, Kesha's vocals change into an auto-tuned [...] "stuttering" [...] as she repeats [...] "This place about to blow" [...] four times over an electro beat. During the song's bridge, Kesha's vocals change pace into a rap-sing style as she tells her listeners to [...] "Go insane, go insane / Throw some glitter / Make it rain on 'em / <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> them Hanes."

500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{and after}} the English Civil War (1642–1651) many dissenting Christian groups emerged, {{including}} the Seekers and others. A young man named George Fox was dissatisfied with {{the teachings of the}} Church of England and non-conformists. He had a revelation that [...] "there is one, even, Christ Jesus, who can speak to thy condition", and became convinced {{that it was possible to}} have a direct experience of Christ without the aid of an ordained clergy. He had a vision on Pendle Hill in Lancashire, England, in which he believed that [...] "the Lord <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> in what places he had a great people to be gathered". Following this he travelled around England, the Netherlands, and Barbados preaching and teaching with the aim of converting new adherents to his faith. The central theme of his Gospel message was that Christ has come to teach his people himself. His followers considered themselves to be the restoration of the true Christian church, after centuries of apostasy in the churches in England.|$|E
