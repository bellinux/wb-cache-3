40|$|Tumor {{progression}} is a multistep {{process in}} which alterations in the expression of numerous gene products may give rise to highly malignant cellular variants. In the present study, we analyzed the differential expression of several genes in cellular variants of mammary adenocarcinomas with high or <b>low</b> <b>malignancy</b> potential, which originated in a common ancestor. To assess the generality of our findings, high and <b>low</b> <b>malignancy</b> variants were derived from two different mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines, namely DA 3 and CSML cells. Of major importance {{is the fact that}} the differences between high- and low-malignancy variants observed in one system of mammary adenocarcinoma cells (DA 3 cells) were identically reproduced in the other system of mammary adenocarcinoma cells (CSML cells). The high malignancy variants of tumors both DA 3 -high and CSML-high (previously called CSML- 100), expressed higher levels of factors that induce monocyte migration than the <b>low</b> <b>malignancy</b> DA 3 -low and CSML-low (previously called CSML- 0) variants. In addition, it was found that DA 3 -high and CSML-high cell variants expressed higher levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) than the <b>low</b> <b>malignancy</b> variants (DA 3 -low and CSML-low). These results suggest that MCP- 1, IL- 6 and MMPs potentially contribute to mammary adenocarcinoma progression and that their expression is regulated by a common pathway. The expression of MCP- 1, IL- 6 and MMPs in both DA 3 -high and CSML-high cells was up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). The fact that TNFalpha exerted similar effects on the expression of these three factors in both cell systems raises the possibility of a coordinated co-regulation of tumor-promoting factors...|$|E

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Adenoid cystic carcinoma is primary bronchopulmonary carcinoma with <b>low</b> <b>malignancy,</b> and 43 patients {{treated in the}} past 50 years in our hospital were retrospectively studied. The {{aim of this study}} is to discuss the clinical symptoms, pathologic characteristic and therapeutic method of primary tracheal or bronchuotracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma. Methods This study summarized total 43 patients of primary tracheal or bronchus adenoid cystic carcinoma treated in our hospital from Jan. 1958 to Dec. 2007. Among them, 40 patients were treated by surgical resection, and 3 patients were treated by fiberoptic bronchoscope’s interventional treatment.

The MNB-T 2 (<b>low</b> <b>malignancy)</b> cell line was originally derived from the in situ tumor and carried in tissue culture for more than 100 passages; the MNB-T 1 (high malignancy) line consisted of a new sub-culture that was also established from the in situ MNB tumor. DPD activity was determined in cytosolic preparations of MNB utilizing high performance liquid chromatography to separate the radiolabeled substrate ([2 - 14 C]thymine) from [2 - 14 C]dihydrothymine. The apparent affinity of DPD for NADPH in MNB cells (Km approximately 0. 08 mM) was identical to that of A/J mouse brain and liver. The DPD activity of the high malignancy (MNB-T 1) cell line was 14. 3 % of that observed in the <b>low</b> <b>malignancy</b> (MNB-T 2) line. In situ tumors formed after implantation of high malignancy (MNB-T 1) cells into A/J mice had only 25. 2 % of the DPD activity observed in tumors derived from <b>low</b> <b>malignancy</b> (MNB-T 2) cells. When MNB-T 2 cells were injected into naive A/J mice, tumors developed in only 68 % of animals, the tumor growth rate was slow and a mortality of 20 % was observed. In contrast, tumors derived from injected MNB-T 1 cells showed a faster growth rate and 100 % mortality. Most MNB-T 2 derived tumors were not lethal and ultimately resolved while the MNB-T 1 derived tumors were invariably lethal. These studies support the concept that the levels of DPD activity in neoplastic cells are inversely related to their malignant expression and also provide a model to study differences between neuroblastoma cell lines derived from the same in situ tumor but which manifest different neoplastic behavior...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} {{the result of}} treatment and long-term outcome of a population-based cohort of patients with retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (RSTS). METHODS: Between 1 January 1989 and 1 January 1994, 143 patients diagnosed as having primary RSTS were selected from a national pathology database (PALGA) in the Netherlands. In this population-based group of patients, the result of surgery, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analysed as well as factors affecting OS and DFS. Median follow-up was 10. 2 years. RESULTS: Operative treatment resulted in a complete tumour resection in 55 % of the patients (n= 78), low- and intermediate-grade tumours were more often completely resected than high-grade tumours (P= 0. 016). Five- and 10 -year cumulative OS was 39 % and 21 %, respectively, while DFS was 22 % and 17 %, respectively. In a multivariate analysis <b>low</b> <b>malignancy</b> grade (P= 0. 017) and a complete tumour resection (P< 0. 001) were associated with better OS.

40|$|Five {{cases of}} serous benign cystadenomas, 2 cases of <b>low</b> {{potential}} <b>malignancy</b> and 3 cases of serous cystadenocarcinomas were diagnosed by light microscopy and were investigated in detail by an electronmicroscope. The following results were obtained. 1) Electronmicroscopically, the epithelial {{cells of the}} serous benign cystadenoma were classified into 2 types: secretory cells and ciliated cells. The secretory cells showed numerous secretory granules which were characterized by well-developed Golgi apparatus. Irregular secretory granules were recognized {{in the vicinity of}} the Golgi apparatus, thus it was surmised that the secretory granules were produced and accumulated in the Golgi apparatuses. 2) The epithelial cells of <b>low</b> potential <b>malignancy</b> may be classified into the following 3 types: secretory cells, ciliated cells and cells possessing small granules. 3) The epithelial cells of serous cystadenocarcinoma are the same as that of <b>low</b> potential <b>malignancy,</b> and may be classified into the following 3 types: secretory cells, ciliated cells and cells possessing small granules. 4) With the progression of serous cystadenoma to malignancy, it was noted that secretory cells, secretory granules, ciliated cells and cilia decreased. 5) The ciliated cells seen in serous benign cystadenomas are one of the cells basically recognized in the epithelium of the female genital tract. In addition, characteristic membrane-bound fibrillar bodies were seen. Based on these ultrastructural findings, it may be said that the cells composing the epithelium of serous cystadenoma closely resemble those of the epithelium of the female genital tract which has a Miillerian duct origin. Thus it is suggested that serous cystadenoma is a tumor of coelomic epithelium origin. 6) As a result of an electron microscopic investigation of serous cystadenocarcinoma, ciliated cells were recognized.

40|$|AbstractCounteraction of drug {{resistance}} {{is a major}} challenge in cancer therapy, particularly in adhanced stages. The main mechanism of multi{{drug resistance}} is related to an increased drug efflux. In the present study we examined the effect of modifying cell membrane lipid fluidity on uptake of adriamycin (ADR) in cells of AKR lymphoma malignancy variants. Modification of cell membrane fluidity, either by lecithin or by lecithin-cholesterol mixtures, induced in {{a high proportion of}} cells of all variants a higher capacity to accumulate ADR. The chemosensitizing effect, for lecithin in particular, was proportional to the vegree of malignancy of the lymphoma variants. The increased ADR uptake was up to 1. 4 -fold in the variant of <b>lowest</b> <b>malignancy</b> and up to 5 -fold in the one of highest aggressiveness. This tenvency correlates with our previous studies and is of particular value since highly-malignant tumors are often drug resistant. The cholesterol-lecithin mixture, induced, however, in part of the variants the appearance of a small subpopulation with very low ADR permeability. Cell membrane rigidification is of value for exposing tumor cell cryptic antigens but may be veleterious when used in conjunction with chemotherapy...|$|R
