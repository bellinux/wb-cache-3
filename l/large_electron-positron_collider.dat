40|$|The <b>Large</b> <b>Electron-Positron</b> (LEP) <b>collider</b> {{experiments}} have constrained {{the mass of}} the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson to be above 114. 4 GeV. This bound applies to all extensions of the SM where the coupling of a Higgs boson to the Z boson and also the Higgs decay profile do not differ much from the SM one. However, in scenarios with extended Higgs sectors, this coupling can be made very small by a suitable choice of the parameters of the model. In such cases, the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass can in turn be made very small. Such a very light Higgs state, with a mass of the order of the Z boson one or even smaller, could have escaped detection at LEP. In this work we perform a detailed parton level study on the feasibility of the detection of such a very light Higgs particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the production process pp → h j →τ^+ τ^- j, where j is a resolved jet. We conclude that there are several models where such a Higgs state could be detected at the LHC with early data. Comment: 14 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

Assuming R-parity conservation, sleptons can be pair-produced at the <b>Large</b> <b>Electron-Positron</b> (LEP) <b>collider.</b> The decay topology studied was the direct decay to the lightest neutralino (X-tilde_ 1 " 0) and the corresponding lepton (l-tilde #-># lX-tilde_ 1 " 0) of same flavour. Within the context of the MSSM, the lightest neutralino forms an ideal candidate for the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and, as it interacts only weakly with ordinary matter, escapes detection. Such events are therefore characterised by acoplanar lepton-pairs coupled with missing energy. The observed number of event candidates from both searches were compatible with Standard Model expectations. Results have therefore been interpreted in terms of excluded regions in the slepton-neutralino mass plane. Assuming the MSSM input parameters for the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan#beta#= 1. 5 and the Higgs mass mixing parameter, #mu# = - 200 GeV/c" 2, the 95 % CL excluded mass regions for right-handed selectrons and smuons were, respectively, m_e_-_t_i_l_d_e_R #<=# 90 GeV/c" 2 and m_#mu#_-_t_i_l_d_e_r #<=# 70 GeV/c" 2.
