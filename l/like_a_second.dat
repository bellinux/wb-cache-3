5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
25|$|The Lining: lining is {{considered}} an unnecessary burden and the Neapolitan tailors keep it as minimal as possible. Usually, the jacket is unlined or only half lined, {{in order to provide}} lightness; even the sleeves are completely unlined, as they’re meant to fit <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> skin. Additionally, the lining is often left open (“volante,” literally “flying”) so that people can admire the fine details and construction of the jacket.|$|E

25|$|The years 1813–1815 were {{difficult}} and tragic ones for Stock. Dresden was in chaos from the terminal {{stages of the}} Napoleonic wars, with the homes (the Körner home included) taken over by French soldiers and great numbers of civilian deaths. Stock's nephew Theodor, who had volunteered for the Freikorps to fight against Napoleon, died in action (1813); and niece Emma died of a short illness two years later, leaving the Körners childless. Stock, who had been <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> mother to her sister's children, was as devastated as Minna and Gottfried were. Finally, Gottfried fell into conflict with Frederick Augustus, the ruler of Saxony, and lost his job.|$|E
25|$|From {{the first}} centuries A.D, {{the cult of}} Mithras, pagan beliefs, and Zoroastrianism were {{commonly}} practised in Georgia. In 337 AD King Mirian III declared Christianity as the state religion, giving a great stimulus {{to the development of}} literature, arts, and ultimately playing {{a key role in the}} formation of the unified Georgian nation, The acceptance led to the slow but sure decline of Zoroastrianism, which until the 5th century AD, appeared to have become something <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> established religion in Iberia (eastern Georgia), and was widely practised there. In the ensuing period, until the course of the 7th century, what is now Georgia remained dominated by the Romans and Sasanians.|$|E
25|$|Cyber Chicken Animation Studio and DQ Entertainment Limited animate {{the series}} in {{traditional}} 2-D. The character designs are kept from the web series, with some changed details; such as cleaner lines and brighter eyes. Despite {{the fact that}} both versions use Adobe Flash to create animation, the television episodes are cleaner-looking. This is probably because the characters and backgrounds in the web episodes were made of overlapping JPEG files, and that the television series has an actual budget. Also, the colors still go outside the outlines, but it seems more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> outline than messy drawing. Every building was changed; in the web cartoon most buildings were grey, but was changed to different colors for the TV version. Vendetta's house is now dark green and Charlotte's blue.|$|E

25|$|As {{the band}} and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member's stylistic {{contribution}} became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but opted for more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at {{the upper end of}} the Dead's sound. The two drummers, Mickey Hart and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a new dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its emerging style. Garcia's lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his training in fingerpicking and banjo.|$|E

Page and Varela found Panikkar in time for their next performance in Las Vegas, where they were sent directly to sing in front of the show's producers. Varela called it a stressful week, during which the new trio {{had to learn how to}} work together, and on a song Panikkar didn't know. When the men faced the judges, Mel B asked them to explain the personnel change, and said it was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> audition.

500|$|Stretch nylon bikini briefs and bras complemented the {{adolescent}} boutique fashions of the 1960s, allowing those to be minimal. DuPont introduced lycra (DuPont's name for spandex) {{in the same}} decade. [...] Spandex expanded the range of novelty fabrics available to designers which meant suits {{could be made to}} fit <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> skin without heavy linings. [...] "The advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini," [...] wrote Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and author of The Bikini Book, [...] "It didn't sag, it didn't bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn't so much like lingerie anymore." [...] Increased reliance on stretch fabric led to simplified construction. It allowed designers to create the string bikini, and allowed Rudi Gernreich to create the topless monokini. Alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early '70s.|$|E
500|$|... "Heaven" [...] is a mournful, {{understated}} slow-tempo ballad with {{gospel and}} pop overtones. It is instrumentally {{complete with a}} hymn-like simple piano. According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com, it is composed using time signature of common time in the key of A Major with a slow tempo of 52 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the low note of C#3 to the higher note of E5. It contains the sequence of A–C#m–F#m–C#m as its chord progression. Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound described the song as a blend of [...] "cinematic reach of modern Top 40 pop with the patience and melancholy of post-808s & Heartbreaks [...] hip-hop". Paste reviewer Philip Cosores noted how the song sounded as if it [...] "work together" [...] with other Boots-produced material on the album, including [...] "Blue" [...] and [...] "Haunted". A writer from Fuse, opined that the song sounded slightly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> part of the singer's own ballad [...] "Halo" [...] (2008). Similarly, Mike Wass from the website Idolator called it [...] "an edgy, indie sister" [...] of [...] "Halo" [...] while Lindsey Weber from Vulture.com deemed it an [...] "answer to" [...] that song. Variety journalist Andrew Barker likened the song to Rihanna's [...] "Stay" [...] (2012) while adding that it succeeded in [...] "improving on it in every way".|$|E
500|$|As the {{swimsuit}} was evolving, the underwear {{started to}} change. Between 1900 and 1940, swimsuit lengths followed {{the changes in}} underwear designs. In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the [...] "breast girdle". During the Great Depression, panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various elasticized yarns making underwear fit <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> skin. By 1930s underwear styles for {{both women and men}} were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although the waistband was still above the navel, the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties {{for the rest of the}} century. Warner standardized the concept of Cup size in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938. Beginning in the late thirties skants, a type of skanty men's briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband. Howard Hughes designed a push-up bra to be worn by Jane Russell in The Outlaw in 1943, although Russell stated in interviews that she never wore the 'contraption'. In 1950 Maidenform introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.|$|E

500|$|In the {{behind the}} scenes video {{published}} by HBO following the airing of the fifth and sixth episodes, Benioff described Bran's visions {{at the beginning of}} the episode as being something that was put together very precisely and purposefully, noting [...] "Even though some of those images flash by in just a fraction of a second each of them was very carefully chosen. And the Mad King was probably the most dramatic of those because we've been hearing about the Mad King from the very beginning of the show, but he's never appeared on screen before. And shooting it, you know, spending a lot of time on what ended up being maybe <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> and a half, couple seconds, of screen time." [...] The new scenes of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, are interspersed with previously shown footage of the White Walkers, as well as wildfire explosions, and other landmark moments from throughout the series, such as Ned Stark's beheading, the Red Wedding, and Bran falling from the Broken Tower in the series premiere. In the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, the Mad King is described as having long, unkempt hair and beard, with nine inch long fingernails. The show's version portrayed his look in a more tidy fashion, with David Rintoul playing the role of the Mad King.|$|E
500|$|Mendelssohn's {{reputation}} in England remained high throughout the 19th century.

In 1851 an adulatory novel by the teenaged Elizabeth Sara Sheppard was published, entitled Charles Auchester. The book features as its leading character Mendelssohn, as the [...] "Chevalier Seraphael", and remained in print for nearly 80 years. In 1854 Queen Victoria requested that the Crystal Palace include a statue of Mendelssohn when it was rebuilt. Mendelssohn's Wedding March from A Midsummer Night's Dream was played at the wedding of Queen Victoria's daughter, Princess Victoria, The Princess Royal, to Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia in 1858, and it remains popular at marriage ceremonies. Mendelssohn's sacred choral music, particularly the smaller-scale works, remains popular in the choral tradition of the Church of England. But many critics, including Bernard Shaw, began to condemn Mendelssohn's music for its association with Victorian cultural insularity; Shaw in particular complained of the composer's [...] " [...] gentility, his conventional sentimentality, and his despicable oratorio-mongering". In the 1950s the scholar Wilfrid Mellers complained of Mendelssohn's [...] "spurious religiosity which reflected the element of unconscious humbug in our morality".|$|E

[...] As he focused on basketball, he had a tumultuous relationship with his father, who acted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> coach, and was overlooked by most college basketball programs. Michigan was the first school to contact him, communicating by mail during his sophomore year. During his junior year, Michigan head coach John Beilein invited him on an unofficial visit to watch Michigan play #4 Duke on December 6 to see unranked Michigan pull an upset.

In the summer before his senior season, he attended Beilein's Elite Camp in Ann Arbor, Michigan, receiving an offer that he accepted. [...] At the time, Hardaway was unranked in the Rivals.com Top-150 and his only other offers were from Minnesota and Kansas State.
