40|$|Jets with a <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> R ≳ 1 and {{grooming}} algorithms {{are widely}} used to fully capture the decay products of boosted heavy particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Unlike most discriminating variables used in such studies, the jet radius is usually not optimized for specific physics scenarios. This is because every jet configuration must be calibrated, insitu, to account for detector response and other experimental effects. One solution to enhance the availability of large- R jet configurations used by the LHC experiments is jet re-clustering. Jet re-clustering introduces an intermediate scale r < R at which jets are calibrated and used as the inputs to reconstruct <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> jets. In this paper we systematically study and propose new jet re-clustering configurations and show that re-clustered <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> jets have essentially the same jet mass performance as <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> groomed jets. Jet re-clustering has the benefit that no additional large-R calibration is necessary, allowing the re-clustered <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> parameter to be optimized {{in the context of}} specific precision measurements or searches for new physics...|$|R
40|$|Usage of {{high-strength}} steels {{with limited}} bendability in conventional air bending is not obvious {{due to the}} deformation limits of these materials. An attractive solution for deformation reduction is the utilization of <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> punches. The bending process for <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> tooling is dissimilar to conventional air bending, due {{to the presence of}} the multi-breakage phenomenon. This phenomenon has been observed by many researchers, but understanding of the influencing parameters is limited. Multi-breakage poses a serious obstacle, since it changes the loading scheme from the typical three-point to four-point bending. In this contribution, an extensive experimental exploration of <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> bending leads to conclusions on the influence of tool dimensions and material characteristics. Air bending experiments have been performed for five materials, four thicknesses, four punch radii, and four die openings. Based on the observed force measurements, the process can be defined as <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> bending when the ratio punch radius/die opening is larger than 1 : 4. Trends for the influencing parameters of the measured data can be used for further investigation of <b>large</b> <b>radius</b> air bending. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} stellar population gradients from z = 2 to z = 0 in massive galaxies at <b>large</b> <b>radii</b> (r > 2 Reff) using ten cosmological zoom simulations of halos with 6 &# 0215; 1012 M&# 8857; < Mhalo < 2 &# 0215; 1013 M&# 8857;. The simulations follow metal cooling and enrichment from SNII, SNIa and AGB winds. We explore the differential impact of an empirical model for galactic winds that reproduces the mass-metallicity relation and its evolution with redshift. At <b>larger</b> <b>radii</b> the galaxies, for both models, become more dominated by stars accreted from satellite galaxies in major and minor mergers. In the wind model, fewer stars are accreted, but they are significantly more metal poor resulting in steep global metallicity (h&# 8711;Zstarsi = &# 8722; 0. 35 dex/dex) and color (e. g. h&# 8711;g &# 8722; ri = &# 8722; 0. 13 dex/dex) gradients in agreement with observations. In contrast, colour and metallicity gradients of the models without winds are inconsistent with observations. Age gradients are in general mildly positive at z = 0 (h&# 8711;Agestarsi = 0. 04 dex/dex) with {{significant differences between the}} models at higher redshift. We demonstrate that for the wind model, stellar accretion is steepening existing in-situ metallicity gradients by about 0. 2 dex by the present day and helps to match observed gradients of massive early-type galaxies at <b>large</b> <b>radii.</b> Colour and metallicity gradients are significantly steeper for systems which have accreted stars in minor mergers, while galaxies with major mergers have relatively flat gradients, confirming previous results. The effect of stellar migration of in-situ formed stars to <b>large</b> <b>radii</b> is discussed.

40|$|The entropy of the intracluster medium at <b>large</b> <b>radii</b> {{has been}} shown {{recently}} to deviate from the self-similar scaling with temperature. Using N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of the LCDM cosmology, we demonstrate that this deviation is evidence that feedback processes are important in generating excess entropy in clusters. While radiative cooling increases the entropy of intracluster gas, resulting in a good match to the data in the centres of clusters, it produces an entropy-temperature relation closer to the self-similar scaling at <b>larger</b> <b>radii.</b> A model that includes feedback from galaxies, however, not only stabilises the cooling rate in the simulation, but is capable of reproducing the observed scaling behaviour both in cluster cores and at <b>large</b> <b>radii.</b> Feedback modifies the entropy distribution in clusters due to its increasing ability at expelling gas from haloes with decreasing mass. The strength of the feedback required, as suggested from our simulations, is consistent with supernova energetics, providing a large fraction of the energy reaches low-density regions and is originally contained within a small mass of gas.

40|$|Following {{the model}} of magnetically {{supported}} rotation of spiral galaxies, the inner disk rotation is dominated by gravity but magnetism is not negligible at radii where the rotation curve becomes flat, and indeed becomes dominant at very <b>large</b> <b>radii.</b> Values {{of the order of}} 1 μG, or even less, produce a centripetal force when the absolute value of the slope of the curve [B_ϕ, R] (azimuthal field strength versus radius) is less than R^- 1. The R^- 1 -profile is called the critical profile. From this hypothesis, the following is to be expected: at <b>large</b> <b>radii,</b> a "subcritical" profile (slope flatter than R^- 1); at still <b>larger</b> <b>radii</b> a B_ϕ-profile becoming asymptotically critical as the density becomes asymptotically vanishing. Recent observations of magnetic fields in NGC 6946 and the Milky Way are in very good agreement with these predictions. This magnetic alternative requires neither galactic dark matter (DM) nor modification of fundamental laws of physics, but it is not in conflict with these hypotheses, especially with the existence of cosmological cold dark matter (CDM) ...|$|R
