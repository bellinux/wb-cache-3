To {{show our}} {{results in the}} {{surgical}} 				 treatment of <b>legs</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>ulcers,</b> with crossectomy and foam 				 sclerotherapy (CAFE) of the great saphenous vein (GSV) in 				 group I and stripping of GSV and varicectomy in group II. 				 Methods. 35 patients with active venous leg 				 ulcers were recruited and treated. They were collected in two 				 groups. Group I were treated by crossectomy and foam 				 sclerotherapy of the GSV and group II were treated by 				 stripping of GSV and varicectomy. The healing time of the 				 ulcer and the complications were recorded after the procedure 				 in the follow-up visits. Results. 29 out of the 				 35 patients completed the follow-up. There were eight 				 cases of incomplete healing of the leg ulcer, 4 in group I 				 (19. 04 %) and 4 in group II (40 %), P< 0. 05. The average rate of healing in group I was 					 0. 38 [*]cm/day and 0. 13 in group II, P< 0. 05. Conclusion. CAFE technique 					 of the great saphenous vein {{in the treatment of}} 6 CEAP 					 patients is a procedure that improves the rate of ulcer 					 healing as compared to these two groups. It is a safe 					 and reliable minimally invasive method, with less morbidity...|$|R

Since then there have been numerous accounts of ice used for pain relief including from the Ancient Egyptians and Avicenna of Persia (A.D.982-1070).

Dr Irving S Cooper, in 1913, progressed the field of cryotherapy by designing a liquid nitrogen probe capable of achieving temperatures of -196 °C, and utilizing it to treat of Parkinson's disease and previously inoperable cancer. Cooper's cryoprobe advanced the practice of cryotherapy, which led to growing interest and practice of cryotherapy. In 1964, Dr. Cahan successfully used his liquid nitrogen probe invention to treat uterine fibroids and cervical cancer. Cryotherapy continued to advance with Dr. Amoils developing a liquid nitrogen probe capable of achieving cooling expansion, in 1967.|$|R

The microstructuring of the surface morphology of the elastomer film combined with the tuning of the Young’s modulus of the PDMS blend is demonstrated to enhance the sensor performance achieving a 0. 25 kPa pressure resolution and a 10 pF capacitive change under 6. 5 kPa compressive load.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we review}} the {{existing}} knowledge on {{the risk of}} infections in chronic skin disease. The normal skin is a major physiological barrier to most microorganisms. In patients with chronic skin diseases the epidermal barrier function is disrupted and the concentration of antimicrobial peptides may be reduced. Several case series and case-control studies of selected hospitalized patients confirm {{a high risk of}} colonization with S. aureus and cutaneous infections among patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and erythroderma. Cellulitis is a common secondary skin infection associated with <b>leg</b> <b>ulcer,</b> <b>varicose</b> veins, lymphedema, tinea pedis, and leg dermatoses. Pox, Human papilloma, and Herpes viruses, some dermatophytes and candida albicans often give rise to secondary skin infections in chronic skin disease. Concerning infection of other organs than the skin, a few studies have shown that atopic dermatitis patients are more prone to upper and lower respiratory tract infection. One study of severe psoriasis patients has shown increased mortality due to infections. Patients with chronic skin disease may have more severe infections with prolonged periods of antibiotic treatments and worse prognosis compared with skin healthy controls, but more data from population-based studies including detailed data on relevant risk factors and confounders is needed...|$|R

40|$|Background. Chronic leg ulcers due to venous {{insufficiency}} represent a significant burden {{for the national}} sanitary system. Although the role of venous hypertension as a key pathogenetic factor of this lesion is clear, several microcirculatory mechanisms involved in the tissue repair process remain to be clarified. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a vasoactive drug for the treatment of <b>varicose</b> <b>leg</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Methods. The study was a prospective randomized trial lasting eight weeks. Twenty patients matched for sex, age, wound dimensions and with clinical and instrumental evidence of chronic {{venous insufficiency}} were enrolled in this study. Patients attended a weekly consultation at the outpatients clinic for chronic leg ulcers of the Department of Dermatology at the University of Pisa and they were randomized into two groups according to treatment: G 1 (n= 10) vasoactive drug, occlusive dressing, elastic bandage, G 2 (n= 10) occlusive dressing, elastic bandage. During the study, subjective parameters were evaluated: intensity of pain, paresthesia, heaviness and objective parameters: intensity of oedema, wound area, transcutaneous tissue gas monitoring (O 2 - CO 2). Results. At the end of the study a marked reduction of subjective symptoms such as pain and paresthesia was observed with an increase of oxygen tissue perfusion in the G 1 group compared to the G 2 group. No significant differences were observed in the two groups about the remaining parameters investigated. Conclusions. The drug investigated in this study showed a good tolerability and efficacy in weakening the clinical symptoms related to venous insufficiency. The positive effect of the vasoactive drug on transcutaneous oxygen tension confirms a direct action on the microcirculatory system, which could positively modulate the tissue repair process...|$|R
