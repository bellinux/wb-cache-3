Study of initial oxidation is very important as it concerns {{the first step of}} a metal 2 ̆ 7 s oxidation and corrosion behavior. Characteristics of the kinetics of early-stage oxidation are believed to have an important influence on the later steady-state growth. Modern sophisticated experimental studies such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>electron</b> <b>diffractions</b> (LEED), combining ellipsometry and auger electron microscopy have clarified some of the details of initial stage of both oxygen chemisorption and oxidation kinetics of Al.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{influence}} of deposition conditions and post-deposition annealing {{on the structure of}} ultrathin iron oxide films grown on magnesium oxide (MgO) substrates is studied. The main experimental technique used is synchrotron based x-ray diffraction (XRD) but also x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>electron</b> <b>diffractions</b> (LEED) are used to characterize the samples. Studying the dependency of film structure and thickness the stoichiometry and structure is changing with increasing film thickness. For large film thickness bulk like magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) can be observed. With decreasing thickness the oxide phase is shifting towards a wüstite (FeO) phase. When changing the deposition rate and substrate temperature a strong influence on the Fe 3 O 4 film structure is observed. With both decreasing deposition rates and substrate temperatures the occupancy of the tetrahedral sites is strongly decreasing while the octahedral sites remain almost unaffected. By post-deposition annealing under low oxygen atmosphere it is possible to increase the ordering of the tetrahedral sites. However, this is accompanied by significant diffusion of magnesium into the iron oxide film. During post-deposition annealing of a gamma-Fe 2 O 3 film under high vacuum a reduction of the iron oxide is observed. Increasing the temperature, first, a reduction from gamma-Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4 is observed. After further increasing the temperature a reduction from Fe 3 O 4 to FeO is observed...|$|R

50|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival at the Michelson Laboratory in California, surface science was born. He was {{involved}} early in {{it in order to}} understand thin film phenomena.

The importance of adsorption on the initial growth of thin films led him also to adsorption studies. In these early years of UHV technique and surface science much of the work went into technological and methodological development.

40|$|Several reconstructions of the Pb(110) {{surface and}} their transformations have been {{investigated}} with <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>electron</b> microscopy and <b>diffraction.</b> Although the c(2 x 4) order-disorder transition of the clean surface was seen clearly to be first order, variation of the transition temperature, T sub(tl) approximately 420 K, by at least 25 K across the surface indicates the presence of significant heterogeneity. Locally varying stress of sufficient magnitude to effect the c(2 x 4) phase transition broadening may be ultimately responsible for driving this reconstruction and its evolution into a (2 x n) form. Potassium-induced c(5 x 2) and c(2 x 4) structures, which we attribute to substrate reconstruction, have also been discovered here. These impurity-induced structures are distinguished from the clean surface reconstruction by their periodicities and/or disordering temperatures.

At monolayer coverage, N- 2 orders in commensurate (3 x 3) structures on both surfaces, and we propose that the unit cells contain four molecules in each case. The infrared spectra reveal that N- 2 exclusively physisorbs on the Pt(111) (1 x 1) H surface, while both physisorbed and chemisorbed N- 2 is detected on the Pt(111) surface. Physisorbed N- 2 is the majority species in the latter case, and the two adsorption states show an almost identical uptake behavior, which indicates that they are intrinsic constituents of the growing (3 x 3) N- 2 islands. An analysis of the infrared absorbance data, based on a simple scaling concept suggested by density functional theory calculations, supports a model in which the (3 x 3) unit cell contains one chemisorbed molecule in end-on atop configuration and three physisorbed molecules.

At low coverage, the (4 x 4) structure was formed by a long-range modulation of the surface with an ~ 24 Å periodicity which exhibited an internal 6 Å periodicity characteristic for the Fe 3 O 4 (111) -(1 x 1) surface. At mid-coverage, two sorts of (2 x 2) domains were observed, which were distinguished by the different diameter of protrusions forming a STM image.

Second, to investigate the magnetic properties of the nanostructures and ultrathin films fabricated with the knowledge from the first part. The first part of the thesis studies molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of Fe, Rh, Ru, and Mo nanostructures on the vicinal Pt(997) surface for various temperatures employing thermal energy He atom scattering (TEAS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and <b>low</b> <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> <b>diffraction</b> (LEED) as characterizing methods. The parameters for the growth {{of a wide variety of}} Fe nanostructures, from monatomic chains to monolayers and surface alloys, were obtained and a detailed comparison of Fe growth on Pt(997) and Pt(111) is presented. Rh deposition creates structures similar to the ones of Fe although with higher defect density. A complex growth mode involving double layer growth is observed for Ru. For Mo no ordered structures could be identified. In the second part of the thesis measurements by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and magneto optical Kerr effect (MOKE) were employed as probes to the magnetic properties of the structures. Ultrathin Fe films show different magnetic properties depending on the step density of the substrate. The relation between magnetism and structure is shown by the comparison of films on Pt(997) and Pt(111). The variety of Fe structures characterized in the first part is investigated finding an increase of orbital magnetic moments when the dimension and thus the coordination in the structure is reduced. It is shown that a stabilization of the magnetization in Fe nanostructures which is reflected by an increased remanence and coercivity is achieved simply by alloying with Pt from the substrate. Finally, it is demonstrated that well measurable magnetic moments are induced in the Pt for a FePt alloy with a total Fe coverage of only 0. 5 ML.

40|$|This Licentiate thesis {{summarizes}} the work {{carried out by}} the author the years 2004 to 2008 at the University of Iceland and the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden. The aim of the project was to investigate the structure of sapphire (alpha-Al 2 O 3) surfaces, both for pure scientiﬁc reasons and also for potential use as substrate for GaN-growth by molecular beam epitaxy. More generally the thesis describes some surface science methods used for investigating the substrates; the general physical back ground, the experi- mental implementation and what information they can give. The described techniques are used for surface analysis on sapphire substrates which have been treated variously in order to optimize them for use as templates for epi- taxial growth of GaN or related III-V compounds. The thesis is based on three published papers. The ﬁrst paper focuses on the formation a thin AlN layer on sapphire, which may act as a buﬀer layer for potential epitaxial growth of GaN or any related III-V materials. Two types of sapphire substrates (reconstructed and non- reconstructed) were exposed to ammonia resulting in the formation of AlN on the surface. The eﬃciency of the AlN formation (nitridation eﬃciency) for the two surfaces was then compared as a function of substrate temperature through photoelectron spectroscopy and <b>low</b> <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> <b>diﬀraction.</b> The reconstructed surface showed a much higher nitridation eﬃciency than the non-reconstructed surface. In the second paper, the aﬀect of diﬀerent annealing processes on the sapphire morphology, and thus its capability to act as a template for GaN growth, was studied. Atomic force microscopy, X-ray diﬀraction analysis together with ellipsometry measurements showed that annealing in H 2 ambient and subse- quent annealing at 1300 °C in O 2 for 11 hours resulted in high quality and atomically ﬂat sapphire surface suitable for III-V epitaxial growth. The third paper describes the eﬀect of argon sputtering on cleaning GaN surfaces and the possibility of using indium as surfactant for establishing a clean and stoichiometric GaN surface, after such sputtering.
