5|$|Mississippi Governor William Allain sent 500 {{members of}} the National Guard to partner with 200 <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officers</b> along Mississippi's coast in {{minimizing}} crime, and nighttime curfews were established in several cities. On September 4, President Reagan declared Mississippi's coastal counties a Major Disaster area. The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated {{that as many as}} 3,000 homes in the state were uninhabitable, their occupants forced to find temporary living arrangements. The Small Business Administration approved special loans up to $500,000 for owners of damaged businesses.

5|$|<b>Law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officers</b> often receive {{inquiries}} {{and demands}} about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.|$|E

5|$|The {{town had}} descended into {{lawlessness}} {{with a number}} of saloons, brothels, dancing halls, and widespread gambling. The town had no <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officers,</b> and the local government officials had become bar keepers.

Over half the residents of the town had signed a petition, addressed to West, alleging that saloons owned by the mayor and City Council members were selling liquor to minors and staying open later than their posted hours. Governor West responded by ordering county officials to restore order, close the saloons, and force the resignations of the corrupt city leaders by December 25, 1913.|$|E

When {{they tried}} to apprehend him, the drug lord opened fire at the security forces before being killed in the fire exchange. Mexico's Procuradurรญa General de la Repรบblica (PGR) officially confirmed his identity through DNA examinations and fingerprint identification. The results were consistent with law enforcement files. While investigators conducted the autopsy {{at a hospital in}} Apatzingรกn, more than 150 <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>officers</b> from the Army, Navy, Federal Police, and the PGR cordoned the area to prevent organized crime members from attempting to steal his body.

At the time of his death, the drug lord was wanted by the Mexican government for charges relating to drug trafficking, organized crime, kidnapping, murder, and theft.|$|E

Unlike Aruba and the United States, Peru does not guarantee the right to a speedy trial. On 6 September, a Peruvian appeals court voted 2 to 1 to reject Van der Sloot's motion that he is being unlawfully held.

New towns such as Moore Haven, Clewiston, and Belle Glade sprouted like the crops. Sugarcane became the primary crop grown in South Florida. Miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in Coral Gables $150million. Undeveloped land north of Miami sold for $30,600 an acre. In 1925, Miami newspapers published editions weighing over , {{most of it in}} real estate advertising. Waterfront property was the most highly valued.

They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas.
