Methods: Archival tumour specimens from patients with colon cancer were analysed in this retrospective immunohistochemical study. HMGB 1, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and podoplanin protein levels were analysed immunohistochemically. In vitro studies using the colon cancer cell line HCT 116 were also undertaken to investigate the relationship between HMGB 1, VEGF-C and nuclear factor (NF) -kB. Results: Specimens from 70 patients with colon cancer were reviewed. The presence of positive HMGB 1 immunohistochemical staining significantly correlated with lymphatic microvessel density, lymph node metastasis and VEGF-C immunohistochemical staining in colon cancer specimens. The presence of positive VEGF-C immunohistochemical staining significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis. The in vitro studies demonstrated that HMGB 1 upregulated VEGF-C mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner in HCT 116 cells, {{and that this was}} mediated via NF-kB.

Approximately one-half of all adults have encapsulated lesions of the lungs or bronchial <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes,</b> whereas in one-third pulmonary and lymphatic lesions are firmly calcified and completely healed. Tuberculous pulmonary lesions of adults who have died of diseases other than tuberculosis are of two types: (1) apical tuberculosis similar to the usual type of fatal phthisis and unaccompanied by caseation, of the regional lymphatic nodes; (2) focal tuberculosis not more commonly situated in the apices of the lungs than elsewhere and accompanied by caseation (or calcification) of the adjacent <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes.</b> Focal pulmonary tuberculosis of adults is identical with the tuberculosis of childhood.

In the part of hematoxylin-eosin negative nodes, small foci of tumour cells (micrometastastasis and isolated tumour cells) can be found using immunostaing or RT-PCR. The aim of this study is to asses clinical and prognostic relevance of these findings. Multicenter, prospective, non-randomised clinical trial running in four Czech centres. All <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes</b> from patients after radical resection are stained using standard hematoxylin-eosin technique, all negative nodes are further processed with immunostaining employing cytokeratin antibody. In the period of two years (1 st January 2009 - 31 st December 2010), 73 patients (100 %) were included into the study from four Czech centers. All patients underwent radical resection for gastric cancer. Subtotal resection was performed in 33 patients (45 %), total gastrectomy in the remaining 40 patients (55 %). Total number of acquired <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes</b> (LN) reached 1245, average number of nodes per one patient was 17. 3. H-E metastasis were disclosed in 364 LN (29 %). All H-E negative nodes were further processed using immunohistochemical staining. Lymph node micrometastasis (MM) were discovered in 35 LN (3 %), isolated tumour cells (ITC) in another 72 LN (6 %). Clinical and prognostic relevance of lymph node MM and ITC was assessed based on the patients' survival data. Preliminary results of this study indicate that presence of the lymph node MM and ITC in gastric cancer patients is not linked to worse oncological outcome.

40|$|The age {{incidence}} of focal tuberculous lesions {{of the lungs}} demonstrates that they {{have their origin in}} most instances in childhood. Focal lesions which heal have been found at all ages after the 2 nd year of life, but in {{more than half of all}} individuals these lesions are acquired between the ages of 10 and 18 years. In the period between 18 and 30 years at least 85 per cent of all individuals have 'acquired focal tuberculous lesions. The occurrence of tuberculous infection in the lungs, in regional <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes,</b> or in some other organs of the body such as the gastrointestinal tract and its lymphatic system, is nearly universal but doubtless a few individuals escape. That focal tuberculous lesions of the lung are occasionally acquired during adult life is shown by the slight increase in the proportion of those with these lesions as age increases from 18 years to old age. Apical lesions of the lung make their appearance in later childhood and occur with increasing frequency from adolescence to old age (50 per cent). After the 2 nd year of life focal tuberculous lesions occurring in situations other than the apices of the lungs tend to heal and after the 10 th year focal lesions are almost invariably encapsulated and latent or healed. Fatal tuberculosis after the 10 th year is with few exceptions apical in origin. The apices are not only more susceptible to infection in later life but once infected afford less resistance to the extension of the lesion. The present series of cases has furnished opportunity to observe the character of the apical lesion in lungs of individuals previously infected with tuberculosis. With one exception the apical lesion (in eight instances) has pursued a chronic course and, encapsulated by fibrous tissue, has remained limited to the extreme apex of the lung. In one instance in a woman with advanced malignant disease chronic pulmonary tuberculosis has been progressive. Tuberculosis of the apices in those who have previously acquired a focal tuberculous lesion has pursued a chronic course and in most instances has remained latent or has completely healed. A very small group of instances of fatal pulmonary tuberculosis suggests that apical lesions in those who have not undergone previous infection may assume an unusually severe character. One instance of apical tuberculosis unaccompanied by focal lesions and followed by tuberculosis of the thoracic duct and disseminated miliary tuberculosis has been especially significant. Apical tuberculosis unaccompanied by evidence of preexisting tuberculosis may be accompanied by tuberculosis of the regional <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes,</b> whereas apical tuberculosis in an individual with a preexistent focal tuberculous lesion is not followed by tuberculosis of adjacent <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes.</b> It is well known that tuberculosis in previously uninfected animals is followed by tuberculosis of adjacent <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes,</b> whereas a second infection fails to implicate the regional <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes.</b> This relation has been well illustrated by the lungs of a monkey which acquired in confinement acute tuberculous pneumonia limited to the left lung; the <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes</b> on this side were greatly enlarged and caseous. The following observations indicate that apical tuberculosis of adults is not the result of infantile tuberculosis but is caused by subsequent infection: (a) Apical tuberculosis does not have its highest incidence, in accordance with common belief, in early adult life when focal infections acquired in childhood are relatively fresh and active but is more common in later life when the focal lesions of childhood have in most instances completely healed. It is noteworthy that most of these apical lesions of later life pursue a chronic course and are discovered at autopsy in individuals who have died from other causes. (b) The well characterized lesions of tuberculosis acquired in childhood and found in adults with apical lesions are almost invariably calcified and healed. The apical lesion is in most instances relatively fresh and caseous whereas the focal pulmonary lesion and associated lesions of regional <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes</b> exhibit no evidence of activity. (c) In a large proportion of instances of associated focal and apical tuberculosis the focal lesion is in one lung, whereas the apical lesion is limited to the opposite apex. This relation affords no support to the view that tuberculous lesions may be transmitted to the apex by way of the lymphatics...|$|R

We studied 61 isolates collected in humans between 2001 and 2008, as well as the reference strain, M. intracellulare ATCC 13950. Results We identified 45 MIRU-VNTR candidates, of which 17 corresponded to the MIRU-VNTR identified in the genome of M. intracellulare ATCC 13950. Among the 45 potential MIRU-VNTR, seven were selected for use in a MIRU-VNTR assay applied to our collection of isolates. Forty-four patterns were found by MIRU-VNTR typing and the discriminatory power of the assay was high with a Hunter-Gaston diversity index of 0. 98.

At present, fine needle aspiration puncture biopsy has become widespread. The objective of the research: To establish the reliability of fine needle aspiration puncture biopsy {{in the formulation of}} a preliminary diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer. Materials and methods. During the period from 2014 to 2016, the clinic received 122 patients with a preliminary diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer. All patients in the prehospital stage were subjected to ultrasound {{examination of}} the neck with fine needle aspiration puncture biopsy of the thyroid nodules, and in case of metastatic lesions – and lymph nodes. Staining of smears were performed by the method of Romanovsky–Giemsa with phosphate buffer to achieve pH 6. 0 – 6. 3 (optimal pH 6. 2) and fixation in methanol. Results. All patients underwent surgical treatment according to the protocol of the treatment of highly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. With the preliminary diagnosis T 1 a-вN 0 M 0, patients underwent thyroidectomy, central <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes</b> dissection, in the remaining cases, thyroidectomy, central and lateral <b>lymphatic</b> <b>nodes</b> dissection from the affected side of thyroid gland. We performed 46 thyroidectomies with central lymphatic dissection (37, 7...|$|R
