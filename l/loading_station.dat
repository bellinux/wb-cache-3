5|$|The {{original}} version at Six Flags Over Georgia features a dual-platform <b>loading</b> <b>station,</b> permitting three trains to operate simultaneously. Each train has seven cars, with each car carrying four riders side-by-side {{in a single}} row. The other two versions use a more standard single-platform <b>loading</b> <b>station.</b> While this allows a maximum of only two trains to operate at a time, each train compensates by having one additional row {{for a total of}} eight rows per train.|$|E
5|$|Galactica {{features}} a dual-platform <b>loading</b> <b>station,</b> permitting three trains to operate simultaneously. Each train has seven cars, with each car carrying four riders side-by-side {{in a single}} row. This configuration allows for up to 1500 riders per hour.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2001, one of {{the trains}} failed {{to stop at the}} ride's brake run, colliding with the other train in the <b>loading</b> <b>station.</b> 22 people were sent to hospitals, without any major injuries. The ride reopened on August 18, 2001.|$|E
25|$|The ride's queue begins {{alongside}} the unload station and continues in one long stretch towards the <b>load</b> <b>station.</b> When {{in line with}} the <b>load</b> <b>station,</b> the queue performs several switchbacks before allowing riders to line up alongside air gates to let them on the ride. On {{the far side of the}} <b>load</b> <b>station</b> several television monitors loop through a video explaining how to get on the ride. The video also details that the riders' mission is to rescue a trapped sea lion for the Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation.|$|R

5|$|A train may {{occasionally}} {{experience a}} rollback following a launch. A rollback {{occurs when the}} train fails to make it {{over the top of}} the tower and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka includes retractable magnetic brakes on its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back into the <b>loading</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads through the hole in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests see before disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E

40|$|Compared to {{conventional}} cars, electric vehicles (EVs) still suffer from considerably shorter cruising ranges. Combined with the sparsity of battery <b>loading</b> <b>stations,</b> the com-plete transition to E-mobility still seems {{a long way}} to go. In this paper, we consider the problem of placing as few <b>loading</b> <b>stations</b> as possible so that on any shortest path there are sufficiently many not to run out of energy. We show how to model this problem and introduce heuristics which provide close-to-optimal solutions even in large road networks. 1...|$|R
50|$|Gas fired base <b>load</b> <b>stations</b> {{have opened}} at Oakey (2000), Swanbank (2002), Yabulu (near Townsville, 2004), Braemar (2006), Darling Downs and Condamine (both 2010) and Diamantina (2014).|$|R
25|$|On August 6, 2001, one of {{the trains}} failed {{to stop at the}} ride's brake run, colliding with the other train in the <b>loading</b> <b>station.</b> 22 people were taken to hospitals, without any major injuries. The ride would reopen twelve days later on August 18, 2001.|$|E
25|$|The coxswain {{would then}} call, 'Boat manned,' to the {{telephone}} operator at the <b>loading</b> <b>station,</b> who, in turn, reported to the 'LC' Control Room. The coxswain would then warn the troops to mind the pulleys {{at the ends of}} falls fore and aft, which could wave freely about when the craft had been set in the water. The task of hooking on and casting off from the ship required skill and seamanship from the coxswain, bowman, and sternsheetsman. The snatch blocks used were heavy steel and difficult to handle. The bowman and sternsheetsman stood by his respective block, as the craft was lowered into the water. At a time when there was sufficient slack in the falls both had to cast off at the same instant, and the blocks had to be released while there was slack in the falls. If the boat was not freed at both ends at once {{the rise and fall of}} the sea could cause the boat to tip, swamp, and perhaps capsize with loss of life. Casting-off was done in all sorts of sea conditions, and the sea might be rising and falling a metre or more (6' swells were not uncommon on D-Day). A combination of skill and luck could redeem a failure to cast-off, nevertheless. On D-Day, an LCA of Royal Marine 535 Flotilla, LSI Glenearn, released all but its after falls, which were jammed, and the craft tilted alarmingly to 45 degrees. The coxswain kept his head, calming the passengers, while seamen worked to free the falls. Once free, the coxswain need to get the LCA away to prevent colliding with the towering side of the LSI as it rose and fell with the swells.|$|E
500|$|Riders {{enter the}} queue from the Sci-Fi City themed area of Universal Studios Singapore, the Lower Lot at Universal Studios Hollywood or Production Central at Universal Studios Florida. The first {{portion of the}} queue is a large {{collection}} of switchbacks. The later part of the queue is themed as a [...] (NEST) base. A series of signs and video screens are located within this area. The video screens play briefings from General Morshower, Bumblebee, Ironhide, and Ratchet, who explain that the Decepticons have come to Earth {{in search of the}} AllSpark. Optimus Prime concludes the briefing by introducing all of the Autobots that are featured in the ride. Towards the end of the queue, guests are given a pair of 3D glasses. Once guests arrive at the <b>loading</b> <b>station,</b> they are grouped and loaded into a ride vehicle modeled on an Autobot named Evac.|$|E
50|$|New {{coal fired}} base <b>load</b> <b>stations</b> have opened at Callide C (2001), Millmerran (2002), Tarong (2003) and Kogan Creek (2007), {{the latter being}} the largest single {{generator}} in Australia.|$|R
50|$|A year later, {{a double}} {{chairlift}} was installed up the double-black trail Mach One. The lift, later numbered Lift 3, ran from near the present-day Peak 8 SuperConnect's midway <b>load</b> <b>station</b> up to {{near the top}} of Lift 5.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year the first {{unit of the}} Gladstone Power Station was commissioned, and this base <b>load</b> <b>station</b> remains the largest by capacity in the state. This enabled the decommissioning of the Howard, Rockhampton and Townsville power stations by 1980.|$|R
500|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear {{is located}} at Hotellneset, [...] {{northwest}} of town. It has a [...] long runway {{and is the only}} airport that is permitted to serve aircraft from off the archipelago. Scandinavian Airlines operates daily flights to Oslo and Tromsø, while there are irregular flights to Russia. Lufttransport operates regular charter services to Svea Airport and Ny-Ålesund Airport, Hamnerabben. Arktikugol operates helicopters to Barentsburg and Pyramiden. There are two quays in Longyearbyen, one for export of coal and one for general goods. From 1907 to 1987, the mining companies operated a network of aerial tramways to transport coal from the mines to the port. In the years 1907/1908 the then worldwide leading German wire ropeways company Adolf Bleichert & Co. from Lipsia built a material cableway from mine 1 to the ship's <b>loading</b> <b>station,</b> which was later supplemented by a cableway to mine 2. The remains of these wire ropeways and later successors to other mines are still visible today.|$|E
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{features}} two fiberglass trains with stadium-style seating. Each train has nine cars with {{two rows of}} paired seats per car. When the ride was re-themed in 2009, on-board audio {{was added to the}} trains. On each one, the two rear seats of the fifth car have speakers mounted in the headrests of the seats that play a soundtrack. This reduced the capacity of the trains from 36 to 34. Upon reopening following the change, a recording of various film quotes played while the train was in motion, ending with a loop of Bizarro and several other people chanting his name. Eventually the audio track was switched to a compilation of clips from different rock songs, although the ending portion of the audio loop was kept due to popular demand. While on the final brake run waiting to return to the <b>loading</b> <b>station,</b> riders hear Bizarro chanting his name and [...] "Bizarro #1". The new trains paint scheme was changed from blue and red to purple. Each seat originally had an individual hydraulic T-shaped lapbar restraints, but after several safety modifications, the restraints now consist of two metal bars on each side.|$|E
500|$|After riders {{board the}} sim-cars and the seat belts are fastened, {{the car that}} they {{designed}} will undergo four different tests: capability, efficiency, responsiveness, and power. In the capability test the car first connects to OnStar, then accelerates past a rain projection and skids out of control. Next, the continuing path disappears and the sim-car turns around to speed up again. A short time later, the sim-car makes a sharp left turn as a lighting bolt strikes. The car then passes by a futuristic city. Following the capability test, the results of which car designs scored {{the best in the}} test are displayed. The sim-car then begins the efficiency test. In the first part, the sim-cars are scanned for [...] "optimum eco-efficiency". The second test performs an aero-dynamic test on the vehicle. Finally, a [...] "hyper-spectrum imaging" [...] takes place. Again, after the test is complete, the best scores are displayed. The third test, responsiveness, is next. The sim-car accelerates around hairpin turns with laser-projected trees. It then enters a tunnel to encounter the 18-wheeler from the original version though it is now shown with lasers. When the vehicle exits the tunnel, the results for the responsiveness test are displayed and all of the test icons are displayed. The final test is power where the sim-car stops for a moment then accelerates through flashing purple arches to a wall with the ride's logo on it leading to the outside portion of the ride. Just after the ride exits the building, a picture of the guests is taken. As the sim-car's speed is increased, it makes a right turn, followed by a wide left, a straight section, and one final long left turn. When the test is complete, the vehicle returns to the <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> where the next riders board. Then, guests use their MagicBand, ticket, or design key that has their Chevrolet Custom Concept Vehicle that they made in the Design Studio to play games and make an ad in the [...] "Chevrolet Showroom." [...] In the showroom, you can also check out some of the newest vehicles Chevrolet has created in their lineup. There is also a gift shop located at the exit like the original version of the ride.|$|E
50|$|Another base <b>load</b> <b>station</b> was {{commissioned}} at Tarong in 1984, {{the year the}} Wivenhoe pumped storage hydro-electric station opened {{in conjunction with the}} commissioning of a new water supply dam near Brisbane. This additional capacity enabled the decommissioning of the Bulimba power station in 1986.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} approach to approximate the expected waiting times for loads {{arriving at the}} <b>loading</b> <b>stations</b> in discrete-space, fixed-window, closed-loop conveyors. The expected waiting times are important for estimating the expected work-in-process (WIP) levels at individual <b>loading</b> <b>stations</b> (which {{can be used to}} facilitate buffer sizing) and to measure the overall performance of the conveyor loop. Derivation of the expected waiting times is complicated by our observation that the contents of adjacent windows on the conveyor is correlated under a range of conveyor speeds, and the expected waiting times are affected by this correlation. In fact, using analytical results and a numerical example based on simulation, we show that the above correlation has a significant impact on expected waiting times. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

2500|$|Once {{out of the}} quarry, a {{block was}} moved to a <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> for {{transport}} to the mill site. [...] The first method (1906 through 1909) used the 50-ton electric hoist, which lowered the block down and onto a Pea Vine cable-powered cart. The cart then moved on rails with downgrades to 54% to a <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> where the block was transferred to a wagon for towing to the mill site. [...] The wagons were first towed by teams of four horses then in 1908 by a 110-horsepower steam tractor previously used for logging. [...] The road to the mill site {{was built in the}} 1890s by John Osgood to his quarry, which was just below the CYMC started quarry. [...] By 1910, the method changed with the 50-ton hoist attaching a block to an overhead cable for lowering [...] to a new <b>loading</b> <b>station.</b> [...] Here the block was placed on a flatcar for towing by an electric tram (designed by General Electric) on standard-gauge railroad track to the town of Marble and into the mill site. [...] Electricity to power the tram came from the CYMC-built hydro-electric plant located just east of the town.|$|E

2500|$|To {{operate the}} quarries, {{structures}} for various functions were {{built around the}} quarry exterior. [...] Wooden derricks were located by and above the openings to lift blocks out of the quarries. [...] The boiler house (providing steam power for quarrying equipment) was the last major addition (second building {{to the right of}} opening 2). In front of the boiler house is a 50-ton (49.875 metric ton) electric hoist and the hoist electric power house is {{to the right of the}} boiler house. Below the boiler house area near the bottom of the photo is the Pea Vine (winch-cable powered carts on rails) used to move marble from the quarry to the <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> several hundred feet away, where it was placed on wagons for transport to the mill site. [...] There are other facilities to the right of opening 1; compressor house, machine shop, and bunk house. [...] To provide the needed electricity, the company built a hydro-electric plant with the generators located just east of the town limits and completed in July 1907.|$|E
2500|$|By 1914 {{the quarry}} {{configuration}} {{had gone through}} several changes but from then on remained largely unchanged until the shut down in 1941. Several buildings located {{to the right of}} opening 1 had been relocated to opening 3, such as the machine shop (first building to the left of opening 2), offices (to the left of the machine shop), and the compressor house (first building on the right of opening 2 and left of the boiler house). [...] The boarding house (not visible to the right of opening 1) was also relocated. In 1910, a new system was finished to get the stone from the quarry down to the finishing mill in the town of Marble. [...] Two tall wooden derricks (one to the left opening 2 and another {{on the east side of}} Yule Creek) suspended an [...] long cable. [...] The 50-ton (49.875 metric ton) electric hoist attached a block to the cable for lowering marble [...] to the new <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> and onto a railroad car (on standard gauge track) towed by the new electric tram finished in 1910. The electric tram replaced the Pea Vine. After closing in October 1941, the equipment inside was removed and the wood structures fell apart.|$|E

50|$|These diesels can in {{some cases}} {{be up and running}} in {{parallel}} as quickly as two minutes, with no impact on the site (the office or factory need not shut down). This is far quicker than a base <b>load</b> power <b>station</b> which can take 12 hours from cold, and faster than a gas turbine, which can take several minutes. Whilst diesels are very expensive in fuel terms, they are only used a few hundred hours per year in this duty, and their availability can prevent the need for base <b>load</b> <b>station</b> running inefficiently at part load continuously. The diesel fuel used is fuel that would have been used in testing anyway.|$|R
