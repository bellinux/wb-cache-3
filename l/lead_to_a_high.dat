25|$|In 1331 the burgraves {{moved to}} Ansbach. In 1363 they were {{elevated}} to sovereigns and in 1417 they were feoffed with the margrave of Brandenburg. Expensive holding of court and persistent {{conflicts with the}} imperial city Nuremberg <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> level of debt of the young principality and consequently they imposed an unbearable burden of taxes upon their subjects. As a consequence, on 6 May 1525 the German Peasants' War also broke out in southern Franconia. On this day rebellious peasants gathered on Hesselberg's peak, thence they went to Wassertrüdingen and captured the margrave vogt. Afterwards they plundered the monastery of Auhausen. On their way to Heidenheim the peasants were captured or killed by margrave soldiers from Gunzenhausen.|$|E
25|$|Before Luas was launched, it was {{feared that}} the tram system would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> number of fatal accidents. So far, however, {{there have been only}} four fatalities. There have been many occurrences of cars {{striking}} trams, mainly caused by motorists breaking red lights. On 16 September 2009, a Luas collided with a Dublin Bus on the O'Connell Street-Abbey Street Junction. 22 people were injured in the collision, 3 seriously, including the tram driver. Early investigations suggested that the bus had the green light to move, and that the Luas must have had technical problems. The Luas driver was later charged with dangerous driving causing harm and operating a tram in a manner which posed risk to others. He was subsequently acquitted of dangerous conduct by the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between diet and acne is unclear, {{as there is}} no high-quality evidence that establishes any definitive link between them. High-glycemic-load diets have been found to have different degrees of effect on acne severity. Multiple randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies have found a lower-glycemic-load diet to be effective in reducing acne. There is weak observational evidence suggesting that dairy milk consumption is positively associated with a higher frequency and severity of acne. Milk contains whey protein and hormones such as bovine IGF-1 and precursors of dihydrotestosterone. These components are hypothesized to promote the effects of insulin and IGF-1 and thereby [...] increase the production of androgen hormones, sebum, and promote the formation of comedones. [...] Effects from other potentially contributing dietary factors, such as consumption of chocolate or salt, are not supported by the evidence. Chocolate does contain varying amounts of sugar, which can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> glycemic load, and it can be made with or without milk. Few studies have examined the {{relationship between}} obesity and acne. Vitamin B12 may trigger skin outbreaks similar to acne (acneiform eruptions), or worsen existing acne, when taken in doses exceeding the recommended daily intake.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{there have}} been many {{religions}} throughout history, and therefore many conceptions of God (or gods), some assert that all of them need to be factored into the Wager, in an argument known as the argument from inconsistent revelations. This, its proponents argue, would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> probability of believing in [...] "the wrong god", which, they claim, eliminates the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his Wager. Denis Diderot, a contemporary of Voltaire, concisely expressed this opinion when asked about the Wager, saying [...] "an Imam could reason the same way". J. L. Mackie notes that [...] "the church within which alone salvation is to be found is not necessarily the Church of Rome, but perhaps that of the Anabaptists or members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or the Muslim Sunnis or the worshipers of Kali or of Odin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pond {{swooping}} {{is a form}} {{of competitive}} parachuting wherein canopy pilots attempt to touch down and glide across a small body of water, and onto the shore. Events provide lighthearted competition, rating accuracy, speed, distance and style. Points and peer approval are reduced when a participant [...] "chows", or fails to reach shore and sinks into the water. Swoop ponds are not deep enough to drown in under ordinary circumstances, their main danger being from the concussive force of an incorrectly executed maneuver. In order to gain distance, swoopers increase their speed by executing a [...] "hook turn", wherein both speed and difficulty increase with the angle of the turn. Hook turns are most commonly measured in increments of 90 degrees. As the angle of the turn increases, both horizontal and vertical speed are increased, such that a misjudgement of altitude or imprecise manipulation of the canopy's control structures (front risers, rear risers, and toggles) can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> speed impact with the pond or Earth. Prevention of injury is the main reason why a pond is used for swooping rather than a grass landing area.|$|E
