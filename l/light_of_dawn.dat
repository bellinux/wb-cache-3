5|$|Eos– The Goddess of Dawn and {{the sister}} of Helios. Eos told Kratos of the machinations of Morpheus, who had taken {{advantage}} of her brother's disappearance. When Kratos found Eos in the Caves of Olympus, she advised him to find the Primordial Fires and free Helios' loyal Fire Steeds, as they could find the Sun God. She also provided him with the magical ability, <b>Light</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dawn.</b> She did not appear in God of War III, leaving her fate unknown. The character was voiced by Erin Torpey in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos: {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of Zeus—offering alternative combat options. Kratos only learns three magical abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the Efreet, the <b>Light</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dawn,</b> and Charon's Wrath, giving him {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to Poseidon's Trident in God of War— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{aggression}} {{may even}} extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded as evil. Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra {{was believed to}} swallow the multitude of other gods, who in this instance are equated with the stars, which vanish at sunrise and reappear at sunset. In doing so, he absorbs the gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar Eye is said to assist in this effort, slaughtering the gods for Ra to eat. The red <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn</b> therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} led by Emmanuel Bodjolle and Étienne Eyadéma met {{and agreed}} to remove Olympio from office. The coup {{began in the early}} morning hours of 13 January 1963 with shooting heard throughout the capital city of Lomé as the military attempted to arrest Olympio and his cabinet. Just before dawn, shots were heard outside of the United States Embassy which was close to the residence of Olympio. With the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn,</b> the dead body of Olympio was found three feet from the gate at the front of the embassy by the U.S. Ambassador Leon B. Poullada. It was claimed that when the soldiers attempted to arrest him in the streets of Lomé, he resisted and was shot in the process. Eyadéma claimed later that he was the one who pulled the trigger killing Olympio, but this is not clearly established. His body was taken inside the embassy and later picked up by his family.|$|E
25|$|Two {{thousand}} years ago in ancient Central America, a battle was waged between Totec, the Guardian of the Light, and Xolotl, the Keeper of Darkness. Totec's army was defeated when Xolotl used the mirror of smoke to unleash hordes of ghastly creatures that fought on his behalf. Totec survived the battle and {{found a way to}} defeat Xolotl, imprisoning him in the mirror of smoke and becoming its immortal guardian {{in the form of a}} stone statue. In the present day, Lara Croft reads of the legend and attempts to find the mirror. After a long and dangerous journey she is successful. While examining the mirror, she is caught unaware by a band of mercenaries. Led by the local warlord, they had followed her into the temple. Unknowing or unbelieving of the curse upon the mirror, the warlord takes it from Lara. His reckless handling of the mirror releases Xolotl. The stone statue of Totec comes to life and warns Lara that Xolotl must be stopped before the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn.</b> Depending on the number of players participating, Lara and Totec either join forces or go their separate ways to try to stop Xolotl.|$|E
500|$|In Dannemann's initial statements, {{she said}} she awoke at 11 a.m. on September 18. During the inquest she stated that she awoke at 10:20a.m., and left to {{purchase}} cigarettes, something she had previously failed to mention. In 1971, she wrote a manuscript in which {{she said she}} awoke at 10 a.m. In 1975, during an interview with author Caesar Glebbeek, Dannemann stated that she awoke at 9 a.m. According to Burdon, Dannemann phoned him as [...] "the first <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn</b> was coming through the window." [...] Stickells said he {{received a phone call}} regarding a problem with Hendrix [...] "between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m." [...] Mitchell said he waited for Hendrix at the Speakeasy Club until they closed at 4 a.m., and a couple of hours after his hour and a half drive home, he {{received a phone call from}} Stickells, who told him Hendrix had died. In her statements to the police and coroner's office, Dannemann never mentioned telephoning Burdon.|$|E

2500|$|Mishnah א - In {{the case}} of the evening Shema, recital begins when the Kohanim enter to eat their terumah (תרומה), which is at nightfall. R'Eliezer says it can be recited {{until the end of the}} first watch. He takes [...] "when you lie down" [...] (ובשכבך) to mean the Shema is recited at the time that people lie down to go to sleep, and anyone who will be going to sleep for the night has done so by the end of the first watch. The sages say it can be recited until midnight. And Rabban Gamliel says until the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn.</b> Rabban Gamliel says that {{whatever}} mitzvahs the sages said can be performed only until midnight can actually be performed until the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn.</b> The sages said until midnight to distance a person from procrastination and thus transgression.

2500|$|From Camp IV, climbers {{begin their}} summit push around midnight, with hopes of {{reaching}} the summit (still another 1,000 metres above) within 10 to 12 hours. Climbers first reach [...] "The Balcony" [...] at , a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks {{to the south and}} east in the early <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn.</b> Continuing up the ridge, climbers are then faced with the Three Steps, a series of imposing rock steps which usually forces them to the east into waist-deep snow, a serious avalanche hazard. At , a small table-sized dome of ice and snow marks the South Summit.|$|E
60|$|Now, at length, Tua {{seemed to}} awake. She rubbed {{her eyes and}} looked. There was the {{sleeping}} Asti; there {{on the table beside}} her were the water and the bread; there {{at the foot of the}} couch, glimmering in the low <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn,</b> was the glorious figure of herself draped in the splendid robes.|$|R

60|$|So she ended, and {{listening}} to her, I felt the tears rising in my eyes, {{because she was so}} much alone, and I feared that this god of hers would never come to save her from the torments of the priests.

2500|$|Mary contemplates her fate, {{and that}} of Leicester also: [...] "I have brought misfortune to all". Talbot and Cecil enter and Cecil tells Mary that he holds her death warrant. After Cecil leaves the room, Talbot informs her that Leicester has been ordered to witness her execution. Beside herself with grief, Mary imagines that the ghost of Lord Darnley is {{in the room with}} her, while Talbot offers comfort (Duet: Quando di luce rosea il giorno a me splendea / [...] "While with the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn</b> my life still sparkled"). However, Talbot then presses her about [...] "one more sin": her [...] "unity with" [...] ("uniti eri") Babington, to which she {{initially}} responds [...] "Ah! be silent; it was a fatal error", but, when he insists, adds that [...] "dying my heart affirms it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mishnah ב - The {{time for}} reciting the morning Shema is {{referred}} to by [...] "when you arise" [...] (ובקומך), and this is when there is enough light to distinguish between blue (תכלת) and white wool. R'Eliezer says between blue and green wool, which would be at a slightly later time. R'Yehoshua says {{until the end of}} the first three hours of the day, because it was customary for kings to still be rising until then. The hours referred to are seasonal hours, which are defined by measuring from either the first <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn</b> to nightfall or from sunrise to sunset (this is a famous argument) and dividing this into twelve equal parts. Halacha accords with R'Yehoshua and if one recites the Shema after the first three hours, it is as if he is reading from the Torah, which shows that reciting the Shema properly is even greater than reciting words of Torah. The ideal time to recite the Shema is shortly before sunrise so the Shemoneh Esrei can be started at exactly sunrise. This is what it means to join the redemption blessing to the Shemoneh Esrei.

2500|$|The main landings, {{those by}} 2nd Canadian Division, were mostly crushed on the beaches. At Puys (Blue Beach), {{some of the}} LCAs {{transporting}} The Royal Regiment of Canada mistook for their guide boat another similar craft. Corrections in course were made, but this was {{at the cost of}} arriving {{a quarter of an hour}} late. Touch down at Puys was about 05:10 in the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn</b> and amid German flares, instead of 04:50 darkness. Some LCAs were able to provide the men first off a dry landing, but those last off the landing craft had to jump into the water and wade ashore. (In certain beaching conditions, each man's last step as he ran off the ramp pushed the LCA back out to sea.) Alasdair Ferguson, second-in-command of the seven LCAs of the 10th LCA Flotilla, carried on HMS Princess Astrid, felt his LCA scrape bottom as enemy fire poured down from a cliff, entering the craft. Having touched down, he ordered [...] "Down ramp!" [...] and urged the troops of the Royal Regiment of Canada and the Royal Canadian Artillery onto the beach. Soldiers were shot down before they cleared the ramp, where their bodies blocked others. Others fell as they crossed the beach to the seawall [...] away. The operation was not successful. All three waves (1st and 2nd LCA, and 3rd LCM1) on Blue Beach were subject to withering fire. The Royal Regiment were trapped against the impenetrable seawall.|$|E
