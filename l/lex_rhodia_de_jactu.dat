40|$|To go by sea {{in ancient}} times could be very dangerous. To the risks of the sea were added the threats of men, no less devastating. Not only the pirates, but also {{individuals}} and entire communities benefited from {{the wreck of the}} ships. A true 'shipwreck industry' flourished in many Mediterranean locations. For many peoples the remains of wrecked ships, the cargo, the same crew were considered property of those who seized them. Rome, instead, not only renounced to exercise the ius naufragii, but endeavored to combat such a phenomenon, particularly harmful to maritime trade. There are numerous Roman normative interventions intended to protect the shipwrecked and their property from the robberies of coastal populations.

The thesis examines Greek influences {{on the most important}} legal source of the Archaic period of Roman law, Law of the Twelve Tables, where the very idea of codification is a Greek influence that stands in opposition to the Roman concept of binding customs of the ancestors - maiorum mores. The example of the <b>Lex</b> <b>Rhodia</b> <b>de</b> iactu and <b>Lex</b> Hieronica shows that Roman legal science did not hesitate to embrace specific rules if it was necessary for the regulation of legal relations with non-Roman, especially Greek, social and business surroundings. Finally, the work {{deals with the}} influence of the Greek philosophers - especially the sophists - {{for the development of the}} skill of the legal argumentation of the Roman jurists.

40|$|O alijamento é um instituto próprio do Direito Marítimo (romano). Trata-se do arremesso de mercadorias ou instrumentos da embarcação a fim de salvar ambas do naufrágio. Seu efeito é a repartição de danos entre os envolvidos (contributio), a qual caracteriza, com o tempo, as avarias grossas. No Digesto, é possível encontrar (quase) todos os elementos que o constituem. Dentre esses, discute-se sobre a intencionalidade do ato, ou seja, quem decide sua realização. Ao assumirem a {{locatio conductio}} como tutela do instituto, os juristas romanos escolhem o magister navis [= capitão da embarcação] como único elo comum entre todos os interessados no evento, e, assim, capaz de decidir sobre esse (D. 14, 2, 2 pr.). Entretanto, também consideram a existência de uma junta deliberativa, formada pelos comerciantes a bordo e passageiros, que deveriam ser consultados (D. 14, 2, 2, 1). Da dúvida se o ato intencional faz referência ao magister navis ou também à junta deliberativa, revela-se um jogo de poder, que condiciona a leitura da <b>lex</b> <b>Rhodia.</b> É necessário determinar o papel desempenhado por cada um desses no alijamento para que se conheça seu conceito no período justinianeu e ajude a compreender esse aspecto na tradição jurídico-marítima posterior. The {{jettison}} {{is a specific}} Admiralty (Roman) Law institution. It means the sacrifice of cargo or ship instruments {{in order to save}} both from shipwreck. Its effect is the splitting damages between the involved parts (contributio), which characterizes, in time, the gross average. In the Digest, itś possible to find (almost) all elements that constitute it. Among them, the intentionality of the act is debated, it means, who can decide about that disposal. Once they agreed with the locatio conductio to patronize the institution, the Roman jurists chose the magister navis [= c̈aptain of the ship]̈ as the only common link between all interested parts in the occurrence and, therefore, capable of making this call (D. 14, 2, 2 pr.). Nonetheless, they also considered the existence of a deliberative commission, composed by the onboard merchants and passengers, who should be consulted (D. 14, 2, 2, 1). From the doubt whether the intentional act refers to the magister navis or also to the deliberative commission, a game of power unveils, conditioning the <b>lex</b> <b>Rhodia</b> reading. Determining the role played by each one of these characters in the jettison is necessary to know its concept in the Justinian period and help to comprehend this aspect in the posterior Admiralty Law tradition...|$|R

40|$|The {{industry}} {{environment has}} changed in the past decades becoming more complex and unforeseeable than ever. New information and communication technologies and new relationships within and between organisations favoured cultural and socio-economic changes so that interdependency of company services and functions has become evident. The company today faces multiple issues such as faster product cycle times and new industrial and environmental constraints. Those issues result in the redefinition of performance structures of the company. On one hand, on an organizational level, this redefinition consists in the process redesign (Business Process Reengineering, BPR) that helps taking into account the integration of the company activities, which were strongly compartmentalized before their reorganization. On the other hand, it consists in the refocusing of the company on its core competencies by transferring company activities or functions, which are considered as not strategic, to external partners. Our research work is situated within this context. In this PhD, we study the problem of process modeling and redesign {{in the context of the}} logistics reorganization of the industrial Group Rhodia. Our objective is to examine how to attain an optimized transverse company management (internal aspects), to redefine the company processes in the context of outsourcing of certain process parts (focus on core competencies), and finally to integrate an interdependent and multi-actor process organization (partner relationships). Within this perspective, our research aims at bringing about methodological tools and configuration practices for supply chain management by particularly concentrating on supply chain processes as well as the links between the activities and actors that conduct those processes. Our will concerning this research work on an industrial ground is to demonstrate the importance of process organization within the supply chain as well as to present the concepts and approaches, which evolve around process modeling in order to propose, in fine, an outsourcing methodology that is supported by process modeling and reorganization. Thus, the first chapter of our PhD lays the framework of our research: the supply chain organization and the importance of processes within this one. The growing global complexity of the company's industrial environment has changed the mechanisms and organization principles. The company engages in an improvement of its way of working, internally within its organization and externally with its direct partners. The concept of supply chain management is clearly associated to this evolution because it is greatly based on process reorganization of the company for which the major stakes consist in a transverse organization in order to attain global supply chain improvement and not locally optimized silos. The first chapter also allows us to present the problematic we address in our research work: the supply chain organization in the context of outsourcing. Therefore, we introduce the industrial background of our work (restructuring of the organization we consider) as well as the industry sector and the related issues (outsourcing objectives in the sector of specialty chemicals). The Group Rhodia faces major stakes of cost reduction and wants to refocus on its core competencies, the specialty chemicals, through the outsourcing of those parts of its logistics, which the Group considers as not being part of its core organization. Rhodia thus aims, through activity reorganization and process outsourcing, at simplifying and lightening its organization in order to be more productive and to keep and attain new competitive advantage in its four main industries: pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemistry, food and consumer goods, industry and services, automotive, and electronics, and fibers. This chapter allows us to lay and present the basis for our reflection of defining and carrying out the outsourcing process. In order to reach this objective, we concentrate in the second chapter on the concepts and approaches, which are associated to process modeling and reorganization. First we determine the general articulation of the approach we propose and we present a certain number of models, methods, tools, etc. enabling internal process reorganization and accompanying the outsourcing of activities to external service providers. We notice that process reorganization is a relatively new concept, which is particularly being considered in industry during the last decade. The research work around this subject and the methodologies, techniques, etc., used in the industry, points out that in comparison to the “organizational” aspects, there is a predominance for the “technical” point of view in that matter. It is the organizational aspects we consider in our research work in order to extend the application of BPR in the context of outsourcing and the sharing of logistics activities of the partners. We use for our work an international process standard of the supply chain, the SCOR-model, which was chosen by the Group Rhodia for the management of its main management processes. This chapter allows us to develop a structuring methodology including three steps (“as is” – “to be” – “go live”) and to employ this one in the case of outsourcing. The third chapter allows us to apply our research work on an industrial level. Through different case studies, led within the Group Rhodia, we illustrate the importance of an integrated and standardized vision and the activity interdependency for the process reorganization applied to logistics outsourcing. We propose a three stage development: the process modeling, analysis and reorganization, helping to make evolve the company on an internal level, allowing the activity outsourcing (in our case a part of the logistics process), and finally improving multi actor functioning of the supply chain. In order to define a consistent process that is under control, it is necessary, before outsourcing whatever company activity, to have a global vision of the tasks that are to be executed in order to identify those, which are likely to be outsourced, and those, which need to be hold internally. Moreover, for a successful outsourcing process, it is essential to integrate in this one the external service provider as a strategic partner of this reorganization effort. Hence, one also needs to consider the interdependency between all activities so as to respect the global process and thus the supply chain. The third chapter thus allows us to propose a process modeling approach in the context of outsourcing in the following way: ¬ “Why to outsource” – decision making for outsourcing ¬ “What to outsource” – activity identification for the outsourcing effort ¬ “How to outsource” – BPR with the help of the SCOR-model and “traditional” BPR methodology for the processes, which are not in the scope of the SCOR-model Thus based on the results of our industrial case studies, we establish in this chapter an approach for process reorganization and outsourcing within the context of Rhodia's supply chain and define an outsourcing plan through process reorganization. Finally, we conclude this PhD by turning back on the academic and industrial contributions of this manuscript concerning process reorganization of the company in the context of outsourcing. We present at last a certain number of research perspectives in this areaPour faire face à un environnement de plus en plus changeant et compétitif, les entreprises sont conduites à une redéfinition de leurs structures. Sur le plan organisationnel, la redéfinition des processus permet de mieux prendre en compte l'intégration d'activités autrefois fortement cloisonnées; le recentrage des entreprises sur leur cœur de métier conduit à un transfert d'activités ou de fonctions jugées non stratégiques vers des partenaires externes. Cette restructuration qui se traduit par une intégration fonctionnelle importante, permet, à travers des processus transversaux d'atteindre un objectif commun à tous : satisfaire le client au moindre coût. C'est dans ce contexte qu'intervient notre travail de recherche. Nous traitons dans cette thèse, dans le cadre de la réorganisation logistique d'un grand groupe industriel, la problématique de la modélisation et de la réorganisation des processus pour une gestion transversale optimisée d'une entreprise (aspect interne), la redéfinition des processus dans le cadre de l'externalisation d'une partie d'un processus (recentrage des activité), et finalement l'organisation de processus interdépendants multi acteurs (relations partenariales). Ce travail vise à apporter des outils méthodologiques et des pratiques d'aide à la configuration des chaînes, en particulier dans le cadre de l'externalisation. Ainsi, le premier chapitre pose le cadre de nos recherches : l'organisation des chaînes logistiques et l'importance des processus au sein de celles-ci. Ce chapitre permet de poser et présenter les bases de notre réflexion pour définir et mettre en œuvre un processus d'externalisation. Pour atteindre cet objectif, le deuxième chapitre est centré sur les concepts et approches relatifs à la modélisation et à la réorganisation des processus. Nous déterminons dans un premier temps l'articulation générale de l'approche d'intervention que nous proposons et nous présentons un certain nombre de modèles, méthodes, outils, etc. pour permettre une réorganisation des processus internes et accompagner l'externalisation d'activités vers des prestataires extérieurs. Nous constatons que si la réorganisation des processus est une notion relativement récente, elle fait l'objet d'une attention toute particulière, ces dernières années, dans les milieux industriels. Le tour d'horizon des travaux de recherche et des méthodologies, techniques, outils, etc. utilisés par les industriels, montre qu'il existe une prépondérance sur l'axe « technologie » par rapport à l'axe « organisation ». C'est sur ce dernier point que nous positionnons nos travaux pour étendre les champs du BPR au cadre de l'externalisation et du partage partenariales d'activités dans l'exécution du processus logistique. Nous utilisons pour cela un standard international des processus de la chaîne logistique, le modèle SCOR, qui a été choisi par le Groupe Rhodia pour la gestion de ses processus principaux. Ce chapitre nous permet alors de développer une méthodologie structurante en trois temps (« as is » - « to be » - « go live ») et d'employer celle-ci dans le cadre de l'externalisation Le troisième chapitre nous permet d'appliquer notre proposition au niveau industriel. A travers différentes études menées au sein du Groupe Rhodia, nous illustrons l'intérêt d'une vision intégrant standardisation et dépendances entre activités, dans la réorganisation des processus appliquée à la mutualisation ou l'externalisation. Nous proposons une évolution en trois temps : modélisation, analyse et restructuration des processus pour une évolution interne à l'entreprise, puis pour l'externalisation d'activités (logistiques dans le cas qui nous intéresse), et finalement pour l'amélioration du fonctionnement multi acteurs. Le troisième chapitre nous permet de proposer une approche pour la modélisation des processus dans le cadre d'une opération d'externalisation : ¬ « Pourquoi externaliser » - la décision d'externalisation ¬ « Quoi externaliser » - la détermination des activités à externaliser ¬ « Comment externaliser » - le BPR à en utilisant le modèle SCOR ou d'autres méthodes pour les processus n'étant pas adressés par SCOR Nous établissons dans ce chapitre, à partir des résultats issus de nos études industrielles, une démarche de réorganisation des processus et d'externalisation dans le cadre de la chaîne logistique <b>de</b> <b>Rhodia</b> et définissons un plan d'externalisation par la réorganisation des processus. Enfin, nous concluons cette thèse en revenant sur les apports académiques et industriels de ce manuscrit concernant la réorganisation des processus de l'organisation dans le contexte de l'externalisation. Nous ouvrirons enfin un certain nombre de perspectives de recherches dans ce domaine...|$|R
