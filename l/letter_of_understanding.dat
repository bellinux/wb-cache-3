A Conservative Party spokesman confirmed the money was a gift from Wright, with no expectation of repayment; Duffy used the money to repay the Government of Canada for the expenses improperly claimed. Duffy then refused to meet with independent auditors or supply financial records in relation to the subsequent investigation in the claimed expense controversy. Shortly before his resignation, the Ethics Commissioner confirmed it was investigating Wright for his involvement with Duffy and for the illegal repayment of these expenses. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) affidavit filed in order to justify an Information to Obtain direction has suggested that Wright was guilty of the charge of Frauds on the Government. On October 28, 2013, PM Harper stated in an interview that Wright did not resign, but was in fact dismissed.

It is unusual for an {{institution}} outside DPRK {{to have this}} kind of partnership understanding.

Behind these visits is an immense amount of networking and procedural work. This presentation outlines the way this partnership came into being, with reflections on the most recent visit of three scholars to the Wintec in 2014. It may be instructive to others contemplating such an approach to a DPRK institution to hear of our achievements and successes, as well as frustrations and setbacks.

40|$|IN 1978, THE United States Agency for International Development (USAID) {{decided to}} assist the Government of Sri Lanka in {{improving}} the management of water in major irrigation projects in the dry zone. It was understood that this required building an adequate knowledge-base and new institutional capacities both of which take time but neither {{of which can be}} purchased 'off the shelf. ' USAID and the Government of Sri Lanka recognized that a successful effort to improve water management could well take 20 years, but it would have to begin in a focused, concrete way, in a pioneering project that would begin to build up in-country knowledge and institutional capacity. In 1979, the government and USAID selected the Left Bank of the Gal Oya Irrigation System for rehabilitation. This planned change program was officially called the Gal Oya Rehabilitation and Water Management Project. The Irrigation Department (10) was appointed by the government as the project implementing agency. Technical assistance was to be obtained from the PRC Engineering consultants Inc., a U. S. engineering firm. Through a <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Understanding,</b> the 10 was further assisted by the Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI), which dealt with the socioeconomic components of the project. ARTI was assisted in this regard by the Rural Development Committee of Cornell University, USA. The project initially spanned 44 months (August 1979 to march 1984). The project life was subsequently extended by 21 months, until December 31, 1985 as it needed more time to reach its assigned targets. With this policy objective, the Farmer Organization Program was included as one of the components of this major water management and rehabilitation project. The project assigned the establishment of farmer organizations (FOs) and the promotion of farmers' participation in these associations to ARTI. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} describe how these FOs evolved. The paper stresses that there was a cyclical trend of Fa evolution. It describes how FOs began and flourished at the initial stage of the project and the socio-administrative-climate that provided a conducive environment to such growth.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the remedy of {{avoidance}} under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) in transactions where the parties have agreed on the payments {{to be made by}} a <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit. The approach of the thesis is to evaluate whether the seller is entitled to the remedy of avoidance in a case where the buyer fails to open a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit in accordance with the underlying contract of sale. The context of the study is the complex international environment. A <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit is a typical payment instrument in international trade. The use <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit is based on the need for security. They are usually resorted to in situations where there are doubts regarding the other party’s financial history, assets, or creditworthiness. Disputes involving <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit take place in the contractual network involving banks. The present thesis studies how the right to avoid the contract is affected by the said arrangement and the commercial purpose <b>of</b> a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit. The legal framework is built around the CISG and the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600). In addition, a brief analysis of the matter {{from the perspective of the}} Finnish Sale of Goods Act is included. The concept <b>of</b> a non-conforming <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit is evaluated mostly through case law. The Principles of International Commercial Contracts by the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (PICC), the Principles of European Contract Law (PECL) and the opinions of the International Chamber of Commerce’s Banking Commission are being used as supplementary legal sources in the interpretation of the provisions of the CISG. In addition, six Finnish experts on <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit were interviewed to gain a closer <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the prevailing practices within the industry. The structure of the present thesis is divided into four parts. Parts I and II, constituting a fairly large proportion of the thesis, deal with describing of the usages and mechanisms related to <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit and the commercial purpose <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit. This is justified with the necessity <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> the particular features of the industry in order to be able to evaluate the fulfilment of a fundamental breach in the given context. This necessity is highlighted in a complex business environment. Part III evaluates the threshold of what constitutes a fundamental from the perspective of the buyer’s failure to open a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit in accordance with the contract. Part III is divided into chapters, each discussing different ways of constituting grounds for a fundamental breach. Part IV concludes with the key elements and findings regarding the fundamental breach and the right to avoid the contract...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} considerations for exporters in international trade transactions is the aspect of payment. In the context of financial risk management, <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> Credit enable the exporter to substitute the credit risk of the buyer with that of his bank. The <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> Credit is a conditional payment guarantee, relying on one hundred per cent documentary accuracy to trigger the payment. Less than one hundred per cent compliance means {{the loss of the}} payment guarantee. Non-compliance is a significant problem as, according to the International Chamber of Commerce, worldwide documentary discrepancy rates against <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> Credit transactions have been estimated to be between sixty to seventy per cent. The mechanics <b>of</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> Credit transactions comprise a complex web of interactions between banks, traders and their service providers, providing a fertile ground for discrepancies and existing literature acknowledges this world-wide problem. In the UK, in 2000, losses were estimated to be AUD 305 million (£ 113) through non-compliant documents being presented under <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> Credit – this amount did not include lost opportunities and cash flow problems. In the same year, a separate USA study <b>of</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> Credit transactions confirmed the high discrepancy rate, but also claimed that as long as buyers want the goods discrepancies did not translate into financial losses. The findings were refuted by others. It is the potential loss of revenue caused by the mismanagement of risk that is foremost in this research. It is estimated that the annual value <b>of</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> Credit business for manufacturing exports to ASEAN is approximately AUD 3. 5 billion, with losses estimated to be upwards of AUD 920 million. This research aims to assist in greater <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the usage <b>of</b> <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> Credit and the dynamics that underpin these transactions leading to a greater <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the interactions between Australian exporters and ASEAN importers...|$|R
