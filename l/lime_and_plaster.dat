By using the Leontief price modelling technique, a scenario for the price changes on sectoral costs of production were simulated. The simulation results indicated that a five percent decrease in petroleum prices will affect all economic sectors. The cost of production for certain sectors, such as air transport, fishing, land transport, cement, <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> <b>plaster,</b> as well as communications are estimated to experience the lowest of production costs.

The experimental results show that: when gelled material system is cement: brick powder= 70 : 30, using 25 % lime or 20 % gypsum can obtain higher strength and lower water absorption foam concrete; when gelled material systems are cement: brick powder: fly ash= 70 : 15 : 15, 60 : 20 : 20 and 50 : 25 : 25, compressive strength and water absorption are better than using lime and gypsum separately...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} an increase in the petroleum price on the sectoral costs of production. Three components of costs of production, which comprise domestic materials, imported input, and labour have been identified. By using the input-output model, different scenarios of the petroleum price changes on sectoral costs of production were stimulated. The simulation results indicated that the fishing, forestry, and logging product, electricity and gas, cement, <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> <b>plaster,</b> and transport sectors are mostly affected by the increase in petroleum price. These sectors are expected to show large impact on costs of production as a result of petroleum price increase because these industries highly consume petroleum products as an intermediate input in their production process...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{physical}} properties and hydration products of slag cement that was prepared by activating ground granulated {{blast furnace slag}} with commercial <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> of Paris (POP) as activators. The consistency, setting times and soundness of various mixes of slag-lime-POP is reported. The hydration products and formation of bonds in the paste during setting were studied {{with the help of}} SEM, FTIR and XRD tests and the same are correlated to the hydration process. The setting times of the mixes are found to be lower than that of the value prescribed for ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Borax is used as a setting retarder and a borax content of 0.4  % by mass gives setting times that are normally prescribed for OPC. In the early stages of setting C–A–S–H gels are found in this cementing material instead of C–S–H gel, as generally observed in the OPC.|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} agglomeration of manufacturing firms for the Indian context using an agglomeration measure given by Ellison and Glaeser for 66 manufacturing industries in 21 major States. The analysis yields that the extractive industries like Iron and Steel and Cement, <b>Lime</b> <b>and</b> <b>Plaster,</b> are highly agglomerated and are found in those States where the raw material is in abundance. The analysis indicates that the agglomerated industries are mostly located in few States thereby pointing that the attempts made by the Government to disperse the industrial units have not been quite successful. Taking one step further, this study also looks at the reasons that {{could be attributed to}} this clustering. The econometric results indicate that the policy related factors that affect the agglomeration in the case of India’s manufacturing Industries, are not alone, enough to create clusters. These along with other non-policy related factors having spillover potential also contribute to agglomeration. Submitted fo...|$|E
40|$|Thermogravimetric {{analyzer}} {{coupled to}} a mass spectrometer (TGA-MS) {{was used to}} study the thermochemical behavior of eight samples. Two varieties of straw (wheat and barley) and two others of binder (<b>lime</b> <b>and</b> <b>plaster)</b> have employed to design four composites. These composites {{can be considered as}} innovative insulation materials for buildings. The thermal degradation of the different specimens was studied from a temperature of 50 to 1000 ºC using increased temperature of 20 ºC/min. This thermal degradation is an important element to evaluate the fire behavior and predict the evolution of smoke emitted during an accidental fire for building application. Using MS analyzer, the ion currents evolutions of 16 molecule groups (shared by a m/z ratio) were followed as functions of temperature. TG curves show that the thermal decomposition of composite samples is more complex (3 - 4 mass loss steps) than the one of the basic materials (1 - 2 mass loss stages) and seems to be mostly affected by the binder nature. The highest amount of gas in pyrolysis products is associated to m/z= 28 ratio and presents more than two thirds of the total quantity. The kinetic parameters were evaluated for the more important mass loss of each sample and their values are in the ranges of 8. 29 - 64. 86 kJ/mol, 0. 4 - 3. 36 and 1. 78 x 10 ^ 3 - 1. 63 x 10 ^ 7 min^- 1 for respectively the activation energy, the reaction order and the pre-exponential factor.

40|$|Many years ago, {{the use of}} lime as the {{traditional}} method of plaster or renderings, had more or less ceased after {{thousands of years of}} being the vital ingredient in building material. <b>Lime</b> renders <b>and</b> <b>plasters</b> were applied to most cottages and rural houses. The survival of lime renders is owed to its ability, acting like a sponge, to absorb moisture then allow it to evaporate slowly over time. The purpose of this dissertation is to show that lime renders of plasters cannot be easily replaced with modern Portland cement without having a major consequence to old and traditional buildings. This dissertation was compiled from an extensive literature review under three specific headings; 1) Formation of Lime 2) Conservation Guidelines and Legislation and 3) Repair & Maintenance of Lime. A case study was undertaken on the restoration of <b>lime</b> render <b>and</b> <b>plaster</b> to a protected structure. The case study showed that unless there is a good commitment and understanding from the outset by the property owners, lime has to be treated differently to ordinary Portland cement, to allow conservation and restoration of the render <b>and</b> <b>plaster.</b> An interview was held with a professional who is heavily involved in conservation of buildings using lime. The interview was carried out so as to gain a clear understanding of the main conservation methods of lime plastering. The information that was gathered during this interview was compiled in order to add further weight to the case study and assess the techniques used in restoration of <b>lime</b> <b>plasters</b> <b>and</b> renders to old buildings...|$|R
