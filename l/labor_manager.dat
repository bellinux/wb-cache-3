Although self-managed (or labor-managed) firms can coincide with worker ownership (employee ownership), the two are distinct concepts, and one need not imply the other. According to traditional neoclassical economic theory, in a competitive market economy, ownership of capital assets by labor (the workforce of a given firm) should have no significant impact on firm performance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} what knowledge specialty contractors {{may contribute}} to the early design of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) products. In current practice, specialty contractors are seldom involved in the early design effort, but evidence suggests that their early involvement is increasing. Lean construction theory advocates this involvement. The paper reports on research that focused on the processes for designing and building semiconductor facilities. The research consisted of conducting a series of one-to-one interviews with experienced practitioners, ranging from <b>labor</b> <b>managers</b> to lead designers and owner representatives. Specifically, we unveil the contributions of specialty contractor knowledge to early design in terms of process efficiencies and improvements in product quality. We group such value in distinct categories and provide examples that stem from current practice or which present potential opportunities for improvement. We discuss reasons why specialty contractor knowledge often is ignored in practice. Examples from changes in the AEC environment nevertheless suggest that organizations are creating conditions to increase interaction between designers and specialty contractors. Such interactions may help AEC organizations to retain and share the knowledge of individuals as well as develop new knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Elderly care {{practice}} and its management together with policy and research {{play a crucial}} role in responding to increasing challenges in institutional care for elderly people. Successful dialogue between these is necessary. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to compare how institutional elderly care management research meets the care challenges currently emphasized in international long-term care policy documents. Methods This paper was based on a systematic literature review. After screening 1971 abstracts using inclusion/exclusion criteria, 58 refereed articles published between 2000 and 2010 remained for analysis. The articles were analyzed using theory-based content analysis by comparing the results to the framework based on analysis of international long-term care management policy documents. Results The current challenges of long-term care management identified from policy documents were Integrated Care Management, Productivity Management, Quality Management, Workforce Management and ICT Management. The research on institutional elderly care management responded somewhat to the challenges mentioned in policy documents. However, some of the challenges were studied broadly and some were paid only minor attention. Further, only few studies focused on the core items of challenges addressed in policy documents. Conclusions Institutional care management research needs to focus more on challenges in integrated care, productivity, ICT and division of <b>labor.</b> <b>Managers,</b> researchers and policy-makers should assume more active collaborative roles in processes of research, policymaking and policy implementation. In addition managers’ and policymakers’ scientific literacy needs to be enhanced. </p...|$|R

This should {{take the form of}} more symmetric labor cost behavior for firms that report a small profit. Our findings are consistent with this prediction. Using detailed employee data, we show that managers of firms reporting a small profit focus on firing employees who are relatively low cost to fire.

Our theory provides new insight {{with respect to a}} substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the "life cycle" of worker-managed firms, and with respect to a complementary body of anecdotal evidence on the causes of worker buyouts and cooperative "degeneration". Our theory is also consistent with differences between the board compensation policies of cooperative firms, where members typically receive little more than travel and per-diem reimbursements, and of investor-owned firms, where members receive substantial pay often based in part on firm financial performance. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} degree to which American workers are treated like second-class parties by {{corporate}} leaders. When business firms do well, share holders and managers obtain significant financial gains, but rank-and-file workers do not usually share in those gains. On the other hand, when firms do poorly, thousands of employees are laid off, while managers obtain bonuses for their forthright actions designed to curtail labor costs. These developments correspond directly to the decline of labor organizations in the United States. When unions represented 35 percent of private sector workers in the late 1950 s and 1960 s, wages and benefits were increased annually. Once union membership began to decline, employers decided they no longer had to consider employee interests. Today, with fewer than 8 percent of private sector employees in <b>labor</b> organizations, <b>managers</b> exercise complete control over their employees.
