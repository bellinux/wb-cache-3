40|$|The <b>lifetime</b> cancer <b>risks</b> of {{exposure}} of cooks and food service workers, office workers, housewives, and schoolchildren in Hong Kong to {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) in their respective indoor premises during normal indoor activities were assessed. The estimated cancer risk for housewives was the highest, and the second-highest <b>lifetime</b> cancer <b>risk</b> to VOC exposure was for the groups of food service and office workers. Within a certain group of the population, the <b>lifetime</b> cancer <b>risk</b> of the home living room was one to two orders of magnitude higher than that in other indoor environments. The estimated <b>lifetime</b> <b>risks</b> of food service workers were about two times that of office workers. Furthermore, the cancer risks of working in kitchen environments were approximately two {{times higher than the}} risks arising from studying in air-conditioned classrooms. The bus riders had higher average <b>lifetime</b> cancer <b>risks</b> than those travelling by Mass Transit Railway. For all target groups of people, {{the findings of this study}} show that the exposures to VOCs may lead to <b>lifetime</b> <b>risks</b> higher than 1 × 10 - 6. Seven indoor environments were selected for the measurement of human exposure and the estimation of the corresponding <b>lifetime</b> cancer <b>risks.</b> The <b>lifetime</b> <b>risks</b> with 8 -h average daily exposures to individual VOCs in individual environments were compared. People in a smoking home had the highest cancer risk, while students in an air-conditioned classroom had the lowest risk of cancer. Benzene accounted for about or more than 40 % of the <b>lifetime</b> cancer <b>risks</b> for each category of indoor environment. Nonsmoking and smoking residences in Hong Kong had cancer risks associated with 8 -h exposures of benzene above 1. 8 × 10 - 5 and 8. 0 × 10 - 5, respectively. The cancer risks associated with 1, 1 -dichloroethene, chloroform, methylene chloride, trichloroethene, and tetrachloroethene became more significant at selected homes and restaurants.

Methods: Segregation indices were {{used to measure the}} distribution of groups of people from different races within neighborhoods. The Townsend Index was used to measure economic deprivation in the study area. Poisson multivariate regressions were applied to assess the association of <b>lifetime</b> cancer <b>risk</b> with segregation indices and Townsend Index along with several sociodemographic measures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Estimates were performed using a Markov microsimulation model and were based on the incidence of first fracture as well as life expectancy. Baseline scenario included projected mortality rates and increasing fracture incidence by 1 % per year. Alternative scenarios were performed on age, life expectancy and trends in fracture incidence. <b>Lifetime</b> fracture <b>risk</b> for osteoporotic population (T-score <or= - 2. 5) was also estimated. RESULTS: In the baseline scenario, <b>lifetime</b> absolute <b>risks</b> of hip fracture and of any major osteoporotic fracture (hip, clinical vertebral or wrist) were respectively 24. 8 % and 44. 3 %. Alternative scenarios showed that when assuming no change of age-specific fracture rates over time, these <b>lifetime</b> <b>risks</b> were 18. 3 % and 35. 2 %, while these values were 20. 0 % and 38. 3 % assuming no future mortality reductions.

5|$|Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's {{syndrome}} (a {{specific type}} of five recognized choledochal cysts), {{have been associated with}} an approximately 15% <b>lifetime</b> <b>risk</b> of developing cholangiocarcinoma.

The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.|$|E

40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the impact of}} radiation exposure it is common practice to present the final conclusions in terms of excess <b>lifetime</b> cancer <b>risk</b> in a population exposed to a given dose. The present investigation is mainly a methodological study focusing {{on some of the}} major issues and uncertainties involved in calculating such excess <b>lifetime</b> <b>risks</b> and related risk projection methods. The age-constant relative risk model used in the recent analyses of the cancer mortality that was observed in the follow-up of the cohort of A-bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is used to describe the effect of the exposure on the cancer mortality. In this type of model the excess relative risk is constant in age-at-risk, but depends on the ageat-exposure. Calculation of excess <b>lifetime</b> <b>risks</b> usually requires rather complicated life-table computations. In this paper we propose a simple approximation to the excess lifetime risk; the validity of the approximation for low levels of exposure is justified empirically as well as theoretically. This approximation provides important guidance in understanding the influence of the various factors involved in risk projections. Among the further topics considered are the influence of a latent period, the additional problems involved in calculations of site-specific excess <b>lifetime</b> cancer <b>risks,</b> the consequences of a leveling off or a plateau in the excess relative risk, and the uncertainties involved in transferring results from one population to another. The main part of this study relates to the situation with a single, instantaneous exposure, but a brief discussion is also given of the problem with a continuous exposure at a low-dose rate...|$|R

However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E

A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk. Raloxifene, a similar drug, did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer.

25|$|The major genetic {{risk factor}} for ovarian cancer is a {{mutation}} in BRCA1 or BRCA2 DNA mismatch repair genes, which is present in 10% of ovarian cancer cases. Only one allele need be mutated to place a person at high risk. The gene can be inherited through either the maternal or paternal line, but has variable penetrance. Though mutations in these genes are usually associated with increased risk of breast cancer, they also carry a substantial <b>lifetime</b> <b>risk</b> of ovarian cancer, a risk that peaks in a person's 40s and 50s. The lowest risk cited is 30% and the highest 60%. Mutations in BRCA1 have a <b>lifetime</b> <b>risk</b> of developing ovarian cancer of 15–45%. Mutations in BRCA2 are less risky than those with BRCA1, with a <b>lifetime</b> <b>risk</b> of 10% (lowest risk cited) to 40% (highest risk cited).

The {{purpose of}} our study was to measure the {{radiation}} dose from ECG-gated CT coronary angiography in children and to estimate the cancer risk associated with the radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Organ doses were measured with a 5 -year-old pediatric phantom and thermoluminescent dosimeters on a 64 -MDCT scanner. Four retrospectively ECG-gated CT coronary angiography protocols with four simulated heart rates and the corresponding pitches were studied. The <b>lifetime</b> attributable <b>risk</b> of cancer incidence was estimated for children in the United States and Hong Kong according to the National Academies Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report. RESULTS. The effective doses were 16. 45, 12. 17, 11. 97, and 11. 81 mSv for the four protocols, respectively. The corresponding <b>lifetime</b> attributable <b>risks</b> estimated for 5 -year-old U.

In relation to the total cancer incidence (baseline cancer incidence plus <b>lifetime</b> attributable <b>risk),</b> <b>lifetime</b> attributable <b>risk</b> from radiation exposure contributed up to 0. 99 % and 3. 51 % for Hong Kong boys and girls and up to 0. 46 % and 1. 57 % for U.
