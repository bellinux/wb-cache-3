40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to assess a new method of <b>controlling</b> <b>load</b> in Intelligent Networks (INs). This will be done through the {{analysis}} of experimentation results and comparison with existing methods of IN <b>load</b> <b>control.</b> This exercise {{will result in the}} investigation and validation of the proposed benefits being offered by this new methodology and the unveiling of its disadvantages. The methodology is known as network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> for the IN. Network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> is demonstrated using the MARINER Service Traffic <b>Load</b> <b>Control</b> System developed by the European Commission’s Advanced Communication, Technologies and Services (ACTS) Multi-Agent Architecture for Distributed Intelligent Network <b>Load</b> <b>Control</b> and Overload Protection (MARINER) Project. This system is shown to be a network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> application operating at the service level, built specifically for Intelligent Networks. Network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> is then assessed by deploying the MARINER System on a model of the IN, and running an exhaustive series of experiments. These experiments are structured to test the proposed benefits, limitations and disadvantages of networkorientated <b>load</b> <b>control.</b> The conclusions drawn from the results of these trials are then compared with existing IN <b>load</b> <b>control</b> characteristics, and used to make an assessment of network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> for the Intelligent Network...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a design of pilot-assisted <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve with <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and fast opening feature based on static and dynamic modeling. Traditional <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valves {{do not have}} the <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve to achieve <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve achieve <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time. Static modeling method based on force balance and Bernoulli orifice pressure-flow equation is used to design the <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability of the valve. Dynamic modeling method based on Newton’s second law and fluid continuity equation is used to optimize the parameters to give the proposed <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve a fast opening feature. An actual <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve was developed according to the above methods and the test results show both good <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and fast opening feature of the design, which validates the potentiality of the proposed design in many applications...|$|R

Complementary to generation <b>control,</b> <b>loads</b> provide flexible and fast responsive sources for frequency regulation, and local frequency measurement capability of loads offers {{the opportunity of}} decentralized control. In this paper, we propose an optimal <b>load</b> <b>control</b> problem, which balances the load reduction (or increase) with the generation shortfall (or surplus), resynchronizes the bus frequencies, and minimizes a measure of aggregate disutility of participation in such a <b>load</b> <b>control.</b> We find that, a frequency-based <b>load</b> <b>control</b> coupled with the dynamics of swing equations and branch power flows serve as a distributed primal-dual algorithm to solve the optimal <b>load</b> <b>control</b> problem and its dual. Simulation shows that the proposed mechanism can restore frequency, balance load with generation and achieve the optimum of the <b>load</b> <b>control</b> problem within several seconds after a disturbance in generation.

In both cases, the line exhibits a single resonance frequency (transmission zero) if the resonators are identical (symmetric structure with regard to the line axis), and this resonance is different to the one of the <b>line</b> <b>loaded</b> with a single resonator due to inter-resonator coupling. If the structures are asymmetric, inter-resonator coupling enhances the distance between the two split resonance frequencies that arise. In spite that the considered <b>lines</b> and <b>loading</b> resonators are very different and are described by different lumped element equivalent circuit models, the phenomenology associated to the effects of coupling is exactly the same, and the resonance frequencies are given by identical expressions. The reported lumped element circuit models of both structures are validated by comparing the circuit simulations with extracted parameters with both electromagnetic simulations and experimental data. These structures can be useful for the implementation of microwave sensors based on symmetry properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Matching demand with {{supply and}} {{regulating}} frequency are key issues in power system operations. Flexibility and local frequency measurement capability of loads offer new regulation mechanisms through <b>load</b> <b>control.</b> We present a frequency-based fast <b>load</b> <b>control</b> scheme {{which aims to}} match total demand with supply while minimizing the global end-use disutility. Local frequency measurement enables loads to make decentralized decisions on their power from the estimates of total demand-supply mismatch. To resolve the errors in such estimates caused by stochastic frequency measurement errors, loads communicate via a neighborhood area network. Case {{studies show that the}} proposed <b>load</b> <b>control</b> can balance demand with supply and restore the frequency at the timescale faster than AGC, even when the loads use a highly simplified system model in their algorithms. Moreover, we discuss the tradeoff between communication and performance, and show with experiments that a moderate amount of communication significantly improves the performance.
