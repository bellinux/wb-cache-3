25|$|Snorri relates that Hrólfr was {{the most}} renowned king in Denmark for valour, {{generosity}} and graciousness. One day a poor boy called Vöggr arrived and expressed his surprise that such a great king would look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pole (kraki). Hrólfr said that Vöggr {{had given him a}} name and gave Vöggr a golden ring in recompense. In gratitude Vöggr swore to Hrólfr to avenge him, should he be killed.|$|E

Often dismayed at Kōsei's inability to move on from his mother's death, she attempts to get him to play the piano again {{in order to make a}} clear decision about his future. She first denies her feelings for him but after undergoing several stages of denial, she falls in love with him, which she confesses to him later on.|$|E

25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to examine it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As {{for me and my}} companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, that we could not move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E
500|$|Jacqueline Obradors as Audrey Rocio Ramirez, {{a teenage}} Puerto Rican {{mechanic}} {{and the youngest}} member of the expedition. Obradors said her character made her [...] "feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid again" [...] and she always hoped her sessions would last longer.|$|E
500|$|Csupó {{said that}} they cast Bailee Madison as May Belle Aarons after weeks of searching for an actress to play the part. He {{went on to say}} that [...] "she had such a charm, even before the camera, she was just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sweetheart. She was very confident, she showed up, shook hands with everybody, totally sweet and perky. I said 'WOW!'— she was just {{stealing}} everybody's heart on the spot." ...|$|E

500|$|Farrell's next film, Martin McDonagh's first {{full-length}} feature In Bruges, {{opened the}} 2008 Sundance Film Festival. While the New Yorker and TimeOut Londons film critics found co-star Brendan Gleeson's performance the stronger of the two, Bradshaw of The Guardian found Farrell (as hitman Ray) [...] "absolutely superb: moody and funny, lethally sexy, sometimes heartbreakingly sad and vulnerable <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy". Time called the film [...] "the prettiest bloodbath of 2008", and Farrell received his first Golden Globe.|$|E
500|$|After {{the energy}} disturbance, Jackson's spirit takes over Ike's body, causing Ike to speak, {{sing and dance}} like Jackson himself. The boys find from online {{research}} {{that the only way}} to make Jackson accept his death is to make him experience the acceptance he sought in life, so they take him to a child beauty pageant for young girls. Dressed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, Ike/Jackson impresses two of the male judges by singing a tune sounding similar to Jackson's [...] "You Are Not Alone," [...] but they are promptly arrested for masturbating while watching the children, leaving a single, unimpressed female judge (much to the shock of the boys, who were unaware of the men's lewd acts and considered them the best judges). When Cartman notices the judge eating Chipotle, he bribes her with knowledge about the ChipotlAway product, and she declares Ike/Jackson the winner as a result. One of the other contestants is physically beaten by her mother for losing. Having found his acceptance, Jackson leaves Ike's body, and Ike is extremely surprised and disgusted to find himself dressed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl.|$|E
500|$|Three {{members of}} the cast {{had never been in}} a film before: Ed Sanders was cast as Toby, Jayne Wisener as Johanna, and Jamie Campbell Bower, who auditioned, and after four days got the part of Anthony said [...] "I think I weed myself.

Honestly, I was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl running around this shop like oh-my-god-oh-my-god-oh-my-god." ...|$|E

"But you didn't know, perhaps, {{that pretty}} Klara <b>likes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> jollification and <b>a</b> bit of fun sometimes, and that papa Goldstein {{is a very}} strict parent and mightily {{particular}} about the proprieties.

6000|$|So with {{something}} like excitement Emily--who at seventy would still have <b>liked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> feast and fashion now and then--ordered dinner for six instead of two, herself wrote a number of foreign words on cards, and arranged the flowers--mimosa from the Riviera, and white Roman hyacinths not from Rome. There would only be, of course, James and herself, Soames, Winifred, Val, and Imogen--but she <b>liked</b> to pretend <b>a</b> <b>little</b> and dally in imagination with {{the glory of the}} past. She so dressed herself that James remarked: ...|$|R

500|$|In March 1980 Sellers {{asked his}} fifteen-year-old {{daughter}} Victoria {{what she thought}} about Being There: she reported later that, [...] "I said yes, I thought it was great. But then I said, 'You looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over {{me and told me}} to get the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E
500|$|More {{impressed}} with Gone Troppo, Dave Thompson wrote in Goldmine in 2002 that, together with [...] "Dream Away", [...] "Circles" [...] "stand alongside {{any number of}} Harrison's minor classics". In his book The Unreleased Beatles, Richie Unterberger describes the song as [...] "a pretty neat, if droning, reflection of Harrison's more somber spiritual sensibilities", and he views the 1968 demo as a version that [...] "exerts by far the greater fascination" [...] compared with Harrison's later recording. Un{{impressed with}} the track, author John Winn dismisses [...] "Circles" [...] as [...] "a depressing number that makes 'Blue Jay Way' sound <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Richard freakout". Ian MacDonald describes it as [...] "a typically perceptive, if deeply gloomy, song about karma".|$|E
500|$|The {{characterization}} of Orrec and Gry was well received. A review in Horn Book Magazine {{stated that the}} twain were [...] "unique, thoughtful young rebels". Their struggles were described as having philosophical aspects that nonetheless did not dominate the story. The review used Le Guin's own words to describe her prose, writing that she [...] "talked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stream running, clearly and merrily, with the Lowland softness and fluency." [...] Cadden, writing in 2006, stated that the characters were drawn in a manner relevant to young adults, {{and that it was}} Le Guin's most satisfying work of young adult fiction. Another reviewer said that Gifts had the [...] "earthy magic and intelligent plot twists" [...] of the Earthsea Cycle, and that the book was a [...] "gift in the purest sense." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{included}} in the set list of Farmer's 1989 tour and was performed as a duet. Carole Fredericks, one of Farmer's vocalists, portrayed the nurse, and in a long monologue, she complained about one of her female patients, who was difficult to bear. Farmer, hidden beneath Frederick's long dress, suddenly appeared, wearing pyjamas, and performed the song by waddling <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> child. The song was also performed during the Mylenium Tour but included in a medley composed of her 1980s greatest hits. A snippet of the song was performed on the opening night of the Timeless Tour on 7 September 2013 in Paris. As for [...] "My Mum Is Wrong", it does not appear on any of Farmer's albums and has not been performed on stage.|$|E
500|$|Manson {{confirmed}} {{during his}} {{appearance at the}} 2010 Revolver Golden Gods Awards in April that the band had recorded 13 songs, and also {{expressed an interest in}} releasing the record in a different way from previous ones. Fred Sablan – guitarist for Twiggy's side-project Goon Moon – joined the band in July, and in October Twiggy described the upcoming album as being [...] "almost done", saying: [...] "It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone always says that, but I think this is our best work so far. It's kind of <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals, without sounding too pretentious." [...] Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal".|$|E
500|$|Most {{critics were}} not {{impressed}} with the medley, comparing it to Aguilera's identity during the Bionic era. Tamar Anitai, also of MTV Buzzworthy summarized the performance saying it [...] "was all about her [...] "I-I'm-still-a-diva" [...] vocals, frenzied stage show, and adult-only innuendo...And then this happened." [...] She went on to comment also sarcastically, [...] "This is so just Christina Aguilera's way of saying she loves you! And that the diminutive diva still {{has a sense of}} humor....It's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> knowing wink that assures you that when she's not changing diapers and doing mommy stuff, Mamaguilera's hanging out at dance party sex dungeons and wailing from the bottom of her light-up hoo-ha. She is DEFINITELY not the same girl who once bopped around on the Disney Channel in a Scrunchie." ...|$|E

500|$|Pauline's {{marriage}} to the luckless Arthur is central to her character, remaining one of her defining traits even {{after his death in}} 1996. The dynamics of the relationship were clear {{from the beginning of the}} programme, with Pauline depicted as the matriarchal force that holds the Fowler family together, while Arthur is depicted as weak, emotionally unstable and easily dominated by the stronger females of his family. Writer Jacquetta May, who once played Rachel Kominski in the programme, has commented that [...] " [...] represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man... Arthur, only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown, often behaved <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy, while Pauline had to make the decisions and keep the family functioning in the face of poverty and unemployment, teenage pregnancy and depression." ...|$|E
500|$|Armitage {{performs}} his own stunts. When performing fight scenes, {{they would}} be choreographed carefully so Armitage could take part rather than a stunt double. For series eight, Armitage performed a fight scene in a swimming pool, which he thought was [...] "fun," [...] but also thought it was difficult as it was [...] "like acting and punching in slow motion." [...] In another sequence, he injured a stuntman with a hospital trolley. He was only given a short lesson {{on how to handle}} firearms, since he was already accustomed to using them whilst working on Ultimate Force. While discussing the shootout at the end of series seven, Armitage noted that he is [...] "not a violent person but when you put a gun in somebody's hands [...] it's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson met 15-year-old actress/model Brooke Shields in 1981, at the Academy Awards. From there, {{the pair}} enjoyed a close relationship. Speaking in 2009, she {{reflected}} {{that they were}} close because sex was never an issue for them. Although the headlines in the media referred to Shields' talking about an [...] "asexual Jackson" [...] after his death, what she actually said was, “As he grew older and the more he started to change physically, the more asexual he became to me.” She also said that as she grew up and started having boyfriends, she would confide in him about her intimate experiences, as he was curious. She said, [...] "he was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid who talked about the bases – what first base was, what second base was" [...] – and his curiosity was understandable given his guarded life.|$|E
