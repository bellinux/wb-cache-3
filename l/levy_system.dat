50|$|In 2016, Pichet {{published}} his General Theory of Social and Tax Expenditures {{in an article}} published in La Revue de droit fiscal dated 8 September 2016. The theory is {{based on the idea that}} all compulsory <b>levy</b> <b>systems</b> are divided into six main categories called specific tax reference segments, each featuring a set of homogeneous fiscal standards enabling a methodical identification of relevant social and tax expenditures. Pichet followed this up with a rigorous doctrine in which individual exception provisions are identified using a series of six successive filters analysing their legitimacy, utility, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and social acceptability. The analysis is prescriptive in nature and leads to a general doctrine in which each specific reference segment can be monitored.|$|R

40|$|Skills {{development}} levies {{are increasingly}} being utilised to increase enterprise provided training in developing economies. South Africa is one such example. The impact of such incentive systems on the bottom-line of firms is a vital consideration in such programs. Particularly important are the economic conditions under which the incentive will stimulate participation by organisations. The transaction costs of participation {{must be taken into}} account: while a levy-grant system clearly creates a prima-facie incentive, it may be prohibitively expensive for some firms to enter the grant disbursement systems. Accordingly, through a simple model of the incentives for firms, the participation level of the firm under various types of <b>levy</b> <b>systems</b> is assessed.

It transpired that, far from being an extinct race, the Dark Elves had simply been amassing their strength {{for a return to}} hostilities with the Asur, and Malekith took advantage of the reduced military presence to once again assault Ulthuan. Having learned from his mistakes, Morvael appointed Mentheus of Caledor as his field commander of the Asur armies, and introduced the <b>levy</b> <b>system,</b> requiring that every elf spends part of the year as a soldier. As Mentheus won the war, Morvael became ever more despondent at the high cost in Asur lives, and was driven deeper into paranoia and insanity through horrific nightmares Malekith's sorcery inflicted on him. During the final assault on Anlec, Mentheus’ forces took the castle, but Mentheus himself was killed: his dragon, Nightfang went berserk and broke the back of the Druchii armies, and the survivors fled back to Naggaroth, Malekith in the lead. Weary beyond bearing, Morvael committed suicide by walking into the Flames of Asuryan once again.|$|E
40|$|Continuous-time {{stochastic}} {{systems have}} attracted {{a lot of}} attention recently, due to their wide-spread use in finance for modelling price-dynamics. More recently models taking into accounts shocks have been developed by assuming that the return process is an infinitesimal Levy process. Levy processes are also used to model the traffic in a telecommunication network. In this paper we focus on a particular technical problem: stability of time-varying stochastic systems driven or modulated by a Levy process with discrete time interventions, such as parameter or state resetting. Such systems will be called hybrid <b>Levy</b> <b>systems.</b> They are hybrid in the sense that jumps both in the dynamics may occur. The peculiarity of our systems is that the jump-times are defined by a more or less arbitrary point process, but there exists an asymmetry in the system dynamics. The novelty of our model relative to the theory of switching stochastic systems is two-fold. First, we allow slow time variation of the parameters, in a stochastic sense, without any statistical pattern, {{in the spirit of the}} classical stability result of Desoer. Secondly, we allow certain jumps (resetting) in the system parameters almost without any a priori condition...|$|R
