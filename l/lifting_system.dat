50|$|Apart {{from the}} TV <b>lift</b> <b>systems,</b> {{there are also}} the related {{projector}} <b>lift</b> <b>systems.</b> These projector <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> may be distinguished into two equipment groups. On the one hand there is the projector ceiling light, which vertically lowers the projector downwards from a suspended ceiling, and there are projector lifts for integration into tables or furniture. The latter moves the projector vertically upwards, out of the furniture or table. Both systems are mostly made from ultra light aluminium. Stable equipment guiding is achieved in most cases using scissors or special guides. A projector <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> is often driven by a tubular motor, or another electromotor, which moves a shaft accordingly. Then the lower platform which the projector stands on, can be lowered via special belts or chains. Projector ceiling <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are available as ultra flat versions right up to stage projector lift devices with a lift of 5m and more, and a load bearing capacity of several 100 kg.|$|R
2500|$|Only three CCXR Trevitas {{were planned}} to be produced, however, because of the {{complexity}} to make the special white carbon-fiber, only 2 were ever made, {{making it one of}} the rarest vehicles manufactured by Koenigsegg. Both cars featured the Koenigsegg Shimmering Diamond Weave bodywork, double carbon rear wing, inconel exhaust system, carbon ceramic brakes with ABS, airbags, paddle-shift, chrono instrument cluster, infotainment system, tire monitoring system and a hydraulic <b>lifting</b> <b>system.</b> The Trevita is also the most expensive street legal vehicle, costing $4.8 million.|$|E

The {{decision}} to raise the gates is made by the management company, which contacts the National Weather Service's River Desk at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. Generally speaking, water at Harper's Ferry takes about 36 hours to reach Washington Harbour. In 1996, the cost of raising the floodgates was about $18,000 per use.

The vehicle included Rosso Mars (red) body colour, 6-speed E-gear transmission, carbon fibre and Alcantara interior upholstery with red stitching, double-A-arm suspension, 19-inch wheels, titanium bearing and bolts, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. Optional equipment included carbon-ceramic brake discs, a tubular interior roll cage, 4-point safety belts and fire extinguisher, satellite navigation, with Bluetooth connection for mobile phones, an anti-theft system, and a <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> that raises the front axle, grey or white brake caliper.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{advanced}} high <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> on aircraft size, performance, {{direct operating cost}} and noise were evaluated for short-to-medium and medium-to-long range aircraft with high bypass ratio and very high bypass ratio engines. The benefit of advanced high <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> in reducing noise {{was found to be}} less than 1 effective-perceived-noise decibel level (EPNdB) when the aircraft were sized to minimize takeoff gross weight. These aircraft did, however, have smaller wings and lower engine thrusts for the same mission than aircraft with conventional high <b>lift</b> <b>systems.</b> When the advanced high <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> was implemented without reducing wing size and simultaneously using lower flap angles that provide higher L/D at approach a cumulative noise reduction of as much as 4 EPNdB was obtained. Comparison of aircraft configurations that have similar approach speeds showed cumulative noise reduction of 2. 6 EPNdB that is purely the result of incorporating advanced high <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> in the aircraft design...|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} a monitor <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> is {{for the most part}} {{similar to that of the}} {{vertical}} pop-up TV <b>lift</b> <b>system,</b> with the only real difference being that the movement radius of the motor and the electrics are enclosed inside a sheet metal module. The system is conceived for smaller PC monitor sizes. They are predominantly installed in conference room tables in order to save space. The monitor <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are inserted from above into the section which has been cut out of the table by a carpenter or joiner and they are then secured to the table once again from below with screws. The upper part of the monitor <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> is often a cover plate made of brushed steel. With the push of a button, the cover section folds inward into the monitor lift and makes way for the monitor to move into position. The monitor moves up automatically and can still be tilted electronically when in the end position. A number of manufacturers manufacture the monitor lift with a fixed display. Monitor <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are available in various sizes ranging from 15 inches up to 42 inches.|$|R
