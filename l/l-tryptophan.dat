5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, <b>L-tryptophan,</b> 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{biosynthesis}} of melatonin occurs through hydroxylation, decarboxylation, acetylation and a methylation {{starting with}} <b>L-tryptophan.</b> <b>L-tryptophan</b> {{is produced in}} the shikimate pathway from chorismate or is acquired from protein catabolism. First <b>L-tryptophan</b> is hydroxylated on the indole ring by tryptophan hydroxylase to produce 5-hydroxytryptophan. This intermediate (5-HTP) is decarboxylated by pyridoxal phosphate and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase to produce serotonin. Serotonin is itself an important neurotransmitter, but is also converted into N-acetylserotonin by serotonin N-acetyltransferase and acetyl-CoA. Hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase and S-adenosyl methionine convert N-acetylserotonin into melatonin through methylation of the hydroxyl group.|$|E
25|$|Dimethyltryptamine is an indole {{alkaloid}} {{derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid <b>L-tryptophan</b> is produced endogenously where in animals <b>L-tryptophan</b> is an essential amino acid coming from diet. No matter the source of <b>L-tryptophan,</b> the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analog is tryptamine. Tryptamine then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the intermediate product N-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Tryptamine transmethylation is regulated by two products of the reaction: SAH, and DMT were shown ex vivo {{to be among the}} most potent inhibitors of rabbit INMT activity.|$|E
25|$|In animals {{including}} humans, serotonin is synthesized {{from the}} amino acid <b>L-tryptophan</b> {{by a short}} metabolic pathway consisting of three enzymes: tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC) and pyridoxal phosphate. The TPH-mediated reaction is the rate-limiting step in the pathway.|$|E
25|$|In drying seeds, {{serotonin}} {{production is}} a {{way to get rid of}} the buildup of poisonous ammonia. The ammonia is collected and placed in the indole part of <b>L-tryptophan,</b> which is then decarboxylated by tryptophan decarboxylase to give tryptamine, which is then hydroxylated by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, yielding serotonin.|$|E
25|$|Medications, {{substance}} abuse, {{and environmental}} exposures may all trigger eosinophil dysfunction. Medications such as NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, <b>L-tryptophan,</b> daptomycin and ampicillin and drugs of abuse such as inhaled heroin and cocaine may trigger an allergic response {{which results in}} EP. Chemicals such as sulfites, aluminum silicate, and cigarette smoke can cause EP when inhaled. A New York City firefighter developed EP after inhalation of dust from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.|$|E
500|$|Many {{cases of}} {{serotonin}} toxicity occur {{in patients who}} have ingested drug combinations that synergistically increase synaptic serotonin. It may also occur as a symptom of overdose of a single serotonergic agent. The combination of MAOIs with precursors such as <b>L-tryptophan</b> or 5-HTP pose a particularly acute risk of life-threatening serotonin syndrome. The case of combination of MAOIs with tryptamine agonists (commonly known as ayahuasca) can present similar dangers as their combination with precursors, but this phenomenon has been described in general terms as the [...] "cheese effect". Many MAOIs irreversibly inhibit monoamine oxidase. It can take at least four weeks for this enzyme {{to be replaced by}} the body in the instance of irreversible inhibitors.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} hydroxylate <b>L-tryptophan,</b> the {{cofactor}} tetrahydrobiopterin (THB) must first react with oxygen and the active site iron of tryptophan hydroxylase. This mechanism {{is not well}} understood, but two mechanisms have been proposed: ...|$|E
2500|$|Specific {{drugs that}} have been studied in sleep bruxism are clonazepam, levodopa, amitriptyline, [...] bromocriptine, [...] pergolide, clonidine, propranolol, and <b>l-tryptophan,</b> with some showing no effect and others appear to have {{promising}} initial results; however, {{it has been suggested}} that further safety testing is required before any evidence-based clinical recommendations can be made. When bruxism is related to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression, adding buspirone has been reported to resolve the side effect. Tricyclic antidepressants have also been suggested to be preferable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in people with bruxism, and may help with the pain.|$|E

50|$|The {{coincident}} {{occurrence of}} Î²-carboline alkaloids and serotonin in P. harmala indicates {{the presence of}} two very similar, interrelated biosynthetic pathways, which {{makes it difficult to}} definitively identify whether free tryptamine or <b>L-tryptophan</b> is the precursor in the biosynthesis of harmine. However, it is postulated that <b>L-tryptophan</b> is the most likely precursor, with tryptamine existing as an intermediate in the pathway.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Fog fever' {{results from}} feedlot {{economics}} and the biochemistry {{of the cattle}} stomach (rumen) being slow to adjust to green grazing. After a low-protein, dried formulation, cattle are less prepared for a sudden, large exposure to high-protein grass. The level of <b>L-tryptophan</b> in crops {{is most likely to}} be high in lush, rapidly growing pastures, particularly (but not exclusively) in the fall. The change in diet to vegetation rich in <b>L-tryptophan</b> causes a corresponding increase of the amino acid typically found in protein in the rumen. Lactobacillus bacteria in the rumen degrade <b>L-tryptophan</b> to indoleacetic acid; bacteria in the rumen convert this to 3-methylindole (3MI) (skatole), which is readily absorbed through the rumen wall into the portal circulation. (3-methylindole is produced exclusively from indoleacetic acid and not directly from <b>L-tryptophan.)</b> Club cells in the terminal bronchioles convert the 3-methylindole to 3-methyleneindolenine, which is toxic to the adjacent alveolar epithelial cells. This toxicity leads to emphysema and pulmonary edema which may cause death by asphyxiation.|$|E
