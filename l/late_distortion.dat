5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a <b>late</b> <b>distortion</b> of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope data that we use to measure the proper motion of the Crab pulsar, with the primary goal of comparing the direction of its proper motion with the projected axis of its pulsar wind nebula (the projected spin axis of the pulsar). Combining data from 47 observations spanning> 10 yr with two different instruments, and using the best available measurement techniques and <b>latest</b> <b>distortion</b> models, we are able to demonstrate that our measurement is robust and has an uncertainty of only ± 0. 4 masyr − 1 on each component of the proper motion. However, we then consider the various uncertainties that arise from the need to correct the proper motion that we measure to the local standard of rest at the position of the pulsar and find µα = − 11. 8 ± 0. 4 ± 0. 5 masyr − 1 and µδ = + 4. 4 ± 0. 4 ± 0. 5 masyr − 1 relative to the pulsar’s standard of rest, where the two uncertainties are from the measurement and the reference frame, respectively. If we then wish to compare this proper motion to the symmetry axis of the pulsar wind nebula, we must consider the unknown velocity of the pulsar’s progenitor (assumed to be ∼ 10 kms − 1), and hence add an additional uncertainty of ± 2 masyr − 1 to each component of the proper motion, although this could be a factor of 10 larger if the pulsar’s progenitor had an anomalously high velocity (> 100 kms − 1).

30|$|In the <b>latest</b> years, {{harmonic}} <b>distortion</b> {{has become}} one of the most significant power quality problems. The primary causes of this problem can be sorted as soft starters, rectifiers and increase of devices that of semiconductor circuits. Nonlinear loads cause harmonic distortion within the voltage and current waveform in the power system. Harmonics result in numerous problems such as low power factor and overheat on the power systems, electrical devices and transformers (Lee and Wu 1998; Snal et al. 2004; Hamadi et al. 2010; Sekkeli and Tarkan 2013). In order to protect other users in power system from the effects of the harmonics caused by nonlinear devices, the IEEE 519 - 1992 standard has imposed specific limits on levels of voltage and current harmonics. Mainly, it sets limits of harmonic current and voltage at the point of common coupling.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{compare the}} effects of {{isolated}} right ventricular pressure and volume overload on left ventricular diastolic geometry and filling, 11 patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, 11 patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to tricuspid valve resection and 11 normal subjects were studied with use of Doppler echocardiography techniques. Right ventricular systolic overload in primary pulmonary hypertension resulted in substantial leftword ventricular septal shift that was most marked at end-systole and early diastole and decreased substantially by end-diastole. Right ventricular diastolic overload after tricuspid valve resection resulted in maximal leftward ventricular septal shift at end-diastole sparing end-systole and early diastole. The early diastolic distortion of left ventricular geometry associated with right ventricular pressure overload resulted in prolongation of isovolumetric relaxation of the left ventricle (129 ± 39 ms) {{and a reduction in}} early diastolic finding compared with values in normal subjects. <b>Late</b> diastolic <b>distortion</b> of left ventricular geometry associated with right ventricular volume overload had no influence on the duration of left ventricular isovolumetric relaxatoon (52 ± 32 ms) but caused a reduction in the atrial systolic contribution to late distolic filling of the left ventricle compared with values in normal sujects. In patients with right ventricular pressure overload, 52 ± 16 % of left ventricular filling occurred in early diastole compared with 78 ± 11 % in patients with right ventricular volume overload (p < 0. 001). The differential effects of systolic and diastolic right ventricular overload on the pattern of left ventricular filling appear to bt related to the timing of leftward ventricular septal displacement...|$|R
40|$|Background: Autogenous costal {{cartilage}} {{is a good}} {{option for}} large volume requirements in rhinoplasty, when septal or conchal cartilages do not suffice. Reluctance to use costal cartilage is due to apprehension of warping. However, warping can be avoided if we follow the principle of balanced section as advocated by Gibson and Davis. "Warping" {{can also be utilized}} to change the curvature of the graft. Materials and Methods: We have used 69 costal cartilage grafts as a solid piece for contour fill in rhinoplasty in 31 patients over the last 10 years. Principle of balanced section as advocated by Gibson and Davis was adhered to while carving the grafts, however some grafts were allowed to warp to get different sizes and shapes. Results: All the procedures were uneventful. Aesthetic appearance of all patients was satisfactory and acceptable to all the patients. In two cases, the dorsal graft minimally shifted to one side, but remained straight. In one patient, there was <b>late</b> appearance of <b>distortion.</b> Conclusion: The mode of cartilage warping is predictable and {{it can be used to}} advantage. Apprehension to use costal cartilage graft is unjustified, as with precision carving a desired shape can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{spectrum}} of {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) allows constraining episodes of energy release in the early Universe. In this paper we revisit and refine the computations of the cosmological thermalization problem. For this purpose a new code, called CosmoTherm, was developed that allows solving the coupled photon-electron Boltzmann equation in the expanding, isotropic Universe for small spectral distortion in the CMB. We explicitly compute the shape of the spectral distortions caused by energy release due to (i) annihilating dark matter; (ii) decaying relict particles; (iii) dissipation of acoustic waves; and (iv) quasi-instantaneous heating. We also demonstrate that (v) the continuous interaction of CMB photons with adiabatically cooling non-relativistic electrons and baryons causes a negative mu-type CMB spectral distortion of DI_nu/I_nu ~ 10 ^{- 8 } in the GHz spectral band. We solve the thermalization problem including improved approximations for the double Compton and Bremsstrahlung emissivities, as well as the latest treatment of the cosmological recombination process. At redshifts z <~ 10 ^ 3 the matter starts to cool significantly below the temperature of the CMB so that at very low frequencies free-free absorption alters the shape of primordial distortions significantly. In addition, the cooling electrons down-scatter CMB photons introducing a small <b>late</b> negative y-type <b>distortion</b> at high frequencies. We also discuss our results {{in the light of the}} recently proposed CMB experiment Pixie, for which CosmoTherm should allow detailed forecasting. Our current computations show that for energy injection because of (ii) and (iv) Pixie should allow to improve existing limits, while the CMB distortions caused by the other processes seem to remain unobservable with the currently proposed sensitivities and spectral bands of Pixie.
