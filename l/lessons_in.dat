5|$|Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams {{relocated}} to Georgiana with his family, {{where he met}} Rufus Payne, who gave him guitar <b>lessons</b> <b>in</b> exchange for meals or money.

He would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career.|$|E
5|$|By 1827, {{the family}} had {{returned}} to Leipzig. Wagner's first <b>lessons</b> <b>in</b> harmony were taken during 1828–31 with Christian Gottlieb Müller. In January 1828 he first heard Beethoven's 7th Symphony and then, in March, the same composer's 9th Symphony (both at the Gewandhaus). Beethoven became a major inspiration, and Wagner wrote a piano transcription of the 9th Symphony. He was also greatly impressed by a performance of Mozart's Requiem. Wagner's early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period.|$|E

5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had <b>lessons</b> <b>in</b> Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that {{the feeling of being}} an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works.

Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral <b>lessons</b> <b>in</b> his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
