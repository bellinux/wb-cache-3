5|$|A weather {{phenomenon}} known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all {{times of the year}} and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very <b>low</b> <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> {{to the north of the}} Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.|$|E
25|$|This {{phenomenon}} can {{be prevented}} by decreasing the relative humidity of the saturated discharge air. For that purpose, in hybrid towers, saturated discharge air is mixed with heated <b>low</b> <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> air. Some air enters the tower above drift eliminator level, passing through heat exchangers. The relative humidity of the dry air is even more decreased instantly as being heated while entering the tower. The discharged mixture has a relatively lower relative humidity and the fog is invisible.|$|E
25|$|Climatic factors {{contribute}} to Australia's high incidence of bushfires, particularly during the summer months. <b>Low</b> <b>relative</b> <b>humidity,</b> wind and lack of rain can cause a small fire, either man-made or caused naturally by lightning strikes, to spread rapidly over large distances. Low humidity, {{the heat of the}} sun and lack of water cause vegetation to dry out becoming a perfect fuel for the fire. High winds fan the flames, increasing their intensity and the speed and distance at which they can travel.|$|E

40|$|With the {{constantly}} decreasing silver {{reserves and}} correspondingly higher costs, film manufacturers are continually searching for methods {{to reduce the}} amount of silver that is used. By using closely controlled conditions of temperature and saturated salt solutions to provide control of <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> during drying of processed x-ray film, it was found that the covering power may be as low as 70 $ of its maximum value depending on the conditions used for drying the film. The highest values for covering power existed when the film was dried at low temperatures and high <b>relative</b> <b>humidities</b> or high temperatures and <b>low</b> <b>relative</b> <b>humidities.</b> The <b>lowest</b> values existed when both the temperature and <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> conditions together were either high or low.

25|$|The maximum {{potential}} {{is limited to}} about 35–40 kV, due to corona discharge dissipating the charge at higher potentials.

40|$|Salmonella typhimurium survived {{freeze-drying}} at a platen {{temperature of}} 120 F (48. 9 C) and also, though {{to a much}} lesser degree, at 160 F (82. 6 C). The extent of the survival at these temperatures was dependent on {{the composition of the}} model system employed.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to its use in photosynthesis, a vine's water supply is also depleted by the processes of evaporation and transpiration. In evaporation, heat (aided by wind and sunlight) causes water in the soil to evaporate and escape as vapor molecules. This process is inversely related to humidity with evaporation taking place at faster rates in areas with <b>low</b> <b>relative</b> <b>humidity.</b> In transpiration, this evaporation of water occurs directly in the vine, as water is released from the plant through the stomata that are located on the undersides of the leaves. This loss {{of water from the}} leaves is one of the driving factors that results in water being drawn up from the roots, and it also helps the vine combat against the effects of heat stress which can severely damage the physiological functions of the vine (somewhat similar to how perspiration works with humans and animals). The presence of adequate water in the vines can help keep the internal temperature of the leaf only a few degrees above the temperature of the surrounding air. However, if water is severely lacking then that internal temperature could jump nearly 18°F (10°C) warmer than the surrounding air which leads the vine to develop heat stress. The dual effects of evaporation and transpiration are called evapotranspiration. A typical vineyard in a hot, dry climate can lose as much as [...] of water per vine through evapotranspiration during the growing season.|$|E
