25|$|The fourth {{generation}} GS had its world premiere at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in California in August 2011. The vehicle {{was shown to}} have a more subtle version of the LF-Gh's spindle grille, while overall exterior dimensions are almost identical to the previous generation. L-shaped LED front daytime running lamps and rear <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> lamps are a new design feature. The new GS was the centerpiece of Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda's initiative to restore passion to the Lexus brand and better compete with German luxury automakers that had been gaining market share in the United States. It was reported that Toyoda initially opposed the styling choices made for the new model, but since thanked the design team that persuaded him to greenlight the project.|$|E
50|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{retrofit}} light sources, a <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> requires control gear to function. In general, the control gear is {{integrated into the}} <b>LED</b> <b>tube,</b> {{but it can also}} be located outside the actual light source.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2014 was {{completed}} {{a standard for}} <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> (EN2776) that guarantees a safe replacement of the traditional T8 fluorescent tube [...] Thanks to the standard, {{it is possible to}} replace old fluorescent <b>tubes</b> with <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> and use standardised <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> regardless of brand.|$|R
40|$|This project {{discusses}} {{design of}} <b>LED</b> RGB <b>tubes,</b> {{which can be}} driven by asynchronous serial line. The light color of the <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> can be controlled in a several segments of tubes. There is made a design of control unit for driving <b>LED</b> <b>tubes,</b> which contains circuits for receiving and detection of audio signal, receiving of protocol DMX 512 and also driving of LED strips. For the microprocessors there is also created a software which ensures a communication between the control unit and <b>LED</b> <b>tubes,</b> driving <b>LEDs</b> in the <b>tube</b> and creating various lighting effects...|$|R
50|$|As {{compared}} to T8 fluorescent lamp technology, <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> can reduce electricity consumption {{by more than}} 50%. Installation and maintenance cost savings can also be expected, since the service life of <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> is typically 3-5 times longer than that of fluorescent lamps.|$|R
50|$|In principle, {{anyone can}} replace a <b>LED</b> <b>tube.</b> In case of {{products}} {{based on the}} Retro-Fit installation approach, LED tubes contain all the electronics required, which means that {{in the event of}} <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> failure, replacement or even fluorescent tube reinstallation is simple.|$|E
5000|$|LED tubes {{that are}} only {{available}} {{as part of a}} dedicated lighting fixture. The package may also include control electronics that are external to the <b>LED</b> <b>tube,</b> and the LED tubes do not comply with the <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> standard EN 62776. Retro-fit LED tubes (installation method 1 above) can also often be installed in fixtures designed for LED tubes. In these cases, the fixture typically only acts as a frame or holder to the tube, and electricity supply to the tubes uses the conductors in the fixture. The <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> may also be compliant with standard EN 62776.|$|E
5000|$|LED tubes {{that are}} {{compatible}} with an electronic (HF) ballast. These LED tubes require a fixture that includes a functioning electronic ballast. This type {{has the advantage of}} easy upgrade of the <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> (compared to installation method 2). Expensive maintenance is a downside. In addition to the <b>LED</b> <b>tube,</b> also the electronic ballast may fail, and it can only be replaced by a qualified electrician. If a <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> that is compatible with an electronic ballast is installed in an old fluorescent fixture, the question of responsibility must be clarified. Who will be liable for the electronic ballast if it breaks when the <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> is being installed? The original supplier of the fixture and the coupling device will no longer be responsible if LED tubes with an electronic ballast are used. Therefore, it is worth considering whether electronic ballasts should be scrapped when LED tubes are fitted in old fixtures, particularly in extensive switchover projects. The term retro-fit is also used to refer to these tubes, as the new <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> will fit into the old fixture without modification. In these cases, the LED tubes may also be compliant with the EN 62776 standard.|$|E
50|$|There are 3 major {{styles of}} underglow LED lights: pod style led lights, LED strips and {{flexible}} <b>LED</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>LED</b> pod {{consists of a}} rigid housing, bunch of led lights and a lens. LED strips are easy to install almost everywhere, including engine bays or air intake scoops. <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> put out steady light that resembles classic neon glow.|$|R
5000|$|... 3rd {{generation}} of Retro-Fit LED tubesThe so-called 3rd generation <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> {{currently on the}} market resolve the insufficient luminosity problem characteristic to their 1st and 2nd generation counterparts. Since the light emitted by <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> is beam-like, the performance (measured in lx) of <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> as compared to fluorescent lamps of comparable size has also significantly depended on luminaire placement and optics. Some luminaire frames reflect the light emitted from a fluorescent lamp upwards and to the sides quite well, while others waste almost all but the light emitted downwards. Especially 1st and 2nd generation <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> of lesser luminous power failed to match the performance of fluorescent lamps if the luminaire included wide optics with good reflecting characteristics and only accommodated a single fluorescent/LED tube. Such luminaires are capable of maximizing redirection of the light emitted from a fluorescent lamp upwards and to the sides back into the room. In case of 3rd generation <b>LED</b> <b>tubes,</b> efforts {{have been made to}} solve this problem by increasing their luminous power, so that it would be sufficient under any circumstances, regardless of the luminaire. As a result, however, the tube surface brightness surpasses that of fluorescent lamps, and in some cases, individual bright LED components can have a disturbing effect. Today, several manufacturers offer 3rd generation <b>LED</b> <b>tubes,</b> but the excessive luminous power is generally accompanied by increased electricity consumption.|$|R
5000|$|... 4th {{generation}} of Retro-Fit <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> The 4th {{generation of}} <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> focuses on solving well-being related issues of general lighting. Recently, several studies aimed at flickering of electric lights have been conducted. According to these studies, the flickering of traditional fluorescent lamps can cause brain stress and anxiety. The 4th generation of <b>LED</b> <b>tubes</b> offers {{a solution to}} the flickering problem. The flickering is measured using so-called flicker index or flicker percentage value. Elimination of flickering allows high-quality video recording and slow motion capture, as well as certain machine vision applications in premises equipped with flicker-free lights.|$|R
50|$|<b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> {{lights are}} {{designed}} to physically fit in fixtures intended for fluorescent tubes. Some LED tubular lamps are {{intended to be a}} drop-in replacement into existing fixtures if appropriate ballast is used. Others require rewiring of the fixtures to remove the ballast. An <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> lamp generally uses many individual Surface-Mounted LEDs which are directional and require proper orientation during installation as opposed to Fluorescent tube lamps which emit light in all directions around the tube. Most <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> lights available can be used in place of T8, T10, or T12 tube designations, T8 is D26mm, T10 is D30mm, in lengths of 590 mm, 1200 mm and 1500 mm.|$|E

5000|$|... 1st {{generation}} of Retro-Fit LED tubesSo-called 1st generation Retro-Fit LED tubes were introduced {{on the market}} between 2005 and 2010, and not much attention was paid on quality or safety. In 2010, European safety authorities, including the Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency, ruled {{that the risk of}} electricity flowing through a <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> during the installation stage should be avoided. This refers to a situation where one end of a <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> is connected to the luminaire and the other, free end becomes energized. The ruling resulted in numerous sales bans and product recalls. Products complying with 1st generation electrical connection are still available on the market.|$|E
50|$|LED {{tubes are}} usually {{produced}} using {{a large number}} of low or medium-power LEDs. With the help of these, light output and heat conduction are balanced out across the entire tube length. The operating temperature of LED tubes is lower as compared to traditional lighting technologies, and a <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> produces less heat than traditional fluorescent lamps. Among the most important properties of LED tubes is the possibility of light direction - the entire luminous power of a <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> can be directed in a narrower beam to wherever the light is required. Owing to the directivity and good luminous efficacy, LED tubes provide illuminance equal to that of other lighting technologies at lower electric power consumption.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> {{standard}} EN 62776 {{is based}} on the international standard IEC 62776 [...] (Double-capped LED lamps designed to retrofit linear fluorescent lamps - Safety Specifications), which applies to LED tubes compatible with a magnetic as well as an electronic ballast.|$|E

50|$|<b>LED</b> <b>tube</b> is {{a modern}} source of light used in {{fluorescent}} lamp luminaires with G5 and G13 bases in place of traditional fluorescent tubes. As compared to fluorescent tubes, the most important advantages of LED tubes are energy efficiency and long service life. LED tubes are sometimes {{also referred to as}} ‘LED fluorescent tubes’, but since the light actually comes from LED components and the tubes contain no fluorescent substance, ‘LED tube’ is more correct.|$|E
