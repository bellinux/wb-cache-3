5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or when the Sun is high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When the Sun is <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|Solar cookers {{are less}} useful in cloudy weather {{and near the}} poles (where the sun is <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> or below the horizon), so an {{alternative}} cooking source is still required in these conditions. Solar cooking advocates suggest three devices for an integrated cooking solution: a) a solar cooker; b) a fuel-efficient cookstove; c) an insulated storage container such as a basket filled with straw to store heated food. Very hot food may continue to cook for hours in a well-insulated container. With this three-part solution, fuel use is minimized while still providing hot meals at any hour, reliably.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of the solar cells used in a photovoltaic system, in combination with latitude and climate, determines the annual energy output of the system. For example, a solar panel with 20% efficiency and an area of 1m2 will produce 200W at Standard Test Conditions, but it can produce more {{when the sun is}} high in the sky and will produce less in cloudy conditions and when the sun is <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> In central Colorado, which receives annual insolation of 5.5kWh/m2/day, such a panel can be expected to produce 440kWh of energy per year. However, in Michigan, which receives only 3.8kWh/m2/day, annual energy yield will drop to 280kWh for the same panel. At more northerly European latitudes, yields are significantly lower: 175kWh annual energy yield in southern England.|$|E

50|$|Legend has it {{that the}} stone goes down to the river, the Afon Llia to drink on occasion. This tale seems likely to be an allusion to the fact that its shadow is cast across the moorland as far as the river when <b>the</b> sun is <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening <b>sky.</b>|$|R
6000|$|It {{was after}} the fight, and around us all night [...] Thar was poppin' and shootin' a {{powerful}} sight; [...] And the niggers had fled, and Aunt Chlo was abed, [...] And Pinky and Milly were hid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shed: [...] And I ran out at daybreak, and nothin' was nigh [...] But the growlin' of cannon <b>low</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|R
500|$|Adenanthos cuneatus grows as an erect, {{spreading}} or prostrate shrub to [...] {{high and}} wide. It has a woody base, {{known as a}} lignotuber, from which it can resprout after bushfire. The wedge-shaped (cuneate) leaves are on short petioles, and are [...] long and [...] wide, with 3 to 5 (and occasionally up to 7) rounded 'teeth' or lobes at the ends. New growth is red and slightly translucent. It glows bright red against the light, especially {{when the sun is}} <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> New growth is mainly seen in summer, and the leaves in general are covered with fine, silvery hair. Occurring throughout the year but more often from August to November, the insignificant single flowers are a dull red in colour and measure around [...] long. The pollen is triangular in shape and measures [...] in length, averaging around [...]|$|E
500|$|Phoenix {{is a small}} {{constellation}} {{bordered by}} Fornax and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the south, touching {{on the corner of}} Hydrus to the south, and Eridanus to the east and southeast. The bright star Achernar is nearby. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'Phe'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between [...] and , while the declination coordinates are between −39.31° and −57.84°. This means it remains below the horizon to anyone living north of the 40th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and remains <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> for anyone living north of the equator. It is most visible from locations such as Australia and South Africa during late Southern Hemisphere spring. Most of the constellation lies within, and can be located by, forming a triangle of the bright stars Achernar, Fomalhaut and Beta Ceti—Ankaa lies roughly in the centre of this.|$|E
2500|$|The action resumed at 5 a.m. on 25 February. [...] The {{artillery}} advanced, facing east, {{enclosed by}} two columns of infantry: to the left, the engineers, the marine infantry and the chasseurs; {{to the right}} the Spanish infantry and the sailors. [...] The sun, very <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> was spoiling {{the aim of the}} cannons, and Lieutenant-Colonel Crouzat brought them forward by rapid bounds to within 200 metres of the enemy lines and ordered them to fire with case shot {{at the top of the}} ramparts. [...] The firing was very heavy and our men, in the open, suffered appreciable casualties. [...] Then the haversacks were laid on the ground, the sailors of the assault force reclaimed their scaling ladders, up to then carried by the coolies, and the admiral ordered the charge to be sounded.|$|E
6000|$|The mule {{was packed}} and Mose {{was about to}} say good-by. The sun was still <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>sky.</b> Frost was on the grass, but the air was crisp and pleasant. All the family stood beside him as he packed his outfit on the mule and threw over it the diamond hitch. As he {{straightened}} up he turned to the waiting ones and said: [...] "Do you see that gap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{may need}} it again," [...] he said briefly. Malchus placed his own clothes upon it and threw over his {{shoulders}} the bernous which Nessus had brought. He then mounted the steps with him, the gate was closed and the bolt shot, and they then made their way across to the stables. It was still perfectly dark, though a very faint light, <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>sky,</b> showed that ere long the day would break.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{silhouette}} of a man looking at the sunset over the ocean at Point Loma, ca. 1920. The silhouette of {{what appears to be a}} bridge and tree are visible at left, while a man is visible standing near center looking to the ocean at right and into the background. The sun is visible peeking through <b>low</b> clouds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> and reflects onto the ocean. Rocks and sand are visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right foreground...|$|R
2500|$|A dove, {{representing}} the Holy Spirit, hovers <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> directly above the lamb, surrounded by concentric semicircles {{of white and}} yellow hues of varying luminosity, the outermost of which appear like nimbus clouds. Thin golden beams emanating from the dove resemble those surrounding {{the head of the}} lamb, {{as well as those of}} the three figures in the Deësis in the upper register. The rays seem to have been painted by van Eyck over the finished landscape, and serve to illuminate the scene in a celestial, supernatural light. This is especially true with the light falling on the saints positioned directly in front of the altar. The light does not give reflection or throw shadow, and has traditionally been read by art historians as {{representing the}} New Jerusalem of Revelations which in 21:23, had [...] "no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the glory of God did Lighten it".|$|E
2500|$|A {{cumulonimbus}} {{cloud that}} appears to have a greenish or bluish tint is a sign that it contains extremely high amounts of water; hail or rain which scatter light in a way that gives the cloud a blue color. A green colorization occurs mostly late in the day when the sun is comparatively <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and the incident sunlight has a reddish tinge that appears green when illuminating a very tall bluish cloud. [...] Supercell type storms {{are more likely to be}} characterized by this but any storm can appear this way. Coloration such as this does not directly indicate that it is a severe thunderstorm, it only confirms its potential. Since a green/blue tint signifies copious amounts of water, a strong updraft to support it, high winds from the storm raining out, and wet hail; all elements that improve the chance for it to become severe, can all be inferred from this. In addition, the stronger the updraft is, the more likely the storm is to undergo tornadogenesis and to produce large hail and high winds.|$|E
2500|$|In the Arctic, {{during the}} winter months of November through February, the sun remains very <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> or does not rise at all. [...] Where it does rise, the days are short, and the sun's low {{position}} in the sky means that, even at noon, not much energy is reaching the surface. [...] Furthermore, most of the small amount of solar radiation that reaches the surface is reflected away by the bright snow cover. [...] Cold snow reflects between 70% and 90% of the solar radiation that reaches it (Serreze and Barry, 2005), and most of the Arctic, {{with the exception of the}} ice-free parts of the sea, have snow covering the land or ice surface in winter. [...] These factors result in a negligible input of solar energy to the Arctic in winter; the only things keeping the Arctic from continuously cooling all winter are the transport of warmer air and ocean water into the Arctic from the south and the transfer of heat from the subsurface land and ocean (both of which gain heat in summer and release it in winter) to the surface and atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|He {{lay there}} musing and dreaming till <b>the</b> sun grew <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{afternoon}} <b>sky,</b> and <b>the</b> tide that isolated the little grotto had gone far {{out into the}} ocean, leaving long, low reefs of sunken rocks, all matted and tangled with the yellow hair of the seaweed, with little crystal pools of salt water between. He {{heard the sound of}} approaching footsteps, and Captain Kittridge came slowly picking his way round among the shingle and pebbles.|$|R
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> to deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west. <b>In</b> late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a <b>low</b> angle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> <b>The</b> standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|R
60|$|On and on she went, over {{hill and}} valley, broad rivers and {{rustling}} woods, till the warm sunlight passed away, the winds grew cold, {{and the air}} thick with falling snow. Then far below she saw the Frost-King's home. Pillars of hard, gray ice supported the high, arched roof, hung with crystal icicles. Dreary gardens lay around, filled with withered flowers and bare, drooping trees; while heavy clouds hung <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>sky,</b> and a cold wind murmured sadly through the wintry air.|$|R
6000|$|... {Sun Man} [...] God wot! We have journeyed {{across the}} [...] sun, high and <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> {{and over the}} sun [...] and under the sun the round world 'round.|$|E
60|$|From {{that point}} he had nearly a {{hemisphere}} of sky {{and got his}} {{first glimpse of the}} Asiatic airships <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> above the glittering tumults of the Upper Rapids.|$|E
60|$|It {{was high}} noon when I first awoke, {{and the sun}} was <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> before I slept--slept as the {{tortured}} criminal sleeps on his rack, too worn to feel further pain.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> sun hung <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western <b>sky,</b> with {{a peak of}} {{the black}} {{cordillera}} cutting its lower edge, and Rio Frio shone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glaring light. Seen from the road across the valley, the town had an ethereal look, for the tiers of square, white houses rose from a gulf of shadow and clustered upon the hillside, glimmering with a pearly luster, picked out by clumps of green. Behind were barren slopes, deepening in color to dusky purple as they {{ran back to the}} foot of the mountain wall.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of bluff {{and landing}} at Spreckles' sugar plantation, Hawaii, 1907. Waves crash against {{the foot of}} the {{embankment}} down which the rail landing reaches to meet the choppy sea. A small building is visible {{at the top of the}} cliff at center.

40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} the French Fort de la Pompelle in Reims after a German bombardment, ca. 1915. The fort {{is built}} into the side of an earthen mound, and most of the masonry that is not flush with the dirt has been demolished. There are two {{partially}} covered brick archways at right that lead into the ridge, and at extreme right is a brick wall with several small rectangular windows. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> foreground at left is the remains of a corner of the fort's wall. There are <b>low</b> clouds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> that add to the bleakness of the scene...|$|R
60|$|Then, when {{he finally}} landed on the {{opposite}} shore, an hour was spent in searching for the horse, which had wandered into the woods, {{and by the time}} the boy was ready to begin the return journey the sun hung <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Now as Bert and Grubb bawled their chorus for {{the third}} time, they became aware of a very big, golden-brown balloon <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> to the north-west, and coming rapidly towards them.

60|$|Frank, glad of a brief rest, gazed astern. It {{was neither}} light nor dark, for a pale moon hung <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> casting a faint silvery track upon the water, {{which was now}} flecked with white froth a little off shore. Across the sweep of {{radiance}} there moved a tall black spire of slanting canvas, with the foam leaping up about the shadowy strip of hull beneath.|$|E
60|$|We {{remained}} there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stable yard until <b>the</b> sun was <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western <b>sky,</b> discussing <b>the</b> situation with Uncle 'Rasmus as our oracle. It is true we lads {{could not speak}} intelligently upon military matters, and as I look back now upon that day, I realize how much of folly there was in our words; but our hearts were nigh to bursting {{with the desire to}} do something toward ridding our colony of Virginia of those swaggering, insolent, red-coated men, all of whom we believed to be quite as brutal as Colonel Tarleton and his followers.|$|R
40|$|Imagery {{covering}} the Socompa volcano and debris avalanche deposit in northern Chile {{was acquired by}} MOMS- 01 when <b>the</b> sun was <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western <b>sky.</b> Illumination from <b>the</b> west shows many important topographic features to advantage. These are inconspicuous or indistinguishable on Landsat TM images acquired at higher solar elevation. The effective spatial resolution of MOMS- 01 {{is similar to that}} of the TM and its capacity for spectral discrimination is less. A technique has been developed to combine the multispectral information offered by TM with the topographic detail visible on MOMS- 01 imagery recorded at a time of low solar elevation...|$|R
60|$|A half moon hung <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear <b>sky,</b> but, for <b>the</b> most part, {{its light}} only reached a short {{distance}} down the white and yellow fronts of the flat-topped houses. These got light and air from the central courtyard, or patio, and the outer walls were only pierced by one or two very narrow windows at some height from the ground. The openings were marked here and there by a faint glow from within, which was often broken by a shadowy female form leaning against the bars and speaking softly to another figure on the pavement below.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{you think}} I am a washerman's donkey?' said the monkey to the shark, {{when the story}} was ended. 'You are wrong; I am not. And as the sun is getting <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> {{it is time for}} you to begin your homeward journey. You will have a nice cool voyage, and I hope you will find the sultan better. Farewell!' And the monkey {{disappeared}} among the green branches, and was gone.|$|E
60|$|The moon hung <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> like {{a yellow}} skull. From {{time to time}} a huge {{misshapen}} cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the man lost his way, and had to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The side-windows of the hansom were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.|$|E
60|$|The {{neighboring}} houses {{also had}} their balconies and roofs filled with people, for it seemed all the Sunset Tribe came out every night {{to witness the}} setting of the sun. It was really a magnificent sight, and Trot scarcely breathed as the great, golden ball sank <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and colored all the clouds with gorgeous tints of orange, red and yellow. Never on the Earth was there visible such splendor, and as the little girl watched the ever-changing scene, she decided the Sunset Tribe was amply justified in claiming that the West was the favored country of the sun.|$|E
60|$|A thin {{crescent}} moon hung <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western <b>sky.</b> <b>The</b> prairie {{was wrapped in}} silent shadows. Leland stood outside the homestead, with the bridle of an impatient horse in his hand, and talked with his wife. There was only one light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house behind them, and everything was very still, but Leland knew that two men who could be trusted to keep good watch were wide awake that night. The barrel of a Marlin rifle hung behind his shoulders, glinting fitfully when it caught the light as he moved. Without thinking {{of what he was}} doing, he fingered the clip of the sling.|$|R
60|$|The {{days were}} growing shorter rapidly, and <b>the</b> sun hung <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>sky</b> {{when at last}} the schooner crept {{into one of the}} many inlets that indent the coast of Southern Alaska. There was just wind enough to carry her in around a long, foam-lapped point, and soon afterwards they let <b>the</b> anchor go <b>in</b> four fathoms of water. Their haven was a sheltered arm of the sea with a river mouth not far away. There was no sign of life anywhere and the ragged cedars that crept close down to the beach stood out in somber spires against the gleaming snow.|$|R
50|$|It {{was well}} placed for viewing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} hemisphere <b>in</b> January 2013 to observe it brightening, crossing Centaurus, Crux and Chameleon, and into February {{when it was}} circumpolar <b>in</b> Octans. By <b>the</b> end of February it set early evening situated in Phoenix, was observable well into March. After perihelion the comet should be reasonably well placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning <b>sky</b> to observe as it fades. The comet was visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> STEREO heliospheric imager HI-2A starting on 17 April. C/2012 F6 crossed the celestial equator on 20 April 2013 becoming a northern hemisphere object. On 9 May 2013 the comet was near Gamma Pegasi and from a dark sky was visible in binoculars before sunrise <b>low</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>sky.</b>|$|R
