25|$|In {{the early}} pioneer days of Western Canada's prairie towns, when a good farming spot being settled, many {{people wanted to}} make money by {{building}} their own grain elevators. This brought in droves of private grain companies. Towns boasted dozens of elevator companies which all stood in a row along the railway tracks. If a town was <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two railways, {{it was to be}} known as the next Montreal. In many elevator rows there would be two or more elevators of the same company. Small towns bragged of their large elevator rows in promotional pamphlets to attract settlers. With so much competition in the 1920s, consolidation began almost immediately, and many small companies were merged or absorbed into larger companies.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are so excited to finally get out on the road and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some amazing support shows... but to be able to go out and play songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There For Tomorrow and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There For Tomorrow in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E

500|$|After a {{break of}} almost four months, Beholder {{returned}} in the Torrey Pines Stakes over one mile at Del Mar on September 1, {{where she was}} ridden {{for the first time}} by Gary Stevens. She started the 1–10 favorite and led all the way, winning from second-place finisher Wittgenstein. Four weeks later, Beholder was matched against older fillies and mares in the Grade I Zenyatta Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Santa Anita. She led from the start and won, with the six-year-old veteran Authenticity in second. Mandella called the winner [...] "a filly that really likes the fight" [...] while Stevens said that [...] "I haven't gotten close to the bottom of her yet". On November 1, Beholder contested the Breeders' Cup Distaff over nine furlongs at Santa Anita. The field was a very strong one, including Royal Delta who had won the race for the last two years, Princess of Sylmar, Authenticity, and Close Hatches. Although Beholder showed some anxiety in the starting gate, she had a clean start. Mandella had been training her so that instead of always being a front-runner, she could be [...] rated behind other horses and conserve energy. His strategy was a success as Beholder tracked the leaders before moving up into second place half a mile from the finish. She took the lead two furlongs out and went clear of the field to win by [...] lengths over Close Hatches, with Royal Delta fourth and Princess of Sylmar last of the six runners. After the race, Mandella said, [...] "I’ve been <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> many good mares in my years of training, but this mare might have to be the best of all." [...] With her Distaff win, she became the first horse to win both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and the Distaff in consecutive years.|$|E

Throughout his reign he had to struggle against conservatives who opposed his reforms.

Abdulmejid toured the empire's territories to see in person how the Tanzimat reforms were being applied. [...] He travelled to İzmit, Mudanya, Bursa, Gallipoli, Çanakkale, Lemnos, Lesbos and Chios in 1844 and toured the Balkan provinces in 1846.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Steven Zaloga credits Wittmann with [...] "about 135" [...] tank kills, {{and points}} out that Wittmann {{achieved}} 120 of these in 1943, operating a Tiger I tank on the Eastern Front. Having advantages both in firepower and in armor, Tiger I was [...] "nearly invulnerable in a frontal engagement" [...] against any of the Soviet tanks of that time, and Wittmann thus could destroy opposing tanks from a safe distance. Zaloga concludes: [...] "Most of the 'tank aces' of World War II were simply <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an invulnerable tank with a powerful gun" [...] (quotation marks in the original). German documents from 1944 stated that Allied technology had {{caught up with the}} Tiger I, and that: [...] "no longer can it prance around, oblivious to the laws of tank tactics". Zaloga believes that Wittmann's fate reflected that new reality: after transfer to France, his crew only lasted two months, and was destroyed by a British medium tank, the up-gunned Sherman Firefly.|$|E

2500|$|PQ-17 was {{notable for}} being a {{complete}} disaster. In a confusing series of events, the British Admiralty ordered the convoy to scatter on 4 July; the way the messages were phrased indicated to the commanders of the convoy and escort that Tirpitz was nearby.

40|$|Extract] Have {{you ever}} {{experienced}} a stone or rock in your sneaker/runner? Has it left you feeling uncomfortable? Maybe even angry or annoyed for making you stop? Or, might you have ignored it, <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a blister later? Change of metaphor now - consider the stone/rock {{as a social}} or cultural issue, particular to physical and health educators that could (should) have impact on pedagogy. Such issues might include ethnicity, culture, gender, class, sexuality and (dis) ability that interlace with the discourses of social justice and inclusion. Ellen Singleton and Aniko Varpalotai as editors of this text have coordinated fifteen chapters to present provocative and sometimes disquieting insight into such issues that face individuals, schools and communities. In their words (2006, p. ix), "each chapter represents the many 'stones' that trouble us in our day-to-day teaching and interaction with students". what is assumed in this is that teachers do recognise the "stones", although we know several either don't see them and operate via routined practices, or choose to ignore. However, this text aims to develop a more open awareness of these critical pedagogical issues for student teachers...|$|R
2500|$|At {{least four}} veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) {{individuals}} were witnessed retrieving coconut shells, manipulating them, stacking them, transporting them some distance (up to 20 metres), and then reassembling {{them to use}} as a shelter. The octopuses use coconut shells discarded by humans which have eventually settled in the ocean. They probe their arms down to loosen the mud, then rotate the shells out. After turning the shells so the open side faces upwards, the octopuses blow jets of mud out of the bowl before extending their arms around the shell—or if they have two halves, stacking them first, one inside the other. They then stiffen their legs and move away in a manner which has been called [...] "stilt-walking". The octopuses eventually use the shells as a protective shelter in areas where little other shelter exists. If they just have one half, they simply turn it over and hide underneath. But if they are <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> retrieved two halves, they assemble them back into the original closed coconut form and sneak inside. This behaviour [...] The authors of the research article claimed this behaviour falls under the definition of tool use because the shells are carried for later use. However, this argument remains contested by a number of other biologists who state that the shells actually provide continuous protection from abundant bottom-dwelling predators in their home range.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of the indigenous languages in our country are no longer be-ing learned at home, and the last generation of native speakers are growing older and older. 1 At the same time, there are increasingly strong efforts by communi-ties to keep their languages alive by developing teaching programs of various sorts {{in the schools and}} in the community. The problem is, who will teach the language? Some communities are <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> still <b>have</b> young and middle aged adult speakers who also have or can get training in language teaching prac-tices. But as the speakers age, increasingly, the energy and the burden for lan-guage revitalization is among the younger adult generations who are not fluent in their language. It is sad, but it is true, and we can do no less than honor and support those with the drive and the bravery to take on this task. This paper is an attempt to support these efforts by discussing the problem that such heroes must face: how to teach a language when the teacher isn’t fluent. It is very easy for a non-fluent speaker (or often, even a fluent one) to fall back on a form of language-teaching that involves word-lists taught through th...|$|R
6000|$|Here {{we first}} made {{acquaintance}} with Mr. Browning, guided to his works by a parody which a lady wrote {{in our little}} magazine. Mr. Browning was not a popular poet in 1861. His admirers were few, a little people, {{but they were not}} then in the later mood of reverence, they did not awfully question the oracles, as in after years. They read, they admired, they applauded, on occasion they mocked, good-humouredly. The book by which Mr. Browning was best known was the two green volumes of [...] "Men and Women." [...] In these, I still think, is the heart of his genius beating most strenuously and with an immortal vitality. Perhaps this, for its compass, is the collection of poetry the most various and rich of modern English times, almost of any English times. But just as Mr. Fitzgerald cared little for what Lord Tennyson wrote after 1842, so I {{have never been able to}} feel quite the same enthusiasm for Mr. Browning's work after [...] "Men and Women." [...] He seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more influence, though that influence is vague, on persons who chiefly care for thought, than on those who chiefly care for poetry. I have met a lady who had read [...] "The Ring and the Book" [...] often, the [...] "Lotus Eaters" [...] not once. Among such students are Mr. Browning's disciples of the Inner Court: I dwell but in the Court of the Gentiles.
