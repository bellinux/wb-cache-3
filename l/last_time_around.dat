5|$|During this period, Ueshiba {{was invited}} to teach {{at a number of}} {{military}} institutes, due to his close personal relationships with key figures in the military (among them Sadao Araki, the Japanese Minister of War). He accepted an invitation from Admiral Sankichi Takahashi to be the martial arts instructor at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, and also taught at the Nakano Spy School, although aikido was later judged to be too technical for the students there and karate was adopted instead. He also became a visiting instructor at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy after being challenged by (and defeating) General Makoto Miura, another student of Takeda Sōkaku's Daitō-ryū. Takeda himself met Ueshiba for the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> 1935, while Ueshiba was teaching at the Osaka headquarters of the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Frustrated by the appearance of his teacher, who was openly critical of Ueshiba's martial arts and who appeared intent on taking over the classes there, Ueshiba left Osaka during the night, bowing to the residence in which Takeda was staying and thereafter avoiding all contact with him. Between 1940 and 1942 he made several visits to Manchukuo (Japanese occupied Manchuria) where he was the principal martial arts instructor at Kenkoku University. Whilst in Manchuria, he met and defeated the sumo wrestler Tenryū Saburō during a demonstration.|$|E
25|$|Chimborazo then erupted {{several times}} during the Holocene, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> 550 AD ± 150years. The eruptions after the {{collapse}} were primarily andesitic, or blocky, coagulated lava flow. These eruptions produced pyroclastic surges that went down as far as 3800 meters altitude. There has been at least 7 eruptions in the past 10000 years. Chimborazo is officially considered inactive, but studies show that there might be an eruption in the future. The average time between eruptions for Chimborazo is 1000 years, and the last eruption was 1400 years ago.|$|E
25|$|At around 17:45, Sydney fired two torpedoes {{from her}} {{starboard}} tubes (although some Germans reported more). Prior to the torpedo launch, Detmers {{had decided to}} destroy Sydney completely and ordered the raider to turn to port so four-gun salvoes could be fired: this manoeuvre caused the torpedoes to pass astern of Kormoran. After completing the turn, battle damage caused Kormorans engines to fail completely, leaving the raider {{dead in the water}} while Sydney continued to sail southwards at low speed. Kormoran maintained a high rate of fire despite being immobilised—some sailors claimed that up to 450 shells were used during {{the second phase of the}} battle—and scored hits on the cruiser, although many shells missed as the range increased. The raider fired her guns for the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> 17:50, with the range at , and a torpedo was launched at 18:00, but missed Sydney.|$|E

25|$|On 12 August 2008, Komsomolskaya Pravda {{reported}} that in South Ossetia several soldiers were wounded and one was killed, who were from Tatarstan. Five days {{before he was killed}} in South Ossetia, Evgeny Parfenov warned his parents not to call him because {{it would be hard to}} reach him by phone. Lieutenant Aleksandr Popov was participating in the exercises on the height near Tskhinvali when his group was requested by the intelligence to reinforce them. According to Popov's mother, Popov told her he could see how the Georgians fired on Tskhinvali one week before the war. The mother of Eldar Lotfullin, 23-year-old contract soldier, said that she was able to call her son for the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> at <b>around</b> 10 PM MSK on 7 August 2008.

25|$|By 17:35, {{the cruiser}} was heading south, heavily damaged, on fire, and losing speed, with her main guns {{destroyed}} or jammed {{facing away from}} their target and her secondary weapons out of range. Kormoran maintained her course and speed, but discontinued salvo firing; her stern guns continued to score hits as Sydney passed through their firing arcs. The cruiser fired torpedoes at Kormoran, but as the raider was turning to bring her port broadside to bear, these passed harmlessly astern. After completing the turn, battle damage caused Kormorans engines to fail completely, leaving the raider {{dead in the water}} while Sydney continued to limp southwards. Despite being immobilised, Kormoran continued to fire at a high rate — some of the German sailors reported that up to 450 shells were used during {{the second phase of the}} battle — and scored hits on the cruiser, although misses would have increased as the range grew.

500|$|After surrendering, Diệm called Lodge by {{telephone}} {{for the last}} time. Lodge did not report the conversation to Washington, so it was widely assumed that the pair last spoke on the previous afternoon when the coup was just starting. However, after Lodge died in 1985, his aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Lodge and Diệm spoke for the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>around</b> 07:00 on 2 November moments after Diệm surrendered. When Diệm called, Lodge [...] "put [...] on hold" [...] and then walked away. Upon his return, the ambassador offered Diệm and Nhu asylum, but would not arrange for transportation to the Philippines until the next day. This contradicted his earlier offer of asylum the previous day when he implored Diệm to not resist the coup. Dunn offered to personally go to the brothers' hideout to escort him so that the generals could not kill him, but Lodge refused, saying, [...] "We just can't get that involved." [...] Dunn said, [...] "I was really astonished that we didn't do more for them." [...] Having refused to help the brothers {{to leave the country}} safely, Lodge later said after they had been shot, [...] "What would we have done with them if they had lived?

50|$|Throughout the 1950s, {{although}} {{it would be for}} the <b>last</b> <b>time,</b> women <b>around</b> the world continued to submit to the trends of Parisian haute couture. Three of the most prominent of the Parisian couturiers of the time were Cristóbal Balenciaga, Hubert de Givenchy, and Pierre Balmain. The frugal prince of luxury, Cristóbal Balenciaga Esagri made his fashion debut in the late 1930s. However, {{it was not until the}} post-war years that the full scale of the inventiveness of this highly original designer became evident. In 1951, he totally transformed the silhouette, broadening the shoulders and removing the waist. In 1955, he designed the tunic dress, which later developed into the chemise dress of 1957. And eventually, in 1959, his work culminated in the Empire line, with high-waisted dresses and coats cut like kimonos. His mastery of fabric design and creation defied belief. Balenciaga is also notable as one of the few couturiers in fashion history who could use their own hands to design, cut, and sew the models which symbolized the height of his artistry.|$|R

5000|$|About {{the name}} of the movie, the {{director}} Sebastián Hofmann {{said in an interview with}} Vice Mexico that when he started thinking about the story for his film, he had a childhood memory of his grandmother asking him to draw Halley's Comet. That happened in 1986, the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> it passed <b>around</b> the Earth. While writing the script for the film in Yucatán, México, he was walking across a town when he saw a newspaper where he read that there was going to be a meteor shower caused by the cosmic dust trail of Halley's Comet. He thought then that it was to much of a coincidence and called the project like the comet. For the director, Halley is also [...] "a symbol for immortality" [...] since it has being known since the beginnings of astronomy and it orbits around the Sun every 75 years. Hofmann says [...] "it is the eternal witness of our history, with its cycles of upswing and decline. The space between each one of its visits is the duration of a human life." ...|$|R

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 13 reviews.

[...] In addition, Dolan noted that [...] "The Mob are happily {{out of step with}} 2013 hip-hop, {{going so far as to}} have nice songs about women." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent said, [...] "In the 14 years since World Party, Cee Lo Green has entirely overshadowed his former Goodie Mob friends, and that dynamic dominates this comeback reunion album. Which is no bad thing: whether he's blurting out a lyric about “white power” over a Moody Blues sample (“Power”) or joyously remembering “my very first white girl” (“Amy”), Cee Lo burns with a fierce creative fire." [...] Jason Lymangrover of AllMusic said, [...] "By the end of the album, Cee Lo's presence dominates and songs start falling closer to material from The Odd Couple. Even when AATM feels like it is coming straight out of left field, it is highly entertaining." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian stated, [...] "The 18-track culmination of a reunion that's been brewing longer than the full line-up of Goodie Mob <b>lasted</b> first <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> Age Against the Machine feels less like a grand comeback statement to lay the group's demons to rest and more like sweeping up forgotten odds and ends from the studio.
