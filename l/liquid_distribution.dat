50|$|The {{method of}} liquid {{injection}} at the venturi throat {{can also cause}} problems. Spray nozzles are used for <b>liquid</b> <b>distribution</b> {{because they are more}} efficient (have a more effective spray pattern) for liquid injection than weirs. However, spray nozzles can easily plug when liquid is recirculated. Automatic or manual reamers can be used to correct this problem. However, when heavy liquid slurries (either viscous or particle-loaded) are recirculated, open-wear injection is often necessary.|$|E
50|$|Full cone nozzles yield {{complete}} {{spray coverage}} in a round, oval or square shaped area. Usually the liquid is swirled within the nozzle and mixed with non-spinning liquid that has bypassed an internal vane. Liquid then exits through an orifice, forming a conical pattern. Spray angle and <b>liquid</b> <b>distribution</b> within the cone pattern {{depend on the}} vane design and location relative to the exit orifice. The exit orifice design and the relative geometric proportions also affect the spray angle and distribution.Full cone nozzles provide a uniform spray distribution of medium to large size drops resulting from their core design, which features large flow passages. Full cone nozzles are the style most extensively used in industry.|$|E

50|$|In general {{evaporation}} {{takes place}} inside vertical tubes, {{but there are}} also applications where the process fluid evaporates on the outside of horizontal or vertical tubes. In all cases, the process fluid to be evaporated flows downwards by gravity as a continuous film. The fluid will create a film along the tube walls, progressing downwards (falling) - hence the name.The fluid distributor has to be designed carefully in order to maintain an even <b>liquid</b> <b>distribution</b> for all tubes along which the solution falls. A typical distributor is shown in Fig. 2; these distributors are usually called ferrules due to their concentric shape.In the majority of applications the heating medium is placed {{on the outside of the}} tubes. High heat transfer coefficients are required in order to achieve equally balanced heat transfer resistances. Therefore, condensing steam is commonly used as a heating medium.For internally evaporating fluids, separation between the liquid phase (the solution) and the gaseous phase takes place inside the tubes. In order to maintain conservation of mass as this process proceeds, the downward vapor velocity increases, increasing the shear force acting on the liquid film and therefore also the velocity of the solution. The result can be a high film velocity of a progressively thinner film resulting in increasingly turbulent flow. The combination of these effects allows very high heat transfer coefficients.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{characterize}} the impact of binder <b>liquid</b> <b>distribution</b> on granule properties during the wet granulation process. A new parameter, namely the binder liquid transfer coefficient, is used to characterize binder <b>liquid</b> <b>distribution.</b> The relationships between binder <b>liquid</b> <b>distribution</b> coefficient and granule size distribution are discussed. Granules are made of lactose alpha-monohydrate (97. 5 % w/w, d 50 = 31 μm) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (2. 5 % w/w, d 50 = 89 μm) and are manufactured in a Mi-Pro high shear mixer (Pro-C-epT, Belgium). Nigrosine is incorporated as a tracer in the binder liquid in order to detect its distribution in the granules during the process. The results show that the binder liquid is heterogeneously distributed at the beginning of the process whereas it tends to be evenly distributed in the powder during the process. The binder liquid transfer in granule classes obeys a first-order law and the binder liquid transfer coefficient appears to be related to operating conditions: high rotation speed, low liquid flow rate and low liquid viscosity favour the achievement of high liquid transfer coefficient. In addition, the higher the coefficient, the earlier the homogenization and the wider the granule mean diameters. Thus, granule size distribution can be controlled by the binder <b>liquid</b> <b>distribution</b> process. A binder <b>liquid</b> <b>distribution</b> mechanism is proposed, which makes it possible to discuss the influence of the operating parameters on the granule construction process...|$|E

40|$|In an {{industrial}} Fluid CokerTM, liquid bitumen is injected into {{a bed of}} hot coke particles through spray nozzles, grouped in several banks at different vertical positions. The main objective of this thesis is to determine whether significant improvements in liquid-solid contact could be achieved by optimizing {{the location of the}} spray nozzles. In the coker regions where bitumen is injected, the gas is a mixture of product vapors and steam. Steam introduced at different levels rises through the coker: the stripping steam is injected near the bottom, then the attrition steam above the stripper and finally the bitumen atomization steam. As a result, the cross-sectional averaged gas velocity greatly varies vertically, from the lowest spray bank to the highest spray bank. In addition, there are large radial variations in gas velocity, as gas bubbles tend to concentrate in the central region of the bed.
