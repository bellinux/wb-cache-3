5|$|Glatter has praised MacLachlan's {{involvement}} in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored {{the character of}} Cooper; she noted that he was as devoted to the character's comedic elements as to his dramatic side and that the crew had difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> his comic delivery. She has also noted that although the writers and directors on the series tended to emphasize the rapport between Cooper and Fenn's character Audrey Horne, {{there was never any}} intention to bring the characters together as a couple.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the main}} characters, only Otho is not morally contemptible. Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and {{something}} of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also a liar and a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> his characters.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{versions}} of the video. The full, long version is one minute longer than the Making the Video version, while the cut version omits the scenes in which she leaves the airport and is sleepy and in which she fills out the questionnaire. The short version begins with Stefani practicing on the piano and her finding the watch just seconds after that. Her being billed is not shown in this version, so the video ends with the Harajuku Girls <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> her performance.|$|E

5|$|Ziegfeld {{returns to}} his father and young Mary Lou at the Chicago Musical College, and departs to San Francisco, where he and Sandow are deemed frauds for putting on a show in which Sandow faces a lion who falls asleep {{as soon as it}} is let out of the cage. Flo travels to England on an ocean liner, where he runs into Billings again who is <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> a {{newspaper}} article denouncing him as a fraud.|$|E
5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind {{her on the}} chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E
5|$|English doctor Maxwell (Shearsmith) {{settles into}} bunk 9E while {{travelling}} from Paris to Bourg-Saint-Maurice. Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg (Pemberton), a drunk, flatulent German who climbs into bunk 9D, then by Kath (Hesmondhalgh) and Les (Benton), a couple travelling to their daughter's wedding. Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple climb into 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she places her bag on bunk 9C then leaves, and Maxwell closes the door. Kath and Les, <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> Maxwell, begin to undress on the bed. Les wakes Jorg, but understanding is limited until Maxwell translates. Jorg switches to 9F and Les climbs into 9D.|$|E

60|$|It {{was their}} turn to <b>laugh,</b> now, <b>at</b> the notion of his shaking Scrooge. But, being {{thoroughly}} good-natured, and not much caring what they <b>laughed</b> <b>at,</b> so that they <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.|$|R
60|$|The girls <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> this sally, as light-hearted, happy {{girls will}} <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> {{anything}} of the sort; and Patt put in her retort, in her own direct, spirited manner.|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} panning view of a fence and people with {{umbrellas}} on the left, eventually zooming out on an audience looking through it in the rain. Both Volkova and Katina are then shown singing to the track in Catholic school uniforms. Throughout {{the majority of the}} visual, the girls are featured performing erratic behaviour, which includes them banging against a fence, yelling for help towards the audience, and occasionally <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> them. While continuing to sing to each other during the second chorus, they subsequently start to kiss, and the audience slightly stares at their actions. Following this, several members of the public start to talk to each other, whilst a shot with the camera looking up Volkova's skirt and exposing her underwear is shown during the process.|$|E
5|$|As a joke {{mirroring}} Cartman's, one of {{the girls}} at school queefs on Butters' face, causing him to run screaming and crying out of the school building. The other boys are shocked and their fathers, outraged, go to the Colorado General Assembly and demand a law banning queefing, much to the anger of the town's women. Meanwhile, the Queef Sisters appear on Regis and Kelly to promote their book Eat, Pray, Queef, and Terrance and Philip's show gets canceled due to the rising popularity of the Queef Sisters. Terrance and Philip attempt to kill the Queef Sisters, but the plan backfires when they end up becoming attracted to them after the Queef Sisters mention that Terrence and Phillip are the sisters' idols. They pair off into couples and travel the Canadian Wine Country together. Meanwhile, after Stan's mother Sharon queefs, she and Stan's sister, Shelley, start <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> the dinner table, causing Stan and his father Randy to leave.|$|E
5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking and <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> the same time.|$|E

60|$|But Peter {{was not to}} be conciliated, {{and took}} himself off in high dudgeon. To be <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> before Felicity--to be <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> BY Felicity--was {{something}} he could not endure. Let Cecily and the Story Girl cackle all they wanted to, and let those stuck-up Toronto boys grin like chessy-cats; but when Felicity <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> him the iron entered into Peter's soul.|$|R

5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E
5|$|Gellibrand was {{disappointed}} at not being appointed AA & QMG, but Bridges was unimpressed with Gellibrand's staff work. He felt that Gellibrand had mishandled the move of the 2nd Infantry Brigade to Cape Helles, where it {{participated in the}} First Battle of Krithia. He also expected Gellibrand to organise a proper officers' mess at Gallipoli and was annoyed at the poor quality of what Gellibrand had scrounged from ships' canteen supplies. Gellibrand might have even been dismissed by Bridges but fate intervened. On 1 May Gellibrand {{was wounded in the}} ankle by shrapnel. Then, on 11 May, while <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> two men whose water bottles had been holed, he received a severe wound in his right shoulder and was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS Gascon. While it was still anchored off Anzac Cove, Bridges was wounded on 15 May and brought on board the same ship (and to the same bed, Gellibrand was moved out of the way), where Bridges died on 18 May 1915.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E
50|$|Gelotophobia is a fear {{of being}} <b>laughed</b> <b>at,</b> a type of social phobia. While {{most people do not}} like being <b>laughed</b> <b>at,</b> there is a {{sub-group}} of people that exceedingly fear being <b>laughed</b> <b>at.</b> Without obvious reasons, they relate laughter they hear to be directed at themselves. Since 2008, this phenomenon has attracted attention from scholars in psychology, sociology, and psychiatry, and has been studied intensively.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{strange to}} say, no one <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> Peter, queer {{as the story}} sounded. You see, they all remembered how they had <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> him and made fun of him when he told about the great {{footprints}} he had found deep in the Green Forest, and how later it had been proven that he really did see them, for they were made by Buster Bear who had {{come down from the}} Great Woods to live in the Green Forest. Then it had been Peter's turn to <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> them. So now, impossible as this new story sounded, they didn't dare <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|R

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Rey Mysterio and CM Punk was {{continued}} from several previous pay-per-views. After months of feuding, Mysterio challenged Punk to a Straight Edge Society Pledge vs. Hair match at Over the Limit. Had Punk won, Mysterio would {{have joined the}} Straight Edge Society, Punk's faction which promoted the straight edge lifestyle. Had Mysterio won however, Punk agreed to have his head shaved. On May 14, Mysterio and Punk faced {{each other in a}} singles match, but the Straight Edge Society (Luke Gallows, Serena, and a mystery masked man) interfered and attacked Mysterio. The following week, Mysterio interrupted an initiation ceremony, in which Punk was shaving the heads of three men to induct them into the Straight Edge Society, and mocked Punk, claiming everyone would be <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> Punk when he was shaved bald at Over the Limit. Later that night, Mysterio teamed with Montel Vontavious Porter to defeat Punk and Gallows in a tag team match.|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} {{employees}} are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the male employees a tour of his massive home, spending {{most of the time}} mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild, uninhibited parties. He offers those present on the tour a free bottle of wine from his wine cellar and the staff proceed to get drunk. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay {{for the duration of the}} tour in order to punish him for <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their brown-nosing battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.|$|E

25|$|Edward was shy, and {{classmates and}} {{teachers}} remembered him as having strange mannerisms, such as seemingly random laughter, {{as if he}} were <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> his own personal jokes. To make matters worse, his mother punished him whenever he tried to make friends. Despite his poor social development, he did fairly well in school, particularly in reading.|$|E
25|$|With his eye {{tuned to}} the {{southern}} jury, Knight cross-examined her. He noted her stylish dress and demanded where she had gotten her fine clothes. When she responded that the Communist Party had paid for her clothes, any credibility she had with the jury was destroyed. Judge Horton warned spectators to stop <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> her testimony or he would eject them.|$|E
25|$|If {{the subject}} matter weren't sacred in the original, we would be {{responding}} to the picture in the most charitable way possible by <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> it from start to finish; this Christian mercy being denied us, we can only sit and sullenly marvel at the energy for which, {{for more than four}} hours, the note of serene vulgarity is triumphantly sustained.|$|E
