60|$|The {{doctrine}} so {{laid down}} demands that every several circumstance should in itself be conclusive, {{or at least}} should afford a violent presumption: it must, we were told, without question, be material to the charge depending. But, as we conceive, its materiality, more or less, {{is not in the}} first instance to be established. To make it admissible, it is enough to give proof, or to raise a <b>legal</b> <b>inference,</b> of its connection both with the charge depending and the person of the party charged, where it does not appear {{on the face of the}} evidence offered. Besides, by this new doctrine, the materiality required to be shown must be decided from a consideration, not of the whole circumstance, but in truth of one half of the circumstance,--of a demeanor unconnected with and unexplained by that on which it arose, though the connection between the demeanor of the party and the paper is that which must be shown to be material. Your Committee, after all they have heard, is yet to learn how the full force and effect of any demeanor, as evidence of guilt or innocence, can be known, unless it be also fully known to what that demeanor applied,--unless, when a person did or said anything, it be known, not generally and abstractedly, that a paper was read to him, but particularly and specifically what were the contents of that paper: whether they were matters lightly or weightily alleged,--within the power of the party accused to have confuted on the spot, if false,--or such as, though he might have denied, he could not instantly have disproved. The doctrine appeared and still appears to your Committee to be totally abhorrent from the genius of circumstantial evidence, and mischievously subversive of its use. We did, however, offer that extraneous proof which was demanded of us; but it was refused, as well as the office document.|$|E
60|$|The Commons of Great Britain, whilst {{willing to}} keep a strong and firm hand over all those who {{represent}} them in any business, do {{at the same time}} encourage them in the prosecution of it, by allowing them a just discretion and latitude wherever their own orders have not marked a distinction. I shall therefore go on with the more cheerful confidence, not only for the reasons that I have stated, but for another and material reason. I know and am satisfied, that, in the nobleness of your judgment, you will always make a distinction between the person that gives the order and the organ that is to execute it. The House of Commons know no such thing as indiscretion, imprudence, or impropriety: it is otherwise with their instruments. Your Lordships very well know, that, if you hear anything that shall appear to you to be regular, apt to bring forward the charge, just, prudent, cogent, you are to give it to the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament assembled; if you should hear from me (and it must be from me alone, and not from any other member of the Committee) anything that is unworthy of that situation, that comes feeble, weak, indigested, or ill-prepared, you are to attribute that to the instrument. Your Lordships' judgment would do this without my saying it. But whilst I claim it {{on the part of the}} Commons for their dignity, I claim for myself the necessary indulgence that must be given to all weakness. Your Lordships, then, will impute it where you would have imputed it without my desire. It is a distinction you would naturally have made, and the rather because what is alleged by us at the bar is not the ground upon which you are to give judgment. If not only I, but the whole body of managers, had made use of any such expressions as I made use of,--even if the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament assembled, if the collective body of Parliament, if the voice of Europe, had used them,--if we had spoken with the tongues of men and angels, you, in the seat of judicature, are not to regard what we say, but what we prove; you are to consider whether the charge is well substantiated, and proof brought out by <b>legal</b> <b>inference</b> and argument. You know, and I am sure the habits of judging which your Lordships have acquired by sitting in judgment must better inform you than any other men, that the duties of life, in order to be well performed, must be methodized, separated, arranged, and harmonized in such a manner that they shall not clash with one another, but each have a department assigned and separated to itself. My Lords, in that manner it is that we, the prosecutors, have nothing to do with the principles which are to guide the judgment, that we have nothing to do with the defence of the prisoner. Your Lordships well know, that, when we come before you, you hear a party; that, when the accused come before you, you hear a party: that it is for you to doubt, and wait till you come to the close, before you decide; that it is for us, the prosecutors, to have decided before we came here. To act as prosecutors, we ought to have no doubt or hesitation, nothing trembling or quivering in our minds upon the occasion. We ought to be fully convinced of guilt, before we come to you. It is, then, our business to bring forward the proofs,--to enforce them with all the clearness, illustration, example, that we can bring forward,--that we are to show the circumstances that can aggravate the guilt,--that we are to go further, show the mischievous consequences and tendency of those crimes to society,--and that we are, if able so to do, to arouse and awaken in the minds of all that hear us those generous and noble sympathies which Providence has planted in the breasts of all men, to be the true guardians of the common rights of humanity. Your Lordships know that this is the duty of the prosecutors, and that therefore we are not to consider the defence of the party, which is wisely and properly left to himself; but we are to press the accusation with all the energy of which it is capable, and to come with minds perfectly convinced before an august and awful tribunal which at once tries the accuser and the accused.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to analyse}} the {{phenomenon}} of the diffusion of interpretive paradigms or argumentation models between constitutional courts. This phenomenon involves the importation of parameters - defined here as extra-systemic to a specific legal system - {{and the use of the}} comparative method in applying constitutional texts. The main subject of this study is the analysis of the first 11 years of South African constitutional jurisprudence, which is a convenient scenario since a constitutional provision enables the Constitutional Court to 'consider foreign law' when interpreting the Bill of Rights. In fact, this led to the wide use of foreign jurisprudence and legislation (from which were extracted argumentation models, patterns of balancing between principles and sometimes actual normative 'meanings') : in other words, extra-systemic <b>legal</b> <b>inferences.</b> This article shows the existence of several patterns of legal argumentation based on foreign law which were developed by the South African Constitutional Court. </p...|$|R
40|$|In one {{standard}} sense, defeasibility is {{a feature of}} inferences, and one that seems to defy classical first order logic: An inference is defeasible when its putative conclusion is rendered doubtful {{by the addition of}} premises (thus violating monotonicity). The main argument of this paper is that certain types of inferences are defeasible in ways that render the putative conclusion genuinely indeterminate. The discussion, and most of the examples, focus on pragmatic <b>inferences,</b> <b>legal</b> <b>inferences</b> and on some overlapping cases, that is, cases in which legal defeasibility is actually a matter of pragmatics. I also argue that legal presumptions and the open-endedness of possible exceptions to legal rules behave differently, and are not susceptible to the kind of defeasibility discussed here. The upshot of the discussion is to show that defeasibility in law sometimes generates a genuine kind of legal indeterminacy. From a legal point of view, the conclusion would be neither here nor there. In such cases, decision-makers must make their judgments on the basis of considerations not dictated by the relevant law...|$|R
5000|$|The {{presumption}} of innocence was originally expressed by the French cardinal and jurist Jean Lemoine in the phrase [...] "item quilbet presumitur innocens nisi probetur nocens (a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty)", based on the <b>legal</b> <b>inference</b> {{that most people are}} not criminals. However, this referred not merely {{to the fact that the}} burden of proof rests on the prosecution in a criminal case, but the protections which a defendant should be given-prior notice of the accusation being made against them, the right of confrontation, right to counsel, etc.It is literally considered favorable evidence for the accused that automatically attaches at trial.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} CLIME, {{a web-based}} legal advisory {{system with a}} multilingual natural language interface. CLIME is a ‘proof-of-concept’ system which answers queries relating to ship-building and ship-operating regulations. Its core knowledge source {{is a set of}} such regulations encoded as a conceptual domain model and a set of formalised <b>legal</b> <b>inference</b> rules. The system supports retrieval of regulations via the conceptual model, and assessment of the legality of a situation or activity on a ship according to the <b>legal</b> <b>inference</b> rules. The focus of this paper is on the natural language aspects of the system, which help the user to construct semantically complex queries using WYSIWYM technology, allow the system to produce extended and cohesive responses and explanations, and support the whole interaction through a hybrid synchronous/asynchronous dialogue structure. Multilinguality (English and French) is viewed simply as interface localisation: the core representations are language-neutral, and the system can present extended or local interactions in either language at any time. The development of CLIME featured a high degree of client involvement, and the specification, implementation and evaluation of natural language components in this context are also discussed...|$|E

During trial, litigants may selectively present only the most helpful evidence uncovered by their investigations. Two experiments examined whether mock jurors appreciate that the evidence they hear at trial may be a selective and unrepresentative sample of underlying facts.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{consideration}} contained in the article is topological logic interpreted as place logic and its possible applications in a logical analysis of legal reasoning. The {{first part of the}} article is about significance of widely understood spatial element in a law and about a role of formal logic in legal sciences (especially in dogmatic of law) and in legal discourse. There are also given conditions imposed on logical systems which can be applied to analyse legal reasoning. In the second part there is characterization of topological logic interpreted as place logic. In the third part there are examples of formalization of sentences of legal language and of <b>legal</b> <b>inferences</b> using symbols occurring in place logic.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the legal parameters of sovereign immunity and its waivers for employees of public {{institutions of higher}} education in the state of Texas. This empirical study examined the decisions of the Texas Judiciary concerning public university litigation in the area of sovereign immunity, with a review of major state court decisions. Legal research methodology was used in this study. The data for this study included case study review of six cases decided by the Texas judiciary. Information about each of the cases and the important <b>legal</b> <b>inferences</b> from the cases was discussed. A review of the history of sovereign immunity and the current status of the application of the Texas Tort Claims Act was also included. Based on the review of the relevant case law and scholarly commentary, the study findings suggest that a) Texas courts recognize and apply the doctrine of sovereign immunity, unless the application of the doctrine is restricted by the Texas Tort Claims Act; b) the Texas Tort Claims Act establishes limited waivers to sovereign immunity applicable only under specified circumstances and subjects; c) Texas courts were consistent in applying the circumstances by which an institution or its actors waived sovereign immunity.

40|$|Induction is an {{interesting}} model of legal reasoning, since it provides a method of capturing initial states of legal principles and rules, and adjusting these principles and rules over time as the law changes.

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a {{framework}} for {{a system that is}} able to build and to keep the context of the interactions in web interfaces to legal text databases. We are using some {{of the results of the}} AustLII (Australasian Legal Information Institute) project with its <b>legal</b> <b>inference</b> system via World Wide Web as an interface for legal text databases. Namely, we are using SINO, a search engine for legal text databases (Greenleaf, Mowbray and King 1997). At the moment we are using SINO to process legal texts from our project partner (PGR, Procuradoria Geral da Repblica - Portuguese Attorney General). The resulting database is used to test the ability of our system to generate SINO queries from user natural language questions. These queries are generated taking into account the dialog context that is built using the previous user questions and previous system answers. Moreover we use YSH, an inference engine (Greenleaf, Mowbray, and van Dijk 1995) to build rule bases modeling some legal kn [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{numerous}} studies comparing intuition and deliberation have been published. However, until now relatively {{little is known}} about the cognitive processes underlying the two decision modes. Therefore, we analyzed processes of information search and integration using eye-tracking technology. We tested hypotheses derived from dual-process models which postu-late that intuition and deliberation are completely distinct processes against predictions of inter-ventionist models. The latter assume that intuitive and deliberate decisions are based on the same basic process which is supplemented by additional processes in the deliberate decision mode. We manipulated decision mode between-participants by means of instructions and participants com-pleted simple and complex city-size tasks as well as complex <b>legal</b> <b>inference</b> tasks. Our findings indicate that the instruction to deliberate does not necessarily increase levels of processing. We found no difference in mean fixation duration and the distribution of short, medium and long fixations. Instruction-induced deliberation led to a higher number of fixations, a more complete information search and more repeated information investigations. Overall, the data support inter-ventionist models suggesting that decisions mainly rely on automatic processes which are sup...|$|E
40|$|Legal {{concepts}} are typically {{encountered in the}} context of legal norms, and the issue of determining their content cannot be separated from the issue of identifying and interpreting (or constructing) the norms in which they occur, and of using such norms in <b>legal</b> <b>inference.</b> Consequently, {{it can be argued that}} a legal system endows its concepts with meaning exactly by embedding such concepts (the terms expressing them) within certain legal norms. Rather than assuming that legal terms have a prior independent meaning, according to which we should determine the meaning of the norms containing them, we should focus on the norms containing such terms and on the inferences they enable, and consequently determine the conceptual contents that such terms are meant to convey. This is particularly the case for the so-called ‘intermediate legal concepts,’ namely, those concepts through which legal norms convey both legal consequences and preconditions of further legal effects, as we shall see in the following. These are indeed the concepts whose semantics we want to investigate, and to which we shall refer when speaking of ‘legal concepts’ tout court...|$|E

Henry Hazlitt argued that the World Bank along with the monetary system it was designed within would promote world inflation and [...] "a world in which international trade is State-dominated" [...] when they were being advocated. Stiglitz argued that the so-called free market reform policies that the Bank advocates are often harmful to economic development if implemented badly, too quickly ("shock therapy"), in the wrong sequence or in weak, uncompetitive economies. Similarly, Carmine Guerriero notices that these reforms have introduced in developing countries regulatory institutions typical of the common law legal tradition because allegedly more efficient according to the legal origins theory. The latter however has been fiercely criticized since {{it does not take}} into account that the legal institutions transplanted during the European colonization have been then reformed.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the role of abductive <b>inference</b> in <b>legal</b> reasoning. Both in the {{determination}} of the relevant facts and in the determination of their <b>legal</b> consequences abductive <b>inference</b> plays a crucial role, being the first step of such reasoning tasks. Two kinds of legal abduction are distinguished: an explanatory one aiming at the reconstruction of the relevant facts and a classificatory one aiming at a legal conceptualization of those facts. We concentrate on the first kind, stressing the similarities it has with scientific abduction, notably on the concern of truth. We claim that legal abduction is truth-directed, justice being in the first place epistemic justice. 1 Charles S. Peirce and Abduction Charles Sanders Peirce (1839 - 1914) calls abduction the inference suggesting an explanation. In his early writings instead of abduction he speaks of hypothesis – see e. g. W 1 : 180, 266 ff. (1865); W 1 : 362, 430 ff. (1866); W 3 : 323 - 338 (1878). At that time his main purpose is to distinguish, in a kantian way, ampliative from non-ampliative inferences. Hypothesis and induction are ampliative inferences while deduction is non-ampliative, being merely explicatory. The point being the difference between ampliative and non-ampliative inferences, i...|$|R
50|$|Neuroscience {{and the law}} have interacted over a long history, but {{interest}} spiked in {{the late}} 1990s. After the term neurolaw was first coined by Sherrod J. Taylor in 1991, scholars from both fields began to network through presentations and dialogs. This led to an increasing pull to publish books, articles, and other literature. The Gruter Institute for Law and Behavioral Research and the Dana Foundation were the first groups to provide funding for the new interdisciplinary field. Parallel {{to the expansion of}} neurolaw, an emergence of ethics specifically regarding neuroscience was developing as well. The intersection of neurolaw and ethics was able to be better scrutinized by the initiation of the Law and Neuroscience Project in 2007. The MacArthur Foundation launched Phase I of its project through a $10 million grant in hope of integrating the two fields. The initiative sustained forty projects addressing a multitude of issues, including experimental and theoretical data that will provide further evidence as to how neuroscience may eventually shape the law. This new field of study has also piqued the interests of several universities. Baylor College of Medicine's Initiative on Neuroscience and the Law’s research seeks to research, educate, and make policy change. The University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Neuroscience and Society began in July 2009, and is working towards confronting the social, <b>legal,</b> and ethical <b>inferences</b> of neuroscience.|$|R
40|$|Reasoning by jurors {{concerning}} {{whether an}} accused {{person should be}} convicted of committing a crime {{is a kind of}} casual inference. Jurors need to decide whether the evidence in the case was caused by the accused’s criminal action or by some other cause. This paper compares two computational models of casual inference: explanatory coherence and Bayesian networks. Both models can be applied to legal episodes such as the von Bülow trials. There are psychological and computational reasons for preferring the explanatory coherence account of <b>legal</b> <b>inference.</b> In December, 1980, Martha von Bülow, a very wealthy heiress, lapsed into a coma that still continues. In 1982, a jury found her husband, Claus von Bülow, guilty of two counts of assault with intent to murder. But an appeal granted him a new trial, and in 1985 he was acquitted on both counts. What was the nature of the inferences that led the first jury to find Claus von Bülow guilty and the second jury to find him not guilty? This paper presents an analysis of jury decision making as a kind of causal inference. Members of the jury had to make inferences about the causes of Martha von Bülow’s coma, in particular about whether it had been the result of an attempt by her husband to kill her. Reasoning about the testimony of witnesses is also causal, in that the jury had to infer whether some witnesses said what they did because they were in a position to know it was true, or because they were lying. In general, legal reasoning in trials such as those of Claus von Bülow’s can be characterized as inference to the best overall causal story.

40|$|Much work {{on legal}} {{knowledge}} systems treats legal reasoning as arguments that lead from {{a description of}} the law and the facts of a case, to the legal conclusion for the case. The reasoning steps of the inference engine parallel the logical steps by means of which the legal conclusion is derived from the factual and legal premises. In short, the relation between the input and the output of a <b>legal</b> <b>inference</b> engine is a logical one. The truth of the conclusion only depends on the premises, and is independent of the argument that leads to the conclusion. This paper opposes the logical approach, and defends a procedural approach to legal reasoning. Legal conclusions are not true or false independent of the reasoning process that ended in these conclusions. In critical cases this reasoning process consists of an adversarial procedure in which several parties are involved. The course of the argument determines whether the conclusion is true or false. The phenomenon of hard cases is used to demonstrate this essential procedural nature of legal reasoning. Dialogical Reason Based Logic offers a framework that makes it possible to model legal dialogues. We use Dialogical Reason Based Logic to specify hard cases in dialogical terms. Moreover, we analyse an actual Dutch hard case in terms of Dialogical Reason Based Logic, to demonstrate both the possibilities and the shortcomings of this approach. It turns out that there is no one set of rational dialogue rules. There are many concurring sets of rules that govern particular types of dialogues. The rules for legal procedures are as much part of the law as the more substantial rules. As a consequence, {{it is not possible to}} offer an universal set of dialogue rules. Dialogical Reason Based Logic rather provides a framework which can be filled with dialogue rules that determine which dialogues are valid and which ones are invalid...|$|E
