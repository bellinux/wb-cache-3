5|$|In 1979, Thomson, Childish, Bill Lewis and Ming {{were members}} of The Medway Poets {{performance}} group, to which Absolon and Sanchia <b>Lewis</b> <b>had</b> earlier contributed.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{rock and roll}} was faltering as its major stars dropped from public view. Elvis Presley was drafted, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively, Chuck Berry was in jail, and Jerry Lee <b>Lewis</b> <b>had</b> been disgraced by press reports that he married his 13-year-old cousin. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest {{the last two years}} of the 1950s were barren of talent, {{pointing}} to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles' work were very similar to the young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing By breaking down the division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with transcendental fervor, unashamedly linking the spiritual and the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought the realities of the Saturday-night sinner and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} planned to send the brigade—which had been renamed the 1st Commando Brigade in late 1944—to India, however, {{the effect of the}} German Ardennes Offensive {{prevented}} this and in January 1945, still under the command of Brigadier Derek Mills-Roberts, they crossed the English Channel by sea and landed in the Netherlands from where they were deployed to Asten on the Maas. By the time they arrived the German advance had been largely halted and it was not until 23 January that the brigade was engaged in any large-scale operations. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Lewis, that night No. 6 Commando joined Operation Blackcock. <b>Lewis</b> <b>had</b> taken over from Courtenay-Coade after the latter had experienced complications from the head injury he had suffered in France earlier.
