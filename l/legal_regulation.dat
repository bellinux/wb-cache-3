Among these were the expulsion of the Society of Jesus and other religious orders of the Regular clergy, the closure of convents, the prohibition of religious teaching in schools, the abolition of the religious oath in civil ceremonies and a secularisation of the State by the separation of Church and State.

40|$|The {{numerous}} Romanian {{standards and}} <b>legal</b> <b>regulations,</b> {{as well as}} their particularities in the field of tourism lead us to formulating systematising proposals for the existing legal framework in the field of tourism. As a result of reviewing <b>legal</b> <b>regulations</b> of public administration applied to Romanian tourism activities, we observe that there are numerous <b>legal</b> <b>regulations</b> that embrace the field of tourism; moreover, according to an analysis of the nature of these regulations applied in tourism, we notice that it is particularly the state and the public authorities that have regulatory roles in tourism, more precisely the protection role against abnormalities and abuses caused in tourism and the role of developing tourism. We identify the flexibility and heterogeneity as being the important particularities of <b>legal</b> <b>regulations</b> in the field of tourism. We consider as opportune the proposal regarding the systematisation of the existing legal framework in the field of tourism, by creating and elaborating a “Code of tourism”, an instrument that shall re-unite the laws and regulations applicable to the tourist industry for an accessible and easy identification, both from the juridical and institutional points of view...|$|R
