However, in {{conjunction}} with Illius Timmis, he brought out a reversible lifeboat, the Timmis-Hodgson, for which silver medals were granted at the North East Coast Exhibition at Tynemouth in 1882, and at the International Fisheries Exhibition in 1883.

5000|$|While pro-administration {{newspapers}} hardened their stance {{towards the}} Bank throughout 1830, official White House policy remained conflicted and perplexing. Jackson, however, had determined {{to oppose the}} rechartering of the Bank on constitutional grounds. [...] At his Annual Address to Congress on December 7, 1830, he launched his second public condemnation of the BUS, expanding his criticisms and proposing a substitute to the central bank. The reformed bank would be wholly public, with no private stockholders, nor would it engage in lending or land purchasing, and retaining only its role in processing custom <b>duty</b> <b>fees</b> for the US Treasury. The address reanimated the issue of recharter signaling the pro-BUS forces that the re-authorization of the Bank was at risk, and a counter-campaign {{would be required to}} deflect Jackson’s criticisms.|$|R

50|$|Trade {{in goods}} smuggled into Pakistan once {{constituted}} {{a major source}} of revenue for Afghanistan. Many of the goods that were smuggled into Pakistan have originally entered Afghanistan from Pakistan, where they fell under the 1965 Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement. This permitted goods bound for Afghanistan to transit through Pakistani seaports free of duty. Once in Afghanistan, the goods were often immediately smuggled back into Pakistan over the porous border that the two countries share, often with the help of corrupt officials. Additionally, items declared as Afghanistan-bound were often prematurely offloaded from trucks and smuggled into Pakistani markets without paying requisite <b>duty</b> <b>fees.</b> This resulted {{in the creation of a}} thriving black market, with much of the illegal trading occurring openly, as was common in Peshawar's bustling Karkhano Market, which was widely regarded as a smuggler's bazaar.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the first}} {{third of the}} 13th century German {{settlers}} were recruited by Duke Leszek I the White to settle the Neumark. After he died in 1227, the Polish central government collapsed, allowing the Margraves of Brandenburg to expand eastwards. They acquired land east of the Oder and expanded their domain further east to the river Drawa and north to the river Persante. In 1257, John I founded the town of Landsberg (now called [...] ) as an alternative river crossng across the Warta, competing with the crossing in the Polish town of Santok, detracting from the considerable revenues Santok made from foreign trade (custom <b>duties,</b> <b>fees</b> from the market operation and storage fees), {{similar to the way}} Berlin had been founded to compete with Köpenick. In 1261, the Margraves purchased Myślibórz ( [...] Soldin) from the Knights Templar and began developing the town to their power center in the Neumark.|$|R

50|$|The {{structures}} of fees vary among sourcing companies. The most common is a commission {{based on the}} free on board ("FOB") cost of the products sourced as negotiated with the client. FOB {{is the cost of}} manufacturing the product and delivering it to the freight forwarder. Some sourcing companies provide an alternative called <b>landed</b> <b>duty</b> paid ("LDP"). LDP, alternatively, is the price of both manufacturing and actually delivering the product to the client (e.g., includes costs of shipping, logistics, customs clearing, etc.). Other types of fee structure include annual retainer fee with performance bonus or fee based on savings achieved.|$|R
