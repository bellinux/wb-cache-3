5|$|The band toured from June 6, 2013 to <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> {{to promote}} this album.|$|E
5|$|Between <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> {{and early}} fall 2015, 1,250 {{soldiers}} from the 1st Brigade Combat Team were deployed to Iraq to support Operation Inherent Resolve.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in spring or early summer, and the larvae hatch in summer, living as plankton. They settle {{to the sea}} floor again as post-larvae in the <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and fall.|$|E
25|$|Cannot survive {{extended}} periods of forage deprivation, preventing introduction into areas with harsh winters or extremely dry <b>late</b> <b>summers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The she-oak skink (Cyclodomorphus casuarinae) is a large, long-tailed, snake-like skink {{endemic to}} Tasmania, Australia. It is viviparous; mating in spring, and giving birth in <b>latest</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|R
60|$|The last csárdás of this memorable night! It {{is eight}} o'clock now, {{and through the}} {{apertures}} in the log wall the brilliant light of this <b>late</b> <b>summer's</b> morning enters triumphant and crude.|$|R
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis females {{lay their}} eggs on Lundy cabbage leaf stalks. The white larvae are leaf miners, digging into the {{petioles}} and stems. After emerging in <b>late</b> <b>summer,</b> they pupate in soil.|$|E
5|$|As it {{requires}} rising heated air, thermalling {{is most effective}} in mid-latitudes from spring through <b>late</b> <b>summer.</b> During winter the sun's heat can only create weak thermals, but ridge and wave lift can still be used during this period.|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis, {{which usually}} appears from <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> to autumn, is {{distributed}} in the hemlock forests of the Pacific Coast Ranges from Northern California to Alaska, the Cascade Range, {{as well as in}} interior forests such as in Manitoba. It has a disjunct distribution, as it has been also been collected in Japan and Taiwan.|$|E
60|$|The women, too, {{knew that}} {{mischief}} was brewing. They drew closer {{to one another}} and shivered with cold beneath their kerchiefs, in spite of the warmth of this beautiful <b>late</b> <b>summer's</b> afternoon.|$|R
60|$|A {{beautiful}} starlit {{night had}} followed {{on the day}} of incessant rain: a cool, balmy, <b>late</b> <b>summer's</b> night, essentially English in its suggestion of moisture and scent of wet earth and dripping leaves.|$|R
50|$|The fruits {{appear in}} <b>late</b> spring-early <b>summer.</b>|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} the American first leg was well underway, there was {{speculation}} of more American dates {{to come in the}} <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and fall, but E Street guitarist Nils Lofgren said that Springsteen and wife Patti Scialfa would make a decision later on.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen Ju 87D dive {{bombers and}} a few Ju 87R-2 {{extended}} range dive bombers {{are known to have}} been supplied to the HZL, and six of these were flown operationally against Soviet troops in the <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> of 1944.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> of 214 BC, Philip again {{attempted}} an Illyrian {{invasion by}} sea, with {{a fleet of}} 120 lembi. He captured Oricum which was lightly defended, and sailing up the Aous (modern Vjosë) river he besieged Apollonia.|$|E
50|$|Yancheng {{occupies}} the flat coastal plains of Eastern Jiangsu. Those areas not cultivated are mainly marshlands, which {{are home to}} several endangered species, including the red-crowned crane and the Pere David's deer. Yancheng has a temperate climate with fairly mild winters and distinctly tropical <b>late</b> <b>summers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The falls drops a {{total of}} 80 ft in four tiers. Unlike many {{seasonal}} waterfalls in Southern California, it has a fairly reliable flow year round, due to springs located further up the canyon. However, it can still dry up during the <b>late</b> <b>summers</b> of dry years.|$|R
50|$|It has (capsule) fruits in <b>late</b> spring-early <b>summer.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the period}} from early spring 1945 to <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> 1945, Feller's naval duties were again at Great Lakes Naval station, where he {{replaced}} Mickey Cochrane as manager of the baseball program, {{as well as an}} active pitcher for the team.|$|E
5|$|Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica is an {{invasive}} species that threatens Jersey's biodiversity. It is easily recognisable and has hollow stems with small white flowers that are produced in <b>late</b> <b>summer.</b> Other non-native {{species on the}} island include the Colorado beetle, burnet rose and oak processionary moth.|$|E
5|$|On October 2, 2013 {{the band}} {{announced}} that it signed to Nuclear Blast. In February 2014, the band entered the studio to record their new album, Bloodstone & Diamonds, for a <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> release.|$|E
5000|$|The White River is navigable {{by small}} boats {{throughout}} most of its length. But in low water years the water level may be too low for navigation {{for a period of}} several months. Flows vary from [...] in <b>late</b> <b>summers</b> of dry years to well over [...] in spring.|$|R
50|$|At {{low water}} in <b>late</b> <b>summers</b> of dry years the {{remnants}} of three villages (Asel, Bringhausen, and Berich) and a bridge across the original river bed submerged when the lake was filled in 1914 can be seen. Descendants of those buried there go to visit the graves of their ancestors.|$|R
40|$|Glimmer is an enchanting {{landscape}} to explore {{for the very}} young, and the young at heart. You are invited to Hamilton’s Band Rotunda for a <b>late</b> <b>summer’s</b> evening with interactive glowing lights. What will you find? What will you do?" Interactive sound and light work. Featuring audience driven sound elements triggered over an acousmatic textural soundscape...|$|R
5|$|Other {{collections}} sites include Australia, Chile, China, Cuba, Iceland, Korea, and Taiwan. In Hawaii, {{it grows}} on trunks of fallen Cibotium and Aleurites trees. A.sarcoides occurs most frequently in <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{are readily}} {{propagated}} from seed. As seed {{is surrounded by}} irritating hairs within the pod, extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth can be taken in <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{begins its}} breeding season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the sedge wren. This {{may be related to the}} abundance of seeds in the <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.|$|E
60|$|The {{change in}} his manner and face, which had grown {{strained}} and harassed, had been noticed by Bianca, though she would have died sooner than admit she had noticed anything about him. It {{was one of those}} periods in the lives of households like an hour of a <b>late</b> <b>summer's</b> day--brooding, electric, as yet quiescent, but charged with the currents of coming storms.|$|R
60|$|And thus, on this ninth day of September, a human load panting {{under the}} heat of this <b>late</b> <b>summer's</b> sun, huddled one against the other, pushed and jostled by the crowd, was exposed to the public gaze in the Forum over against the rostrum Augustini, so that all who had a mind, and a purse withal, might suit their fancy and buy.|$|R
6000|$|If we {{will admit}} time into our {{thoughts}} at all, the mythologies, those vestiges of ancient poems, wrecks of poems, so to speak, the world's inheritance, still reflecting {{some of their}} original splendor, like the fragments of clouds tinted by the rays of the departed sun; reaching into the <b>latest</b> <b>summer</b> day, and allying this hour to the morning of creation; as the poet sings:-- ...|$|R
5|$|This sparrow is awkward {{in flight}} and {{primarily}} uses running and hopping to move. The rufous-crowned sparrow will at times forage in pairs during the breeding season, and in family-sized flocks in <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and early autumn. During the winter they can occasionally {{be found in}} loose mixed-species foraging flocks.|$|E
5|$|After {{fifteen years}} of off-again, on-again, conversations, The Koch Administration and the then-named NY Zoological Society (now Wildlife Conservation Society), signed a fifty-year {{agreement}} in April 1980, where the Central, Prospect, and Queens zoos would be administered by the Society. Specific plans for Prospect Park Zoo were another seven years in the making. By <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> 1987, an $18 million, {{two and a half}} year renovation plan was put forth to renovate Prospect Park Zoo and coordinate its venue with other facilities to avoid redundant programming.|$|E
5|$|American Idiot toured North America {{beginning}} on December 28, 2011, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The original national tour cast included Van Hughes reprising {{his role as}} Johnny, Jake Epstein as Will, Scott J. Campbell as Tunny, Leslie McDonel as Heather, Gabrielle McClinton as Whatsername, Nicci Claspell as The Extraordinary Girl, and Broadway alumnus Joshua Kobak as St. Jimmy. A non-Equity second U.S. tour launched in the <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> of 2012.|$|E
60|$|The {{beauty of}} the <b>late</b> <b>summer's</b> day was {{accepted}} {{as a matter of}} course: as {{part and parcel of the}} holidays and festivals ordered by the Cæsar. These too were the people's just dues: emperors had to justify their existence by entertaining their people. Grumblings at their luxury and extravagances were only withheld because of other luxuries and extravagances perpetrated for the amusement of the people.|$|R
60|$|Yes! she was beautiful! No captious chronicler {{has ever}} denied that! {{and no one}} who knew her before, and who saw her again on this <b>late</b> <b>summer's</b> afternoon, could fail to mark the {{additional}} charm of her magnetic personality. There was a tenderness in {{her face as she}} turned her head to and fro, a joy of living in her eyes that was quite irresistibly fascinating.|$|R
50|$|<b>Late</b> this <b>summer,</b> Iain will be {{releasing}} {{his first}} published work of sheet music through Sofawolf Press.|$|R
