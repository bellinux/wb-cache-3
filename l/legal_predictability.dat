40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{interpretation}} and application of law in WTO dispute settlement from the angle of <b>legal</b> certainty and <b>predictability.</b> An analysis of the interpretation of WTO law shows that in general it does not differ from the interpretation of other public international law as interpretative rules well known in international law are applied. This together with the consistence provided by the respect of earlier panel and Appellate Body reports safeguard legal certainty. Furthermore, <b>legal</b> certainty and <b>predictability</b> requires clarity in the law applicable in WTO dispute settlement, in particular as regards non-WTO law. It will be shown that apart from peremptory norms of public international law (ius cogens), the relevance of international law outside WTO law is limited. Non-WTO treaty law must not be applied except if referred to by WTO law or incorporated therein. Apart from that international law of any kind can only be considered when interpreting WTO law. In certain circumstances this applies even to non-WTO treaty law to which not all WTO members are parties. Due to the as yet limited importance of non-WTO law, <b>legal</b> certainty and <b>predictability</b> also depend {{on the issue of}} conflict of norms, which also is relevant as far as the interrelationship of the different WTO agreements is concerned. In this regard <b>predictability</b> and <b>legal</b> certainty cannot be fully reached. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about two stories. The more reassuring one states that byestablishing that a norm is valid because of its source, not its merit, legal {{positivism}} is, in its various forms, {{perhaps one of the}} greatest achievements in Western legal theory and practice. From constitutionalism to human rights policies, from criminal to international law and free trade agreements, from contracts to torts and e-commerce, <b>legal</b> validity, <b>predictability,</b> and coherence have found their most powerful ally in positivist thought. This contribution argues that it is time for a different, neorealist story: the metaphysical, ontological and biopolitical essence of its language demonstrates that legal positivism has in fact played a fundamental role in the substitution of action with behaviour, and consequently, in the normalisation of humankind’s self-annihilating animality as post-historical and post-political ‘form-of-(non-) living. &rsquo...|$|R

40|$|The {{main idea}} behind {{this article was}} to perform a {{theoretical}} analysis of the purposes and tools of antitrust policy and law. An ancient dialectical method {{has been applied to}} separate different components of competition policy with the following deconstruction of the conflicting essence of those elements without inevitable evening-out the distinctions between them. Dialectical approach to antitrust demonstrates why competition deserves to be explored independently from other legitimate economic goals and that the primary purpose of competition law logically is protection (via preventive antitrust, i. e. arts 101 - 106 TFEU) and promotion (via proactive antitrust, i. e. sector-specific regulation) of competition. Dialectical antitrust does not deny that consumer welfare constitutes a meta-goal of modern competition policy. Indeed in the hierarchy of economic values consumer welfare remains decisive, but methodologically it is neither exhausted nor entirely embraced by competition law, which exists in order to regulate competition. Antitrust theory has striven {{for a long time to}} reconcile the apparent dilemma between the aspiration to protect the freedom of undertakings to benefit from their successful competition on one hand, and the freedom of their less successful counterparts to participate in this competition on the other; to provide for firms liberal environment on the one hand and to fine-tune their behaviour in order to establish <b>legal</b> <b>predictability</b> and economic efficiency on the other; to protect competition on the one hand and maximise common benefits for society on the other. Essentially, those three crucial dimensions of the competition dilemma can be solved within the framework of dialectical antitrust, which on the level of methodology proposes to utilitise those conflicts by placing their different components into separate parentheses...|$|E

This also helps avoiding complicated, lengthy and painful proceedings. More specifically, it allows international couples to agree in advance which law would apply to their divorce or legal separation as long as the agreed law is the law of the Member State which they have a closer connection with. In case the couple cannot agree, the judges can use a common formula for deciding which country's law applies.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to examine the}} approach adopted by the European Commission in recently regulated energy markets. Antitrust investigations indicate that the European Commission increasingly tends to implement competition law, in particular through commitment decisions, {{in order to create a}} quasi-ex ante regulatory effect in the markets. The main conclusion of this thesis is that a lack of legal certainty and insufficient clarification of the law originating from this approach might have detrimental impacts on a single and competitive energy market design in Europe. This thesis consists of three substantial chapters in addition to the introductory and final conclusion chapters. The first chapter analyses long-term supply contracts concluded in the wholesale markets from both an economic and a legal perspective. The economic analysis of the contracts shows that the functioning of European energy markets remains ambiguous. The European Commission thus seems to adopt a strategy to balance spot market trading with long-term supply contracts and vertical integration through antitrust investigations. The second chapter aims at examining the tendency of European Commission to assess the foreclosure effects of a preferential use of cross-border energy transmission networks within the new liberalised energy markets. While a pro-entry bias approach of the European Commission is observed in the case law, it is difficult to find recognition by the Commission as well as secondary EU law of the likely pro-competitive effects of long-term cross-border transmission network reservations resulting from the associated long-term cross-border supply contracts. Besides, it can be observed from the case law that the European Commission and the European Courts tend to approve the preferential use of networks as long as the right holder engages in a major investment in these networks. As a consequence, the methodology adopted by the European Commission for the antitrust analyses of priority access rights to cross-border infrastructure might fail to correspond with <b>legal</b> <b>predictability</b> and economic accuracy. The aim of the third chapter is to show the tendency of the European Commission to finalise antitrust investigations through a public settlement procedure, which seems to be a convenient tool for the facilitation of market regulation through antitrust enforcement. The increased number of commitment decisions in the energy markets raises a concern regarding the possible detrimental effects of this trend. With the consideration of the importance of legal certainty in the regulated markets in terms of market building and social welfare, the chapter proposes a hypothetical framework guideline including certain measures which may increase the efficiency and sustainability of public settlement procedures and also improve legal certainty in the energy markets...|$|E
40|$|Authentic {{and some}} {{supplementary}} means of international treaties have been determined by Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. During {{the process of}} codification in the International Law Commission determination of these means was not a subject-matter of differences {{among members of the}} Commission or among States, but determination of an order of priority among them was. At the end the Commission took the view that all authentic means have to be applied and that their mutual interaction would lead to legally relevant interpretation. Today international judicial bodies do not follow that view. They select some of available authentic and supplementary means and give them different weight.

40|$|With {{growth in}} foreign {{investment}} and {{in the number of}} companies investing in foreign countries, the application of general principles of public international law has not been deemed adequate to regulate {{foreign investment and}} there is, as yet, no comprehensive international treaty on the regulation of foreign investment. Consequently, states have resorted to bilateral investment treaties (BITs), regional trade and international investment agreements (IIAs) and free trade agreements (FTAs) to supplement and complement the regime of protection for foreign investors. In the absence of an international investment court, states hosting foreign investment or investor states have opted for investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS). This mechanism has brought about its own challenges to the international law of foreign investment due to inconsistency in the application and interpretation of the key principles of international investment law by such arbitration tribunals, and further, there is no appellate mechanism to bring about some cohesion and consistency in jurisprudence. Therefore, there are various proposals mooted by scholars to address these challenges and they range from tweaks to BITs and IIAs, the creation of an appellate mechanism and the negotiation of a multilateral treaty to proposals for reform of ISDS only. After assessing the merits and demerits of such proposals, this study goes further, arguing {{for the creation of a}} World Investment Organisation (WIO) with a standing mechanism for settlement of investment disputes in order to ensure <b>legal</b> certainty, <b>predictability</b> and the promotion of the flow of foreign investment in a sustainable and responsible manner...|$|R

40|$|Legislative {{deliberations}} {{among various}} democratic bodies re- sult {{most of the}} time in some sort of compromise. Consequently, this compromise is often a major source of law in democratic countries. But what exactly does it mean “to reach a compromise” and, more impor- tantly, how does this phenomenon affect the quality of the regulations issued by a democratic body? Do the regulations issued as a result of compromise differ importantly from those resulting of a unanimous deci- sion? And if so, is the difference perceivable only at a purely linguistic level or does it entail further consequences? Shall we then avoid compro- mise or rather resort to it as often as possible? Finally, is compromise a source of interpretation? This paper is an attempt to provide at least a partial answer to most of the questions posed above. The answer seems not only a riddle at the theoretical level, but also has numerous practical consequences. It can affect the quality of the regulations issued as well as the level of <b>legal</b> certainty (or <b>predictability)</b> in a particular society, especially in those governed by continental (positivist) legal systems.

Recent proposals are going to develop at least a uniform rule about jurisdictional competence, based on the mechanism of the forum necessitatis, already envisaged by article 7 of the EC regulation No. 4 / 2009. That innovation isalso a consequence of the proposed abolition of national exorbitant fora. The paper describes the general characteristics of the mechanism, that can be used only on a subsidiary and exceptional basis, i. e. when no provision would otherwise confer jurisdiction on a Member State. Accordingly, such a mechanism departs from the principles of predictability and proximity of the head of jurisdiction, because it applies when the dispute is closely connected to a third State. In that context the use of forum necessitatis is required in order to prevent or to remedy a denial of justice that could take place (or has already taken place) in the third State. When the denial of justice would affect procedural or substantive fundamental human rights of the claimant, the forum necessitatis mechanism allows him/her to bring his/her action before the courts of the Member States. More detailed requirements as to the existence of a denial of justice are envisaged in the proposal to revise EC regulation No. 44 / 2001. In addition, the dispute must have a «sufficient connection» to the Member State of the forum; such a requirement is needed in order to provide the allocation of jurisdictional competence between Member States...|$|R
40|$|International {{intellectual}} property (IP) protection {{is at the}} heart of controversies over the impact of economic interests on social or environmental concerns. Some see IP rights as unduly encroaching upon human rights and societal interests, others argue for stronger enforcement and additional exclusivity to incentivize new innovations and creations. Underlying these debates is the perception that international IP treaties set out minimum standards of protection - which presumably allow for additional protection with only the sky being the limit. This article challenges this view and explores the idea of maximum standards or ceilings within the existing body of international IP law. It looks at the relation between IP treaties and subsequent agreements or national laws which offer stronger protection. In particular, within the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), an important qualification may serve as a door opener for ceilings: While additional IP protection may not go beyond mandatory limits within TRIPS, the qualification not to “contravene” TRIPS is unlikely to safeguard TRIPS flexibilities against TRIPS-plus norms. The article further identifies and examines the rationales for maximum standards in international IP protection as: (1) <b>Legal</b> security and <b>predictability</b> about the boundaries of protection; (2) the global protection of users’ rights; and (3) the free movement of goods, services and information. Examples of mandatory limits in the existing IP treaties and in ongoing initiatives can implement these. However, most of the relevant treaty norms are optional. The article concludes with some observations on the need for more comprehensive and precise maximum standards...|$|R
40|$|This article reviews key {{aspects of}} the {{theoretical}} debate on the distinction between bright-line rules framed in clear and determinate language and vague legal standards. It is generally believed that legal rules provide more certainty and <b>predictability,</b> while <b>legal</b> standards afford flexibility, accommodate equitable solutions, and allow for a more informed development of the law. Furthermore, the article seeks to refute the idea that bright-line rules are superior to vague standards in regard to certainty and predictability. In first section, the author articulates the claims that <b>legal</b> certainty and <b>predictability</b> are essential for both capitalism and liberalism, and that these systems {{of economic and political}} organization therefore require legal rules framed in clear and determinate language. Second section undertakes a critical evaluation of that claim and argues that, oftentimes, the best-drafted clear and determinate rules would result in less certainty than alternative vague and indeterminate standards. Third section provides explanations why things are so, arguing that the law is but one of many normative systems; that competing economic, social, and moral standards are often couched in vague and indeterminate terms; and that many of these standards cannot be reduced to clear and determinate rules. As conclusion author pointed out on the extensive use of vague legal standards that with no doubt harbors dangers. Vague standards can easily mask arbitrariness, inconsistency, and injustice, and can also generate uncertainty. their proper use requires good faith, professionalism, and intelligence, and therefore depends on a high caliber legal profession. 22224714 Filozofia Publiczna i Edukacja Demokratyczn...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the problems that the ECJ has found in recent cases at applying the classic three step selectivity test {{in the area of}} taxation. The Court is confronted with the Member States’ attempt to circumvent the State aid rules by creating ad hoc general tax systems so there is no general system against which the tax measures can be assessed. In order to avoid this circumvention, the ECJ has shifted its case law on material tax selectivity towards a new “comparability test” (also called “equality test”) based on a non-formalistic approach which takes into account the underlying objectives of the tax measure. This “comparability test” encompasses an objectives-based approach which provides Member States a higher degree of freedom. However it seems to be rather vague because it involves the difficult task of distinguishing permissible goals from impermissible goals which irretrievably leads us to a case-by-case analysis which does not provide the desirable degree of <b>legal</b> certainty and <b>predictability.</b> The main conclusion of this research is that the criterion of material tax selectivity is not definitively formulated in the ECJ case law but, on the contrary, it is open to refinements {{in order to meet the}} challenges that current and future State aid cases may raise.

40|$|The {{development}} of the United Nation’s Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) started {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century in order to provide a uniform legal regime for international sales contracts. The development started because of a belief that a uniform international sales convention would contribute certainty in commercial trade and decrease transaction costs for the contracting parties. The Convention was signed in Vienna 1980 and came into force in 1988 after securing the necessary number of ratifications. The CISG is automatically applied to international sale contracts in certain given situations but the contracting parties are free to exclude the Convention as applicable law in favour of another regulation. As of today, more than 25 years after the CISG came into force, the Convention is commonly being excluded as the governing law of international sales contracts. By studying surveys and academic writings, certain factors can be derived as reasons prior to an exclusion of the CISG. The factors can be referred to as unfamiliarity, time and costs, negotiation strength and standard form contracts or standard terms. Regarding unfamiliarity, the importance given to the Convention in law faculties within the signatory states, together with time and costs attributed to a familiarization process, seems to play an important role. Moreover, the Convention is associated with problems regarding a non-uniform interpretation of the Convention’s provisions within the national courts and arbitral tribunals, as well as regarding its incompleteness, meaning that there are gaps that need to be filled by national law. These problems affect the Convention’s ability to provide potential users with <b>legal</b> certainty and <b>predictability,</b> which in turn may affect the familiarity with the Convention and hence have an impact on an exclusion of the CISG...|$|R
40|$|The WTO {{provides}} an opportunity to observe the recent creation, development and operation of a "hard law" adjudicative legal system, with legal subjects of greatly varying degrees of power, embedded within an intensely political environment. Between these parallel political and legal communities there are numerous points of contact. At each point of contact one finds played out (or to be played out) and resolved, re-iteratively, the basic drama between power-based and rules-based approaches to disputes. An examination of the Dispute Settlement Understanding and of subsequent developments - from the particular perspective of a participant within the WTO legal system - suggests that the rules-based approach was initiated in a somewhat low profile manner. Once the process had been quietly booted-up, ambiguity and discretion embedded in the rules has been systematically crystallizing, {{under the influence of}} lawyers and adjudicators acting {{both in and out of}} the court room, so as to substantially further develop and consolidate a more complete rules-based operating system. This is something to which the Members themselves do not appear to have objected. In the long term, the fundamental driving motor for this process, which ultimately outweighs all other considerations, is a necessity recognised by all participants and their constituents – that is, <b>legal</b> security and <b>predictability</b> for firms engaged in international trade. However, the legitimacy of particular outcomes will ultimately continue to rest upon the rationality, reasonableness and openness of adjudicators and their judgments. This repetitive process of shared experience and palliative outcome is progressively binding the political and legal communities together in a shared fate. The process is proving remarkably successful, and may both serve as a model for (and have spill-over effects in) other areas of international law. Ultimately, the system's continued success depends upon jealously guarding the independence of adjudicators, including the process by which they are selected, as well as ensuring the availability of effective remedies.

SIGMA has a special role in the development of the EAS concept. Harmonisation and convergence of national public administrations, with simultaneous retention of national traditions, leads to the conclusion that the beginnings of the European administrative space really exist. However, it is not yet possible to discern the formation of a complex and minutely developed public administration model that ought to be implemented by the member states and candidate countries. The European administrative space is probably going to be a set of rules and standards with gradually increasing corpus...|$|R
40|$|The private sewage {{systems in}} Sweden {{releases}} around 600 tons of phosphorus per year, compared to about 350 tons from municipal sewage treatment plants, and {{they account for}} approximately 21 % of the total anthropogenic discharge of phosphorus into Swedish waters. About 40 % of Sweden's nearly 1 million private sewage systems are inferior with respect to emissions to surface and groundwater.   The technology of small sewage plants is under development and knowledge of treatment effects for different solutions is poorly consolidated. Municipal authorities lack resources {{to keep up with}} the technologic development and assess the reliability of the treatment performances that suppliers report for their products. The thesis aims to conduct a market review and evaluation of wholly or partially prefabricated small sewage plants, to make it easier for municipalities and property owners to assess different technical solutions. The goal is a compilation of the products on the market, evaluated on the basis of the reliability of specified degrees of reduction. Information on sampling procedures and test results were collected through a questionnaire to all active suppliers and the responses were then used to classify the products. The results suggest that most products have been extensively tested and shown a good cleaning ability. Those test results should be readily available to property owners and state authorities so that they do not have to make their own inquiries to verify the functionality of each product. Tests should also be entered in the central gauge database that is being constructed on behalf of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. A case study was conducted in five municipalities in order to investigate how the handling of private sewage plants can be improved. The current work situation, what improvements that are demanded and what the administrators think of various suggestions for action was identified through interviews. According to the results, all administrators use the Environmental Protection Agency's general recommendations in their work though most of them experience difficulties to interpret the recommendations, and demand clearer rules and guidance. Almost all administrators want to increase the use of digital data and collaborate more across municipal boundaries. Another interesting finding is that the strategies to define the levels of environmental protection differ widely both between the five municipalities and between administrators within the municipalities. Better coordination is needed to enhance <b>legal</b> certainty and <b>predictability</b> for property owners and contractors. Kunskapscentrum Små Avlop...|$|R
40|$|How {{should we}} respond to a {{criminal}} offence committed by a young person? It is obvious {{that this is a}} very complex question. Multiple factors play important roles: the offence itself, but also the juvenile’s background in terms of education, socialization, prior convictions, etc. Every case is unique, but the criminal legal system has to follow the principles of <b>legal</b> certainty and <b>predictability.</b> A <b>legal</b> response to juvenile offending is a consequence of the criminal action, but it also has to consider the lesser maturity and greater vulnerability of young offenders. This dualism makes a trial against a young perpetrator complicated. The ideology of culpability and punishment emphasizes the seriousness of a certain offence. The ideology of welfare accentuates the social situation of the young offender and his or her individual needs. Juvenile criminal justice systems seem to face contradictory demands: from the law in a strict sense and from society at large. They are caught in the middle: between the culpability for the offence and the best interests of the young person. This thesis investigates the tension(s) between “welfare” and “justice” that the juvenile criminal justice system has to deal with (the “welfare/justice clash”) in Sweden and Germany. After exploring the differences between young and adult offenders which underlie the welfare/justice clash, the project presents an in-depth investigation of the Swedish and the German juvenile criminal justice systems. Thus, this study is comparative in its approach. To illustrate the different forms the welfare/justice clash takes in the Swedish and the German juvenile criminal justice systems, I focus on these systems’ guiding principles, legal responses and sentencing rules, procedural rules and safeguards, and on the figures in the juvenile courtroom. The investigation is not limited to a doctrinal study. I also present an empirical study, in the form of participant observations in the juvenile courtroom and semi-structured interviews with judges and public prosecutors from both countries, to gain insight into legal practice. The study of the two juvenile criminal justice systems shows that the theoretical welfare/justice clash is visible in books as well as in action, irrespective of the different approaches towards young offenders these countries pursue. However, this does not appear to give rise to any major problems in legal practice, as surprising as this may be. The practitioners in the juvenile courtroom seem to be able to balance and respect both ideologies. In the analysis, I suggest an explanation for the ability of the juvenile criminal justice systems in Sweden and in Germany to function in spite of the tensions highlighted in the previous chapters. Here, I switch perspectives from an internal view of the juvenile criminal justice system to an external view. I suggest abandoning the purely legal dogmatic (justice) approach and the purely welfare-based or social approach and instead combining elements of them in an approach to juvenile criminal justice that understands it as a system in its own right...|$|R
40|$|In {{discussions of}} moral {{responsibility}} for collectively produced effects, {{it is not}} uncommon to assume that we have to abandon the view that causal involvement is a necessary condition for individual co-responsibility. In general, considerations of cases where there is "a mismatch between the wrong a group commits and the apparent causal contributions for which we can hold individuals responsible" motivate this move. According to Brian Lawson, "solving this problem requires an approach that deemphasizes the importance of causal contributions". Christopher Kutz's theory of complicitious accountability in Complicity from 2000 is probably the most wellknown approach of that kind. Standard examples are supposed to illustrate mismatches of three different kinds: an agent may be morally co-responsible for an event to a high degree even if her causal contribution to that event is a) very small, b) imperceptible, or c) non-existent (in overdetermination cases). From such examples, Kutz and others conclude that principles of complicitious accountability cannot include a condition of causal involvement. In the present paper, I defend the causal involvement condition for co-responsibility. These are my lines of argument: First, overdetermination cases can be accommodated within a theory of coresponsibility without giving up the causality condition. Kutz and others oversimplify the relation between counterfactual dependence and causation, and they overlook the possibility that causal relations other than marginal contribution could be morally relevant. Second, harmful effects are sometimes overdetermined by non-collective sets of acts. Over-farming, or the greenhouse effect, might be cases of that kind. In such cases, there need not be any formal organization, any unifying intentions, or any other noncausal criterion of membership available. If we give up the causal condition for coresponsibility it will be impossible to delimit the morally relevant set of acts related to those harms. Since we sometimes find it fair to blame people for such harms, we must question the argument from overdetermination. Third, although problems about imperceptible effects or aggregation of very small effects are morally important, e. g. when we consider degrees of blameworthiness or epistemic limitations in reasoning about how to assign responsibility for specific harms, they are irrelevant to the issue of whether causal involvement is necessary for complicity. Fourth, the costs of rejecting the causality condition for complicity are high. Causation is an explicit and essential element in most doctrines of legal liability and it is central in common sense views of moral responsibility. Giving up this condition could have radical and unwanted consequences for <b>legal</b> security and <b>predictability.</b> However, it is not only for pragmatic reasons and because it is a default position that we should require stronger arguments (than conflicting intuitions about "mismatches") before giving up the causality condition. An essential element in holding someone to account for an event is the assumption that her actions and intentions are part of the explanation of why that event occurred. If we give up that element, it is difficult to see which important function responsibility assignments could have...|$|R
