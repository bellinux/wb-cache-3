40|$|Global {{concerns}} over atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels {{and the security}} of fossil fuel supply {{have led to the}} development of biofuels; a potentially carbon-neutral and renewable fuel strategy. One new gasoline-alternative biofuel candidate is 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (DMF). In this paper, the potential of DMF is examined in a direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine. Focus is given to the combustion performance and emissions sensitivity around the optimum spark timing, especially at 10 crank angle degrees retard (SR 10). Such spark retard strategies are commonly used to reduce catalyst <b>light-off</b> <b>times,</b> albeit at the cost of reduced engine performance and increased CO 2. The results for DMF are compared to gasoline, ethanol, butanol and methanol so that its sensitivity can be positioned relatively. The overall order of spark sensitivity at the highest load (8. 5 bar IMEP) was: gasoline > butanol > DMF > ethanol > methanol. The four biofuels widen the spark window due to improved anti-knock qualities and sometimes increased charge-cooling. This allows the increase of CO 2 to be better minimized than with gasoline. Furthermore, DMF is the only biofuel to produce high exhaust gas temperatures, similar to gasoline and helpful for fast catalyst light-off, whilst maintaining high combustion stabilities. This demonstrates the potentially favorable characteristics of DMF to become an effective cold-start fuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} determine the effects of substantial spark retard on engine combustion, hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, feed gas enthalpy, and catalyst light-off. Engine experiments were conducted at cold engine conditions for various ignition timings and air/ fuel ratios. Chemical and thermal energy of the exhaust gas was tracked from cylinder-exit to the catalytic converter inlet using a variety of experimental techniques. Time-resolved exhaust port and exhaust runner hydrocarbon concentrations were converted to an exhaust HC mass flow rate and compared to time-averaged downstream HC levels. Quenching experiments quantified cylinder-exit HC emissions by rapidly cooling exhaust gas at the valve seats, effectively freezing HC oxidation reactions. Combustion stability was observed to decrease as the phasing of the 50 % mass fraction burned location occurred later in the expansion stroke. A thermodynamic burn rate analysis indicated combustion was complete by exhaust valve opening with spark timings as late as 200 after top-dead-center (ATDC). Engine operation with a relative air/fuel ratio 10 % lean of stoichiometric resulted in the lowest observed tailpipe-out HC emissions. Retarded spark timings increased exhaust system oxidation, with port HC oxidation ranging from 15 % to 37 % with additional HC reductions (40 - 50 %) in the runner for ATDC spark timings. Catalyst <b>light-off</b> <b>times</b> were reduced by 5 seconds and cumulative catalytic converter-in HC emissions were reduced by 44 % prior to light-off. A phenomenological model of exhaust system oxidation was developed to provide insight into HC burn-up with late combustion phasing. (cont.) A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism was coupled with an exhaust flow model and exhaust thermal model. The hydrocarbon tracking and exhaust gas quenching experiments provided initial conditions for a reacting plug flow model. The predicted exhaust HC reaction rates were found to be strongly coupled with exhaust gas temperature and the hydrocarbon species used to represent unburned fuel.

40|$|The term ‘biodiesel’ refers, in this paper, to the Fatty Acid Alkyl Esters (FAAE) {{derived from}} vegetable, animal or waste oil feedstocks. Numerous {{economic}} and environmental drivers, such {{as the need for}} fuel security, the requirement to reduce global CO 2 emissions and the volatile price of crude oil, are leading to alternative transport fuels such as biodiesel being produced, and consumed, in increasing quantities. Most published research has focused on the impact of biodiesel on engine performance and emissions and, to a lesser degree, with the intention of understanding the impact on aftertreatment systems. Where the aftertreatment systems have been considered, studies have mainly concentrated on diesel particulate filters and NOX reduction systems. To date, no detailed studies in open literature have addressed diesel oxidation catalyst performance and, subsequently, this work presents the first thorough examination in this area. This study investigated the relative impact of thermal and chemical factors, when using rapeseed-based biodiesel, on the performance of a diesel oxidation catalyst. The oxidation reaction intensity inside the catalyst brick was examined and used to identify any possible effects caused by different HC speciation when using biodiesel compared to baseline diesel fuel. It was found that the CO catalyst conversion efficiency over a legislative drive cycle reduced as the biodiesel percentage increased, with conversion reduced by 10 % and 16 % for B 25 and B 50 respectively compared to baseline diesel. The reduction in spatial and temporal average catalyst brick temperature between B 0 and B 50 over the New European Drive Cycle was found to be up to 15. 5 °C. Catalyst light-off curves showed very similar responses when the engine out emissions of CO and HC’s were closely matched to the baseline diesel fuel. No statistically significant difference in the light-off temperatures between B 50 and baseline diesel were found, indicating that exhaust gas HC speciation did not {{have a significant impact on}} catalyst performance. The results show that exhaust gas temperature, and the energy released during the exothermic reactions within the catalyst, are the most significant cause of variations in catalyst performance when using biodiesel blends. These findings indicate that the increased use of biodiesel could require aftertreatment design and control optimisation to negate adverse impact on catalyst <b>light-off</b> <b>times</b> and performance...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the increasingly widespread use of catalytic converters for meeting automotive exhaust emission regulations considerable attention is currently being directed towards improving their performance. Experimental analysis is costly and time consuming. A desirable alternative is computational modelling. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} fully integrated computational model for simulating monolith type automotive catalytic converters. Two commercial CFD codes, PHOENICS and STAR-CD, were utilised to implement established techniques for modelling the flow field in catalyst assemblies. To appraise the accuracy of the flow field predictions an isothermal steady flow rig was designed and developed. A selection of axisymmetric inlet diffusers and 180 o expansions were tested, with the velocity profile across the monolith, the wall static pressure distribution along the inlet section and the total pressure drop across the assembly being measured. These datum sets were compared with predictions using a variety of turbulence models and solution algorithms. The closest agreement was achieved with a two-layer near wall approach, coupled to the fully turbulent version of the RNG k-ε model, and a nominally second order differencing scheme. Even with these approaches the predicted velocity profiles were too flat, the maximum velocity being as much as 17. 5 % too low. Agreement on pressure drops was better, the error being consistently less than 10 %. These results illustrate that present modelling techniques are insufficiently reliable for accurate predictions. It is suggested that the major reason for the relatively poor performance of these techniques is the neglecting of channel entrance effects in the monolith pressure drop term. Despite these weaknesses it was possible to show that the model reproduces the correct trends, and magnitude of change, in pressure drop and velocity distributions as the catalyst geometry changes. The PHONETICS flow field model was extended to include the heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical reactions associated with catalysts. The methodology is based on an equivalent continuum approach. The result is a reacting model capable of simulating the three-dimensional distribution of solid and gas temperatures, species concentrations and flow field variables throughout the monolith mat and the effects that moisture has on the transient warm-up of the monolith. To assess the reacting model’s accuracy use was made of published light-off data from a catalyst connected to a test bed engine. Comparison with predicted results showed that the model was capable of reproducing the correct type, and time scales, of temperature and conversion efficiency behaviour during the warm-up cycle. From these predictions it was possible to show that the flow distribution across the monolith can significantly change during light-off. Following the identification, and subsequent modelling, of the condensation and evaporation of water during the warm-up process it was possible to show that, under the catalyst conditions tested, these moisture effects do not affect <b>light-off</b> <b>times.</b> Conditions under which moisture might affect light-off have been suggested. Although the general level of model accuracy may be acceptable for studying many catalyst phenomena, known deficiencies in the reaction kinetics used, errors in the flow field predictions, uncertainty over many of the physical constants and necessary model simplifications mean that accurate quantitative predictions are still lacking. Improving the level of accuracy will require a systematic experimental approach followed by model refinements...|$|R

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 Automotive exhaust {{emission}} regulations are becoming stricter due to increasing {{awareness of the}} hazardous effects of {{exhaust emission}}s. The main challenge {{to comply with the}} EPA regulations is to reduce the emissions during cold start, because catalytic converters are ineffective until they reach a 'light-off' temperature - the temperature at which the converter starts reducing 50 % of emissions.

The reactor consists of a cylindrical ceramic monolith with porous alumina washcoat in which platinum is distributed as the catalyst. Two fuel-rich equivalence ratios were studied over a range of flow rates. The fuel-rich conditions permit low temperature combustion without the problem of hotspots likely to occur under fuel-lean conditions with hydrogen-containing fuels. Experimental data of temperature and species concentration at the exit of the reactor have been reported for a maximum fuel thermal input of 34 kW. The system exhibited quick start-up with a <b>light-off</b> <b>time</b> of around 60 s and a steady-state time of around 200 s as determined from the transient temperature profiles. The experimental results have also been complemented with detailed two-dimensional numerical simulations for improved understanding of the combustion characteristics in the reactor.

Stable operation, quick startup, and high turn-down ratio are some of the key features that enable the proposed combustion system to accommodate the transients in solar-thermal applications.

In Europe the majority of all personal car journeys are less than 4 km in length, with the emissions produced in the first kilometre accounting for 80 % of the total emissions produced in that journey. This is due to the time taken for the catalyst to attain 'light-off' signified by the point at which a catalyst reaches a sufficiently high temperature to allow chemical reactions to occur.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{technique to}} enhance fuel efficiency of large capacity S. I. engines is the de-activation of some cylinders at partial load, through {{the cut-out of}} fuel metering and a specific control of the airflow. Thanks to the ensuing reduction of throttling losses (the active cylinders operate {{at a much higher}} load), fuel consumption can be reduced, without any negative perception from the driver. Such a technique has been already applied successfully on some production engines, at the cost of some additional complication on the valve-train system. The application analyzed in this study is a little bit different, being aimed to reduce both fuel consumption and emissions, with a minimum impact on engine design. Larger fuel savings may be obtained by coupling the cylinder de-activation with VVT. However, the most important advantage of the modular engine concept proposed in this paper is in terms of emissions: this study demonstrates that the <b>light-off</b> <b>time</b> of the catalysts may be strongly reduced, and a further improvement is obtained by doubling the effective surface of the catalytic bed.

The MISiC (metal insulator silicon carbide) lambda sensor has proven to be both sensitive and selective to lambda, and its properties have been studied in lambda stairs both in gasoline engine exhausts and in the laboratory. There is, however, a small cross-sensitivity to CO. The influence of metal gate restructuring on the linearity of the sensor has also been investigated. The metal tends to form islands by time, which decreases the catalytic activity and thereby gives the sensor, which is binary when fresh, a linear behavior. Successful attempts to prevent the restructuring through depositing a protective layer of insulator on top of the metal were made. The influence of increasing the catalytic activity in the measurement cell was also studied. It was concluded that the location of the binary switch point of MISiC lambda sensors could be moved towards the stoichiometric value if the consumption of gases in the measurement cell was increased. The MISiC NH 3 sensor for SCR systems {{has been shown to be}} highly sensitive to ammonia both in laboratory and diesel engine measurements.

40|$|Emissions from {{gasoline}} engines {{remain an}} important issue worldwide as they are both harmful to health and contribute to green house effects especially under cold start conditions. A major challenge of the automotive industry is to reduce harmful emissions {{as much as possible}} whilst continuing to reduce CO 2 emissions. Three-way-catalytic converters have been used very successfully to convert the harmful gases before release to the environment but these devices have to reach their light-off temperature in order to activate the chemical reactions. Therefore, the conversion time is delayed and during the pre light-off period, high levels of emissions are released. An investigation into methods capable of increasing catalyst temperature under cold start conditions has been carried out. The most beneficial technique used in this research was the secondary air method. The method introduced extra air into the exhaust manifold which allowed the engine to run rich and then the residual unburned fuel to be oxidised in the exhaust before approaching the converter. An experiment following a Box- Behnken design was used to study the effect of engine speed, spark angle, load, relative air/fuel ratio (lambda) and secondary air flow on pre-catalyst temperature. The study suggested the best result for the engine studied was to achieve fast catalytic <b>light-off</b> <b>time</b> was to run engine at 1225 rpm, spark angle of 0 degree BTDC, lambda of 0. 82 and load of 0. 5 bar BMEP. These settings allowed the remaining fuel to be burned with 5. 87 kg/hr of secondary air in the exhaust manifold to achieve a pre-catalytic temperature of 631. 1 QC and achieve light-off for all emissions within 17. 2 seconds. The results were also used to build a temperature prediction model using the Matlab MBC toolbox and the best available model gave an R 2 of 0. 9997 by using radial base functions (RBF). However, the optimum conditions still produced cyclic variation in the combustion, giving an average COVimep of 14. 8 % during the pre-catalytic heating period which caused problems concerning engine smoothness. To derive a greater insight into the mechanisms governing the cyclic variability observed a simulation study was undertaken. The study used a simulation using Ricardo WAVE and Matlab Simulink to allow a detailed representation of some of the principle mechanisms giving rise to cyclic variability under cold start conditions. The study included combustion under rich and lean mixtures and considered the effect of variations of air/fuel ratios and residual gas fraction. As a result, the simulation showed a similar characteristic variability of heat release to that observed experimentally. The validation of the model for heat release showed that the predictions were under estimated by 0. 49 % while under lean combustion, there was an under estimation of 2. 07 %. Both predictions had normally distributed residuals. The model suggested that the residual gas fractions were higher than the limit of 8. 8 % (under rich fuelling) or 8. 0 % (under lean fuelling) that was predicted to cause ignition delay to increase significantly and therefore contribute to high cyclic variability. ' An optimisation was carried out by varying camshaft angle in the simulation. The results suggest that retarding the exhaust camshaft position by 4 degrees (EVC 12 degrees BTDC) could reduce COVimep by 63. 2 % under rich combustion. In contrast, advancing the intake camshaft position suggested that the COVmep can be reduced but more experimental data is required to validate the results because variation of intake camshaft positions had a larger impact on pumping work than varying exhaust camshaft positions. These additional pumping losses result in higher air and fuel flow requirements. In summary, this thesis describes a detailed investigation into the effects of engine calibration on catalyst heating performance. One of the limiting factors in achieving rapid light-off is combustion variability. Extensions have been introduced to an industry standard ID engine simulation to allow realistic cyclic variability to represented and developed. These tools could allow cyclic variability to be considered more rigorously during a calibration exercise. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
