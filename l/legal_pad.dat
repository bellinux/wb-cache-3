500|$|Using {{scraps of}} paper {{given to him by}} a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a <b>legal</b> <b>pad</b> given to him by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay [...] "Letter from Birmingham Jail". It responded to eight {{politically}} moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes. Bass suggested that [...] "Letter from Birmingham Jail" [...] was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham. The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings. King's arrest attracted national attention, including that of corporate officers of retail chains with stores in downtown Birmingham. After King's arrest, the chains' profits began to erode. National business owners pressed the Kennedy administration to intervene. King was released on April 20, 1963.|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Puffy" [...] {{most likely}} comes from Andy Sturmer's {{conscious}} or unconscious {{recollection of the}} night he and his bandmates/friends in the (as of then unnamed) band Jellyfish were {{trying to come up}} with funny/catchy band names. [...] "The Puffy" [...] was one of the titles presented by Roger Joseph Manning's friend Greg Hillegas. A laugh was had by all, and the conversation moved on.

She has said, [...] "He was on his deathbed. We knew {{it was the last time}} we were seeing each other; he grabbed my brother's hand and mouthed 'I love you,' but he never touched me. All he did was write on a <b>legal</b> <b>pad</b> 'How's work?'" ...|$|E
