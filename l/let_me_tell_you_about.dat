It was a semi-autobiographical musical profile of Haggard, {{akin to the}} contemporary Behind The Music, produced and directed by Michael Davis. The 1973 recession anthem, [...] "If We Make It Through December," [...] furthered Haggard's status {{as a champion of}} the working class. [...] "If We Make It Through December" [...] turned out to be Haggard's last crossover pop hit.|$|E

60|$|FITZSIMMONS. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it. Bill {{was an old}} fighter. Not an old man, you know, but he'd been in the {{fighting}} game a long time. He was about thirty-eight and a gamer man never entered the ring. But he was in hard luck. Younger fighters were coming up, and he was being crowded out. At that time it wasn't often he got a fight and the purses were small. Besides it was a drought year in Australia. You don't know what that means. It means that the rangers are starved. It means that the sheep are starved and die by the millions. It {{means that there is}} no money and no work, and that the men and women and kiddies starve.|$|E

I held him tighter and tighter, till I nearly strangled him, and he gasped and gurgled and moaned. Oh! it was fine to see him. Then I found a cord in the drawer there and I bound him, and while I fastened the knots I laughed and I talked to him. I talked about that night in the storm when he threw his father"--he pointed a long, quivering finger at me--"threw him into the slate quarry, and about that day {{when he came to the}} Castle gate and brought me to the plantation, and suddenly caught me by the throat till he thought he had strangled me, and beat me on the head. Ah, how my head has burned ever since, ever since, ever since! Ah, Milly, come to me! Milly, I am on fire! My head is on fire! Ah, ah!" ...|$|E

She is a widow, and lives in Kensington with her two daughters--both pretty, clever girls, I think, though they are my cousins. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> her. She is a dear good creature, and I am awfully fond of her; very {{religious}} too, but what the world thinks and says, and what it will say, is as much to her as what her Bible says, although it would shock her very much to hear me say so. When I made the discovery that Fan was my half-sister, I told aunt all about it. She was greatly troubled in her mind, and I suppose that her mental picture of the girl must have been rather a disagreeable one; but she asked no questions on the point, and I gave her no information. She {{said that it was}} right to provide for her, and so on, but {{that it would be a}} great mistake to make her take the family name, or to bring her forward in any way. After a few days she wrote to me asking what I had done or was going to do about it. I replied that Fan was my father's daughter, and as much to me as if we had been born of one mother as well, and that I had nothing more to say. Then I got letter after letter, reasoning with me about my quixotic ideas, and trying to convince me that my action would only result in spoiling the girl, and in creating a coldness between myself and relations. It was rather hard, because I am really fond of my aunt and my cousins. My only answer to all her letters was to give her an account of that dream or fancy of my father's; her reply was that that made no difference, that I would do the girl no good by dragging her among people she was not fitted to associate with.|$|E
