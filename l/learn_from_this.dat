25|$|A {{number of}} Australians {{were able to}} <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> series {{and were able to}} {{transform}} themselves into better players as a result. David Boon's Test career was written off after this series. Dean Jones lived up to his promise, while Steve Waugh, after a long period of time, finally began to deliver on his ability and was one of Australia's most important players in the 1990s. Australia's bowlers, notably Geoff Lawson, Merv Hughes and Craig McDermott, all returned to form and were integral parts of future teams that defeated England in 1989, 1990–91, 1993, and 1994-95. Bruce Reid's performances improved markedly, but back injuries limited his Test career.|$|E
25|$|There is one {{fundamental}} lesson we must <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> experience: {{electricity is}} really different from everything else. It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities {{to take advantage}} of a deregulated market endless. It is a public good that must be protected from private abuse. If Murphy's Law were written for a market approach to electricity, then the law would state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.' And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.|$|E

2500|$|China’s {{international}} {{role played}} two parts within their community, one {{being a part}} of the horror that took place and the other side being remorseful. It is already proven that the Rwandan genocide could have been prevented [...] Both France and China were responsible for supplying the government with military arms. If prevention from the United Nations was taken far more seriously, it could have prevented China and France from funding and/or fueling the genocide and French troops from helping the Hutu regime in power flee the country. [...] The Rwandan embassy and Chinese communities organized events to honor the lost and injured. These events took place in Beijing and a few Rwandan communities. The memorials were marked with silence, prayers, songs and presentations on the history of Rwanda; they expressed the hope that the world could <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> tragedy.|$|E

However, it did little to revive the political fortunes of Cowen's government. After Fianna Fáil performed badly in the elections of 5 June 2009, losing half its European Parliament seats, Fine Gael tabled a motion of no confidence against Cowen on 9 June. He survived the vote by a thin margin of 85–79. Support for the government continued to fall: on 3 September 2009, an Irish Times /TNS mrbi poll, opinion poll reported that Cowen's satisfaction rating had dropped six points to 15 percent, with 77 percent of voters saying they were dissatisfied with the way he was doing his job.|$|E
2500|$|Manetho was an Egyptian priest, {{living in}} the third century BC, who {{categorized}} the pharaohs of dynastic Egypt into 31 dynasties. Manetho’s schematic has its flaws; nevertheless, modern scholars conventionally follow his method of grouping. The Papyrus Prisse, a Middle Kingdom source, supports the fact that King Huni was indeed Sneferu’s predecessor. It states that [...] "the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Huni, came to the landing place (i.e., died), and the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Sneferu, was raised up as a beneficent king in this entire land..." [...] Aside from Sneferu’s succession, we <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> text that later generations considered {{him to be a}} [...] "beneficent" [...] ruler. This idea may stem from the etymology of the king’s name, for it can be interpreted as the infinitive [...] "to make beautiful." [...] It is uncertain whether Huni was Sneferu’s father; however, the Cairo Annals Stone denotes that his mother may have been a woman named Meresankh.|$|E

2500|$|On Rotten Tomatoes {{the film}} has a rating of 11% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 3.3/10. The film was given a Two Thumbs Down on Siskel & Ebert, with Gene Siskel noted that the film's {{animation}} looks [...] "cheap and unfinished" [...] and that [...] "none of the songs are memorable" [...] while Roger Ebert added his dislike of the [...] "dumb songs", [...] "silly story", and the film's color-coding of its heroes and villains. Ebert took this a step further by arguing [...] "What do kids <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>this?</b> Nothing overt. Just a quiet, unstated impression: White is good and brave, and brown is scheming and negative. Reinforce that through lots of cartoons (examples: Aladdin and The Rescuers Down Under) and no wonder even black children choose white dolls in some psychological experiments". Deseret News said, [...] "the songs are forgettable, the story one-note and the characterizations quite weak". The Austin Chronicle said the film [...] "lacks dramatic structure and narrative drive: Songs and animated action pieces are narratively connected but the film doesn't feel as though it is an organic whole. All the elements are here, they just don't come together". Time Out said [...] "The characterisations are weak and unendearing. Worse, the big 'action' sequences turn up with the pacing and predictability of clock chimes. And, in what is perhaps the last great medium for musicals, the perfunctoriness of Barry Manilow's songs and arrangements seem guaranteed to put off yet another generation". The New York Times wrote that 4 would be [...] "the optimum age for viewers of this gentle, animated musical", adding that [...] "the action seems flat and low-rent compared to those earlier movies", and that it [...] "doesn't have the vivid characters, first-rate animation or sense of adventure that turns movies like The Lion King into endlessly watchable favorites".|$|E
