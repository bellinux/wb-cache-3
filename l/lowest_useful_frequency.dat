The objective is to control, in a passive form, the longitudinal vibration transmissibility in specific and wide enough frequency ranges of interest.

40|$|Optical rectennas are antenna-coupled diode {{rectifiers}} {{that receive}} and convert optical-frequency electromagnetic radiation into DC output. Because classical rectennas working at microwave frequencies can achieve very high rectification efficiencies, rectennas working as solar cells {{were expected to}} have efficiencies significantly higher than conventional solar cells. By applying the theory of photon-assisted tunneling (PAT) to optical rectennas at solar intensities, I show that the power conversion efficiency of rectenna solar cells is fundamentally limited to the Trivich-Flinn efficiency limit of 44 %. This unexpected result {{is the same as}} the Shockley-Queisser ultimate efficiency limit of conventional solar cells. Is it possible to exceed this efficiency limit? I answer this question by showing that there is a correspondence between the quantum and classical operation of a rectenna. Such correspondence allows high frequency rectennas to operate in the same way as classical rectennas, and to potentially exceed the Trivich-Flinn efficiency limit. I propose two ways to achieve classical operation in optical rectennas. Diode design is crucial for achieving high rectification efficiency. High-speed diodes, such as metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diodes, have insufficient asymmetry for harvesting low intensity radiation. I suggest steps to improve the characteristics of double insulator MIM diodes and calculate their power conversion efficiency using PAT theory. A simple figure of merit is provided to quickly assess the usefulness of MIM diodes in optical rectennas. Although ineffective at visible frequencies, MIM diodes have RC time constants sufficient for operation at <b>low</b> terahertz <b>frequencies,</b> <b>useful</b> in applications including detection and high-speed electronics.

In contrast to MIM diodes, novel planar devices called geometric diodes have very low RC time constants and are capable of rectifying radiation up to 100 THz.
