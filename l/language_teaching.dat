25|$|Dogme <b>language</b> <b>teaching</b> is {{considered}} to be both a methodology and a movement. Dogme is a communicative approach to <b>language</b> <b>teaching</b> and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher. It has its roots in an article by the language education author, Scott Thornbury. The Dogme approach is also referred to as “Dogme ELT”, which reflects its origins in the ELT (English <b>language</b> <b>teaching)</b> sector. Although Dogme <b>language</b> <b>teaching</b> gained its name from an analogy with the Dogme 95 film movement (initiated by Lars von Trier), the connection is not considered close.|$|E

25|$|Although this {{approach}} is all but unknown among language teachers today, elements of it have had long-lasting effects on <b>language</b> <b>teaching,</b> being the basis of many widely used English as a Second/Foreign Language textbooks {{as late as the}} 1980s and elements of it still appear in current texts. Many of the structural elements of {{this approach}} were called into question in the 1960s, causing modifications of this method that led to communicative <b>language</b> <b>teaching.</b> However, its emphasis on oral practice, grammar and sentence patterns still finds widespread support among language teachers and remains popular in countries where foreign language syllabuses are still heavily based on grammar.|$|E

25|$|Textbooks on the Nanai language, fairy tales, {{and artistic}} {{literature}} {{are used in}} Nanai <b>language</b> <b>teaching.</b> Sometimes teachers took the initiative to use oral folklore as well.

Nanai language textbooks follow the model of Russian language textbooks aimed at native speakers, rather than emphasising instruction in the language itself, and in the theoretical/practical grammar. This model is not adequate for the situation of heritage language preservation. Moreover, the existing <b>language</b> <b>teaching</b> materials are oriented predominantly (or only) towards the development of reading habits; however, the number of publications in the Nanaian language does not exceed one-two ten, mostly collections of folklore or artistic works of the historical-biographical genre, publishing in limited print runs.
