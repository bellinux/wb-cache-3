25|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>carburizing</b> {{involves}} placing {{parts in}} a bath of a molten carbon-containing material, often a metal cyanide; gas carburizing involves placing the parts in a furnace maintained with a methane-rich interior.|$|E
50|$|In general, gas {{carburizing}} is {{used for}} parts that are large. <b>Liquid</b> <b>carburizing</b> {{is used for}} small and medium parts and pack carburizing {{can be used for}} large parts and individual processing of small parts in bulk. Vacuum carburizing (low pressure carburizing or LPC) can be applied across a large spectrum of parts when used in conjunction with either oil or high pressure gas quenching (HPGQ), depending on the alloying elements within the base material.|$|E
50|$|A {{main goal}} when {{producing}} carburized workpieces {{is to ensure}} maximum contact between the workpiece surface and the carbon-rich elements. In gas and <b>liquid</b> <b>carburizing,</b> the workpieces are often supported in mesh baskets or suspended by wire. In pack carburizing, the workpiece and carbon are enclosed in a container to ensure that contact is maintained over as much surface area as possible. Pack carburizing containers are usually made of carbon steel coated with aluminum or heat-resisting nickel-chromium alloy and sealed at all openings with fire clay.|$|E
50|$|In general, pack {{carburizing}} equipment {{can accommodate}} larger workpieces than <b>liquid</b> or gas <b>carburizing</b> equipment, but <b>liquid</b> or gas <b>carburizing</b> methods are faster and {{lend themselves to}} mechanized material handling. Also the advantages of carburizing over carbonitriding are greater case depth (case depths of greater than 0.3 inch are possible), less distortion, and better impact strength. This makes it perfect for high strength and wear applications (e.g. scissors or swords). The disadvantages include added expense, higher working temperatures, and increased time.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Hardening agents== There are {{different}} types of elements or materials {{that can be used}} to perform this process, but these mainly consist of high carbon content material. A few typical hardening agents include carbon monoxide gas (CO), sodium cyanide and barium carbonate, or hardwood charcoal. In gas carburizing, the CO is given off by propane or natural gas. In <b>liquid</b> <b>carburizing,</b> the CO is derived from a molten salt composed mainly of sodium cyanide (NaCN) and barium chloride (BaCl2). In pack carburizing, carbon monoxide is given off by coke or hardwood charcoal.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the effect of temperature and holding time in the <b>liquid</b> <b>carburizing</b> process to t he hardness increase of AISI 1025 steel. This <b>liquid</b> <b>carburizing</b> process uses temperature variation 750 0 C, 800 0 C and 850 0 C, with holding time 30, 60, and 90 minutes. The reagen used is a mixture of NaCN 75...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} effects of {{nitriding}} and carburizing processes applied to gears subjected to contact stresses below 1300 MPa. The manufacturing cost, as well the depth of hardened layer and the distortion produced by two processes are analyzed. AISI 4140 gears quenched, tempered, liquid and gas nitriding and AISI 8620 gears after <b>liquid</b> <b>carburizing,</b> quenching and tempering are analyzed. The dimensional control of the gears was carried out before and after heat and thermochemical treatments. It is concluded that liquid or gas nitriding processes are about 30...|$|E
40|$|Carburizing {{is one of}} {{the leading}} surface-hardening {{processes}} for improving wear and fatigue resistance while still maintaining tough and shock resistant cores through surface carbon enrichment of low-carbon steel parts. Of the different carburizing media available, <b>liquid</b> <b>carburizing</b> is not recommended in P/M applications because of salt entrapment in the pores. While gas carburizing is more practical than pack carburizing, plasma treatments are becoming more common because of better treatment control, leading to better performance. In previous studies, we have shown the viability of treatments such as nitriding, nitrocarburizing and carburizing, when applied with suitable parameters to Ni, Mo and Mn alloyed P/M steels of sinter-hardening capability. In the present work, the effects of gaseous and plasma carburizing treatments performed in industrial furnaces on carbon free samples have been studied in order to establish the most suitable treatment cycles and to verify the depth of the carbon penetration. Case depth and microstructure have been characterized by metallographical, physical and chemical analysis...|$|E
