25|$|Three {{biochemical}} pathways {{activate the}} complement system: the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> is {{homologous}} to {{the classical}} pathway, but with the opsonin, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and ficolins, instead of C1q. This pathway is activated by binding of MBL to mannose residues on the pathogen surface, which activates the MBL-associated serine proteases, MASP-1, and MASP-2 (very similar to C1r and C1s, respectively), which can then split C4 into C4a and C4b and C2 into C2a and C2b. C4b and C2a then bind together to form the classical C3-convertase, as in the classical pathway. Ficolins are homologous to MBL and function via MASP in a similar way. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been described in M-ficolin in humans, with effect on ligand-binding ability and serum levels. Historically, the larger fragment of C2 was named C2a, but it is now referred to as C2b. In invertebrates without an adaptive immune system, ficolins are expanded and their binding specificities diversified {{to compensate for the}} lack of pathogen-specific recognition molecules.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{proteins}} and glycoproteins {{that constitute the}} complement system are synthesized by hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinal tract and gastrointestinal tract. The three pathways of activation all generate homologous variants of the protease C3-convertase. The classical complement pathway typically requires antigen—antibody complexes (immune complexes) for activation (specific immune response), whereas the alternative pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis, foreign material, pathogens, or damaged cells. The mannose-binding <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events. [...] C3b binds {{to the surface of}} pathogens, leading to greater internalization by phagocytic cells by opsonization.|$|E
5000|$|It {{inhibits}} {{the action}} the classical and the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways,</b> more specifically C4. It also has ability to bind C3b. C4BP accelerates decay of C3-convertase {{and is a}} cofactor for serine protease factor I which cleaves C4b and C3b.|$|R
5000|$|C3 convertase {{can be used}} {{to refer}} to the form {{produced}} in the alternative pathway (C3bBb) or the classical and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> (C4bC2a). Once formed, both C3 convertases will catalyze the proteolytic cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b (hence the name [...] "C3-convertase").|$|R
2500|$|... "It is {{also useful}} {{to be aware}} that the larger active {{fragment}} of C2 was originally designated C2a, and is still called that in some texts and research papers. Here, for consistency, we shall call all large fragments of complement b, so the larger fragment of C2 will be designated C2b. In the classical and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> the C3 convertase enzyme is formed from membrane-bound C4b with C2b." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> {{is a type}} of cascade {{reaction}} in the complement system, similar in structure to the classical complement pathway, in that, after activation, it proceeds through the action of C4 and C2 to produce activated complement proteins further down the cascade. In contrast to the classical complement pathway, the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> does not recognize an antibody bound to its target. The <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> starts with mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolin binding to certain sugars.|$|E
50|$|The {{complement}} {{system can be}} activated through three pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway.</b> One way that the most-recently discovered <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> is activated is through mannose-binding lectin protein. MBL binds to carbohydrates (to be specific, D-mannose and L-fucose residues) found on the surfaces of many pathogens.|$|E
50|$|MBL {{deficiency}} {{refers to}} Mannan-binding <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> components such as MBL2.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} resist {{complement}} differs between the Y and ColombianaTrypanosoma cruzi strains. We {{found that the}} Y strain of T. cruziwas more able to resist the classical and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> of complement activation than the Colombiana strain. The complement C 2 receptor inhibitor trispanning gene (CRIT) is highly conserved in both strains. At the protein level, CRIT is expressed only in stationary-phase epimastigotes of the Y but not the Colom-biana strain and is expressed in infectious metacyclic trypomastigotes of both strains. Y strain epimastigotes with an overexpressedCRITgene (pTEX-CRIT) had higher survival in normal human serum (NHS). Overexpression of the Y strain CRIT gene in Colombiana epimastigote forms increased the parasite’s resistance to lysis mediated by the classical and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> but not to lysis mediated by alternative pathways. CRIT involvement on the parasite surface was confirmed by showing that the lytic activity of NHS against epimastigotes could be restored by adding excess C 2. Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease and that affects 18 million people in Latin America, with 90 million at risk of infection worldwide [1]. Approximately 30 %of individuals in the indetermi-nate stage, in which parasitemia is undetectable and pa...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: The {{immune system}} is likely to {{play a key role}} in the {{etiology}} of gliomas. Genetic polymorphisms in the mannose-binding lectin gene, a key activator in the <b>lectin</b> complement <b>pathway,</b> have been associated with risk of several cancers. Methods: To examine the role of the <b>lectin</b> complement <b>pathway,</b> we combined data from prospectively collected cohorts with available DNA specimens. Using a nested case-control design, we genotyped 85 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 9 genes in the <b>lectin</b> complement <b>pathway</b> and 3 additional SNPs in MBL 2 were tested post hoc). Initial SNPs were selected using tagging SNPs for haplotypes; the second group of SNPs for MBL 2 was selected based on functional SNPs related to phenotype. Associations were examined using logistic regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Nominal p-values are presented and are not corrected for multiple comparisons...|$|R
40|$|By {{eliciting}} inflammatory responses, {{the human}} immunosurveillance system notably combats invading pathogens, during which acute phase proteins (CRP and cytokines) are elevated markedly. However, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a persistent opportunistic pathogen prevalent {{at the site}} of local inflammation, and its acquisition of multiple antibioticresistance factors poses grave challenges to patient healthcare management. Using blood samples from infected patients, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa is effectively killed in the plasma under defined local infection-inflammation condition, where slight acidosis and reduced calcium levels (pH 6. 5, 2 mM calcium) typically prevail. We showed that this powerful antimicrobial activity is provoked by crosstalk between two plasma proteins; CRP:L-ficolin interaction led to communication between the complement classical and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> from which two amplification events emerged. Assays for C 4 deposition, phagocytosis, and protein competition consistently proved the functional significance of the amplification pathways in boosting complement-mediated antimicrobial activity. The infection-inflammation condition induced a 100 fold increase in CRP:L-ficolin interaction in a pH- and calcium-sensitive manner. We conclude that the infection-induced local inflammatory conditions trigger a strong interaction between CRP:L-ficolin, eliciting complement-amplification pathways which are autonomous and which co-exist with and reinforce the classical and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways.</b> Our findings provide new insights into the host immune response to P. aeruginosa infection under pathological conditions and th...|$|R

50|$|Collectins {{are linked}} with {{activation}} of <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> of complement activation. At the beginning, {{there is a}} binding of collectin to PAMPs or DAMPs. Collectin MBL is involved in activation of the lectin complement pathway. There are three serine proteases, MASP-1, 2 and 3 (MBL-associated serine proteases), which participate in activation of the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway.</b> MASP-2 has a cleavage activity and {{it is essential for}} forming lectin C3 and C5 convertases and for activation of the complement.|$|E
50|$|Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), {{also called}} mannose-binding protein or mannan-binding protein (MBP), is a lectin that is {{instrumental}} in innate immunity via the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway.</b>|$|E
40|$|Complement {{effector}} products {{generated in}} the transplanted kidney are known to mediate transplant rejection, but which of the three main activation pathways of complement trigger this response is unclear. Here we assessed {{the role of the}} classical and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> by studying the common component C 4 in mouse kidney transplant rejection. We transplanted wild-type or C 4 -null H- 2 b donor kidneys into H- 2 k or H- 2 d recipients, or vice-versa, to assess the roles of donor kidney and recipient expression of complement. Intragraft C 4 gene expression rose substantially during rejection. However, we found no significant association between graft acceptance and the presence of C 4 in either the donor kidney or recipient mouse. At the time of rejection, we found no significant differences in alloantibody response in the different groups. Tubular deposition of C 3 to C 9 occurred regardless of the absence or presence of C 4 in either the donor or recipient mouse, indicating that C 4 was dispensable for complement activation at this site. These data suggest that complement activation and renal allograft rejection are independent of the classical and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> in these models, implying that in the absence of these pathways the alternative pathway is the main trigger for complement-mediated rejection...|$|R
40|$|The {{complement}} system {{refers to a}} series of proteins circulating in the blood that do the work of complementing antibodies in destroying bacteria. These proteins circulate in an inactive form, but in response to the recognition of the molecular components of the pathogenic micro-organism, they become sequentially active, working in a manner wherein the activation and binding of one protein leads to the activation of the next protein in cascade resulting in the lysis of bacterial cells. There are three pathways of complement activation namely classical, <b>lectin</b> and alternative <b>pathways.</b> The initiation of complement cascade in classical pathway is caused by formation of immune complexes {{on the surface of the}} target cell. The alternative and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> are integral participants of non-specific innate immunity and hence do not require any antibody involvement for activation...|$|R
40|$|C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 BP) is a soluble, 570 kDa large glycoprotein, {{present in}} plasma at a {{concentration}} of approximately 200 mg/L. C 4 BP is the main inhibitor of the classical and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> of complement, where it controls C 4 b-mediated reactions. Here, we describe a method for purification of C 4 BP from human plasma, {{which is based on}} barium chloride precipitation, anion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. We also describe a functional assay, in which C 4 BP's cofactor activity to factor I, in the degradation of C 4 b, can be assessed...|$|R
50|$|MASP-1 is {{involved}} in the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> of the complement system and is responsible for cleaving C4 and C2 to form C4b2a, a C3-convertase.|$|E
50|$|MASP-1 is a serine {{protease}} that {{functions as a}} component of the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> of complement activation. The complement pathway plays an essential role in the innate and adaptive immune response. MASP-1 is synthesized as a zymogen and is activated when it complexes with the pathogen recognition molecules of <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway,</b> the mannose-binding lectin and the ficolins. This protein is not directly involved in complement activation but may play a role as an amplifier of complement activation by cleaving complement C2 or by activating another complement {{serine protease}}, MASP-2. MASP-1 is also able to cleave fibrinogen and factor XIII and may be involved in coagulation. A splice variant of this gene which lacks the serine protease domain functions as an inhibitor of the complement pathway.|$|E
50|$|Anwar’s {{research}} on N. meningitidis involved determining effects that modifying the organism’s outer components had on its susceptibility to {{attack by the}} host’s immune system. Specifically, the ability of mannose binding lectin, {{a component of the}} immune system involved in the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> of opsonization, to bind onto N. meningitidis when it’s LOS outer core and/or capsule had been removed was determined by utilizing flow cytometry and gel electrophoresis. It was found that when the outer core was removed, strong binding of MBL to N. meningitidis was detected, even when physiologically low levels of MBL had been used. In addition, activation of the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway</b> of opsonization had also been detected by the presence of a cleaved product. Both results indicate that removal of the outer core increases the host’s immune response against the pathogen.|$|E
50|$|In the {{classical}} and <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> of complement activation, {{formation of the}} C3-convertase and C5-convertases requires binding of C2 to an activated surface-bound C4b {{in the presence of}} Mg2+; the resultant C4bC2 complex is then cleaved by C1s or MASP2 into C2a and C2b. It is thought that cleavage of C2 by C1s, while bound to C4b. results into a conformational rotation of C2a whereas the released C2b fragment may retain most of its original structure. C2a is the larger, enzymatically active fragment which is incorporated into the C3 convertase in this pathway, C4b2. C2b is released into the fluid phase.|$|R

40|$|C 1 {{inhibitor}} is a multipotent serpin {{capable of}} inhibiting the classical and the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> of complement, the fibrinolytic system, and contact/kinin system of coagulation.

Measuring the C 1 inhibitor level is of vital {{importance for the}} diagnosis of HAE and also for monitoring patients receiving C 1 inhibitor for therapy. Determination of the antigenic C 1 inhibitor level by the radial immunodiffusion (RID) technique is described in detail in this chapter.

40|$|The {{complement}} system {{is an important}} component of the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. The classical complement pathway is activated by antibody–antigen complexes on the bacterial surface and has been considered predominately to be an effector of the adaptive immune response, whereas the alternative and mannose-binding <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> are activated directly by bacterial cell surface components and are considered effectors of the innate immune response. Recently, a role has been suggested for the classical pathway during innate immunity that is activated by natural IgM or components of the acute-phase response bound to bacterial pathogens. However, the functional importance of the classical pathway for innate immunity to S. pneumoniae and other bacterial pathogens, and its relative contribution compared with the alternative and mannose-binding <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> has not been defined. By using strains of mice with genetic deficiencies of complement components and secretory IgM we have investigated the role of each complement pathway and natural IgM for innate immunity to S. pneumoniae. Our results show that the proportion of a population of S. pneumoniae bound by C 3 depends mainly on the classical pathway, whereas the intensity of C 3 binding depends on the alternative pathway. Furthermore, the classical pathway, partially targeted by the binding of natural IgM to bacteria, is the dominant pathway for activation of the {{complement system}} during innate immunity to S. pneumoniae, loss of which results in rapidly progressing septicemia and impaired macrophage activation. These data demonstrate the vital role of the classical pathway for innate immunity to a bacterial pathogen. Jeremy S. Brown, Tracy Hussell, Sarah M. Gilliland, David W. Holden, James C.

50|$|MBL {{belongs to}} the class of collectins in the C-type lectin superfamily, whose {{function}} appears to be pattern recognition in {{the first line of}} defense in the pre-immune host.

5000|$|Three {{biochemical}} pathways {{activate the}} complement system: the classical complement pathway, the alternate complement pathway, and the mannose-binding <b>lectin</b> <b>pathway.</b> The classical complement pathway typically requires antibodies for activation {{and is a}} specific immune response, while the alternate pathway can be activated without the presence of antibodies and is considered a non-specific immune response.

40|$|Innate {{immunity}} is {{the major}} host defense against invasive aspergillosis. To determine whether the collectin mannan-binding lectin (MBL) {{is involved in the}} initial protective immunity through complement activation against opportunistic fungal infections caused by Aspergillus, we performed in vitro studies on 29 different strains of Aspergillus conidia from five different species. Incubation of Aspergillus conidia in human normal serum leads to activation of the alternative pathway, whereas neither the classical nor the <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> through C 4 and C 2 cleavage are activated. Complement response to conidia was investigated using a MBL-deficient serum and reconstitution experiments were conducted with MBL/MASPs complexes. We found that MBL can directly support C 3 activation by a C 2 bypass mechanism. Finally, a stronger activation of the alternative pathway was observed for the clinical strains isolated from patients with invasive aspergillosis, compared with the environmental strains...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of {{circulating immune complexes}} (CICs) is a characteristic feature of human lymphatic filariasis.

The levels of CICs in association with complement activation in clinically asymptomatic, filarial-infected patients (INF); filarial-infected patients with overt lymphatic pathologic changes (CPDT); and uninfected controls (EN) were examined. Significantly increased levels of CICs and enhanced functional efficiency of the classical and mannose-binding <b>lectin</b> <b>pathways</b> of the complement system was observed in INF compared with CPDT and EN.

It shows a duplex role in affecting chemotaxis; while inactivating neutrophil CXCR2 receptor, generates an active C5a fragment of C5 (although inactivating C5b). However, it has yet to prove any significant impact on the outcome of infection. Inhibition of staphopain A by phosphorylated cystatin α did prevent colony formation in skin tissue, but the effect could also be attributed to staphopain B. Mutation of scpA did not show any impact on the outcome of a skin abscess nor a septic arthritis model. Overlapping activity with the other proteases, plus the complexity of virulence determinants and the infection site environment makes it difficult to determine the impact of the protease in pathogenesis.|$|R
