25|$|In 2015 a {{university}} level course aiming {{to encourage and}} support practitioners working with young children to introduce the Cornish language into their settings was launched. The Cornish Language Practice Project (Early Years) is a level 4 course approved by Plymouth University and run at Cornwall College. The course is not a Cornish <b>language</b> <b>course,</b> but students will be assessed {{on their ability to}} use the Cornish language constructively in their work with young children. The course will cover such topics as Understanding Bilingualism, Creating Resources and Integrating Language and Play, but the focus of the language provision will be on Cornish. A non-accredited specialist Cornish <b>language</b> <b>course</b> has been developed to run alongside the level 4 course for those who prefer tutor support to learn the language or develop their skills further for use with young children.|$|E

50|$|The {{academic}} program {{has evolved over}} time. The Center originally provided English <b>language</b> <b>courses</b> for Chinese students and Chinese <b>language</b> <b>courses</b> for international students. The English <b>language</b> <b>courses</b> were suspended during the 1997-1998 school year, as the Chinese administrators of the Center concluded that the language skills of entering Chinese students were already sufficient for the program. This decision was opposed by the American faculty. The Chinese <b>language</b> <b>courses</b> were suspended several years later. These changes reflected a controversy over whether the Center represented a substantive graduate program or a language school; for many years, Johns Hopkins SAIS only awarded half-credit {{for participation in the}} program on these grounds.|$|R
