2500|$|Solvent {{extraction}} – electrowinning (often {{referred to}} as [...] "SX–EW") is a process frequently applied for recovering copper from low-grade and/or oxidised copper ore.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to present the {{possibilities}} of copper(II) recovery from the synthetic sulphate <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> containing cobalt(II), nickel(II) and manganese(II). Design/methodology/approach: The investigations have been undertaken in order to determine the influence of major parameters on the extraction process of copper(II) from the <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> of polymetallic manganese nodules. Copper(II) ions were extracted with Kelex 100 and LIX 70 in kerosene. The effect of different parameters such as pH of aqueous phase, extractants concentration in the organic phase, concentration of sulphuric acid as the stripping reagent were investigated. Findings: The optimal conditions of metal ions selectivity extraction have been determined. Over 99 % of Cu(II) can be effectively extracted with 5 % Kelex 100 and 10 % LIX 70 at pH of 2. 0 from model <b>leach</b> <b>liquor</b> in the presence of Co(II), Ni(II) and Mn(II), while less than 10 % of the other metals is transported to the organic phase. The selectivity of Cu(II) extraction over Co(II), Ni(II) and Mn(II) with Kelex 100 depended upon the acidity of aqueous solution and the selectivity increased with decreasing of pH in the feed solution. Separation of Cu(II) from these metal ions is very effective. Cu(II) can be recovered successfully from the loaded organic phase with Kelex 100 through stripping with 2. 0 M H 2 SO 4. Practical implications: The results can be used during the hydrometallurgical recovery of metals from nodules on the industrial scale.
