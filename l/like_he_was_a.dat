According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> person that understood what we were doing and could maintain a focus on what we were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E
500|$|When Tom Welling {{auditioned for}} the role {{he was not sure}} how to prepare. While waiting for his turn, he {{realized}} that the character is one thing above all else: [...] "... a high school kid ...." [...] To Welling, simply acting <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> normal teenager, instead of like a super hero, was the perfect way to embody the character. Welling realized that by doing that, the special effects and other production elements would fill in the holes and perfect the character on screen. For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene with Kristin Kreuk (the first actor to be cast for the show), and the network thought they had [...] "... great chemistry".|$|E
500|$|Universal {{makeup artist}} Jack Pierce paid special {{attention}} to the Monster's appearance in this film. He altered his 1931 design to display the after-effects of the mill fire, adding scars and shortening the Monster's hair. Over the course of filming, Pierce modified the Monster's makeup to indicate that the Monster's injuries were healing as the film progressed. Pierce co-created the Bride's makeup with strong input from Whale, especially regarding the Bride's iconic hair style, based on Nefertiti. Lanchester's hair was given a Marcel wave over a wire frame to achieve the style. Lanchester disliked working with Pierce, who she said [...] "really did feel that he made these people, <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> god... in the morning he'd be dressed in white as if he were in hospital to perform an operation." [...] To play Mary Shelley, Lanchester wore a white net dress embroidered with sequins of butterflies, stars, and moons, which the actress had heard required 17 women 12 weeks to make.|$|E

500|$|Kulwicki {{started his}} rookie season in 1986 with Terry. After Terry decided to end support for his racing team mid-season, Kulwicki fielded his own team. He started out as {{essentially}} a one-man team {{in a time when}} other teams had dozens of people in supporting roles. Initially the driver, owner, crew chief, and chief mechanic, Kulwicki had difficulty acquiring and keeping crew members because he found it difficult to trust them to do the job with the excellence that he demanded, and because he was hands on in the maintenance of racecars {{to the point of being}} a [...] "control freak". He sought out crew members who had owned their own racecars, believing they would understand what he was going through: working long hours and performing his own car maintenance with a very limited budget. Notable crew members include his crew chief, Paul Andrews, and future Cup crew chiefs, Tony Gibson and Brian Whitesell. Future crew chief and owner, Ray Evernham, lasted sixweeks with Kulwicki in 1992. Evernham later said, [...] "The man was a genius. There's no question. It's not a matter of people just feeling <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> genius. That man was a genius. But his personality paid for that. He was very impatient, very straightforward, very cut-to-the-bone." [...] With onecar, twoengines, and twofull-time crew members, Kulwicki won the 1986 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award. He had competed in 23 of 29events, with fourtop10 finishes, three races not completed (DNF), an average finish of 15.4, and had only one result below 30th place. Kulwicki finished 21st in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.|$|E
2500|$|Goblins are reptilian fairies, often {{described}} as upright, raptor like creatures (minus the claws and feathers). They are quite stupid as they have brains the size of rats, but they can still talk and (to a certain extent) work machinery like lasers and sometimes even computers. They {{have the ability to}} create fireballs in their hands, or shoot them through their nostrils (sometimes by inhaling fireballs created in their own hands). Groups of goblins are involved in an ongoing turf war with groups of dwarves. They make their clothing from their own shed skin. In Book 3, Holly describes goblins as [...] "Evolution's little joke", with the reasoning, [...] "pick the dumbest creatures on the planet, and give them the ability to conjure fire". Notable goblins include General Scalene who was killed along with Julius Root in book 4, also a general in the goblin revolution and public enemy No.2 [...] (after Opal Koboi). [...] Also there are Generals Sputa and Phlebum, leaders of the triad, and captain (now lieutenant after killing D'Nall and Aymon) [...] Nyle, a young, cocky goblin captain also enlisted in the goblin revolution. Another notable goblin is Lieutenant Poll. He was the leader of the goblin hit squad who nearly killed Root and Butler in book 2. After straying too close to an avalanche to inspect the [...] "bodies" [...] of Butler and Root, a one-ton pane of ice put [...] "some big hole in Lieutenant Poll. I could see right through 'im. An' I don't mean that <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bad liar." [...] in the words of Aymon.|$|E

With a {{comfortable}} feeling {{on the side}} toward the fire he stuck his slight legs straight out before the old-time settle, looked devil-may-care, made delightful ridges on the sanded floor with his toe, and clapped a pewter pot on his knee with a small emphatic [...] "Wop!" [...] After {{about two and a}} quarter tankards he broke out, [...] "Say, that peddler guy there, don't he look <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> gipsy--you know--sneaking through the hedges around the manner-house to steal the earl's daughter, huh?" ...|$|E

Till that night, he took pets and passions if he was spoke to, and lap through the house like a four-year-auld at the least word of advice that was minted at him, but now he spoke as grave and as douce as the Lord Abbot himself. She kendna," [...] she said, [...] "what might be the upshot of it, but it was <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> wonderfu' callant even now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Who do {{you think}} I ran into the other evening at the De Luxe Restaurant? Why, old Freddy Durkee, {{that used to be}} a dead or-alive {{shipping}} clerk in my old place--Mr. Mouse-Man we used to laughingly call the dear fellow. One time he was so timid he was plumb scared of the Super, and never got credit for the dandy work he did. Him at the De Luxe! And if he wasn't ordering a tony feed with all the [...] "fixings" [...] from celery to nuts! And instead of being embarrassed by the waiters, like he used to be at the little dump where we lunched in Old Lang Syne, he was bossing them around <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> millionaire! ...|$|E

60|$|NEXT day, towards night, we laid {{up under}} a little willow towhead out in the middle, {{where there was a}} village {{on each side of the}} river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and {{tiresome}} to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> runaway nigger, you know.

Imagine! Can you beat that? And him nothing but a Swede tailor--Erik Valborg his name is. But he used to be in a tailor shop in Minneapolis (they do say he's a smart needle-pusher, at that) and he tries to let on that he's a regular city fellow. They say he tries to make people think he's a poet--carries books around and pretends to read 'em. Myrtle Cass says she met him at a dance, and he was mooning around all over the place, and he asked her did she like flowers and poetry and music and everything; he spieled <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> regular United States Senator; and Myrtle--she's a devil, that girl, ha! ha!--she kidded him along, and got him going, and honest, what d'you think he said?

The boys call him 'Elizabeth,' and they stop him and ask about the books he lets on to have read, and he goes and tells them, and they take it all in and jolly him terribly, and he never gets onto the fact they're kidding him.
