40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was prioritizing of effective factors in service quality of aerobicclubs in Karaj. Nowadays service quality is one of successful factor in service organizations. Customers’ satisfaction from services causes to maintaining of customers that leads to successof organization. Method of the research is descriptive and solidarity kind. The statisticalpopulation was the members of aerobic clubs. 12 clubs were selected in a random cluster wayand totally 141 questionnaire were collected. In the research standard Liu questionnaire wasused that has been translated and its validity was subscribed by specialist teachers. Reliability ofquestionnaire also was calculated by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (α= 0 / 87). Factor analysiswith Varimax rotation was used for analysis of data. The result showed empathy with <b>loadfactor</b> of 0 / 86; reliability with load factor of 0 / 85; assurance with load factor of 0 / 80;responsiveness with load factor of 0 / 78 and tangibles with load factor of 0 / 73 were sequentiallythe most important factors in service quality of aerobic clubs in Karaj...|$|E

The usual procedure is to circle and climb in vertical currents of limited spatial dimension (‘thermals’) under cumulus clouds and thereafter to exchange the gained height into distance by gliding out to the next cumulus cloud. While doing so, sailplane pilots will often encounter larger-scale regions where the atmosphere moves in a vertical direction. Until recently the optimal strategy in such situations {{was assumed to be}} to fly slower through regions with upward moving air and faster through regions with downward moving air. Only a few years ago it was discovered both in theory, from energy considerations, as well as in practice, by contest pilots, that in some circumstances more energy could be extracted from the atmosphere when the <b>loadfactor,</b> i. e., the total aerodynamic lifting force on the wings divided by the weight, was varied. The research reported in this paper was set up to investigate this phenomenon. To that end a simple dynamic model is assumed for the sailplane, and the optimization problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with terminal constraints. This optimal control problem is solved numerically for a number of different widths and strengths of the vertical currents encountered. The computer program used for this purpose is a rather general continuous optimal control program based on the use of (conjugate) gradients in function space and a projection operation to account for the terminal constraints...|$|E
50|$|Cretan Airlines was {{established}} in 1993 by Cretan businessmen active in the tourist sector. Their aim was to run an airline for flying tourists to airportsnearby their hotels. Cretan was the first Greek airline to operate AirbusA320 aircraft that were leased from Adria Airways. Although the main business was charter flights, a route from Thessaloniki to Athensand Crete was opened. Cretan also planned opening other domestic routes and a decision toorder the Dornier Do-328 was made. Unfortunately, <b>loadfactors</b> {{during the winter months}} proved to be too low, thus incurring greateconomic losses for the company. Therefore, its owners were forced to ceaseoperations in early 1995. At that time, the company had transported morethan 100.000 passengers and had a staff of approximately 250 people.|$|R
