Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's <b>level</b> <b>range.</b> Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E

25|$|The in-game {{world of}} The Lord of the Rings Online is {{currently}} divided into 25 distinct regions with individual dynamic content and storyline. Three main world areas include Eriador, Rhovanion and Gondor. Turbine has not added new areas (unlike in Tolkien's original world, Enedwaith appears under Eriador and Rohan {{is considered to}} be a part of Rhovanion). Each region in the game contains NPCs and quests within an established player character <b>level</b> <b>range.</b> Level ranges are broad and the regions' main quest lines will guide players through deeds and quests in the region in progression from lowest level to highest level. Every region contains Player vs. Environment, or PvE content. The only in-game region that player's can participate in Player vs. Player, or PvP action is the Ettenmoors (see above). Each region also has a 'capital', the largest settlement, such as 'Bree' in Bree-land or the village of 'Aughaire' in Angmar. The capitals serve as 'quest hubs' (bases to accept or finish quests from friendly NPCs) and contain in-game services for player characters, such as vendors, auction houses, crafting halls, etc. Every region is sub-divided into distinct areas, with individual landscape aesthetic and NPCs that spawn only in that area. These areas take on many distinct appearances: swamp, tundra, forest, open plains, hilly regions, lakes, etc. The areas contain additional quest hubs and services, either large settlements of NPCs or small camps or lone NPCs.|$|E
