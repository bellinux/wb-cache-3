50|$|In the {{aquarium}} the <b>leopard</b> <b>bush</b> fish {{is often seen}} as a hardy oddball that fits into some community tanks but careful consideration must be taken since it is somewhat aggressive. The <b>leopard</b> <b>bush</b> fish in the wild is a predator so it will take small fish up to the general size of an adult female guppy; anything larger than this will {{for the most part}} be ignored. It is not generally a good idea to mix this fish with large aggressive cichlids as they may injure the <b>leopard</b> <b>bush</b> fish or out-compete it for food. Good tank mates for the <b>leopard</b> <b>bush</b> fish include all gourami species, bala shark, silver dollar, Corydoras, Plecostomus species, Ancistrus catfish, and anything that won't fit into its mouth. They enjoy lots of space and places to hide, so 55 gallons is acceptable if it is not overstocked and has good filtration.|$|E
50|$|In {{the wild}} <b>leopard</b> <b>bush</b> fish will eat any fish or insect {{that they come}} across {{small enough to fit}} into their mouths. In the {{aquarium}} however they will readily learn to accept dead alternatives such as bloodworms (chironomid midge larvae) and some sinking pellets, however that said few learn to accept flake foods and many people prefer to feed them with live food so that they are able to watch the <b>leopard</b> <b>bush</b> fish's unusual stalking method.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{collected}} {{basic data}} on the mammalian fauna of the Ugalla area (05 ° 13. 0 ’S, 30 ° 27. 5 ’E), western Tanzania. We identified 50 mammalian species: seven species of Primates; at least one unidentified species of Chiroptera; two identified species of Lagomorpha; four identified species of Rodentia; 17 identified {{and at least two}} unidentified species of Carnivora; one species of Tubulidentata; one species of Hyracoidea; and 15 species of Artiodactyla. Nine-teen of these species had not previously been reported from Ugalla. Moreover, eight of these mammal species had not previously been confirmed in this area, according to the Red List of the International World Conservation Union. Ugalla has a diverse mammalian fauna, including species that originated in the tropical rainforest and acacia savanna. In addition, our surveys suggest that genets, African civets, <b>leopards,</b> <b>bush</b> hyraxes and southern reedbucks have differ-ent ecologies from mammals in other regions...|$|R
