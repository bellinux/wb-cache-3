These roads are mainly federal roads maintained by the national Public Works Department. The city also famous {{for a number of}} roundabouts including the oldest and largest one, known as Datuk Abang Kipali Bin Abang Akip Roundabout. The roundabout are usually landscaped and were efficient to handling traffic congestion. However, traffic lights are more commonly used now as the city traffic continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{allegations}} had not previously been reported to authorities, the reasons given included fear of disbelief and distrust in the judicial system. At least seven allegations of sexual assault made to police during Savile's lifetime were not <b>linked</b> <b>by</b> police, with Savile as the same alleged perpetrator. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that {{the allegations}} made to Surrey Police between 2007 and 2009 could have resulted in prosecutions being undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{control their}} use of these {{electron}} donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, <b>linked</b> <b>by</b> the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.|$|E

Between the two wings is a landscaped courtyard.|$|E
5|$|Some TLPs may {{be caused}} by gas {{escaping}} from underground cavities. These gaseous events are purported to display a distinctive reddish hue, while others have appeared as white clouds or an indistinct haze. The majority of TLPs appear to be associated with floor-fractured craters, the edges of lunar maria, or in other locations <b>linked</b> <b>by</b> geologists with volcanic activity. However, {{these are some of the}} most common targets when viewing the Moon, and this correlation could be an observational bias.|$|E

5|$|The common {{element to}} both church and palazzi {{interior}} design was the stucco work. Stucco {{is an important}} component of the Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'oeil ceilings and walls in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti <b>linked</b> <b>by</b> swags of flowers, in a private house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{group of}} islands surrounds Scapa Flow. Hoy {{is the second}} largest of the Orkney Isles and Ward Hill at its northern end is the highest elevation in the archipelago. The Old Man of Hoy is a well-known seastack.

It is also the location of the Neolithic Tomb of the Eagles. Graemsay and Flotta are both <b>linked</b> <b>by</b> ferry to the Mainland and Hoy, and the latter is known for its large oil terminal. South Walls has a 19th-century Martello tower and is connected to Hoy by the Ayre. South Ronaldsay, Burray, Glims Holm, and Lamb Holm are connected by road to the Mainland by the Churchill Barriers.|$|E
5|$|Anderitum {{appears to}} have been a {{particularly}} important link in the Saxon Shore forts, which extended from Hampshire to Norfolk and may have been connected by intermediate watchtowers. The Notitia Dignitatum mentions a fleet that was presumably based there, the Classis Anderidaensis. It would probably have acted in coordination with naval units based on the other side of the Channel to intercept pirate ships passing through the Channel. Like the other Saxon Shore forts, Anderitum's position at a strategic harbour would have enabled the Romans to control access to the shoreline and prevent invaders from penetrating inland. It was <b>linked</b> <b>by</b> a road built in the late Roman period, probably at the same time as the fort.|$|E
