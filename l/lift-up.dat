Additionally, Hilux Surf versions immediately moved to 16-inch wheels and gained a center differential, enabling the use of four-wheel drive on hard surfaces without complication for the first time. The prior system was retained to give on-the-fly shifting between rear- and four-wheel drive as before. The new 4Runner was also available with a factory installed selectable electric locker in the rear differential, a first for the 4Runner but available since 1993 in the Toyota Land Cruiser.|$|E

50|$|The Commodore {{represented}} {{a major shift}} in thinking for Holden since it was significantly smaller than the previous full-size family car, the Holden Kingswood, but visually similar in size to the mid-size Torana / Sunbird sedans. It essentially came about in response to the 1973 oil crisis and the need to produce more fuel-efficient cars. Holden, hedging their bets, initially built the Commodore alongside the other two established body styles, until the Torana was dropped in mid-1979, with only the Sunbird surviving into mid-1980 following release of the updated VC Commodore. The VB was available in three specification levels: Commodore, Commodore SL, and Commodore SL/E. A station wagon variant - not available in SL/E form - was released on 24 July 1979, hitting showrooms on 6 August 1979. It featured a large cargo area and an easy access one-piece <b>lift-up</b> tailgate. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany (from the Rekord), the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan, confirmed by the separate keys for the ignition system and rear door.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quarterback in}} this context was often called the [...] "blocking back" [...] as their duties usually {{involved}} blocking after the initial handoff. The [...] "fullback" [...] was the furthest back behind {{the line of scrimmage}}. The [...] "halfback" [...] was halfway between the fullback and the line of scrimmage, and the [...] "quarter-back" [...] was halfway between the halfback and the line of scrimmage. Hence, he was called a [...] "quarter-back" [...] by Walter Camp.The requirement to stay behind the line of scrimmage was soon rescinded, but it was later re-imposed in six-man football. The exchange between the person snapping the ball (typically the center) and the quarterback was initially an awkward one because it involved a kick. At first, centers gave the ball a small boot, and then picked it up and handed it to the quarterback. By 1889, Yale center Bert Hanson was bouncing the ball on the ground to the quarterback between his legs. The following year, a rule change officially made snapping the ball using the hands between the legs legal. Several years later, Amos Alonzo Stagg at the University of Chicago invented the <b>lift-up</b> snap: the center passed the ball off the ground and between his legs to a standing quarterback.

5000|$|The escheators {{were ordered}} by a writ from the king's {{chancery}} {{to investigate the}} deaths of tenants-in-chief {{in order to assess}} what monetary value was due to the king from his so-called feudal incidents, comprising for example feudal relief, wardships, and marriages. Such revenues which resulted from the deaths of his tenants-in-chief formed a significant proportion of the mediaeval royal revenues. The feudal due which was payable to the king on the inheritance of the lands by the tenant's heir is termed a relief, from Latin levo, levare (to <b>lift-up),</b> plus re (again), signifying the process of re-elevating the heir to the honourable position of the deceased, as a lord of the manor and tenant-in-chief. The scale of reliefs payable to the king by his tenants-in-chief who held under the feudal land tenure of barony had become a fixed sum under clause two of Magna Carta (1215), but the king nevertheless needed to know who the heir was so payment of the relief could be demanded. If the tenant-in-chief was found to have no heir, for example if he was unmarried or childless, the lands held would [...] "escheat" [...] (i.e. revert to the demesne of the king) to be re-granted as a valuable reward to a favoured courtier or official, or sold for cash proceeds. This aspect of the process was the origin of their former appellation by early Victorian antiquarians of [...] "escheats". If the tenant-in-chief left a minor son as heir, that is to say one aged under 21, his wardship escheated likewise to the king, who was able to sell or award his marriage to a third party. Generally the marriages of such wards were purchased by wealthy men as husbands for their own daughters, and a marriage contract was drawn up at the direction of the bride's father which entailed the ward's future estate onto the progeny of the marriage. Thus the wealthy purchaser's grandchildren became the inheritors of the ward's estate. If the deceased tenant-in-chief left a minor daughter, that is to say one aged under 14, or one younger who was not contracted in marriage, as sole heiress (or more as joint-heiresses), her wardship and marriage likewise escheated to the king. Such wardships constituted {{a significant part of the}} royal revenues in mediaeval times.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: We have {{utilized}} <b>lift-up</b> laminoplasty to treat patients with myelopathy caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of the cervical spine. The preliminary surgical outcome with computer-assisted morphological assessment is presented. Material and Methods: The surgical technique of <b>lift-up</b> laminoplasty includes standard posterior {{exposure of the}} cervical spine, en-bloc laminectomy, and expansion of the cervical canal by <b>lift-up</b> of the laminae with custom-designed hydroxyapatite laminar spacers and stabilization of the laminae using titanium miniplates. From 1998 to 2003, 10 consecutive patients with cervical myelopathy secondary to OPLL have been treated with this method and comprehensively evaluated. Care was taken to tailor the treatment to individual patients by using different sizes of spacers to adjust the degree of expansion depending {{on the amount of}} stenosis of the cervical spine. The degree of expansion of the cervical canal was altered by design, based on the preoperative imaging simulation. Results: Preliminary surgical outcome, evaluated at 6 months after surgery, revealed a significant improvement of neurological function. Image analysis revealed that the cervical canals were significantly expanded, with a mean reduction of 13. 1 &#x 0025; in the stenosis ratio. <b>Lift-up</b> laminoplasty was effective in the treatment of patients with myelopathy secondary to cervical OPLL, and the amount of expansion could be individually adjusted at the discretion of the surgeon.

40|$|The {{pedestrian}} {{level wind}} environment is seriously deteriorated by moderated local wind flow in a densely built-up subtropical city like Hong Kong. In {{order to improve}} the weak wind condition, the lift up design {{has been used for}} some time. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding and quantitative assessment of its modification on the pedestrian level wind comfort around different building configurations under different wind directions. This paper aims to study the effects of <b>lift-up</b> design in four common building configurations on the wind comfort via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The turbulence model and numerical method are firstly validated by comparing the simulated wind flow data with the wind tunnel test results. The validated model is then utilized to simulate the four building, configurations, including the "-", "L", "U" and "square" shaped buildings. The mean wind velocity ratio (MVR) and mean wind velocity change ratio (Delta MVR) are employed to identify the wind comfort and to quantitatively evaluate the improvements due to the <b>lift-up</b> design. Results show that the <b>lift-up</b> design can improve the wind comfort in building surroundings and its influence is highly dependent on the incident wind direction. Specifically, the wind comfort is better under the oblique wind direction than the other two wind directions. These findings can provide us a better understanding of the <b>lift-up</b> design and will be helpful in better precinct planning. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the alterations of kinetic characteristics in the step up/over test in patients with acute and chronic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency. Twenty acute, twenty chronic ACL-deficient (ACLD) patients, and forty healthy controls participated in this study. The step up/over test was performed on a clinical force platform system to obtain the following variables: movement time, <b>lift-up</b> index and impact index. The percentages of the indexes from the stepping leg and time of step-up and swing- over were further calculated. These variables were examined statistically by using mixed repeated measure analysis of variance to reveal the differences between groups and between limbs. Smaller <b>lift-up</b> forces and longer swing-over time in both ACLD groups than those in the control group were found. One exception was the <b>lift-up</b> index in the affected side condition of the acute ACLD group, which was not significantly different from the controls. A reduced contribution to the impact index from the affected stepping leg was also found in the acute ACLD group. The acute ACLD group showed no significant change in their step-up strategy at the affected limbs, but they may have a poorer eccentric control of the affected knees on the step and thus put a larger portion of loading onto the unaffected landing leg. Our results indicated the <b>lift-up</b> index, swing-over time and load- distributing strategy at impact may be important parameters in monitoring functional recovery in patients with ACL deficiency.

40|$|International audienceThe {{stability}} of the recirculation bubble behind a smoothed backward-facing step is numerically computed. Destabilization occurs first through a stationary three-dimensional mode. Analysis of the direct global mode shows that the instability corresponds to a deformation of the recirculation bubble in which streamwise vortices induce low- and high-speed streaks as in the classical <b>lift-up</b> mechanism. Formulation of the adjoint problem and computation of the adjoint global mode show that both the <b>lift-up</b> mechanism associated with the transport of the base flow by the perturbation and the convective non-normality associated with the transport of the perturbation by the base flow explain {{the properties of the}} flow. The <b>lift-up</b> non-normality differentiates the direct and adjoint modes by their component: the direct is dominated by the streamwise component and the adjoint by the cross-stream component. The convective non-normality results in a different localization of the direct and adjoint global modes, respectively downstream and upstream. The implications of these properties for the control problem are considered. Passive control, to be most efficient, should modify the flow inside the recirculation bubble where direct and adjoint global modes overlap, whereas active control, by for example blowing and suction at the wall, should be placed just upstream of the separation point where the pressure of the adjoint global mode is maximum. © 2009 Cambridge University Press...|$|E
