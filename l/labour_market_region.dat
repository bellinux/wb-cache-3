Our findings indicate that short distance relocations (within municipalities and labour markets) are triggered by growth and the corresponding need for more space, while longer distance relocations are mainly influenced by regional characteristics. The spatial concentration of similar or related firms, a higher level of urbanization and R&D intensity keep firms from leaving their <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>region,</b> but firms are more inclined to leave regions with a higher share of innovative firms...|$|E

We argue that the effects of foreign presence on host-country productivity may differ depending on the mode of foreign entry. Using a long panel from the Norwegian Manufacturing Census, we find that greenfield entry both in the same industry and in the same <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>region</b> has a negative impact on the productivity of domestic plants, while entry via acquisition affects the productivity of domestic plants in the same industry positively. The positive effect from acquisitions is consistent with knowledge spillovers as these plants have pre-established linkages within the industry. The negative effects from greenfield entry can be attributed to increased competition both in the product market and for qualified employees in a tight labour market. Our results help to explain the ambiguity of results in the empirical literature that relates overall foreign presence to host-country productivity...|$|E

To evaluate the performance of these models, the task was to predict individualmigration {{from other parts of}} Sweden to the Local <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>region</b> of Stockholmfrom the year 2011 to 2012 using microdata. The result shows that the models have relativelyhigh AUC (0. 9056 - 0. 9136).

The modelsare also compared to a baseline model (i. e., a model which randomly predict who migrates ornot), which shows that they are significantly better than random prediction. However, due to arelatively high imbalance in classes, between migrants and non-migrants (1 : 200), the absolutenumber of false positives versus true positives at the optimal operating point is large and makesthe predictions less useful in practice. Since the performance between Logistic regression and Neural networks is not significantlydierent, this result indicates that it is for a practitioner also relevant to compare the modelsbased on other factors such as interpretability and complexity when choosing a model for aprediction task...|$|E
40|$|Travelling {{by train}} has {{increased}} {{during the last}} decades in Sweden. This has {{put pressure on the}} existing infrastructure and has created problems with delays and cancelled departures. The railway is a complex system with mutual dependencies and high vulnerability for disruptions. The situation for the railway system in the Stockholm region is today strained. The capacity is fully used. An increase of the population together with an expected growth in popularity for train travelling will lead to a demand for additional railway capacity.   The purpose of this master’s thesis is to investigate long-term needs and requirements regarding increased railway capacity in the Stockholm region. As a consequence of the system properties of a railway system it is crucial to define a common goal when developing the system. The common goal is here presented as a system level requirements specification. The requirements can be summarised as following: A long-term railway solution shall meet traveller’s needs on a national, regional and local level, contribute to increasing the area of the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>region,</b> be robust and reliable and contribute to the fulfilment of the national climate goals.   As a result a long-term need of a new double track between Järna and Uppsala is identified. Trafikverket is recommended to further investigate an expansion of the railway system with a new tunnel connection between Älvsjö and Tomteboda. Such an expansion enables a robust system with faster passages through Stockholm and the possibility to separate different kinds of trains...|$|E
40|$|The {{geographical}} {{distance between}} home and workplace is present and increases within modern society. Along with changing economic structures and technological developments it has increased the spatial division of labour and changed the pressure on global, regional and local markets. Regional development strategies today emphasize on more mobile, flexible and larger geographical labour markets to improve matchmaking between jobs and labour force to reach and obtain development. Commuting has therefore increased and is often promoted as a positive solution for involved individuals and the regional society at large. Although, the notion and benefits of such regional development strategies have been questioned as commuting involves a consideration between economic and social circumstances and effects on all involved household members. The social and economic effects on commuting households in Umeå enlarged local <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>region</b> have therefore been studied in and investigated in this thesis. Empirical data has been collected through qualitative interviews with four commuting households with different home-work locations and commuting situations. Results of this study goes in line with previous studies and pictures how commuting is a strategy to obtain or maintain desired living conditions within desired location when the local labour opportunities are limited. Commuting households therefore gain “quality of life” and labour opportunities. But, the economic benefits are reduced by transport costs and reduction of labour hours, and the social consequences of reduced time in the home environment effects relations between family members and the division of household responsibilities’. This study have also broaden the understanding of commuting effects and showed that shorter commuting distance also hold social and economic implications for commuting households. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{regional}} demographic trends in France from 1968 to 1990. This study {{is based on}} a concept using zones d'emploi (<b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>regions)</b> as regional analysis units instead of régions de programmes or départements as usually done in other studies. The 348 zones d'emploi are functional units based on commuter flows. The study follows two main objectives: (1) Analysis of the main regional migration and population trends over the three census periods from 1968 to 1990. (2) Analysis of the growth trends of different types of regions on the basis of typifying the zones d’emploi (<b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>regions)</b> according to economic criteria and settlement structure criteria. The large-scale pattern of the population and population trends. Owing to the stronger growth of the rural zones d'emploi after 1975, the growth figures are rather suggestive of deconcentration trends. In the 80 ies, however, the demographic trends were rather indicative of concentration trends: there has been a disproportionate growth in the regional metropolises and in the area around Paris. Additional indicators such as the employment trend and the business formation rate underline the dominance of concentration trends. That dominance of concentration trends on the inter-regional level in France is in accordance with studies which consider the large agglomeration areas to be the "winners" of the emerging European Union internal market. migration trends seem to be relatively stable in comparison to the massive change in the general economic and political framework in France and Western Europe. For instance, more than 60 % of the zones d'emploi (<b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>regions)</b> have steadily shown either migration losses or migration gains over the three census periods. The different region types, however, show more distinct changes. The zones d'emploi (<b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>regions)</b> with a tertiary sector specialisation show a higher population growth than mainly industrial regions.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a summary and four self-contained papers. Paper [I] examines whether fathers influence the time their children spend in subsidized child care. Two non-nested models of family child care demand are estimated. The parameter estimates indicate that several characteristics of the father {{are associated with the}} time his child spends in child care. J-tests and bootstrapped J-tests also show that a model where the father’s characteristics are excluded can be rejected in favour of a model where his characteristics are included. Paper [II] considers the effects of the Swedish child care fee reform on public expenditures and taxation in the municipalities. A difference-indifference approach is employed where outcomes are compared with respect to the municipalities’ pre-reform fee systems. The results show that pre-reform characteristics determine taxes and child care expenditures in the post-reform period. It is also found that changes in child care quality were not connected to the pre-reform systems characteristics. Paper [III] provides evidence of the effect of college quality on earnings in Sweden. The results suggest that the link between college quality and earnings is weak. A small positive effect is found for individuals that are likely to work full time. Controlling for region of work affects the estimated effects, indicating a correlation between choice of college quality and choice of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>region.</b> In Paper [IV], earnings differences between transfer and non-transfer students are analysed. The results show that earnings, during the first years after leaving the university, are significantly lower for students who change universities compared to students who do not change.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five individual essays, {{and a common}} introduction. The main theoretical focus {{of the study is}} to show that a firm’s choice to carry out a business interaction is based on its set of perceived business opportunities. Differences in domestic regional business attraction in Sweden are investigated within the framework of new spatial econometric tools, assuming that interregional business trips {{can be used as a}} proxy for regional business attraction. If a region has a growing number of new innovations and/or a number of entrepreneurs with profitable business opportunities, then more firms will establish business contacts with that region. A decision to make a business contact is related to the perceived profitability of such a contact and the profitability is correlated with the form of interaction chosen, where the choice is between an face-to-face (FTF) contact and a mediated contact. The arguments put forward are that the choice of FTF business contacts is associated with non-standardised information exchange and high transaction costs (net of travel costs). This implies that market and renewal activities are associated with a greater willingness to make an FTF contact than other activities. The empirical part of the study examines the generation and attraction of interregional FTF business interaction for a set of functional regions and for the Jönköping airport market area. The empirical part is based on two unique surveys with over 165 000 respondents. The empirical exercises show that the generation of interregional business trips is primarily market oriented. In addition, the analysis shows that the willingness to make a trip increases with the size of the establishment and is greater for the manufacturing industry than for other industries. A spatial interaction model between origin and destination pairs is also outlined and estimated. It is shown that the share of knowledge and service-handling professions in a <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>region</b> influences both the generation and attraction of interregional FTF business contacts. The empirical analysis also shows that regions with high employment shares for growing industries tend to exert a positive attraction and to some extent also a generation of business trips. As a consequence, growing regions tend to attract more business trips than similar but stagnating regions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{describe}} and analyse socio-economic changes in northern Sweden. Focus is on the period 1985 - 2000. Population development, restructuring of economic activities, political and cultural changes are related to a theoretical discussion on the transformation of sparsely populated areas as an outcome of multi-dimensional and interrelated processes. Besides an introductory and concluding section, the thesis contains four papers. The first paper deals with forestry's changed role in the local economy of four municipalities located in the inland areas of upper Norrland. The changes within forestry have been driven by adaptation to global competition and rapid technical development. Even though timber production has increased {{in some of the}} municipalities, job losses have greatly reduced the importance of forestry in the local economies. Many employees have left forestry for work in other branches, unemployment or retirement However, relatively few have moved from the area. A multiplier model was employed in order to analyse the impact on the local economy. The second paper deals with population changes in the six northernmost counties. During the 1990 s, most municipalities and rural areas in northern Sweden have experienced renewed depopulation. At the same time, some rural areas have shown significant population growth. Three types of rural areas with population growth have been identified. Firstly, there are rural areas within daily commuting distance from regional centres. Secondly, there is a group of rural areas, mainly a number of mountain villages close to the border with Norway, which has benefited from the tourist industry. Finally, there are a few rural areas characterised by attractive residential environments and leisure housing. The third paper is based on a classification of 500 residential areas and villages in the county of Västerbotten into seven types of housing environments. In this way, the county is broken down into a mosaic of housing environments characterised by very different prerequisites for consumption and economic development A complex and dispersed pattern of disadvantaged residential areas all over the county indicates the difficulty in treating counties and municipalities as homogeneous regions. In the fourth paper, focus is on young peoples' attitudes towards staying in or moving to small communities within a local <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>region</b> in northern Sweden. The study is based on telephone interviews with 400 young {{men and women in the}} Umeå region. Half the interviewees lived in the university city of Umeå while the others were residents in five rural municipalities surrounding Umeå. In general, the males and females aged 19 - 25 had a much more positive attitude towards living in rural communities than did those aged 15 - 18. Nevertheless, only half of the young people already living in the rural municipalities wanted to stay there. Among the young people living in the city, slightly less than 50 % showed an interest in moving to the surrounding rural areas, mainly the countryside within commuting distance from the city. The connection between higher education and out-migration of young people from rural areas is also highlighted. Diss. (sammanfattning) Umeå : Univ., 2002 digitalisering@um...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{coherence}} between and within functional as well as administrative <b>regions</b> in a <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> context. The larger the coherence of the local <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> within the delimited regions, the larger the heterogeneity between the delimited regions is expected to be for particular measures related to the economy and the <b>labour</b> <b>market.</b> Contrary to previous delimitation studies we test for <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> coherence. The functionally defined regions are compared with the administratively defined regions with respect to four economic indicators: (i) income level; (ii) housing prices; (iii) employment rate, and (iv) unemployment rate. It turns out that the administrative delimitation of the Netherlands performs, on average, equally well as the functional delimitation. The hypothesis that the municipalities within the administratively defined regions show less coherence than the municipalities within the functionally delimited regions, cannot be rejected. We find some minor evidence that the coherence is greater for the average income level of municipalities within functional regions than within administrative regions. It can be concluded that there is not much to be gained in <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> policies by using functional instead of administrative divisions of regional <b>labour</b> <b>markets.</b> Therefore we doubt the usefulness of other studies on functional delimitations of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>regions.</b> Finally, our results imply that it may be better for regional <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> policies not to use a highly differentiated division of regions for such a small country as the Netherlands. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} NEG {{framework}} of the Helpman model to investigate the spatial distribution of wages across German <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>regions</b> under different assumptions. As the assumptions of equal regional price level and equal real wages are strongly rejected for the German economy, standard approaches may fail to reveal the role of market access in explaining regional wage disparities. In part substantial changes occur when market potential is measured {{with the aid of}} regional price levels. With the so-called price index approach, the importance of market access in explaining regional wage differentials is clearly revealed. When controlling for heterogeneity of labour force and spatial dependence, the relationship still remains highly significant. From the price index approach, limited demand linkages of reasonable reach are inferred. New Economic Geography, market access, wage disparities, regional price levels...|$|R

In both countries, workers entering the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> in <b>regions</b> with (or periods of) tighter job competition obtain lower wages. Competition from employed job seekers has {{a negative impact on}} entry wages in both countries, while competition from unemployed job seekers has a negative impact only in Finland. Overall, the wage elasticity is larger in Great Britain than in Finland, suggesting that centralised collective bargaining might mitigate {{the impact that}} local <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> conditions have on entry wages. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeven {{years after}} the EU enlargement, when Romania and Bulgaria joined EU, {{and a year later}} that Croatia became a member country, other five South East European {{countries}} (Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Macedonia) are waiting for the membership in European Union. <b>Labour</b> <b>markets</b> of SEE must adapt to fast changes of European <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> where opportunities for life-long jobs will be very rare and job mobility will be even more intensified in the future. In order to find adequate answers to these challenges <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> in the <b>region</b> should become more market-driven. Process of transition in most of the countries of the region started nearly 25 years ago and countries in the SEE region have been trying to implement the best solutions and practices into local <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> and to move in the right direction. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to make comparison of <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> among the countries in the region of South East Europe, especially comparison of non-EU members with the <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> of Bulgaria and Romania, from the aspects of gender, age and other characteristics, and to draw the conclusions about the changes on the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> of the <b>region</b> in the last decade when it comes to the employment, unemployment and participation rates and other <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> indicators. Through implementation of principal components analysis and factor analysis changes of regional <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> in last decade were monitored and key factors were identified. Comparative analysis of <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> in the <b>region</b> was made and conclusions were drawn about differences in the case of key <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> indicators...|$|R
