5|$|There are {{at least}} 139 mammal species. Of the 16 endemic mammals, 13 are {{threatened}} and amongst the 32 threatened species include the critically endangered Malabar large-spotted civet, the endangered lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri tahr, Bengal tiger and Indian elephants, the vulnerable Indian leopard, Nilgiri <b>langur</b> and gaur.|$|E
5|$|Leopards {{are found}} in hilly areas but may also venture into the low land jungles. Small cats in the park include the jungle cat, fishing cat and leopard cat. Other mammals include barking deer, sambar deer, hog deer and chital, sloth and Himalayan black bears, Indian grey mongoose, otters, yellow-throated martens, Himalayan goral, Indian pangolins, and <b>langur</b> and rhesus macaques. Owls and nightjars can be heard during the night.|$|E
5|$|Other than feral {{dogs and}} {{domestic}} cattle, {{the most frequently}} encountered non-human mammal is the hanuman, a long tailed grey <b>langur</b> prevalent in the Gangetic plain. Some wild boars and wolves may still be spotted in the small forests of Chinpai, Bandarsol and Charicha. Leopards and bears {{are not to be}} seen any more in the wild. Sometimes during the season when mahua trees bloom, wild Asiatic elephants from Jharkhand come in trampling crops and threatening life and property. Birds of Birbhum include a mix of hilly and plain-land dwelling species like partridge, pigeon, green pigeon, water fowls, doyel, Indian robin, drongo, hawk, cuckoo, koel, sunbird, Indian roller, parrot, babbler, and some migratory birds.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{locomotor}} behaviour of white-headed <b>langurs</b> Trachypithecus leucocephalus and François’ <b>langurs</b> T. françoisi to test two hypotheses: (1) these monkeys have evolved locomotor ability {{to support their}} activities on limestone hills, and (2) François’ <b>langurs</b> have evolved more diverse locomotor skills than white-headed <b>langurs.</b> Data were collected from 1996 – 1998 and in 2005 in Fusui Nature Reserve, Guangxi, and showed that the two species had similar locomotor types, but François’ <b>langurs</b> had more locomotor modes (26) than white-headed <b>langurs</b> (12). Quadrupedal walking and leaping were two major types, and white-headed <b>langurs</b> were more arboreal than François’ <b>langurs.</b> We suggest that, while keeping their ancestral locomotor types, the two species have evolved new types allowing them to live on limestone cliffs. Compared to white-headed <b>langurs,</b> François’ <b>langurs</b> have more diverse locomotor modes that probably have allowed them to live in more habitat types. As an evolutionary outcome, François’ <b>langurs</b> have a larger distribution range [Current Zoology 55 (1) : 9 – 19, 2009]...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} growth {{patterns of}} crested <b>langurs</b> and vervet monkeys are investigated for several unilinear dimensions. Long bone lengths, trunk height, foot length, epiphyseal fusion {{of the long}} bones and the pelvis, and cranial capacity are compared through six dental growth stages in male Trachypithecus cristatus (crested <b>langurs)</b> and Cercopithecus aethiops (vervet monkeys). Results show that the body elements of crested <b>langurs</b> mature differently than those of vervets. In some dimensions, <b>langurs</b> and vervets grow comparably, in others vervets attain adult values in advance of crested <b>langurs,</b> and in one feature the <b>langurs</b> are accelerated. Several factors may explain this difference, including phylogeny, diet, ecology, and locomotion. This study proposes that locomotor requirements affect differences in somatic growth between the species...|$|R
5|$|The {{region is}} {{home to one of}} the largest populations of {{endangered}} Indian elephant and Bengal Tiger in India. Elephant populations are found in eight fragmented sites in South India; in northern Karnataka, along the Western Ghats, in Bhadra–Malnad, in Brahmagiri–Nilgiris–Eastern Ghats, in Nilambur–Silent Valley–Coimbatore, in Anamalai–Parambikulam, in Periyar–Srivilliputhur and Agasthyamalai The region {{is home to}} one-third of the tiger population {{and more than half of}} the elephant population of India. There are 14 Project Tiger reserves and 11 Project Elephant reserves in the region. Other threatened and endangered species found in the region include grizzled giant squirrel, grey slender loris, sloth bear, nilgiri tahr, nilgiri <b>langur,</b> lion-tailed macaque, and Indian leopard.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Trachypithecus should be considered only a subgenus of Semnopithecus. If maintaining the two as separate monophyletic genera, the purple-faced <b>langur</b> and Nilgiri <b>langur</b> belong in Semnopithecus instead of the usual Trachypithecus. At present it is unclear where the T. pileatus species group (consisting of the capped <b>langur,</b> Shortridge's <b>langur</b> and Gee's golden <b>langur)</b> belongs, as available mtDNA data place it in Semnopithecus, while Y chromosome data place it in Trachypithecus.|$|E
25|$|Gray langurs have stable {{populations in}} some areas and declining ones in others. Both the black-footed gray <b>langur</b> and Kashmir gray <b>langur</b> are {{considered}} threatened. The latter is the rarest species of gray <b>langur,</b> with less than 250 mature individuals remaining.|$|E
25|$|<b>Langurs</b> can {{be found}} near roads and can become victims of {{automobile}} accidents. This happens even in protected areas, with deaths by automobile collisions making {{nearly a quarter of}} mortality in Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary in Rajasthan, India. <b>Langurs</b> are considered sacred in the Hindu religion and are sometimes kept for religious purposes by Hindu priests and for roadside performances. However, some religious groups use <b>langurs</b> as food and medicine, and parts of gray <b>langurs</b> are sometimes kept as amulets for good luck.|$|R
50|$|Intergeneric hybrids {{are known}} to occur within the Colobinae subfamily. In India, gray <b>langurs</b> (Semnopithecus spp.) {{are known to}} {{hybridize}} with Nilgiri <b>langurs</b> (Trachypithecus johnii).|$|R

25|$|Distribution and {{demography}} of all diurnal primates {{were studied}} in Silent Valley National Park and adjacent areas {{for a period}} of three years from 1993 to 1996. Fourteen troops of lion-tailed macaque, eighty-five troops of Nilgiri <b>langur,</b> fifteen troops of bonnet macaque and seven troops of Hanuman <b>langur</b> were observed. Of these, the Nilgiri <b>langur</b> was randomly distributed, whereas the lion-tailed macaque troops were confined to the southern sector of the Park. Bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs were occasional visitors. The Silent Valley forest {{remains one of the most}} undisturbed viable habitats left for the endemic and endangered primates lion-tailed macaque and Nilgiri <b>langur.</b>|$|E
25|$|The entire {{distribution}} of all gray <b>langur</b> species stretches from the Himalayas {{in the north}} to Sri Lanka in the south, and from Bangladesh in the east to Pakistan in the west. They possibly occur in Afghanistan. The bulk of the gray <b>langur</b> distribution is within India, and all seven currently recognized species {{have at least a}} part of their range in this country.|$|E
25|$|The primate house {{includes}} some unique endangered primate species like the lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri <b>langur,</b> capped <b>langur</b> and chimpanzee. The park {{is also the}} National Studbook Keeper for the endangered lion-tailed macaque, nominated by the CZA. With the successful execution of the Co-ordinated Captive Breeding Programme (CCBP), the park accounts for around 36 percent of lion-tailed macaques in the country's zoos as of 2011.|$|E
40|$|Phayre’s leaf-monkeys (Trachipithecus phayrei) or Phayre’s <b>langurs</b> are {{old world}} monkeys that inhabit South-East Asian {{tropical}} forests. The species is under a severe threat due to large scale habitat destruction and disturbances by people living near the habitat of <b>langurs.</b> The present study recorded the aggressive behavior of male <b>langurs</b> towards domestic dogs in the Cachar district of Assam. Response of each member in the troop was observed. The sophisticated behavior of males in safeguarding the weaker members was observed. In conclusion, the harassment by domestic dogs may result in the expulsion of Phayre’s <b>langurs</b> from their native habitat...|$|R
50|$|Mostly folivorous, tufted gray <b>langurs</b> are fond {{of eating}} {{anything}} vegetarian. They are known to eat fruits and seeds. <b>Langurs</b> are differ from leaf monkeys, where latter is known to eat mature, fleshy fruits, and <b>langurs</b> are like to eat partially drier fibrous fruits. The leaves of Drypetes sepiaria, Dimocarpus longan, Ficus microcarpa, Holoptelea integrifolia, and fruits and seeds of Hydnocarpus venenata, Ficus arnottiana, Macaranga peltata are known to eat by Sri Lankan subspecies.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out on one group each of lion-tailed macaques and Nilgiri <b>langurs</b> living as {{sympatric}} groups in a rainforest in Anaimalai Hills, Western Ghats, south India. Whereas the lion-tailed macaques {{were found to be}} frugivorous/ insectivorous, the Nilgiri <b>langurs</b> were primarily folivorous. Fruit was the only shared component in the diet of the two species. The lion-tailed macaques occupied a higher substratum than the Nilgiri <b>langurs</b> not only for their routine activities, but also for overall feeding and fruit feeding. The presence of lion-tailed macaques resulted in further lowering the feeding substratum and increased passivity in Nilgiri <b>langurs.</b> Food specialization and vertical stratification differentiate the niches of these two sympatric species...|$|R

The park is also home to exotic species such as the Australian flightless bird species of emu and cassowary. The park contains about 138 plant species, including cashew and eucalyptus. The dense vegetation of the park supports about 56 species of butterfly.|$|E
25|$|Gray langurs or Hanuman langurs, {{the most}} {{widespread}} langurs of the Indian Subcontinent, are a group of Old World monkeys constituting {{the entirety of the}} genus Semnopithecus (from Ancient Greek σεμνός semnós, “revered, august, holy”, and πίθηκος píthēkos, “ape, monkey”). All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri <b>langur</b> and purple-faced <b>langur,</b> which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Langurs</b> mostly walk quadrupedally {{and spend}} half {{their time on}} the ground and the other half in the trees.

25|$|Because {{of their}} sacred status and their less {{aggressive}} behavior {{compared to other}} primates, <b>langurs</b> are generally not considered pests {{in many parts of}} India. Nevertheless, secularization seems to have somewhat changed such attitudes. <b>Langurs</b> will raid crops and steal food from houses, and this causes people to persecute them. While people may feed them in temples, they do not extend such care to monkey at their homes. <b>Langurs</b> stealing and biting people to get food in urban areas may also contribute to more persecutions.|$|R

25|$|Excessive {{exploitation}} of rare wood such as go mun wood (Diospyros spp.) and go huế wood (Dalbergia rimosa) and oils from trees such as Cinnamomum balansea, rattan has cause an exhaustion {{of these plants}} {{in many areas of}} the park. Bat population in caves and grottos also face disturbance by human activities. Hồ Chí Minh Highway, Road 20 crossing the edge zone and the connection road linking these two roads crossing the core zone also contribute danger to the wildlife in this national park, especially populations of Hatinh <b>langur</b> and black <b>langur.</b> During the construction of this road, blasts and other activities kept several primates away from their regular habitat.|$|E
25|$|The {{gestation}} period of gray <b>langur</b> lasts around 200 days, {{at least at}} Jodhpur, India. In some areas, reproduction is year-around. Year-round reproduction appears to occur in populations that capitalize on human-made foods. Other populations have seasonal reproduction.|$|E

We set out to observe douc <b>langurs</b> directly in the wild to quantify the diet during wet and dry seasons. We confirmed that the species relies on foliage throughout the year, but it includes significant proportions of fruit and flowers in its diet when those items are available. The douc <b>langurs</b> selected various parts from 152 species of plants in 2 national parks, but there {{did not appear to be}} favorite species that were heavily selected over others. In both the wet and dry seasons, the black-shanked douc <b>langurs</b> ate mostly leaves, but the diversity of plants consumed increased and the proportion of fruit eaten almost doubled in the wet season.
