5000|$|On May 26, 2009, a {{new feature}} called [...] "Money Meter" [...] was {{introduced}} {{at the end}} of GSN Live, the same day the current set was introduced. The Jackpot starts at $500, the Money Meter Jackpot increased every time the games were played when the players are online at GSN.com and <b>logging-on</b> from their personal account at GSN.com. When a caller is chosen to play Money Meter, a question is asked by the host. Once after the host finishes asking a question and the multiple-choice answers, a caller has five seconds to answer the question. If a caller is wrong or run out of time, the money meter stays for thenext three hours (six hours until October 9, 2009) of GSN Live the next day.

By April 2010, however, the Weekly Money Meter was gone.|$|E

With creativity, a person can eat, work, reproduce, play, shop, and sleep without taking a step. The articles in this issue of Diabetes by Højbjerre et al.
