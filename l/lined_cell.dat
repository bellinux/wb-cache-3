40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the role of bone <b>lining</b> <b>cells</b> in the coordination of bone resorption and formation. Ultrastructural analysis of mouse long bones and calvariae revealed that bone <b>lining</b> <b>cells</b> enwrap and subsequently digest collagen fibrils protruding from Howship's lacunae that are left by osteoclasts. By using selective proteinase inhibitors we show that this digestion depends on matrix metalloproteinases and, to some extent, on serine proteinases. Autoradiography revealed that after the bone <b>lining</b> <b>cells</b> have finished cleaning, they deposit {{a thin layer of}} a collagenous matrix along the Howship's lacuna, in close association with an osteopontin-rich cement line. Collagenous matrix deposition was detected only in completely cleaned pits. In bone from pycnodysostotic patients and cathepsin K-deficient mice, conditions in which osteoclastic bone matrix digestion is greatly inhibited, bone matrix leftovers proved to be degraded by bone <b>lining</b> <b>cells,</b> thus indicating that the bone <b>lining</b> <b>cell</b> "rescues" bone remodeling in these anomalies.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Cell</b> <b>lines</b> {{have been}} widely used in {{biomedical}} research. The community-based <b>Cell</b> <b>Line</b> Ontology (CLO) {{is a member of the}} OBO Foundry library that covers the domain of <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Since its publication two years ago, significant updates have been made, including new groups joining the CLO consortium, new <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> <b>cells,</b> upper level alignment with the Cell Ontology (CL) and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigation, and logical extensions. Construction and content Collaboration among the CLO, CL, and OBI has established consensus definitions of cell line-specific terms such as ‘cell line’, ‘cell line cell’, ‘cell line culturing’, and ‘mortal’ vs. ‘immortal <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> cell’. A <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> is a genetically stable cultured cell population that contains individual <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> <b>cells.</b> The hierarchical structure of the CLO is built based on the hierarchy of the in vivo cell types defined in CL and tissue types (from which <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> <b>cells</b> are derived) defined in the UBERON cross-species anatomy ontology. The new hierarchical structure makes it easier to browse, query, and perform automated classification. We have recently added classes representing more than 2, 000 <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> <b>cells</b> from the RIKEN BRC Cell Bank to CLO. Overall, the CLO now contains ~ 38, 000 classes of specific <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> <b>cells</b> derived from over 200 in vivo cell types from various organisms. Utility and discussion The CLO has been applied to different biomedical research studies. Example case studies include annotation and analysis of EBI ArrayExpress data, bioassays, and host-vaccine/pathogen interaction. CLO’s utility goes beyond a catalogue of <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> types. The alignment of the CLO with related ontologies combined with the use of ontological reasoners will support sophisticated inferencing to advance translational informatics development...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The {{distribution}} {{and production of}} {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) was examined on the synovium from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS [...] The localisation of bFGF was determined by an immunohistochemical staining procedure using anti-bFGF monoclonal antibody. The expression of bFGF mRNA was detected by nonradioactive in situ hybridisation using bFGF antisense oligo DNA. RESULTS [...] The bFGF was found in the synovial <b>lining</b> <b>cell,</b> sublining stromal fibroblast-like cells, and vascular endothelial cells from patients with RA and OA. Little or no bFGF was found in non-inflamed synovium. Immunostaining of bFGF in the synovial cells was more extensive and intense in synovium of patients with RA than that of patients with OA.

No cells adhered to dishes after 72 h incubation at this temperature. Using a plaque assay technique, CHSE 114, CHSE 214, SSE 5, STE 137, and RTH 149 <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were susceptible to IHNV and IPNV. The CSE 119 <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> was found to be unsuitable for use in plaque assays. Both control and virus-infected CSE 119 cell monolayers developed plaques similar to those produced by viruses. Attempts at cloning CHSE 214, CSE 119, STE 137, and RTH 149 <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were futile. <b>Cells</b> would not grow at low densities required for cloning...|$|R
50|$|Walter Nelson-Rees (11 January 1929 - 23 January 2009) was a {{cell culture}} worker and {{cytogeneticist}} who helped expose {{the problem of}} cross-contamination of <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> He used chromosome banding to show that many immortal <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> previously thought to be unique, were actually HeLa <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> The HeLa <b>cells</b> had contaminated and overgrown the other <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
40|$|Twenty three human {{mononuclear}} <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> including ten myelomonocytic <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> eight B <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> {{and five}} T <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> were examined {{to determine whether}} they could be infected with dengue- 2 virus. All the <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were infected with dengue- 2 virus as determined by immunofluorescent staining and by virus titration of culture supernatant fluids. K 562, Jiyoye and Jurkat, respectively, showed the highest percentage of infected cells of these myelomonocytic, B and T <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Antibody to dengue- 2 virus at subneutralizing concentrations augmented dengue- 2 virus infection of myelomonocytic <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> but not of B <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> or of T <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Persistent dengue- 2 virus infection was established using a myelomonocytic <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> (K 562), a B <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> (Raji), and a T <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> (HSB- 2). These <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> maintained a high percentage (more than 70 %) of dengue- 2 virus antigen-positive cells for at least 25 weeks. Very low titers of infectious dengue- 2 virus were detected in the culture supernatant fluids of the persistently infected cells. Dengue- 2 virus antigen-positive Raji cell clones were established from persistently-infected Raji cells using limiting dilutions and all of the cells in these clones were dengue- 2 virus antigen-positive. These findings demonstrate that a variety of human mononuclear <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> can be infected with dengue- 2 virus and may be useful as models for the analysis of dengue virus-human cell interactions in dengue virus infections...|$|R
