40|$|Abstract Introduction In general, ocular {{complications}} of hematologic malignancies such as leukemia are well documented. However, reports of ocular involvement in such diseases as <b>lymphomatoid</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> and {{chronic myelomonocytic leukemia}} are uncommon. Here we present cases of these two relatively rare hematologic malignancies demonstrating clinical and subclinical ocular involvement. Case Presentation In the first case, a 54 -year-old man with a previous diagnosis of <b>lymphomatoid</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> presented with a new-onset conjunctival lesion while his systemic disease {{was thought to be}} in remission. A biopsy was taken that revealed heavy infiltrates of B and T cells {{at the site of the}} lesion. Molecular analysis confirmed that these cells were positive for both Epstein-Barr viral DNA and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, consistent with a manifestation of his systemic disease. In the second case, a 51 -year-old man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia died after a waxing and waning clinical course. Post-mortem studies revealed the presence of atypical monocytes in the choroidal and subretinal spaces, consistent with his previous diagnosis. Conclusion While ocular involvement in hematologic malignancies is not uncommon, these two cases describe involvement of the eye by two relatively rare neoplasms. We herein emphasize novel findings in each case, including conjunctival involvement as the first sign of recurrent <b>lymphomatoid</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> and the combination of subretinal and choroidal myelomonocytic leukemic infiltration. With the evolution of new antineoplastic therapies that may prolong life, these cases exemplify the importance of eye care in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies. </p...|$|E

40|$|A case of <b>lymphomatoid</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> of {{the lung}} is {{described}} in which the presenting features were a skin eruption and peripheral neuropathy.

This combination of clinical and pathological findings is in every detail that of <b>lymphomatoid</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> as recently identified by Liebow et al. (1972). Additional, previously undescribed, and unexplained findings in this case were persistent hypercalciuria and the presence in three axillary lymph nodes of subcapsular groups of cells resembling those of a benign naevus.
