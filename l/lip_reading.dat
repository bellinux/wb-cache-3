25|$|Entwistle was {{notorious for}} the {{extremely}} high volume {{at which he}} played bass, {{going so far as}} to rig pick-ups to each string on his instruments. This led to him developing hearing loss, similar to Townshend. Although not as public about his problems as Townshend, he reputedly had to rely on <b>lip</b> <b>reading</b> to understand speech in his later years. Randy Bachman of Bachman-Turner Overdrive claimed that towards the end of his life, Entwistle mostly played by feeling the rush of air from his giant amp stacks.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} psychologists {{conducted}} a study to test the McGurk effect with Aphasia patients and speech reading. The subjects watched dubbed videos in which the audio and visual did not match. Then after they completed {{the first part of}} the experiment, the experimenters taught the aphasic patients to speech read, which is the ability to read lips. The experimenters then conducted the same test and found that the people still had more of an advantage of audio only over visual only, but they also found that the subjects did better in audio-visual than audio alone. The patients also did improve their place of articulation and their manner of articulation. This all means that aphasic patients might benefit from learning how to speech read (<b>lip</b> <b>reading).</b>|$|E

25|$|To {{be defined}} as bilingual, an {{individual}} need not have perfect fluency or equal skill in both languages. Bimodal bilinguals, like oral-language bilinguals, exhibit {{a wide range of}} language competency in their first and second languages. For Deaf people (the majority of bimodal bilinguals in the U.S.), level of competency in ASL and English may be influenced by factors such as degree of hearing loss, whether the individual is prelingually or post-lingually deaf, style of and language used in their education, and whether the individual comes from a hearing or Deaf family. Regardless of English competency in other areas, no Deaf individual is likely to comprehend English {{in the same way as}} a hearing person when others are speaking it because only a small percentage of English phonemes are clearly visible through <b>lip</b> <b>reading.</b> Additionally, many Deaf bilinguals who have fluency in written English choose not to speak it because of the general social unacceptability of their voices, or because they are unable to monitor factors like pitch and volume.|$|E
500|$|Numerous parodies of [...] "Friday" [...] {{have been}} {{uploaded}} to YouTube and become viral {{in their own}} right.

500|$|Among {{his other}} reforms, Covell {{undertook}} {{to modernize the}} facilities of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind by urging the state to install gas lighting and to install plumbing {{for the purposes of}} providing tap water. In addition to the school's infrastructure, Covell overhauled the school's levels of comprehension in 1875 by introducing a classification system in which students were arranged in grades. Covell also introduced the tradition of publishing biennial reports, then annual reports, which have continued to be released every year since 1876. In 1877, at Covell's recommendation, the schools' board established the Department of Visible Speech in which deaf-mute students were instructed in the manner of articulation and <b>lip</b> <b>reading.</b>|$|E
500|$|Eighteen months later, the United States {{spacecraft}} Discovery One {{is bound}} for Jupiter. On board are mission pilots and scientists Dr. David Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole, {{along with three}} other scientists in suspended animation. Most of Discoverys operations are controlled by the ship's computer, HAL 9000, referred to by the crew as [...] "Hal". Hal states that he is [...] "foolproof and incapable of error". Hal raises concerns {{about the nature of}} the mission to Bowman, which the latter ignores. Hal then reports the imminent failure of an antenna control device. The astronauts retrieve it in an extravehicular activity (EVA) pod but find nothing wrong. Hal suggests reinstalling the device and letting it fail so the problem can be found. Mission Control advises the astronauts that results from their twin HAL 9000 indicate that Hal is in error. Hal insists that the problem, like previous issues ascribed to HAL series units, is due to human error. Concerned about Hal's behavior, Bowman and Poole enter an EVA pod to talk without Hal overhearing, and agree to disconnect Hal if he is proven wrong. Hal secretly follows their conversation by <b>lip</b> <b>reading.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The most {{sophisticated}} {{of these devices}} is the cochlear implant, which can sometimes restore {{a high level of}} auditory function even when natural hearing is totally lost. However, the amount of destruction to the cochlear nerve caused by the typical NF2 schwannoma often precludes the use of such an implant. In these cases, an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) can restore a primitive level of hearing, which, when supplemented by <b>lip</b> <b>reading,</b> can restore a functional understanding of spoken language.|$|E

50|$|The lips {{serve for}} {{creating}} different sounds—mainly labial, bilabial, and labiodental consonant sounds {{as well as}} vowel rounding—and thus {{are an important part}} of the speech apparatus.

Key words: visual perception, exercises, communicative-orientated education Visual perception of the verbal speech called also <b>reading,</b> <b>reading</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>reading</b> eyes, transcription from <b>lips,</b> <b>reading</b> face and etc. is a very complicated process, which recodes acoustic code to optical one. Alyh (1977) calls Kinemes /movements, through which sounds are optically differentiated and are analogous to the acoustic phonemes. Kinemes are perceived visually thanks to {{the movements of the}} visual articulating organs and especially lips / open, set one to other, stretched in a trunk or smile position and etc. The conditional segmentation of the otherwise unified and complex process of the visual perception of the verbal speech allows outlining of its basic components:- kinaesthetic stimulation by reflective repetition of verbal movements;- information transmission along nerve routes to the brain;- processing and understanding of the visually perceived speech.

2500|$|Morgan {{learned and}} became quite {{competent}} in <b>lip</b> <b>reading,</b> but was never {{comfortable with the}} inaccuracy and ambiguity of the method. His friends noted that he could speak quite clearly but typically chose {{not to do so}} unless among people he knew well. Deafness gave him no way to regulate his voice and his conversation was locked in a high-pitched monotone. Instead he typically turned to communicating in writing, carrying on personal conversations with the use of note cards, the backs of letters, scratch paper, and other handy paper. Archivist and historiographer Gary Topping noted that [...] "...because Morgan’s deafness shifted his communication with the external world entirely to the written world, his world became a literary world, and the long hours of practice with the written world turned him into a virtuosos of English prose {{in the same way that}} musical practice produces virtuosity." [...] (p.118) As an adult his publication manuscripts exhibit heavy revisions and editing, while his letters flow through his manual typewriters and onto paper as seemingly seamless compositions, almost without typographic error.|$|E

2500|$|APD can {{manifest}} as problems {{determining the}} direction of sounds, difficulty perceiving differences between speech sounds and the sequencing of these sounds into meaningful words, confusing similar sounds such as [...] "hat" [...] with [...] "bat", [...] "there" [...] with [...] "where", etc. [...] Fewer words may be perceived than were actually said, as there can be problems detecting the gaps between words, creating the sense that someone is speaking unfamiliar or nonsense words. Those suffering from APD may have problems relating what has been said with its meaning, despite obvious recognition that a word has been said, as well as repetition of the word. [...] Background noise, such {{as the sound of}} a radio, television or a noisy bar can make it difficult to impossible to understand speech, since spoken words may sound distorted either into irrelevant words or words that don't exist, depending on the severity of the auditory processing disorder. Using a telephone can be problematic for someone with auditory processing disorder, in comparison with someone with normal auditory processing, due to low quality audio, poor signal, intermittent sounds and the chopping of words. Many who have auditory processing disorder subconsciously develop visual coping strategies, such as <b>lip</b> <b>reading,</b> reading body language, and eye contact, to compensate for their auditory deficit, and these coping strategies are not available when using a telephone.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lip</b> <b>reading</b> is a {{multimodal}} {{process for}} humans. By watching movements of lips and face, humans get conditioned and practice <b>lip</b> <b>reading.</b> Silent <b>lip</b> <b>reading</b> activates the auditory cortex.

40|$|For {{hearing and}} deaf people, speech {{perception}} involves an integrative process between auditory and <b>lip</b> <b>read</b> information. In order to disambiguate information from lips, manual cue may be added (Cued Speech). We examined how audio-visual integration {{is affected by}} the presence of manual cues. To address this issue, we designed an original experiment using audio-visual McGurk stimuli produced with manual cues. The manual cue was either congruent with auditory information, lip information or with the expected fusion. Our results suggest that manual cues can modify the audio-visual integration, and that their impact depends on auditory status. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
