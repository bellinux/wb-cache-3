During the programme the presenter John Lloyd observed that Kees Moeliker {{did not have an}} English language Wikipedia page but only a Dutch language one. Lloyd went on to state: [...] "We're going to make one about you for the English Wikipedia". Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, who was also a guest on the programme, replied that that was unnecessary because Wikipedians listen to the show and he predicted that an English <b>language</b> <b>page</b> for Kees Moeliker would be created before the airing of the programme had finished. Approximately 8 minutes later, and 7 minutes before the programme finished being aired, the first version of the page had been submitted.|$|E

40|$|The ScriptSource website is {{designed}} to be an authoritative source of information on the world’s scripts, characters and languages, and the relationships between them. The site presents substantial core data, including more than 200 script pages, 100, 000 character pages and 7, 000 language pages. Each <b>language</b> <b>page</b> on ScriptSource contains information about which scripts can be used to write the language, with links to the corresponding language pages on at least five other linguistic websites. Software entries provide details of fonts and keyboards which work for the language. Registered users can contribute information in the form of entries, which are moderated. The demonstration will reveal the wealth of information to be found on ScriptSource, and will show how language information can easily be entered, and associated with other information on the site, to make ScriptSource a valuable aid to language documentation. An interface to enter the character lists for a language is already in place and will be included in the demo; a phonemic data interface is currently under development. An increasing number of links to other language sites, such as the Aboriginal Languages of Australia site, underline the usefulness of ScriptSource as a hub for language documentation...|$|E
