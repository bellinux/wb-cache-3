25|$|Social psychologists {{therefore}} {{deal with}} the factors that <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> behave in a given way {{in the presence of}} others, and look at the conditions under which certain behavior/actions and feelings occur.

25|$|A (topological) {{surface is}} a topological {{space in which}} every point has an open {{neighbourhood}} homeomorphic to some open subset of the Euclidean plane E2. Such a neighborhood, together with the corresponding homeomorphism, {{is known as a}} (coordinate) chart. It is through this chart that the neighborhood inherits the standard coordinates on the Euclidean plane. These coordinates are known as local coordinates and these homeomorphisms <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> describe surfaces as being locally Euclidean.|$|E

Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of decoding, or factorizing in {{a single}} way, biinfinite words with a finitary {{language}} <b>leads</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> consider two distinct notions of factorization for biinfinite words. For one of these notions, requiring singleness of decoding periodic biinfinite words <b>leads</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> study circular codes. The other notion <b>leads</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> define the new notion of precircular codes. Precircular codes are defined and analyzed. The family of precircular codes is compared {{to the family of}} circular codes and to the family of almost circular codes. The structure of two-element precircular codes is determined. Codes and precircular codes are characterized by their way of acting upon periodic biinfinite words...|$|R

The reasons why some are skeptical is 1) it may prevent us with coming to terms with trauma, 2) tamper with our identities and <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> a false sense of happiness, 3) demean the genuineness of human life, 4) encourage some to forget memories they are obligated to keep, and 5) inure us to the pain of others. Whether or not it is ethical to fully or partially erase the memory of a patient, it is certainly becoming a more relevant topic as this technology improves in our society.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E

[...] (305) Despite the increased popularity of {{the use of the term}} [...] "sustainability", the possibility that human societies will achieve environmental sustainability has been, and continues to be, questioned—in light of environmental degradation, climate change, overconsumption, population growth and societies' pursuit of unlimited economic growth in a closed system.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, Rilke {{is one of}} {{the more}} popular, best-selling poets—along with thirteenth-century Sufi mystic Rumi (1207–1273), and 20th century Lebanese-American poet Kahlil Gibran (1883–1931). In popular culture, Rilke is {{frequently}} quoted or referenced in television programs, motion pictures, music and other works when these works discuss the subject of love or angels. Because of his work being described as [...] "mystical," [...] Rilke's works have also been appropriated for use by the New Age community and in self-help books.

500|$|The {{convection}} diminished {{while the}} hurricane accelerated toward the New Jersey coast, due to it becoming {{involved with the}} low to the west. The pressure continued to drop, which indicated the system was intensifying because of baroclinic instability. In an advisory issued by the NHC late on October29, the NHC noted that, [...] "all of these considerations <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> conclude that the most appropriate classification at advisory time is extratropical." [...] The agency declared Sandy a post-tropical cyclone at about 2100UTC that afternoon, while located just offshore southern New Jersey. About 2 1/2 hours later, the storm made landfall approximately 5mi (8km) northeast of Atlantic City near Brigantine. The intensity at landfall was estimated at 80mph (130km/h), although the strongest winds were located offshore, east and southeast of the center.|$|E
500|$|Theodor W. Adorno's Jargon of Authenticity (1964) {{suggested}} that the poems are essentially evil: [...] "The fact that the neoromantic lyric sometimes behaves like the jargon , or at least timidly readies the way for it, should not <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> look for the evil of the poetry simply in its form. It is not simply grounded, as a much too innocent view might maintain, in the mixture of poetry and prose. The evil, in the neoromantic lyric, consists in the fitting out of the words with a theological overtone, which is belied by {{the condition of the}} lonely and secular subject who is speaking there: religion as ornament." [...] Adorno further believed the poems reinforced the German value of commitment that supported a cultural attraction towards the principles of Nazism.|$|E
