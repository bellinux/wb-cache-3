40|$|Intraday {{liquidity}} risk {{is a subject}} that applies to all banks, and arises whenever there is a timing mismatch between incoming and outgoing payments within a business day. In case such a mismatch occurs, the bank is exposed to the risk that it is unable to meet its payment obligations at the time expected. A <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffer</b> could help to mitigate this risk. This thesis presents a framework for intraday {{liquidity risk}} management within ABN AMRO Bank, while taking different priorities of transactions into account. We examine the use of extreme value theory (EVT) and propose two metrics to capture the risk: the univariate and multivariate risk metric. The univariate risk metric represents {{the size of the}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffer</b> for each priority group separately and provides granular view. Making use of a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm in combination with univariate EVT, we are able to estimate the size of the <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffer</b> for a specified time interval within a business day. We forecast the buffer size 30 days out-of-sample and test the violations against the conditional coverage (CC) hypothesis. Satisfactory results are obtained for the groups with high and moderate priority when the highest confidence levels are considered: α = 0. 1 and 0. 05. For the group with low priority, the risk metric performs well for the lowest confidence levels: α = 0. 025 and 0. 01. The multivariate risk metrics aggregates the size of the <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffer,</b> while taking the diversification of the priority groups into account.

Nevertheless, banks only prefer holding liquidity buffers to weather future crises if the ex-ante crisis probability exceeds a certain threshold.

40|$|For central banks, {{monitoring}} banks’ {{liquidity risk}} {{is of great}} importance from a financial stability perspective. One essential gauge for assessing liquidity risk exposure is whether banks have sufficient <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffers</b> to survive a potential unexpected funding crisis. In this article, we aim to assess the resilience of Hungarian banks to liquidity shocks by using a liquidity stress test. The test {{is based on a}} hypothetical stress scenario involving a bank-specific liquidity shock, triggered by a confidence crisis,for example. The shock absorbing capacity of a bank is measured by the maximum degree of liquidity shock the bank can withstand over the short run on the strength of its liquid assets. On the basis {{of the results of the}} stress test it is believed that the current liquidity risks essentially do not pose a threat to financial stability. As for large banks, with the overwhelming part of customer deposits, the current <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffers</b> would typically enable the maintenance of liquidity even under extreme circumstances. It should be noted, however, that Hungarian banks are increasingly exposed to fluctuations in global liquidity and that intra-group financing relations may represent a contagion channel. Therefore, in the future, the study of these risk scenarios may be important in further developing stress testing practices for both the central bank and commercial banks. bank liquidity, liquidity risk, stress testing. ...|$|R

Studies of LDC credit markets {{from this point of view}} seem to be scanty and this paper attempts to address this lacuna.

We develop VECM models in the Indian context (for the period April 1991 - December 2004 using monthly data) to analyse salient features of the credit market. An analysis of the ECMs (error-correction mechanisms) reveals that disequilibrium in the Indian credit market is adjusted via demand responses rather than supply responses, which is in accordance with the customer view of credit markets. Further light on the working of the model is obtained through the "generalized" impulse responses and "generalized" error decompositions (both of which are independent of the variable ordering).

40|$|Link to {{the latest}} version] To {{investigate}} the social cost of fire sales, I build a banking model a ̀ la Diamond and Dybvig in which an aggregate liquidity shock hits consumers preferences before asset returns are realized. Banks can sell assets to mutual funds when this shock is too high to pay the depositors hit by the shock. The wealth of the buyers of assets, the mutual funds, results from a portfolio allocation by households between bank deposits and mutual funds shares. I identify one combination of imperfections that {{gives rise to a}} pecuniary externality implying a welfare loss: an asymmetry of information between banks and depositors regarding depositors ’ liquidity needs on top of an incomplete market feature. Distortions lay both in the banks ’ choice, between assets and reserves, and in the households ’ choice, between bank deposits and mutual funds shares. High liquidity shock triggers bank default for low level of funds wealth. The price then falls below the fundamental value at a cash-in-the-market value. As banks do not realize that such a fire sale situation might occur, they do not optimally insure depositors against the idiosyncratic liquidity risk. It implies both an ex ante and an ex post welfare loss. Whereas efficiency would require banks to keep a <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffer,</b> they do not keep enough reserves and invest too much in assets.

The model further relies on simulations to generate <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffer</b> losses for both a non-crisis and crisis period as well. The emerging economy {{is represented by}} South Africa (SA) and the developed economy by the United Kingdom (henceforth UK). The Liquidity Stress Tester model (LST) has been successfully applied to both the Dutch and UK markets in previous research. The model's flexibility and adaptability allows it to assess different banking systems and different reactions (buffer restoration and leverage targeting) of participants within these milieus. The LST considers feedback effects arising from bank reactions and allows {{for the assessment of}} severely stressed haircuts and systemic risk increases caused by reputation degradation and increased contagion from other banks. Losses stemming from the second round effects of a liquidity event are explored through the reactions conducted by banks in the banking system. The study conducts a review of liquidity risk models utilised in previous research. Characteristics of these models and the data they used are highlighted, shedding light on the advantages and shortcomings of these models. Possible restrictions in liquidity risk management are also explored. The study discusses the relevance of the South African/UK economies' comparison, as well as the selected periods chosen for investigation. To assist further research with the LST, the study illustrates and discusses how it is modelled and developed in Microsoft Office Excel. The results obtained illustrate the potential severity of second round feedback effects of a liquidity event on liquidity positions in banks. The effects of mitigating actions conducted by banking institutions reacting to initial liquidity stress shocks are explored, as well as the way these actions could potentially affect second round effects on banks. The analysis and discussion of simulated results attempts to isolate and identify characteristics of economies and periods used that may have contributed to specific liquidity events. The study concludes with a summary of the research and suggestions for possible future work and development using the LST. Master...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the 2007 - 08 financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed two liquidity standards to reinforce banks’ resilience to liquidity risks. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the impact of liquidity regulation on bank behavior. The first of four main chapters analyzes the development of global liquidity standards, their objectives {{as well as their}} interaction with capital standards. The analysis suggests that regulating capital is associated with declining <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffers.</b> The interaction of liquidity regulation and monetary policy, the view that regulating capital also addresses liquidity risks as well as a lack of supervisory momentum were important factors hampering the harmonization of liquidity regulation. Chapter 3 takes a wide view on the impact of liquidity regulation on banks' liquidity management. The key question is whether the presence of liquidity regulation substitutes banks' incentives to hold liquid assets. The cross-country analysis suggests that most bank-specific and country-specific determinants of banks’ <b>liquidity</b> <b>buffers</b> are substituted by liquidity regulation while a bank's disclosure requirements become more important. The complementary nature of disclosure and liquidity requirements provides a strong rationale for considering them jointly in the design of regulation. Chapter 4 zooms in on one of the key questions regarding the interaction of the LCR with monetary policy transmission. The analysis shows that a liquidity requirement causes short-term and long-term interest rates as well as demand for long-term loans to increase. However, banks do not seem able to pass on the increased funding costs in the interbank market to their private sector clients. Rather, a liquidity requirement seems to decrease banks' interest margins, which might require central banks to use a representative real economy interest rate as additional target for monetary policy implementation. Chapter 5 is motivated by the European sovereign debt crisis and analyzes the impact of preferential regulatory treatment on banks’ demand for government bonds. The analysis suggests that preferential treatment in liquidity and capital regulation increases banks' demand for government bonds beyond their own risk appetite. Liquidity and capital regulation also seem to incentivize banks to substitute other bonds with government bonds. The thesis concludes with an epilogue on liquidity stress testing...|$|R
