5000|$|Wehner is {{a staunch}} critic of Donald Trump; he joined many Republican figures who {{announced}} {{that they would not}} vote for Trump. In a January 2016 column in the New York Times entitled [...] "Why I Will Never Vote for Donald Trump," [...] Wehner wrote that if Trump was the Republican nominee and Hillary Clinton the Democratic nominee, [...] "I would prefer to vote for a responsible third-party alternative; absent that option, I would simply not cast a ballot for president. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republicans,</b> I suspect, would do the same." [...] In another Times op-ed in July 2016, Wehner wrote that Trump [...] "embodies a Nietzschean morality rather than a Christian one," [...] writing that Trump is [...] "characterized by indifference to objective truth (there are no facts, only interpretations), the repudiation of Christian concern for the poor and the weak, and disdain for the powerless." [...] He also wrote: [...] "it {{is fair to say that}} there existed in the Republican Party repulsive elements, people who were attracted to racial and ethnic politics and moved by resentment and intolerance rather than a vision of the good. This group was larger than I ever imagined, and at important moments the Republican Party either overlooked them or played to them. Some may have been hoping to appeal to these elements while also containing and moderating them, to sand off the rough edges, to keep them within the coalition but not allow them to become dominant. But the opposite happened. The party guests took over the party." [...] A day after Trump was inaugurated as president, Wehner authored a column in the New York Times in which he expressed doubt that Trump would govern well, a prediction that he claims came true in a column he wrote a day after Trump fired of FBI Director James Comey after Comey asked for additional resources in investigating the Russian interference. In July 2017, Wehner wrote, [...] "Republican voters and politicians rallied around Mr. Trump in 2016, believing he was anti-establishment when in fact he was anti-order. He turns out to be an institutional arsonist. It is an irony of American history that the Republican Party, which has historically valued order and institutions, has become the conduit of chaos." ...|$|E
