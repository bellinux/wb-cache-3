5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume <b>leaves</b> (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus Lepilemur) and woolly lemurs (genus Avahi) also primarily eat <b>leaves,</b> making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming <b>leaves</b> from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young <b>leaves</b> are preferred over mature <b>leaves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal <b>leaves</b> which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The <b>leaves</b> are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two <b>leaves,</b> but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the <b>leaves</b> extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the <b>leaves</b> are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the <b>leaves</b> turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E

40|$|U. S. {{federal and}} state family <b>leave</b> {{legislation}} requires employers to provide job protected parental <b>leave</b> for new mothers covered under the legislation. In most cases the <b>leave</b> is unpaid, and rarely longer than 12 weeks in duration. This study evaluates disparities in parental <b>leave</b> eligibility, access and usage across the family income distribution in the United States. It also describes the links between <b>leave</b> taking and womens labor markeet careers. The focus is especially on low-income families, as their <b>leave</b> coverage and ability to a¤ord taking unpaid <b>leave</b> is particularly poor. This study shows that the introduction of both state and federal legislation increased overall <b>leave</b> coverage, <b>leave</b> provision and <b>leave</b> taking. The new policies did not, however, reduce gaps between low- and high-income familieseligibility, <b>leave</b> taking or <b>leave</b> length. In addition, the FMLA e¤ects on <b>leave</b> taking were not stronger in states without prior <b>leave</b> legislation, nor for women who met the eligibility criteria, as these women were already relatively well covered by other parental <b>leave</b> arrangements. The increased <b>leave</b> taking does not have signi 8 ̆ 5 cant e¤ects on womenswages, earnings, employment or promotions. The small career e¤ects may partly {{be due to the}} very limited <b>leave</b> length in the United States...|$|R

40|$|The 1993 Family and Medical <b>Leave</b> Act (FMLA) {{guarantees}} employees 12 {{weeks of}} unpaid <b>leave</b> to address family issues. Twelve {{states and the}} District of Columbia passed similar legislation antedating the FMLA. However, studies in the economics literature find either small or insignificant effects of the legislation on employment, leave-taking, work, and wages.

The {{correlation}} coefficient between GP-certified sick <b>leave</b> and self-certified sick <b>leave</b> is, perhaps surprisingly, only 0.055.
