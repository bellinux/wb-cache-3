25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star.</b> He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star,</b> right then and there... She {{said she was going}} to be a movie star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding the episode's Leap Dave Williams fictional film, Mary Cella of HLN said, [...] "it was {{a highly}} {{effective}} guest spot because it seemed exactly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> Carrey would <b>star</b> in. Andie MacDowell's role as his wife was a brilliant nod to actual holiday classic Groundhog Day." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Play a Simple Melody" [...] {{was then}} {{featured}} in the 1954 movie There's No Business <b>Like</b> Show Business, <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>starring</b> Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, Donald O'Connor, Johnnie Ray, Mitzi Gaynor, and Marilyn Monroe showcasing Irving Berlin songs from the whole of his career. In the movie, Merman and Dailey sang the song in a vaudeville sequence.|$|R
50|$|Dan and Olivia {{encounter}} several {{troubles in}} their relationship when Vanessa alienates them both during her attempt at getting the freshman toast at NYU. When Dan introduces Olivia to Rufus and Lily, she starts acting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stereotypical <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> towards them until Vanessa reveals that she lied to {{the both of them}} so that Olivia wouldn't have to meet her judgmental mother, Gabriela. Vanessa loses the toast to Olivia and properly reintroduces Olivia the next morning after the incident. Olivia's <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> background also catches up to her when she is forced to continue her fake relationship with Patrick Roberts, her former co-star. Serena intervenes and Dan and Olivia soon manage to make their relationship public.|$|R

50|$|The opening titles {{featured}} Gaby {{dressed up}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> {{driven to the}} studio in a limo and walking on red carpet to the door. Meanwhile, Terry, carrying a briefcase, rode a rickety old bicycle across London and parked it outside the back door before quietly entering the building through said back door.|$|E

40|$|The {{death of}} Eileen Chang on September 8, 1995 in Los Angeles made {{headlines}} {{in all the}} Chinese newspapers. In the Chinese-speaking areas of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland China, a veritable cult of mystique has been built around her by both public media and {{the large number of}} her fans (who called themselves Chang-mi or 2 ̆ 2 Chang-fans”). However, in the last twenty-three years of her life Chang lived quietly and incognito in Los Angeles, shunning all social contact and escaping publicity by constantly changing her residences in numerous hotels, motels, and small apartment houses until her death in an obscure apartment building in the Westwood section of Los Angeles. This “mystery” of her last years adds only more glamour to her legend: she was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> retired <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> past her prime, like Greta Garbo...|$|R
5000|$|A new Phantom Lady was {{introduced}} in Crisis Aftermath: The Battle for Blüdhaven (2006), {{as one of the}} metahumans guarding Blüdhaven. She appears in the limited series Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters. Her name is Stormy Knight and, like the original character, her father is a U.S. Senator, though no connection to the other Knight characters has been established. She seems to know Father Time and has hinted that they've met before with him in a different guise, referring to his look as [...] "this year's look is Colonel Sanders, Time?" [...] She acts <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spoiled <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> and treats her other teammates like the popular girl in high school would treat the geeks (especially the Human Bomb and Major Force), but shows some hint of respect for the new Doll Man, hinting that they worked together for some time. Her wristbands not only project light but can bend reality.|$|R
5|$|The {{characterization}} of Neville Sinclair {{was inspired by}} <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, <b>like</b> Higham's Flynn, <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous process of writing and re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|R
50|$|Kitano then {{happens to}} pick up a gun at a yakuza quarrel. He shoots first his yakuza {{neighbor}} (Susumu Terajima), and begins to kill people around his world. The film implies it is some kind of a dream, showing deceased guys appear again in blood and yell alive normally. Kitano takes out his female neighbor (Kotomi Kyono) and commits a bank robbery. Accomplishing his fantasies of acting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> 'Beat' Takeshi, Kitano takes a journey into the absolutely bizarre, surreal world (an underground nightclub, night gun battles, and the catastrophe at a Boiling Point-, or Sonatine-like tropical island).|$|E
5000|$|Universal did {{not have}} a [...] "glamour girl" [...] like other studios - an {{equivalent}} to Hedy Lamarr (MGM), Dorothy Lamour (Paramount), Betty Grable (20th Century Fox), Rita Hayworth (Columbia) or Ann Sheridan (Warner Bros). They decided to groom Maria Montez to take this role and she received a lot of publicity. Montez was also a keen self promoter. In the words of The Los Angeles Times [...] "she borrowed an old but sure-fire technique to get ahead in the movies. She acted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star.</b> She leaned on the vampish tradition set up by Nazimova and Theda Bara... She went in heavily for astrology. Her name became synonymous with exotic enchantresses in sheer harem pantaloons." ...|$|E

5000|$|W. Mott Hupfel III photographed The American Astronaut. He {{worked closely}} with McAbee to achieve {{a black and white}} that could help audiences suspend disbelief about an outer space where there is no {{atmosphere}} to filter light, while still leaving a lot up to the imagination. [...] "We wanted the audience to see much of what is happening in shadow," [...] explains McAbee. The Boy’s performance on stage was lit and photographed to create a massive shadow, which in some shots takes up much of the screen. Mott also lit and photographed The Boy <b>like</b> <b>a</b> silent <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> in the scenes that he and Curtis share in the space ship. Says McAbee," [...] Mott worked on putting a little bit more light on Greg than on me. It was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> special effect that explained everything about our characters - here was this dirty trader guy at the helm and next to him was this young hero. Mott understood what we were after and made the film look exactly right." ...|$|R
5000|$|I'm {{not in it}} {{very much}} ... it's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> where the <b>star</b> only appears now and then. - Ronnie Spector, {{referring}} {{to the amount of}} time afforded the orchestral passages on the recording As with [...] "River Deep - Mountain High", the single's lack of success was one of the [...] "crushing disappointments" [...] of Phil Spector's career, author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1977, the producer having [...] "outdone himself to transform it into a masterpiece of his patented 'wall of sound' production". Spector had been sure that the song would become [...] "a giant smash", according to Williams, who describes the outcome as a challenge to [...] "Phil's eternal trust in his own judgment of excellence".|$|R
40|$|Abstract Western policymakers {{have come}} to take Egypt’s foreign policy {{orientation}} for granted in recent decades. After President Anwar Sadat’s dramatic split from the Soviet bloc and embrace of peace with Israel in the 1970 s, Egypt became a reliable but rarely exciting diplomatic partner. Little appreciated has been the centrality of foreign policy to Egypt’s internal interests {{as well as its}} external ones, {{and the extent to which}} changes in either the domestic or international environment could trigger the Egyptians to reassess their stance. The present article examines the interests that Egyptian foreign policy serves, and it analyses factors that could prompt a future Egyptian government to adopt different policies in order to serve those interests more effectively. Egyptian foreign policy sometimes seems <b>like</b> <b>an</b> aging <b>movie</b> <b>star.</b> In the mid- 1970 s, reporters flocked to Cairo. They chronicled Egypt’s shift away from Soviet bloc, Arab socialism and warfare, and toward the United States, economic opening, and peace. As part of his foreign policy strategy, President Anwar Sadat met with numerous journalists and world leaders. After his November 1977 trip to Jerusalem, he reache...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, Sue {{walks down}} Hollywood Boulevard, and is {{startled to see}} her doppelgänger across the street. Before Sue can investigate, Doris arrives and {{attempts}} to kill her, having been hypnotized by The Phantom. Sue is brutally stabbed in the stomach with her own screwdriver, causing her to stagger {{down the street and}} eventually collapse next to some homeless people on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. One woman remarks that Sue is dying, then proceeds to debate with another, younger homeless woman about taking a bus to Pomona. Her companion talks at length about a friend named Niko, a prostitute whose blond wig makes her look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star,</b> thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. The older woman comforts Sue by holding a lighter {{in front of her face}} until she finally dies, promising her [...] "no more blue tomorrows." [...] Off-camera, Kingsley yells [...] "Cut!" [...] and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.|$|E
5000|$|Clive James {{focused on}} fame in the 20th century, because {{the arrival of}} mass media, film and {{television}} changed forever the ways people became famous. In previous centuries people could only become famous by doing something that was remembered ages later. Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte conquered countries, Jesus Christ developed a religion, ... In the 20th century people could become world famous in less than no time and without doing anything, thanks {{to the arrival of}} mass media. Movie stars like Charlie Chaplin, for instance, became global stars due to the nearly universal reach of film. James cites Chaplin as the first truly world famous 20th century celebrity. The invention of the film close-up made people on film screens appear larger than life and thus increased the emotional involvement of the audience. This often led to mass hysteria and confusion between an actor's stage persona and the roles he played on the screen (as in the case of Rudolph Valentino). Certain politicians in the century have used the media to promote their own image to the public, for instance John F. Kennedy, who looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star,</b> and Ronald Reagan who was a former movie star.|$|E

5000|$|Journalist Tom Spurgeon wrote, Cockrum's penciled {{interiors}} {{on those}} first few issues of the [...] "new" [...] X-Men were dark and appealingly dramatic [...] [...] [...] [...] Cockrum gave {{those first few}} issues of X-Men a sumptuous, late-'70s cinema style that separated the book {{from the rest of}} Marvel's line, and superhero comics in general. Reading those X-Men comics felt <b>like</b> sneaking into <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>starring</b> Sean Connery or Sigourney Weaver, not simply like flipping on the television. Uncanny X-Men really felt new and different, almost right away, and Cockrum's art was a tremendous part of that. [...] Cockrum stayed with the title until 1977 (as main penciller on issues #94-105 and 107), when he was succeeded by penciller John Byrne with issue #108. The final issue of his run introduced the Starjammers, a spacefaring superhero team he had originally intended to debut in their own series.|$|R
