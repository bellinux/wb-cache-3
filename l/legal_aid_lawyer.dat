40|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>aid</b> {{expenditure}} {{has risen}} dramatically in recent years, prompting attention from successive governments. A prominent theme {{of past and}} present government reform proposals has been the shifting of risk away from the taxpayer towards lawyers, clients and insurers by altering the means by which <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> <b>lawyers</b> are paid. This paper explores this theme by presenting information on <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> expenditure trends {{over the last two decades}} and then considering whether payment mechanisms have contributed to this performance. Finally, it reviews previous and current reform proposals in this area. It concludes that, because risk-shifting also alters incentives, it is essential that reform recognises and monitors these. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{other professions}} have {{attempted}} to make their services more readily available in recent years, the legal profession 2 ̆ 7 s availability has remained relatively static. Today there is a considerable lack of legal services for a {{great majority of the}} people. This lack of available services is most critical in the lower and middle income classes. Only recently have any remedies to this problem been suggested and actively undertaken. <b>Legal</b> <b>aid</b> societies, <b>lawyer</b> referral services, and group legal service plans are the three primary methods used to combat the problem. <b>Legal</b> <b>aid</b> societies are primarily for lower income individuals while group legal service plans and lawyer referral services are mainly for use by the middle class. However, at this time only the <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> societies and the lawyer referral plans have become workable tools. Group legal service programs are not yet sufficiently established to provide adequate relief. It is {{the purpose of this article}} to consider the effect of these programs on the lower and middle income classes. Since <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> societies and <b>lawyer</b> referral plans are becoming well established, the first portion of this paper is devoted to a brief history of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> societies and <b>lawyer</b> referral plans and the development of the present need for group legal service plans. It is shown that even though both <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> societies and <b>lawyer</b> referral plans are providing more people in the low and middle classes with legal services, there still is a failure to provide legal services for the middle class. A detailed consideration of group legal service plans case law is then developed in an effort to demonstrate how acceptable such plans are to the courts. The second portion of the article is devoted to a critical analysis of why the <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> societies and <b>lawyer</b> referral plans are so widely accepted when group legal service plans are struggling for recognition. Of particular importance is a discussion of the old Canons of Ethics and the new Code of Professional Responsibility. It is shown that the American Bar Association and the legal profession in general have seen fit to make express provisions in the new Code to accommodate <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> societies and <b>lawyer</b> referral plans. Particular attention is given to the absence of adequate provisions in the Code of Professional Responsibility to support group legal service plans...|$|R

40|$|This paper applies Marx' {{theory of}} {{alienation}} {{to the work}} of criminal <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> <b>lawyers</b> to suggest that the lawyers might be best understood as alienated workers.

The concept of alienation is put forward as a valuable analytical tool for understanding this vision of a substandard legal practice, which may have potential for moving forward future debates on whether the lawyer-client relationship serves access to justice and, if not, how it might be improved to better do so...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} lawyers respond to {{financial}} incentives {{in ways that}} are consistent with predictions from contract theory. It uses data collected from before/after the introduction of standard fees for <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> <b>lawyers</b> in England and Wales. For some inputs (not all), these substituted fixed price contracts for retrospective fee-for-service remuneration. We consider the effects of these new contracts on case-level inputs and examine the extent of substitution across inputs remunerated by fixed prices and fee-for-service. We find that lawyers' responses were consistent with theory: (i) high-powered incentives for cost-reduction lowered inputs that may have been difficult to monitor, and (ii) substitution across inputs took place in line with multitask agency. Our results have implications for <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> expenditure control, and current policies on personal injury litigation, as well as providing empirical evidence on the effects of remuneration contracts.
