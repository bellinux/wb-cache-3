500|$|Baird's {{mother was}} struck and killed on 15 July 1958, just outside Mimi's home, by a Standard Vanguard car {{driven by an}} off-duty constable, PC Eric Clague, who was a <b>learner-driver.</b> Clague later said: [...] "Mrs Lennon just ran {{straight}} {{out in front of}} me. I just couldn't avoid her. I was not speeding, I swear it. It {{was just one of those}} terrible things that happen." [...] Baird and Jackie (aged eleven and eight respectively) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater's, and were not allowed to attend the funeral. [...] They were told two months later by Norman Birch (Lennon's uncle) that their mother had died. Lennon's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls—ignoring Dykins' parentage, as he had never legally married Julia. Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool. [...] Her grave is unmarked, and over the years its location was forgotten until it was recently identified by Jackie as [...] "CE (Church of England) 38-805".|$|E

Simulators {{are used}} for many {{different}} purposes, among them physical rehabilitation and the training of differently abled <b>learner-drivers.</b> In South Africa, however, {{the extent of the}} latter type of simulators is limited to paraplegic <b>learner-drivers</b> only. The reason is that locally sourcing the necessary equipment to adapt commercial simulators for the training of differently abled <b>learner-drivers</b> presents a problem. The concept of Universal Design stipulates that as many individuals as possible should be able to use a particular product. Consequently, a simulator for differently abled <b>learner-drivers</b> should accommodate as many such persons as possible. However, applying Universal Design in the area of design researched for the present dissertation adds further complexity due to the unique nature of the physical limitations experienced by individuals. A differently abled driver puts an extreme constraint on the design of a product - and becomes a limiting user. Nevertheless, this dissertation adopts a Universal Design approach to investigate the possibility of designing such a simulator in South Africa, as well as its viability. A limiting user was included in the research to represent the bigger differently abled community. Field research was carried out by implementing a Participatory Design process. Furthermore, a team was selected according to a Meta-Design mind-set, including professionals from engineering, clinical psychology and occupational therapy. The leader and researcher was an industrial designer...|$|R
40|$|People {{severely}} initiated {{into a group}} {{often have}} stronger group affiliation than those undergoing a mild or no initiation. There is controversy over the correct theoretical explanation for this. The traditional explanation is that new members exaggerate their liking of {{the group as a}} way of avoiding cognitive dissonance. An explanation that has emerged more recently (e. g. Lodewijkx & Syroit, 2001) has been that from the Severity-Affiliation-Attraction-Hypothesis (SAAH), suggesting that the evoked physiological arousal increases affiliation. These competing explanations were investigated. Experiments 1 - 2 suggested that the least amount of cognitive dissonance led to the highest amounts of group affiliation. Experiment 3 (ongoing) is testing SAAH by tracking physiological arousal whilst varying initiation of <b>learner-drivers.</b> Results, various rites-of-passage and cultural explanations will be discussed to extract conclusions on what severe initiations do to new group members and why...|$|R
40|$|The disproportionately high {{involvement}} of young, novice drivers in road accidents in the Netherlands {{has led to}} consideration being given to introducing a special, limited driving licence for new drivers. After research, consultation of all parties involved, and a careful consideration of alternatives, the following measures are regarded as promising: (1) More (better) traffic education in secondary schools; (2) Lowering (or a zero-level) of the alcohol limit (restriction {{for a period of}} two years beginning after passing the driving test); (3) An Alcohol Education Measure for novice drivers; (4) A temporary driving licence with a second examination after 2 years (or following a course after passing the driving test); and (5) a graduated driving licence (with accompanied driving). In this report, the results are presented of a study of the distribution of the support for these five measures, among the <b>learner-drivers</b> themselves as well as their parents. Data was gathered in three different ways: questionnaires put to and group discussions held with learner-drivers; and telephone interviews held among parents...|$|R

40|$|The {{public health}} {{dimensions}} of road safety literacy for novice drivers who speak English {{as a foreign}} language, are a concern due to increasing transnational mobility. The research literature indicates interest in this language issue in terms of comparisons with native English speakers, gender, and international evaluations.   However, studies of road safety as a literacy issue are limited. Using an autobiographical approach this paper explores the textual, inter-textural and performative literacy of a Chinese <b>learner-driver</b> in Australia. Evidence of the learner-driver’s life history, use of multiple languages, and cultural differences are shown to impact on her development of road safety literacy...|$|E
40|$|Graduated {{licensing}} schemes {{have been}} found to reduce the crash risk of young novice drivers, but there is less evidence of their success with novice motorcycle riders. This study examined the riding experience of a sample of Australian learner-riders to establish the extent and variety of their riding practice during the learner stage. Riders completed an anonymous questionnaire at a compulsory rider-training course for the licensing test. The majority of participants were male (81 %) with an average age of 33 years. They worked full time (81 %), held an unrestricted driver's license (81 %), and owned the motorcycle that they rode (79 %). These riders had held their learner's license for an average of 6 months. On average, they rode 6. 4 h/week. By the time they attempted the rider-licensing test, they had ridden a total of 101 h. Their total hours of on-road practice were comparable to those of <b>learner-drivers</b> at the same stage of licensing, but they had less experience in adverse or challenging road conditions. A substantial proportion had little or no experience of riding in the rain (57 %), at night (36 %), in heavy traffic (22 %), on winding rural roads (52 %), or on high-speed roads (51 %). These findings highlight the differences in the learning processes between unsupervised novice motorcycle riders and supervised novice drivers. Further research is necessary to clarify whether specifying the conditions under which riders should practice during the graduated licensing process would likely reduce or increase their crash risk...|$|R
