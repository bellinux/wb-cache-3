5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters.

5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

At the pre-chorus, she sings [...] "The old me's gone and I feel brand new, {{and if you}} don't like it, fuck you", which takes aim at anyone who dismisses her new style; meanwhile, she declares her musical departure from her previous 1940s and 1950s inspired album Back to Basics (2006) at the chorus with the line, [...] "I'm not myself tonight, tonight I'm not the same girl". The song also evokes sexual theme, with lyrics such as [...] "I'm dancin' a lot, I'm takin' shots and I'm feelin' fine/ I'm kissin' all the boys and girls". Writing for Billboard magazine, Michael Menachem opined that Aguilera channeled a [...] "more 'Euro-glamorous' version" [...] of her previous alter ego [...] "Xtina", featured in her 2002 hit [...] "Dirrty" [...] from Stripped.|$|E

500|$|In Paris, Ahmadzaï worked obsessively to {{complete}} the recording of [...] "Impressive Instant", applying his characteristic sound mangling. He used the Antares Auto-Tune plug-in set for the pitch correction. Explaining that the audio processor kept the characteristic of the voice, he recalled that Madonna was not afraid to use it, unlike other artists; she just had to sing a <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of tune and vibrato. The song had LFO sweeps at its beginning, panning from its left and right, which created {{the backdrop of the}} track. To achieve this, Ahmadzaï used a Nord Lead synthesizer, passed through an audio filter. The bass used in the song was subdued, and did not contain any music in high or mid-range. Instead of using a Minimoog synthesizer, Ahmadzaï used a Korg Prophecy analog-modelling synthesizer which added a different texture to the song. Audio filters were used for the first appearance of a melody and Madonna's voice was processed through an Eventide 3000 harmonizer, finally adding effects from filters and E6400 emulator. Also, Ahmadzaï added his characteristic stuttering sounds to the song, explaining: ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Holmes from Destructoid {{questioned}} {{the controversy over}} the decision by stating [...] "While there are surely plenty of folks who adore seeing their screen filled with frilly thong shots, I imagine there may be even more players out there who'd find the sudden prioritization of arse in their fighting games to be <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of place." [...] Chris Carter at Destructoid commented [...] "It's still a bit weird that something this goofy was removed, especially with the design Laura has in general," [...] and noted that a character like Necalli is [...] "probably far more harmful" [...] for children's eyes. In another article by Destructoid, Carter stated [...] "It's such a weird thing to me, because R. Mika's butt is still very visible, she just doesn't lightly tap it a few times per match." [...] Likewise, ND Medina at iDigitalTimes expressed confusion over the change, noting that her full butt was still being exposed. The butt slap was later restored as a mod for the PC version, albeit in a different pose.|$|E
500|$|During early development, Rocksteady {{placed a}} {{prototype}} Batmobile {{in the existing}} Arkham City map, and learned that the claustrophobic city designed for Batman to glide and grapple did not work well for driving a vehicle. Gotham City was thus redesigned with wider streets to allow space for the Batmobile and other street traffic to drive without colliding into walls, and buildings were made taller to accommodate the vehicle's ejection ability. To redesign Gotham City, the designers attempted {{to build on the}} previous games' gothic architecture while making a more believable and dense city. Alongside minor elements like neon lights, billboard advertising, and American-style cars, the team developed ideas for shops that could be found in the city, while retaining a grimy, dystopian theme. Describing the design, Hego said: [...] "every kind of element we've added in there ... makes the entire experience feel a <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of time. You couldn't pinpoint whether it's twenty years ago, now or in ten years time." [...] The designers valued making an open world that was [...] "rich, vibrant, dense...and full of interesting things to do" [...] over it just being large.|$|E

500|$|... "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] {{was covered}} by Colton Dixon and Skylar Laine in the {{eleventh}} season of American Idol. Natalie Finn of E! gave a mixed review of the pair's performance, writing [...] "Skylar handled Kelly Clarkson better than Colton played Jason Aldean on [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay," [...] but she's the country girl, so it made sense." [...] Brian Mansfield of USA Today felt that the song was out of Dixon's comfort zone and a <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of Laine's range. Gil Kaufman of MTV remarked that the chemistry between the pair was more like cold fusion. Jennifer Still of Digital Spy said the performance [...] "isn't anything incredible". [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] was performed by Justin Chain and Shelbie Z in the fifth season of The Voice during the Battle Rounds which was first aired on October 14, 2013. Natasha Chandel of MTV opined that the pair struggled with their pitch and harmonies during rehearsals but successfully stepped up their game during the live performance. A similar view was shared by Ashley Lee of The Hollywood Reporter writing, [...] "Throughout rehearsals, neither the motorcycle accident survivor nor the pageant coach could lock in their harmonies during the choruses [...] They ended up blending well onstage.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce {{said the}} story in [...] "Christmas Scandal" [...] was so busy that it risked running awry, but was kept together {{by a number of}} strong comedic moments and subplots. Pierce particularly enjoyed watching the parks department scrambling to do Leslie's work, and the chemistry between both April and Andy, and Leslie and Dave. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said he [...] "thoroughly enjoyed" [...] the episode, especially the subplot of the parks department employees realizing how much work Leslie does due to her absence. However, he said way the sex scandal consumed the entire town and local media countered the central conceit of the series, [...] "that Leslie treats her mundane, small-town civil service job {{as if it were a}} high-stakes national politics job, while everyone else sees their world for what it is". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was [...] "a sweet and clever way to celebrate the holiday season", but that the media frenzy in [...] "Christmas Scandal" [...] was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of place in an episode filled with a ton of subtler, character-building moments". Fowler said the parks department employees splitting up to do Leslie's work was [...] "a great element" [...] that helped develop Leslie's character.|$|E
500|$|American {{songwriter}} {{and producer}} Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart convened with Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash and Kuk Harrell in January 2007 at the Atlanta-based Triangle Studios {{to create new}} material. In the studio, Stewart was [...] "messing around with a walloping hi-hat sound", which he found in the free music software GarageBand, which is included in all Mac computers. With his attention caught by the sound, Nash asked Stewart what he was doing: [...] "Oh, my Gosh, what is that beat?". When Stewart incorporated chords onto the hi-hat, [...] "immediately the word popped into [...] head"; {{he went to the}} vocal booth and started singing. Nash wrote the first two verses and the chorus over Stewart's skeleton track. They quickly wrote the lyrics, completing the first verse in 60 seconds. They continued into writing, adding the hook while [...] " [...] would put the next chord". In a matter of hours, they had recorded a demo of the track. The song was written with American pop singer Britney Spears in mind, whom Stewart had previously worked with on her 2003 single [...] "Me Against the Music". Stewart and Nash thought that Spears, who had [...] "her personal life... a <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of control" [...] at the time, needed a hit as musical comeback. Spears was working on her fifth album, Blackout, so they sent a copy of the demo to Spears' management. However, Spears did not hear of the song because her label rejected it, claiming they had enough songs for her to record.|$|E

Alicia returned in the final episode of the series, broadcast on 30 July. Alistair Brammer made his first appearance in episode fourteen, broadcast on 5 December 2015, as receptionist Jack Diamond. Jack departed in episode thirty-two. Lloyd Everitt's casting in the role of paramedic Jez Andrews was announced in January 2016, with Kent describing him as [...] "young, handsome and openly bisexual. Everitt said he was [...] "honoured" [...] to join [...] "such a successful show". Jason Durr and Jaye Griffiths were also announced to be joining the regular cast on 24 February 2016, as staff nurse David Hide and consultant Elle Gardner.

500|$|After the {{completion}} of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, World War II began, and Laughton, realizing his company could no longer film in London, sold O'Hara's contract to RKO. O'Hara later professed that this [...] "broke my heart, I felt completely abandoned in a strange and faraway place". She next featured in John Farrow's A Bill of Divorcement (1940), a remake of George Cukor's 1932 film. O'Hara portrayed Sydney Fairchild, which was played by Katharine Hepburn in the original, in a film which she considered having a [...] "screenplay [...] was mediocre at best". The production was problematic after Farrow reportedly made [...] "suggestive comments" [...] to her and began stalking her at home, and once he realized that O'Hara {{was not interested in}} him sexually, he began bullying her on set. The feisty O'Hara punched him in the jaw one day, which {{put an end to the}} mistreatment. O'Hara's performance was criticized by reviewers, with the critic from The New York Sun writing that she [...] "lacked the intensity and desperation it must have; nor does she seem to have a sparkle of humor". She next found a role as an aspiring ballerina who performs with a dance troupe [...] in Dance, Girl, Dance (1940). She considered it to have been a physically demanding film, and felt intimidated by Lucille Ball during the production as she had been a former Ziegfeld and Goldwyn girl and was a superior dancer. The two remained friends for many years after the film was completed. Critic Molly Haskell thought that O'Hara was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of her depth in a vaudeville house, not exactly the temple of high art".|$|E
500|$|Writer Novak {{cites the}} episode as the [...] "most conceptually ambitious" [...] in the show's history. More {{than half the}} episode {{consisted}} of footage from the film. Originally, the producers considered showing just the movie, but they felt that it [...] "would feel like a gimmick or experiment", {{and so it was}} decided that the film would be intercut with shots of the office reacting to the film. In order to make the film seem as if Michael had created it, the film used was colorized in post-production to make it seem as if it were of a cheaper quality than the normal high-quality film that the series used. Certain shooting methods, like hand-held and zooms, were nixed, except for in cases where they could be presented in a [...] "poorly-executed" [...] manner. This was done in a way to make it appear that Michael at least knew what he was doing; Novak explained that the crew [...] "didn't want the joke of the episode to be how bad he was at filmmaking" [...] because it would [...] "be a little easy and a <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of character". To create the fake dummy of Toby that exploded, Paul Lieberstein was required to spend several hours in a full-face mold that reportedly [...] "unnerved him greatly". Two molds were taken. Both were filled with explosives, but one was filled with fake blood. Both were shot with slow-motion cameras. However, the dummy with the fake blood in it was considered [...] "too disturbing for us and arguably too disturbing for Michael", and so the tamer explosion was used.|$|E

500|$|... "No Church in the Wild" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics and was {{often described as}} a highlight from Watch the Throne. Andy Gill of The Independent stated [...] "the best track is surely the opener 'No Church in the Wild', whose deep, detuned twang groove, over a marching organ motif, is the most striking music on the album, promising rather more {{than the rest of}} the record is able to deliver. Both this and the other stand-out track, [...] "Made In America", feature assured vocal refrains from Frank Ocean, while the two rappers muse over familiar themes of loyalty, sexuality and maternal solidarity." [...] Rolling Stone claims that it is one of the most musically impressive songs on Watch the Throne and describes the production as an [...] "ominous, darkly funky bass groove and chilly synths tailor-made for Ocean's off-kilter crooning." [...] Matt Popkin from American Songwriter praised Jay Z's verse and the menacing vibe of the song. NOW claims that [...] "uncomfortably visceral opener 'No Church In The Wild' – with its filthy Phil Manzanera guitar sample and mournful Frank Ocean chorus – cuts to the heart of Watch The Throne's power dynamic." [...] However, PopMatters criticized that the verses [...] "feel a <b>little</b> <b>out</b> of focus compared to the hook and beat's opulence." [...] Sputnikmusic's Tyler Fisher commented [...] "88-Keys creates a positively epic opening track with 'No Church in the Wild', full of creeping guitar riffs and pulsating bass, building tension that simply never releases." [...] Rolling Stone named the track the sixth best song of the year, reporting that [...] "with Hov and Yeezy getting deep into arcane theology, this track is just another high." ...|$|E
