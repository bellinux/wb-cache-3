2500|$|Dana Morgan, {{the son of}} Arrow Development co-founder Ed Morgan, founded D. H. Morgan Manufacturing in 1983. He got {{his start}} in the {{amusement}} industry at age 14 as a ride operator at Playtown, a small children's park in Palo Alto, California, that was owned by Arrow Development. Upon graduation from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo {{he went to work}} for Disney, primarily doing design work for the Walt Disney World project. During the construction of Disney World, Morgan went to work for Arrow Development which was building rides for Disney World. In 1974 Morgan <b>left</b> <b>Arrow</b> Development to become the general manager of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. When Huss Maschinenfabrik purchased Arrow Development in 1981, Morgan was appointed president of the newly formed Arrow-Huss. Morgan left Arrow-Huss in 1983 to form his own company, D. H. Morgan Manufacturing. Morgan had originally intended to build carousels, but the company's first contract was to build new trains for the Giant Dipper wooden roller coaster at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. The demand for new coaster vehicles was so great that the carousel-building business had to be put on hold until 1988. In the meantime, the Electric Antique Car Line was developed, and customer requests came in for custom attractions as well. In March 1991, the company moved to larger facilities in La Selva Beach, California. [...] Dana Morgan continued building trains for wooden coasters until 1994 when on June 8, he sold the wood train manufacturing operation to competitor Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. The last Morgan trains built for a wooden coaster were delivered to Yomiuriland in Japan.|$|E

40|$|International audienceExperimental {{results and}} a kinetic {{modeling}} were previously {{reported for the}} gas phase oxidation of methane {{in the presence of}} NO 2 at short residence time (20 - 80 ms) in a microreactor. A detailed kinetic analysis is carried out in the present study in means of flow rate and sensitivity analysis, in order to investigate the role of NO 2. A comparison is made of the reaction systems with and without NO 2. The concentration profiles of several key species are presented and analyzed in the present study. The CH 3 O center dot radicals are present in far larger quantities in the CH 4 /O- 2 /NO 2 system than in the CH 4 /O- 2 system. With NO 2, the dominant route to HCHO is through CH 3 O center dot, primarily involving the reaction: CH 3 center dot + NO 2 double <b>left</b> right <b>arrow</b> CH 3 O center dot + NO, followed by: CH 3 O center dot (+M) double <b>left</b> right <b>arrow</b> CH 2 O + H center dot (+M) and CH 3 O center dot + O- 2 double <b>left</b> right <b>arrow</b> HO 2 center dot + CH 2 O.
