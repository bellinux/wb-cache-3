50|$|In 1857, the United Kingdom {{sponsored}} the Commercial Code of Signals for the Use of All Nations at Sea, which introduced four <b>letter</b> <b>flag</b> signal codes to identify individual ships. The Commercial Code of Signals, c. 1900, was modified {{to become the}} International Code of Signals. By the 1860s, individual ships were being allocated code letters in the United States and Europe. From 1874, code letters were recorded in Lloyd's Register as part of each individual vessel's entry in the register. Generally, code letters allocated to a ship remained with that ship, although there are known cases where new code letters have been allocated following a change of port of registry or owner. Code Letters were sometimes reallocated once a ship had been struck from the register, but no two ships bore the same code letters at the same time. With the introduction of radio for communications, code letters were used also as radio call signs.|$|E

40|$|Textual data holds {{a number}} of {{properties}} {{that can be taken}} into account in order to improve compression. Pre-processing deals with these properties by applying {{a number of}} transformations that make the redundancy “more visible ” to the compressor. One of the most commonly used concepts in text pre-processing is called Capital Conversion. Words with capital letters are converted to their lowercase versions while signaling the change with a flag. This way, not only context similarities are increased but also dictionaries used for word replacement only need to contain words in their lowercase versions. Word replacement consists of replacing words with shorter codes which are references to their location in a dictionary. We propose the creation of “online ” dictionaries presenting different alternatives for word orderings- by frequency, prefix, sufix and frequency x size-of-word- and a new implementation of the Capital Conversion technique. In our implementation of Capital Conversion, only two flags are needed to deal with words that have capital <b>letters.</b> <b>Flags</b> that encode words with first capital letter and totally uppercase words are used in the same way. When the word starts with a few uppercase letter...|$|R
5000|$|By 1653, the Royal Navy {{had issued}} {{instructions}} by which an admiral could signal various orders by hoisting flags in various locations on his ship. Modern naval code signalling {{began with the}} invention of maritime signal flags in the mid-17th century by the Duke of York who was created Lord High Admiral after the Restoration. A ship's message had {{to be approved by}} the Officer of the watch, and his system was augmented and changed in various ways over the following century. In 1790, Admiral Lord Howe issued a new signal book for a numerary system using numeral flags to signal a number; the number indicated the message, not the mast from which the flags flew. Substitute flags were also instituted to indicate repeated numerals, and there was consideration of making the flags more distinct. In 1799, Captain Sir Home Popham published his first list of words and sentences which could be referenced by a number (or [...] "code"); three subsequent editions added <b>letter</b> <b>flags,</b> with the 1801 edition numbering 2994 codes. Popham's code was famously used for the [...] "England expects that every man will do his duty" [...] signal at Trafalgar by Nelson.|$|R

It was captured when found in an abandoned railroad car at Macon, Georgia, on 20 May 1865 by Sergt. John W. Deen, 17th Indiana Mounted. Infantry; and is War Department capture no. 500.

5000|$|Various {{other codes}} were also published, {{but all these}} were {{eventually}} supplanted by the Commercial Code of Signals published by the British Board of Trade in 1857, which eventually became the International Code of Signals (ICS). A significant development was the addition of <b>letter</b> <b>flags</b> to make the code alphabetical. (The vowels were initially left out to avoid formation of any objectionable words.) [...] During World War I, there was an unprecedented need for ships to communicate, merchant as well as naval, but the ICS was found wanting: [...] "It was not international. It was found that when signalling word by word, the occasions upon which signaling failed were more numerous than when the result was successful." [...] This led to major revisions in 1931. This new international code of signals was officially brought into force worldwide on 1 January 1934. Thirteen new flags were introduced, so that the triangular pennants used for letters, C, D, E, F, and G were replaced with new square flags and became the numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The numerals 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 were introduced by five new flags, and there were three substitute flags, used when repeating letters in a hoist. Additional changes in 1969 greatly reduced the Code (dropping the Geographical and Vocabulary sections), and more narrowly focused it on communications related to safety of navigation. An indication {{of the success of}} the ICS is that most navies now use the ICS <b>flags</b> for representing <b>letters.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of two primary care interventions, a <b>letter</b> and a <b>flag,</b> {{aimed at improving}} attendance for breast screening among (i) all women invited for breast screening and (ii) non-attenders. Methods: A probabilistic decision analytic model was developed using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation implemented in WinBUGS. The model was populated using economic and effectiveness data collected alongside two randomised controlled trials. Results: For all women invited, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the letter compared with no intervention is £ 27 per additional attendance, and the ICER for the combined <b>letter</b> and <b>flag</b> intervention compared to the letter alone is £ 171. The corresponding ICERs for non-attenders are £ 41 and £ 90. The flag intervention is an inefficient option in both settings. A {{large proportion of the}} costs fall on the practices (25 - 67 %), depending on the intervention and target population. The total costs incurred do not, however, seem prohibitive. Expected value of perfect information suggests that there is greater value in carrying out further research on the intervention implemented among all women invited for breast screening rather than on non-attenders. Conclusions: The flag intervention alone {{does not appear to be}} an efficient option. The choice between the letter and both interventions combined is subjective, depending on the willingness to pay for an additional screening attendance.

John Berry McFerrin (1807-1887) recalled: [...] At Chickamauga, the slaughter was tremendous on both sides, but the Confederates held the field. I remained on the battlefield eleven days, nursing the sick, ministering to the wounded, and praying for the dying. The sight was awful. Thousands of men killed and wounded. They lay thick all around, shot in every possible manner, and the wounded dying every day. Among the wounded were many Federal soldiers.

60|$|This {{paper was}} sent out from Boston, {{on the evening}} of the 8th, with a flag of truce, which bore it to the American lines at Roxbury. There it was {{received}} by Colonel Learned, and carried by him to head-quarters. Washington consulted with such of the general officers as he could immediately assemble. The paper was not addressed to him, nor to any one else. It was not authenticated by the signature of General Howe; nor was there any other act obliging that commander to fulfil the promise asserted to have been made by him. It was deemed proper, therefore, that Washington should give no answer to the paper; but that Colonel Learned should signify in a letter his having laid it before the commander-in-chief, and the reasons assigned for not answering it. With this uncompromising <b>letter,</b> the <b>flag</b> returned to Boston. The Americans suspended their fire, but continued to fortify their positions.|$|R

5000|$|Semaphore flags {{are also}} {{sometimes}} used as {{means of communication}} in the mountains where oral or electronic communication is difficult to perform. Although they do not carry flags, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers have used hand semaphore in this manner. Some surf-side rescue companies, such as the Ocean City Maryland Beach Patrol, use semaphore flags to communicate between lifeguards. The <b>letters</b> of the <b>flag</b> semaphore are also a common artistic motif. One enduring example is the peace symbol, adopted by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1958 from the original logo created by a commercial artist named Gerald Holtom from Twickenham, London. Holtom designed the logo for use on a protest march on the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, near Newbury, England. On 4 April 1958, the march left Trafalgar Square for rural Berkshire, carrying Ban the Bomb placards made by Holtom's children making it the first use of the symbol. Originally, it was purple and white and signified {{a combination of the}} semaphoric letters N and D, standing for [...] "nuclear disarmament," [...] circumscribed by a circle.|$|R
6000|$|By half-past two {{the action}} had ceased along {{that part of}} the line which was astern of the ELEPHANT, but not with the ships ahead and the Crown Batteries. Nelson, seeing the manner in which his boats were fired upon when they went to take {{possession}} of the prizes, became angry, and said he must either send ashore to have this irregular proceeding stopped, or send a fire-ship and burn them. Half the shot from the Trekroner, and from the batteries at Amak, at this time, struck the surrendered ships, four of which had got close together; and the fire of the English, in return, was equally or even more destructive to these poor devoted Danes. Nelson, who was as humane as he was brave, was shocked at the massacre--for such he called it; and with a presence of mind peculiar to himself, and never more signally displayed than now, he retired into the stern gallery, and wrote thus to the Crown Prince:--"Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson has been commanded to spare Denmark when she no longer resists. The line of defence which covered her shores has struck to the British flag; but if the firing is continued on the part of Denmark, he must set on fire all the prizes that he has taken, without having the power of saving the men who have so nobly defended them. The brave Danes are the brothers, and should never be the enemies, of the English." [...] A wafer was given him, but he ordered a candle to be brought from the cockpit, and sealed the letter with wax, affixing a larger seal than he ordinarily used. [...] "This," [...] said he, [...] "is no time to appear hurried and informal." [...] Captain Sir Frederick Thesiger, who acted as his aide-de-camp, carried this <b>letter</b> with a <b>flag</b> of truce. Meantime the fire of the ships ahead, and the approach of the RAMILLIES and DEFENCE from Sir Hyde's division, which had now worked near enough to alarm the enemy, though not to injure them, silenced the remainder of the Danish line to the eastward of the Trekroner. That battery, however, continued its fire. This formidable work, owing to the want of the ships which had been destined to attack it, and the inadequate force of Riou's little squadron, was comparatively uninjured. Towards the close of the action it had been manned with nearly fifteen hundred men; and the intention of storming it, for which every preparation had been made, was abandoned as impracticable.|$|R
