5|$|Spruance {{failed to}} regain contact with Yamamoto's forces on 5 June, despite {{extensive}} searches. Towards {{the end of}} the day he launched a search-and-destroy mission to seek out any remnants of Nagumo's carrier force. <b>This</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> strike narrowly missed detecting Yamamoto's main body and failed to score hits on a straggling Japanese destroyer.

60|$|March 1st.--Plenty more {{butternut}} or clay-color'd escapees every day. About 160 came in to-day, a {{large portion}} South Carolinians.

50|$|Starfishes of genus Astropecten live on mobile seabed (sandy, muddy or gravel seabed) {{and they}} remain largely buried under {{sediment}} during the day.

Unlike other Astropecten, this species is active and easy to find during day, especially in early morning and <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>This</b> species lives only in the Mediterranean Sea and it prefers sandy seabed at low depths as between 1 and 12 m.|$|R

The Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary also advises that high levels of radioactivity have been found in Tokyo's drinking water and that it should not be used to reconstitute baby formula as it is around twice the legal limit for children.|$|R
50|$|The {{habits of}} the Gabon batis {{are similar to those}} of other batises and it is {{territorial}} and usually seen either singly, in pairs or in small family groups. It is a restless but unobtrusive bird and patrols the whole of its 18-20 ha territory each day, the male taking the lead and singing his song, especially in the morning and <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>This</b> species and the West African batis regularly have hostile interactions which the Gabon batis reacts to by raising its crown feathers and flicking its wings and tail while moving from sided to side.

6000|$|But on <b>this</b> <b>late</b> summer <b>afternoon,</b> Carter Watson was curious. As {{he moved}} along he paused before a gaudy {{drinking}} place. The sign above read, [...] "The Vendome." [...] There were two entrances. One evidently {{led to the}} bar. This he did not explore. The other was a narrow hallway. Passing through this {{he found himself in}} a huge room, filled with chair-encircled tables and quite deserted. In the dim light he made out a piano in the distance. Making a mental note that he would come back some time and study the class of persons that must sit and drink at those multitudinous tables, he proceeded to circumnavigate the room.|$|R

5000|$|As a {{means of}} {{attracting}} customers at less busy times, many restaurants have promotional periods on certain days, usually {{in the early morning}} or <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>This</b> typically involves charging a fixed price for certain dishes.

60|$|CARTER WATSON, {{a current}} {{magazine}} under his arm, strolled slowly along, gazing about him curiously. Twenty years had elapsed {{since he had}} been on this particular street, and the changes were great and stupefying. This Western city of three hundred thousand souls had contained but thirty thousand, when, as a boy, he had been wont to ramble along its streets. In those days the street he was now on had been a quiet residence street in the respectable workingclass quarter. On <b>this</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> he found that it had been submerged by a vast and vicious tenderloin. Chinese and Japanese shops and dens abounded, all confusedly intermingled with low white resorts and boozing dens. This quiet street of his youth had become the toughest quarter of the city.|$|R
30|$|In T. kensleyi, the {{presence}} of full stomachs was registered throughout the day, but with a higher proportion during the early morning and <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>This</b> pattern is similar to other decapod species from inland waters, which indicates a crepuscular (dawn and dusk) feeding rhythm (Collins [1997]; Williner and Collins [2002]; Aguzzi et al. [2005]; Zimmermann et al. [2009]). However, there are many evidences that {{the presence}} of food at any time of the day can trigger the locomotion in decapod crustaceans even in periods of low activity (Fernandez de Miguel and Aréchiga [1994]; Reigada [2002]; Pontes and Arruda [2005]; Sokolowicz et al. [2007]; Zimmermann et al. [2009]). Indeed, in T. kensleyi, {{the presence of}} prey items in the gut content suggests a continuous food intake and can provide clues of the movement of crabs in streams throughout the day.|$|R

50|$|P. sulcifer larva feed on what P. dominula feeds on, {{since it}} is the host workers who are {{collecting}} the food. It has been found that P. dominula food is from three insect orders. P. dominula, unlike many other social wasps, is known as a very generalist predator, and is both opportunistic and very flexible in selecting their prey. Adult P. sulcifer wasps have been shown to eat the larvae of other insect species including Tenebrio molitor larvae (a beetle species) and fly maggots. It has also been shown that the parasitic P. sulcifer female may use the host eggs as nutrition soon after usurpation occurs. Additionally, in P. sulcifer, a peculiar phenomenon is observed during usurpation season. The female is known to feed on flowers in the early morning and in the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>This</b> is thought to have evolved so the female could attempt to usurp {{in the middle of the}} day, when the host is out feeding.|$|R
