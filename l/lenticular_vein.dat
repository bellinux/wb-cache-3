40|$|An {{integrated}} structural, petrographic and microthermometric methodology {{has been}} applied on syn- to late-orogenic quartz veins from the High-Ardenne slate belt (Belgium) to define their relative timing. The quartz precipitates, which do not show any mutual cross-cutting relationships, represent the meso-scale brittle accommodation during fold initiation, amplification and locking. Crystal-plastic deformation structures and P–T trapping conditions indicate that the different processes accommodating folding occurred in a progressive manner along a retrograde deformation path, associated with the gradual exhumation of the slate belt from ca. 7. 5 to 6 km depth. Successive veining occurred from peak metamorphic conditions (ca. 300 °C and 190 MPa), measured in extrados veins, to subsequent lower P–T conditions in the periphery of a <b>lenticular</b> <b>vein</b> (ca. 275 °C and 180 MPa), late-orogenic saddle reef filling (ca. 245 °C and 160 MPa), and {{the core of a}} <b>lenticular</b> <b>vein</b> (ca. 220 °C and 150 MPa). Open-cavity growth and fluid-assisted brecciation indicate that veining occurred under overpressured fluid conditions. It is therefore fair to assume that the High-Ardenne slate belt acted – at least episodically – as a mid-crustal overpressured fluid reservoir, not only in the earliest and latest stages, but also during the main stage of orogeny. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The argentiferrous quartz-siderite-sulphide Strieborná vein {{hosted by}} mid-greenschist facies of Lower Paleozoic {{sequences}} {{represents one of}} the important vein structures of epigenetic mineralisation within the Rožňava ore district, Slovakia. The <b>lenticular</b> <b>vein</b> consists of some ore columns with high-grade fine to medium-grained semimassive and massive sulphides with Ag-tetrahedrite as the principal mineral of the sulphide stage. The mesoscopic analysis demonstrates that the sulphide mineralisation and enclosing rocks were subjected to successive stages of penetrative deformation and recrystallisation within the brittle-ductile shear zone. It is concluded that relatively later brittle-ductile deformations of sulphides are most evident within and along reactived subvertical fault zones to which the highest accumulation of sulphides is restricted. A wide variety of brittleductile deformation textures has been identified. Brittle and ductile deformation textures such as intense cataclasis, grain indentation, grain boundary migration, dislocations, plasticity reflect the response of the sulphides to various degrees of deformation, recrystallisation and remobilisation. The distribution of deformation textures within orebodies with a highgrade sulphide ore (Ag-tetrahedrite) suggests a strong strain partitioning along reactived fault zones. It is postulated that a later focussed fluid flow in these zones had significant effects on the strain of earlier sulphides and emplacement of high ore concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Iron or {{manganese}} oxide rich rocks were constantly and intensively used by hunter- gatherers from around 300 kya. Nonetheless, few is none concerning the supply in raw ferruginous materials. The mine San Ramón 15 in {{northern part of}} the Chilean coast reveals an exceptional evidence of the extraction of iron and probably {{manganese oxide}} rich materials by groups of hunters-fishers-gatherers. Two extraction phases were determined during the excavation of the mine trench: the oldest one during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (11000 - 8000 cal. BP) and the second one from 4300 cal. BP. A rich set of lithic pounding stones and hammer stones were recorded in the mine refus. The mine trench follows a various meters wide <b>lenticular</b> <b>vein</b> in the granodioritic bedrock from the Jurassic. The vein is principally made of hydrothermal pyrolusite, magnetite and goethite which are extremely hard materials and yellow to brown and black. Thus we suppose that the prehispanic miners intensively extracted a peculiar part of the vein, between the hard magnetite and the bedrock, so that few evidence of the material extracted in the mine were recorded. Our investigations focus on the determination of the characteristics of the quite messing materials which were extracted and we try to identify the following phases of transformation and utilisation. In order to address these issues, we sampled and document the lithology of the vein and of the numerous geological formations which provide iron rich materials in the neighbourhood. Furthermore, fragments of iron oxides from the mine refus, as well as red or black residues on tools from divers Archaic sites in the area (hammer stones in the mine, lithic weapons, grinding-stones and shells in the shellmiddens and rock-shelters) in order to compare their mineralogical and geochemical composition...|$|E
40|$|The Capps {{gold mine}} is located five and {{one-half}} {{miles northwest of}} Charlotte, in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. The area lies wholly within the igneous belt of the southern Appalachian gold region in approximately {{the central part of}} the Piedmont province of eastern United States. The ore deposits consist of <b>lenticular</b> quartzdolomite-pyrite <b>veins</b> irregularly replacing sheared zones of the granite country rock. The wall-rock alteration and vein mineralization indicate that the deposits belong to the mesothermal rather than hypothermal zone into which most of the southern Appalachian gold deposits have been classified. The immediate future of the Capps district does not present an optimistic picture, because the Capps Company is in the hands of receivers. Nevertheless, it is possible that successful mining could be carried out, if deposits were carefully blocked out in advance of extraction. The best possibilities for future exploration are extensions of the deposits beneath old excavations, especially those above which rich ore has been obtained. ...|$|R
40|$|The Monte Cristo {{mining area}} was {{discovered}} {{in the early days}} of mining in California, and intermittent attempts have been made to work it to the present time. The gold is localized in <b>lenticular</b> quartz <b>veins</b> replacing fractured country rock along north-south fault zones. Pyrite is the principal ore mineral with magnetite and minor amounts of sphalerite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite also present. Anorthosite is the principal country rock in the areas apparently intruded into diorite. Hornblendite dikes cut the anorthosite before the time of gold mineralization, and late lamprophyre dikes were injected after the vein quartz. Some pegmatite and late aplite dikes are also present. The area on the whole has undergone little metamorphism. Several stages and patterns of faulting are present and an attempt was made to work out their relative ages and the ages of the dikes and veins with respect to them. Joint patterns were mapped but no relation was found between them and the ore control. Economically the mine is considered a bad risk for any sizeable operation. Small scale mining of high grade ore shoots with a minimum of investment capital is believed to offer the best chance of success. The most favorable aspect of the property is the amount of development work done on the Monte Cristo North area where short crosscuts would open up a possible downward extension of the vein exposed at the surface...|$|R
40|$|The Pb–Zn ore {{deposits}} in the Guern Halfaya and Bou Grine areas (northern Tunisia) are hosted mainly by dolostones in the contact zone between Triassic and Upper Cretaceous strata and by Upper Cretaceous limestones. The deposits occur as <b>lenticular,</b> stratiform, <b>vein,</b> disseminations and stockwork ore bodies consisting of sphalerite, galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite and sulfosalt (gray copper). Barite and celestite dominate the gangue, with lesser calcite. The δ 34 S values of barite and celestite (12. 7 – 15. 0 ‰) at the Oum Edeboua mine {{are consistent with}} the reduction of sulfates in Triassic evaporites within the study area (12. 8 < δ 34 S < 14. 0 ‰). The δ 34 S values in base-metal sulfides from both study areas (2. 6 – 9. 5 ‰) and the presence of bacterial relics suggest involvement of bacterially-mediated sulfate reduction in the mineralization. The present Pb isotope data are homogeneous with ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁴Pb, ²⁰⁷Pb/ 204 Pb and ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁴Pb ratios of 18. 723 – 18. 783, 15. 667 – 15. 685 and 38. 806 – 38. 889, respectively, which suggest a single source reservoir of Pb at depth in the upper crust. The syn-diagenetic mineralization in the Bahloul Formation and the calculated age from the Pb isotopic data suggest an Upper Cretaceous age for the Pb–Zn {{deposits in}} the Guern Halfaya and Bou Grine areas. During this period, NE–SW to ENE–WSW trending regional extensional tectonic structures likely favored migration of mineralizing fluids and eventual deposition at Guern Halfaya and Bou Grine...|$|R
