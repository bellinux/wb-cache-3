5|$|Leonardo's dissections and {{documentation}} of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped {{to describe the}} physiology and mechanics of movement. He attempted to identify the source of 'emotions' and their expression. He {{found it difficult to}} incorporate the prevailing system and theories of bodily humours, but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations of bodily functions. He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define atherosclerosis and <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass aorta to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and grass seed to watch flow patterns. Vesalius published his work on anatomy and physiology in De humani corporis fabrica in 1543.|$|E

25|$|Genetic factors: Genetic factors {{predispose}} both to {{alcoholism and}} to alcoholic liver disease.

5000|$|Cirrhosis is the {{formation}} of fibrous tissue (fibrosis) {{in the place of}} liver cells that have died due to a variety of causes, including viral hepatitis, alcohol overconsumption, and other forms of <b>liver</b> toxicity. <b>Cirrhosis</b> causes chronic <b>liver</b> failure.|$|R

25|$|Complications involve {{portal vein}} {{thrombosis}} and splenic vein thrombosis: clotting of blood affects the {{hepatic portal vein}} or varices associated with splenic vein. This can lead to portal hypertension and reduction in blood flow. When a <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> patient is suffering from thrombosis, {{it is not possible}} to perform a liver transplant, unless the thrombosis is very minor. In case of minor thrombosis, there are some chances of survival using cadaveric liver transplant.|$|E
25|$|Hyperestrogenism (elevated {{levels of}} estrogen) {{may be a}} result of {{exogenous}} administration of estrogen or estrogen-like substances, or may {{be a result of}} physiologic conditions such as pregnancy. Any of these causes is linked with an increase in the risk of thrombosis. It's also a symptom of <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis,</b> due to lowered metabolic function of the liver, which metabolises estrogen, leading to spider angioma, palmary erythema, gynecomastia and testicular atrophy in some male patients.|$|E

25|$|The {{prognosis}} {{for people with}} ALD depends on the liver histology as well as cofactors, such as concomitant chronic viral hepatitis. Among patients with alcoholic hepatitis, progression to <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> occurs at 10–20% per year, and 70% will eventually develop cirrhosis. Despite cessation of alcohol use, only 10% will have normalization of histology and serum liver enzyme levels. As previously noted, the MDF {{has been used to}} predict short-term mortality (i.e., MDF ≥ 32 associated with spontaneous survival of 50–65% without corticosteroid therapy, and MDF < 32 associated with spontaneous survival of 90%).The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has also been found to have similar predictive accuracy in 30day (MELD > 11) and 90-day (MELD > 21) mortality. <b>Liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> develops in 6–14% of those who consume more than 60–80 g of alcohol daily for men and more than 20 g daily for women. Even in those who drink more than 120 g daily, only 13.5% will suffer serious alcohol-related liver injury. Nevertheless, alcohol-related mortality was the third leading cause of death in 2003 in the United States. Worldwide mortality is estimated to be 150,000 per year.|$|E
25|$|Upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding {{is from a}} source between the pharynx and the ligament of Treitz. An upper source is characterised by hematemesis (vomiting up blood) and melena (tarry stool containing altered blood). About half of cases are due to peptic ulcer disease (gastric or duodenal ulcers). Esophageal inflammation and erosive disease are the next most common causes. In those with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis,</b> 50–60% of bleeding is due to esophageal varices. Approximately half of those with peptic ulcers have an H. pylori infection. Other causes include Mallory-Weiss tears, cancer, and angiodysplasia.|$|E
