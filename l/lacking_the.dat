5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} from two specimens: a damaged cranium (skull without mandibles, or lower jaws) <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> back part (the parietal bones and further back) {{as well as}} the incisors, canines, and second premolars; and another damaged cranium <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> same parts {{as well as the}} left toothrow. Both show no {{evidence}} of ongoing tooth replacement, indicating that the permanent dentition is complete. M.macpheei was larger in most measurements than M.brevicaudata, but because of small samples, some differences are not statistically significant. The length of the bony palate in the two specimens of M.macpheei is 9.4 and 9.7mm, compared to 7.1 to 9.0mm in eight adult M.brevicaudata. In both specimens, the length of the molar row is 3.0mm, compared to 2.4 to 2.8mm in the sample of M.brevicaudata.|$|E
5|$|The Programming Language Committee was not well-known, however. The vice-president, William Rinehuls, {{complained that}} two-thirds of the COBOL {{community}} did not know of the committee's existence. It was also poor, <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> funds to make public documents, such as minutes of meetings and change proposals, freely available.|$|E
5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the same locality represents a partially articulated skeleton that is only <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> tail. Likewise stored at the IVPP, the specimen has the collection number IVPP V13898. The specimen was described in a brief correspondence authored by Li, Olivier Rieppel, and Michael LaBarbera that was published by Science in September 2004; a more detailed description was subsequently published by Rieppel, Li, Nicholas Fraser in a 2008 Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology paper.|$|E

50|$|It is in La {{relation}} d'objet that Lacan {{introduces the}} algebraic {{symbol for the}} barred Other, and lack comes to designate <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of <b>the</b> signifier in the Other. Then {{the relation of the}} subject to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of <b>the</b> signifier in the Other, designates the signifier of a <b>lack</b> in <b>the</b> Other. No matter how many signifiers one adds to the signifying chain, the chain is always incomplete, it always <b>lacks</b> <b>the</b> signifier that could complete it. This missing signifier is then constitutive of the subject.|$|R
5|$|Although no flight-deck cruisers {{were ever}} {{built by the}} U.S. Navy, the Soviet Union's , {{developed}} in the 1970s, is remarkably {{similar to that of}} the original flight-deck cruiser design, featuring an angled flight deck aft with anti-ship missile launchers forwards. In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the installation of a flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end a much more modest conversion, <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> flight deck, was carried out.|$|E
5|$|Because fossils {{identifiable}} as P. sternbergi {{are found}} {{exclusively in the}} lower layers of the Niobrara Formation, and P. longiceps fossils exclusively in the upper layers, a fossil <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> skull can be identified based on {{its position in the}} geologic column (though for many early fossil finds, precise data about its location was not recorded, rendering many fossils unidentifiable).|$|E
5|$|Both {{species were}} {{formerly}} recognized {{as belonging to}} Theriosuchus; K. guimarotae was initially named as T. guimarotae, and specimens of K. langenbergensis were initially referred to T. pusillus upon their discovery. Schwarz and colleagues recognized a number of characteristics that united these two taxa {{to the exclusion of}} other species of Theriosuchus; in particular, Knoetschkesuchus only has two distinct types of teeth, <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> leaf-shaped teeth seen in other atoposaurids. Other distinguishing traits include the relatively wide skull, and the presence of the antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in all life stages.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide a {{critique}} of behavioural economics or nudging {{as a basis for}} practical policy making purposes. While behavioural economics operates as a plausible critique of standard neoclassical economics, it suffers from the same methodological errors inherent within that tradition. Just as socialist planners <b>lacked</b> <b>the</b> information (and incentives) to allocate resources across an entire economy and economists <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> information to optimally correct externalities, so too libertarian paternalists <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> information to second guess consumer preferences and opportunity costs...|$|R

5|$|By early July 1907 Shackleton {{had secured}} little {{financial}} support beyond Beardmore's guarantee and was <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> funds {{to complete the}} refit of the ship. In mid-July he approached the philanthropic Earl of Iveagh, otherwise known as Edward Guinness, head of the Anglo-Irish brewing family, who agreed to guarantee the sum of £2,000 (updated value £) provided that Shackleton found other backers to contribute a further £6,000. Shackleton {{was able to do}} this, the extra funds including £2,000 from Sir Philip Brocklehurst, who paid this sum to secure a place on the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island {{is heavily}} vegetated, and most islets possess three ringed zones of vegetation: an {{outermost}} herb mat, typically composed mainly of Heliotropium anomalum; an inward zone of shrub, primarily Heliotropium foertherianum; and a central forested region, typically dominated by groves of Pisonia grandis trees. Coconut palms {{have also been}} introduced and exist in substantial quantities on the larger islets. This pattern of vegetation is consistent across the larger islets, with smaller islets <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> central forest and the smallest vegetated solely by low herbs. Other common plants include Suriana maritima and Morinda citrifolia.|$|E

Four depleted panzer divisions were not enough to defeat the First US Army. The disastrous Operation Lüttich drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.|$|E
5|$|For example, infant {{formulas}} traditionally were <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> MFGM {{because this}} fraction is lost during regular dairy processing. However, more {{recent advances in}} technology have facilitated the separation of MFGM from the fat globule, allowing bovine MFGM to be added in concentrated form. The MFGM fraction is now commercially available and {{can be added to}} infant formula or other nutritional products.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, {{plans for}} a HIAG {{convention}} in Göttingen faced strong opposition from the local Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Jewish Council, the Students' Association and the University hierarchy.

5|$|It {{had been}} also conjectured that the double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave {{aromatic}} character to that system, {{was important for}} the carbene's stability. This conjecture was disproved in 1995 by Arduengo's group, who obtained a derivative of dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> double bond. The thermodynamical stability in this compound, {{and the role of}} steric protection in preventing dimerisation, has been a topic of some dispute.|$|E

5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping. The hands had four fingers, <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> innermost finger of the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and {{could be used to}} manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes.|$|E
