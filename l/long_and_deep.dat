5|$|The {{road was}} {{constructed}} following World War I {{in order to}} provide improved access to the ports at Avonmouth Docks, which had replaced Bristol Harbour as the major local centre for commercial shipping. Upon opening on 2 July 1926, it was the single most expensive road project in Britain, costing £800,000 (now about £ million). The construction posed a number of significant engineering challenges, including <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>deep</b> rock cuttings, a viaduct over the River Trym, and retaining walls against the gorge adjacent to the River Avon. Falling rocks have since been a problem along the Portway, particularly at the southern end close to the Clifton Suspension Bridge, with concrete canopies constructed to prevent loose rock and assist with remedial work.|$|E
25|$|Flowing west {{through the}} {{mountains}} from its source in the Sierra Valley the Middle Fork is joined by Big Grizzly Creek, which drains Lake Davis to the north. Then the river flows through Portola and Delleker in the Humbug Valley. Sulphur Creek joins in the Mohawk Valley, just upriver from Graegle. Continuing west, the Middle Fork passes the small settlement of Sloat in Long Valley, then enters a <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>deep</b> gorge. It is joined by numerous small tributaries. The Pacific Crest Trail crosses near Onion Valley Creek. The Middle Fork turns to flow southwest and south, through Bald Rock Canyon and into the middle arm of Lake Oroville.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, a {{delegation}} from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt visited Sudan and held various meetings {{inside the country}} advocating and explaining their ideology. Sudan has a <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>deep</b> history with the Muslim Brotherhood compared to many other countries. By April 1949, the first branch of the Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood organization emerged. However, simultaneously, many Sudanese students studying in Egypt {{were introduced to the}} ideology of the Brotherhood. The Muslim student groups also began organizing in the universities during the 1940s, and the Brotherhood's main support base has remained to be college educated. In order to unite them, in 1954, a conference was held, attended by various representatives from different groups that appeared to have the same ideology. The conference voted to establish a Unified Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood Organization based on the teachings of Imam Hassan Al-banna.|$|E

25|$|To {{extend the}} attack {{front of the}} Fourth Army, a {{subsidiary}} attack was planned at Gommecourt, forgoing a counter-attack at Vimy Ridge to recapture the ground lost in Unternehmen Schleswig-Holstein, a local German attack on 21 May, lacking the troops to conduct both attacks. In {{the first week of}} May, the 56th (1st London) Division (Major-General Charles Hull) and the 46th (North Midland) Division (Major-General Edward James Montagu-Stuart-Wortley) moved into the VII Corps (Lieutenant-General Thomas Snow) area for the attack. By 10 May, both divisions had taken over the front on the right flank of the 37th Division (Major-General A. Edward W. Count Gleichen). The 46th (North Midland) Division had to dig many <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>deep</b> communications trenches to counter the German observation over the area but in the 56th (1st London) Division area opposite the south-western face of the salient as far as Nameless Farm the trenches of both sides were level, with a dip in between, with a hedge along the bottom. Further on, both lines were {{on the west side of}} a wide valley between Rossignol Wood and Hébuterne, the British line on a forward and the German line on a reverse slope, with German artillery observation posts on the east side of the valley. The rear area of the 56th (1st London) Division was invisible to ground observers up to Hébuterne but German balloon observers kept watch. The main British posts were along the eastern fringe of Hébuterne and the ridge running south; the valley slope drained water from the area but on the 46th (North Midland) Division front the flat ground was boggy.|$|E
500|$|The concert program {{received}} a positive reception. The Oregonian David Stabler wrote {{that during the}} May 7 performance the orchestra displayed peak condition and [...] "played with a precision and intensity {{that would have been}} unattainable a decade ago". He complimented Sylvan's diction and [...] "emotional engagement", but noted that some words were difficult to make out. Stabler called the timpanist's performance during Britten's symphony [...] "fierce" [...] and the orchestra's playing [...] "clear and intentional". In his review of the Carnegie Hall performance, Stabler opined that the Oregon Symphony's program (which he described as one of [...] "rage, brutality and fleeting beauty that required the utmost precision and ferocity from the musicians") focused more on playing, while the programs by other orchestras drew attention to the music. Stabler wrote: [...] "Everyone knows orchestras are fighting to survive, but on this night, the Oregon Symphony breathed <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>deep</b> of triumph." [...] In a separate article summarizing reviews by New York critics, Stabler called the Symphony a [...] "virtuosos band" [...] that [...] "now plays with more acute rhythmic precision, more clarity, more informed style... and more extreme dynamics and tempos". James Bash of Oregon Music News wrote a positive review of the New York performance, describing it as more enhanced, dramatic and intense than the Portland concerts, partly because of the venue's superior acoustics. Bash described the orchestra's performance of The Unanswered Question as [...] "compelling and auspicious" [...] and wrote that Sylvan's vocals during The Wound-Dresser [...] "conveyed the sensitive text superbly". In addition to complimenting the Symphony overall, Bash singled out solo performers by name. After noting the audience's enthusiastic response to the performance, including multiple bravos and particular recognition for Kalmar, Bash quipped [...] "the Oregon Symphony may be regional in terms of size and budget, but they are world-class when they play".|$|E
2500|$|At Hamilton the 1st FW was an {{administrative}} {{organization of the}} ADC 26th Air Division.

[...] As the Vietnam War wound down, Headquarters Tactical Air Command was directed to preserve the lineage of many units which had command-controlled designations that gave them no history or traditions.
