5|$|Python uses dynamic typing and {{a mix of}} {{reference}} counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. An important feature of Python is dynamic name resolution (<b>late</b> <b>binding),</b> which binds method and variable names during program execution.|$|E
25|$|In most {{object-oriented}} languages, {{calls to}} methods are represented physically by a pointer to the code in memory. This restricts {{the design of}} an application since specific command handling classes are needed, usually organized according to the chain-of-responsibility pattern. While Cocoa retains this approach for the most part, Objective-C's <b>late</b> <b>binding</b> opens up more flexibility.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic type {{checking}} is {{the process}} of verifying the type safety of a program at runtime. Implementations of dynamically type-checked languages generally associate each runtime object with a type tag (i.e., a reference to a type) containing its type information. This runtime type information (RTTI) {{can also be used to}} implement dynamic dispatch, <b>late</b> <b>binding,</b> downcasting, reflection, and similar features.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{binding time}} {{analysis}} imposes {{a distinction between}} the computations to be performed early (e. g. at compile-time) and those to be performed late (e. g. at run-time). For the 位-calculus this distinction is formalized by a two-level 位-calculus. We present an algorithm for static analysis of the binding times of a typed 位-calculus with products, sums, lists and general recursive types. Given partial information about the binding times of some of the subexpressions it will complete that information such that (i) early bindings may be turned into <b>late</b> <b>bindings</b> but not vice versa, (ii) the resulting two-level 位-expression reflects our intuition about binding times, e. g. that early bindings are performed before <b>late</b> <b>bindings,</b> and (iii) as few changes as possible have been made compared with the initial binding information. The results can be applied in the implementation of functional languages and in semantics directed compiling...|$|R

25|$|Under Objective-C, {{methods are}} {{represented}} by a selector, a string describing the method to call. When a message is sent, the selector is sent into the Objective-C runtime, matched against a list of available methods, and the method's implementation is called. Since the selector is text data, this lets it be saved to a file, transmitted over a network or between processes, or manipulated in other ways. The implementation of the method is looked up at runtime, not compile time. There is a small performance penalty for this, but <b>late</b> <b>binding</b> allows the same selector to reference different implementations.|$|E
25|$|By {{a similar}} token, Cocoa {{provides}} a pervasive data manipulation method called key-value coding (KVC). This allows {{a piece of}} data or property of an object to be looked up or changed at runtime by name. The property name acts {{as a key to}} the value. In traditional languages, this <b>late</b> <b>binding</b> is impossible. KVC leads to great design flexibility. An object's type need not be known, yet any property of that object can be discovered using KVC. Also, by extending this system using something Cocoa terms key-value observing (KVO), automatic support for undo-redo is provided.|$|E
2500|$|Apple {{intended}} Swift {{to support}} many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread <b>late</b> <b>binding,</b> extensible programming and similar features, but [...] "safer" [...] (easier to catch software bugs); Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointers and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports {{the concept of}} protocol extensibility, an extensibility system {{that can be applied}} to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term [...] "protocol-oriented programming" [...] (similar to traits).|$|E
25|$|<b>Late</b> static <b>binding</b> is {{a variant}} of binding somewhere between static and dynamic binding. The binding of names before the program is run is called static (early); {{bindings}} performed as the program runs are dynamic (late or virtual).|$|R

2500|$|Dynamic linking or <b>late</b> <b>binding</b> is linking {{performed}} while {{a program}} is being loaded (load time) or executed (run time), rather {{than when the}} executable file is created. A dynamically linked library (dynamic-link library or DLL under Windows and OS/2; dynamic shared object or DSO under Unix-like systems) is a library intended for dynamic linking. Only a minimum amount of work {{is done by the}} linker when the executable file is created; it only records what library routines the program needs and the index names or numbers of the routines in the library. The majority of the work of linking is done at the time the application is loaded (load time) or during execution (run time). Usually, the necessary linking program, called a [...] "dynamic linker" [...] or [...] "linking loader", is actually part of the underlying operating system. [...] (However, it is possible, and not exceedingly difficult, to write a program that uses dynamic linking and includes its own dynamic linker, even for an operating system that itself provides no support for dynamic linking.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Prior to version 4, C# {{only allowed}} <b>late</b> <b>binding</b> via the {{appropriate}} reflection API. A different API {{would be needed}} for each of [...]NET, COM, and DLR objects. With C# 4, the language gained the [...] "dynamic" [...] pseudo-type. This would be used {{in place of the}} Object type to indicate that <b>late</b> <b>binding</b> is desired. The specific <b>late</b> <b>binding</b> mechanism needed is determined at runtime using the Dynamic Language Runtime as a starting point.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic {{dispatch}} {{is different}} from <b>late</b> <b>binding</b> (also known as dynamic binding). In the context of selecting an operation, binding associates a name to an operation. Dispatching chooses an implementation for the operation after you have decided which operation a name refers to. With dynamic dispatch, the name may be bound to a polymorphic operation at compile time, but the implementation not be chosen until run time. While dynamic dispatch does not imply <b>late</b> <b>binding,</b> <b>late</b> <b>binding</b> does imply dynamic dispatching since the binding is what determines the set of available dispatches.|$|E

40|$|By {{allowing}} service {{calls to}} be guarded by contexts, Asymmetric Event Struc-tures (AES for short) and contextual nets are a convenient framework to model composite Web services or service orchestrations. We equip AES with QoS domains {{as a framework}} to capture a number of QoS metrics and their combi-nation. We use the resulting model to formalize QoS-based <b>late</b> service <b>binding</b> in composite services. When subject to QoS-based <b>late</b> service <b>binding,</b> compos-ite services may be non-monotonic with respect to QoS, meaning that strictly improving the QoS of a service may strictly decrease the end-to-end QoS of the composite service, an embarrassing feature for QoS-aware management; we study this issue.

40|$|The {{power of}} a {{programming}} language depends to a significant extent on its semantics of expression evaluation. It is therefore rewarding and popular to emulate nonexistent evaluation features by library constructs. For instance, one can emulate the functional programming idiom of a (partially) unbound function in an imperative language by providing special functor types. Their instances are created anonymously and represent <b>late</b> <b>bindings</b> if used as function arguments. This approach is of limited scalability to further emulations in this style, because each function implementation has to account for any possible combination of such special argument types. We propose a library-based framework that systematically supports the emulation of evaluation semantics without increasing the complexity order of function implementations. C++ as implementation language allows applying these constructs statically and therefore to avoid performance penalties at run time...|$|R

50|$|An Intent in the Android {{operating}} {{system is a}} software mechanism that allows users to coordinate the functions of different activities to achieve a task. An Intent is a messaging object which provides a facility for performing <b>late</b> runtime <b>binding</b> between the code in different applications in the Android development environment. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, {{where it can be}} thought of as the glue between activities: Intents provide an inter-application messaging system that encourages collaboration and component reuse.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic binding and delimited {{control are}} useful {{together}} in many settings, including Web applications, database cursors, and mobile code. We examine this pair of language features {{to show that}} the semantics of their interaction is ill-defined yet not expressive enough for these uses. We solve this open and subtle problem. We formalise a typed language DB+DC that combines a calculus DB of dynamic binding and a calculus DC of delimited control. We argue from theoretical and practical points of view that its semantics should be based on delimited dynamic binding: capturing a delimited continuation closes over part of the dynamic environment, rather than all or none of it; reinstating the captured continuation supplements the dynamic environment, rather than replacing or inheriting it. We introduce a type- and reduction-preserving translation from DB + DC to DC, which proves that delimited control macro-expresses dynamic binding. We use this translation to implement DB + DC in Scheme, OCaml, and Haskell. We extend DB + DC with mutable dynamic variables and a facility to obtain not only the <b>latest</b> <b>binding</b> of a dynamic variable but also older bindings. This facility provides for stack inspection and (more generally) folding over the execution context as an inductive data structure...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, Java can use <b>late</b> <b>binding</b> {{using its}} {{reflection}} APIs and type introspection {{much in the}} same way it is done in COM and [...]NET programming. Generally speaking those who only program in Java do not call this <b>late</b> <b>binding.</b> Likewise the use of [...] "duck typing" [...] techniques is frowned upon in Java programming, with abstract interfaces used instead.|$|E
