25|$|Filming started near Dublin on 11 April 2016, {{while the}} last two scripts were still being produced. Scenes {{in the setting of}} St Brendan's Catholic Church were filmed at St Matthias' Church, Killiney, on the first two days. On-location filming also took place in Dalkey's Coliemore Harbour between 5 and 11 May. Six weeks of on-location filming took place in the village of Dunmore East in County Waterford, {{starting}} on 25 May 2016. The scripts called for a seaside town or village and out of the options found by the <b>location</b> <b>management</b> team, Dunmore East was chosen. Dunmore East was essentially renamed to Redwater during filming, with the local council and businesses getting involved. Various locations in the village were used, including the beach, church, The Strand Inn and The Spinnaker Bar, with filming at The Strand Inn starting immediately, and interior filming at The Spinnaker Bar lasting three days from 31 May to 2 June 2016. The Strand Inn was used for five separate fictional locations in the series: a tourism office, restaurant, surf shop, sushi bar, and the exterior of the pub, called Peter Dolan's in the series, for which the facade of The Strand Inn was transformed. A country fair, called The Winking Fish, was set up outside The Strand Inn for the purpose of filming. The nearby village of Passage East was also used for filming. Filming ended on 26 July 2016. Wallace filmed some of her own stunts, including jumping from a boat into the sea and an underwater sequence, which were filmed in Dublin. Some filming was also done at Magheramore beach, County Wicklow, including a scene filmed at midnight where mist was created over the sea. The series was filmed with a single camera.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper actualizes the {{classification}} of <b>location</b> <b>management</b> methods published up to now and presents results of a related extensive performance comparison {{of the most important}} paradigms for <b>location</b> <b>management</b> in cellular networks. First, a universal structure of a performance analysis framework for <b>location</b> <b>management</b> methods is defined and analyzed. Then, both a user mobility model and a specific simulation environment claiming to be as realistic as possible are suggested and implemented. Finally, the simulation framework obtained is used for a systematic comparative performance analysis of a representative sample of the most important <b>location</b> <b>management</b> schemes. The overall conclusion is that a location-area based <b>location</b> <b>management</b> method designed around a profile or history-based direction information offers the absolute best performance, in terms of <b>location</b> <b>management</b> cost, compared to all other alternative approaches. The key difference from previous works in literature is clearly underlined concerning both mobility modeling and novel <b>location</b> <b>management</b> schemes.

40|$|<b>Location</b> <b>management</b> is a {{key issue}} in {{personal}} communication service (PCS) networks. Performance analysis plays important roles {{in the implementation of}} <b>location</b> <b>management</b> methods and system design in PCS networks. Existing PCS networks have the home location registers (HLRs) and visitor location registers (VLRs) architecture for <b>location</b> <b>management.</b> Some interesting dynamic <b>location</b> <b>management</b> methods are proposed to improve the system performance of PCS networks. However, the existing performance analysis of the dynamic <b>location</b> <b>management</b> methods are too simple and not available for PCS networks with real HLR/VLR architecture. One of the reasons is the complexity and difficulty of the problem. In this paper, we challenge the problem and successfully establish a new analytical model available for the analysis of the important dynamic movement-based <b>location</b> <b>management</b> method for PCS networks...|$|E
40|$|<b>Location</b> <b>management</b> is an {{important}} problem in distributed mobile computing. <b>Location</b> <b>management</b> consists of location updates, searches and search-updates. An update occurs when a mobile host changes location. A search occurs when a mobile host needs to be located. A search-update occurs after a successful search. Various strategies can be designed for search, update and search-update. Static <b>location</b> <b>management</b> uses one combination of search, update and searchupdate strategies throughout the execution. Simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of different static strategies for various communication and mobility patterns. Simulation results indicate that performing search-updates significantly reduces the message overhead of <b>location</b> <b>management.</b> 1 Introduction <b>Location</b> <b>management</b> is {{an important}} problem in distributed mobile computing. <b>Location</b> <b>management</b> consists of location updates, searches and searchupdates: An update occurs when a mobile host changes location.
