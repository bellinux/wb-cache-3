5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Unlike galagos, {{which have}} longer legs than arms, slow lorises have {{arms and legs}} of nearly equal length. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to <b>leg</b> <b>length)</b> averages 89, {{indicating}} that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs. As with the slender lorises, their arms are slightly longer than their body, but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} size of {{the hands}} and feet in pterosaurs (by comparison with modern animals such as birds) may indicate the type of lifestyle pterosaurs led on the ground. Azhdarchid pterosaurs had relatively small feet compared to their body size and <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> with foot length only about 25%–30% {{the length of the}} lower leg. This suggests that azhdarchids were better adapted to walking on dry, relatively solid ground. Pteranodon had slightly larger feet (47% the length of the tibia), while filter-feeding pterosaurs like the ctenochasmatoids had very large feet (69% of tibial length in Pterodactylus, 84% in Pterodaustro), adapted to walking in soft muddy soil, similar to modern wading birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees or in burrows. Frogs {{must be able to}} move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help them to do so. Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were, with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose. The tibia, fibula, and tarsals have been fused into a single, strong bone, as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs (which must absorb the impact on landing). The metatarsals have become elongated to add to the <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and allow frogs to push against the ground for a longer period on take-off. The illium has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the sacrum which, in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. The tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis. This enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during a leap.|$|E

Thesis. First Counselor: Prof. Dr. Muchsin Doewes, dr., AIFO. Second Counselor: Dr. Sapta Kunta Purnama, M. Pd. Sport Science Program, Postgraduate Program, Sebelas Maret University of Surakarta. This study aims {{to determine}} the relationship both single and double between <b>length</b> <b>legs</b> variable, leg muscles strength, arm span and maximum volume of oxygen to the achievement of 100 -meter front crawl swimming style and how large the contribution of each variable. This research used a descriptive method with correlation analysis. This study’s population is fostering student achievement and swimming of JPOK FKIP UNS & UTP Surakarta totaling 33 people. The variables of this study consist of four independent variables. They are <b>legs</b> <b>length,</b> <b>leg</b> muscles strength, arm span and maximal oxygen volume.

25|$|While Homo habilis was {{certainly}} bipedal, its long arms {{are indicative of}} an arboreal adaptation. Homo erectus had longer legs and shorter arms, revealing a transition to obligate terrestriality, though it remains unclear how this change in relative <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> {{might have been an}} advantage. Sheer body size, on the other hand, seems to have allowed for better walking energy efficiency and endurance. A larger Homo erectus would also dehydrate more slowly and could thus cover greater distances before facing thermoregulatory limitations. The ability for prolonged walking at a normal pace would have been a decisive factor for effective colonisation of Eurasia.|$|E

25|$|Mechanical power (work {{per unit}} time) and the {{distance}} over which that power is applied (e.g., <b>leg</b> <b>length)</b> are the key determinants of jump distance and height. As a result, many jumping animals have long legs and muscles that are optimized for maximal power according to the force-velocity relationship of muscles. The maximum power output of muscles is limited, however. To circumvent this limitation, many jumping species slowly pre-stretch elastic elements, such as tendons or apodemes, to store work as strain energy. Such elastic elements can release energy {{at a much higher}} rate (higher power) than equivalent muscle mass, thus increasing launch energy to levels beyond what muscle alone is capable of.|$|E
25|$|As in all Macronaria, the forelimbs of brachiosaurids {{are long}} {{relative}} to the hindlimbs, but this trait is more pronounced in brachiosaurids. The forelimbs were very slender for a sauropod and the metacarpal bones of the forelimb were elongated. These adaptations overall increased the stride length of the forelimbs, arguably resulting in an uneven gait. However, it was previously argued that they were hindlimb dominant like other sauropods, and thus {{had the ability to}} rear up on their hindlimbs. Based on the structure of their legs, making it impossible for them to run, it is likely that they moved about in a low walking speed (20–40km/day), but were capable of moving faster when necessary, up to 20–30km/hour, depending on <b>leg</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

A modern acetabulum component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials.|$|E

25|$|Evolution has {{provided}} the human body with two distinct features: the specialization of the upper limb for visually guided manipulation and the lower limb's development into a mechanism specifically adapted for efficient bipedal gait. While the capacity to walk upright {{is not unique to}} humans, other primates can only achieve this for short periods and at a great expenditure of energy. The human adaption to bipedalism {{is not limited to the}} leg, however, but has also affected the location of the body's center of gravity, the reorganisation of internal organs, and the form and biomechanism of the trunk. In humans, the double S-shaped vertebral column acts as a shock-absorber which shifts the weight from the trunk over the load-bearing surface of the feet. The human legs are exceptionally long and powerful as a result of their exclusive specialization to support and locomotion— in orangutans the <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> is 111% of the trunk; in chimpanzees 128%, and in humans 171%. Many of the leg's muscles are also adapted to bipedalism, most substantially the gluteal muscles, the extensors of the knee joint, and the calf muscles.|$|E
25|$|The femoral {{component}} is the component that fits in the femur (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped {{to accept the}} femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There {{are two types of}} fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic bone cement to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a Morse taper. These options allow for variability in <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.|$|E
25|$|As worker ants grow {{to larger}} sizes, {{the shape of}} the head changes, due to the head length growing {{at the same time as}} the total body length, and the head width may grow by 20%. The length of the {{antennae}} only grows slowly; the antennae may only grow 60% longer by the time the body doubles its length, thus the relative antennal length decreases by 20% as the length of the body doubles. All individual legs of the body are isometric with body length meaning that even when the length of the body doubles, the legs will also double. However, not all of the legs are the same length; the prothoracic portion accounts for 29% of <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> the mesothoracic 31%, and the metathoracic 41%. The first two pairs of legs are of equal length to one another, whereas the final pair is longer. Overall, the morphological appearance of a worker changes dramatically when it grows larger. The head exhibits the greatest shape change and the height of the alinotum grows quicker than its length, where a height/length ratio of 0.27 in minor workers and 0.32 in major workers is seen. Due to this, larger workers tend to have a humped-shape and robust alinotum in contrast to smaller workers. No petiole segment exhibits any change in shape as the size of the body changes. The width of the gaster grows more rapidly than its length, where the width may be 96% of its length but increases to 106%.|$|E
