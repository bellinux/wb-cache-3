25|$|Even so, {{volcanic}} outgassing {{could not}} have accounted {{for the amount of}} water in Earth's oceans. The vast majority of the water —and arguably carbon— necessary for <b>life</b> <b>must</b> have come from the outer Solar System, away from the Sun's heat, where it could remain solid. Comets impacting with the Earth in the Solar System's early years would have deposited vast amounts of water, along with the other volatile compounds life requires onto the early Earth, providing a kick-start to the origin of life.|$|E
25|$|A {{theory that}} speaks to {{the origin of life}} on Earth and other rocky planets posits life as an {{information}} system in which information content grows because of selection. <b>Life</b> <b>must</b> start with minimum possible information, or minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, and it requires thermodynamically free energy accessible by means of its information content. The most benign circumstances, minimum entropy variations with abundant free energy, suggest the pore space in the first few kilometres of the surface. Free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula.|$|E
25|$|Darwin {{was still}} researching and experimenting with his ideas on natural {{selection}} {{when he received}} a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace describing a theory very similar to his own. This led to an immediate joint publication of both theories. Both Wallace and Darwin saw the history of life like a family tree, with each fork in the tree’s limbs being a common ancestor. The tips of the limbs represented modern species and the branches represented the common ancestors that are shared amongst many different species. To explain these relationships, Darwin said that all living things were related, and this meant that all <b>life</b> <b>must</b> be descended from a few forms, or even from a single common ancestor. He called this process descent with modification.|$|E

25|$|Tensions {{between the}} French {{company and the}} {{government}} were longstanding. The government of Niger had concluded a deal with a Chinese state owned company China Nuclear International Uranium Corporation (SinoU) to begin mining at Teguida, {{in the midst of}} the Tuareg winter pasturing lands and the fall Cure Salee festival at Ingall. The government expected a greater share of the proceeds of these new mines than it has received from the Arlit operations dominated by the former colonial power. More than a dozen prospecting contracts have been offered to companies from Canada and Europe as well, and there are also worries amongst the French that the Arlit mines, nearing the end of their useful <b>life,</b> <b>must</b> soon be replaced by new concessions. Areva has begun work on a new mine outside Arlit, but even prior to this conflict, it was not expected to be operational for a number of years.|$|E

500|$|Among the {{earliest}} widespread criticisms of Riley were opinions that his dialect writing {{did not actually}} represent the true dialect of central Indiana. In 1970 Peter Revell wrote that Riley's dialect was more similar to the poor speech of a child rather than the dialect of his region. Revell made extensive comparison to historical texts and Riley's dialect usage. Philip Greasley wrote that while [...] "some critics have dismissed him as sub-literary, insincere, and an artificial entertainer, his defenders reply that an author so popular with {{millions of people in}} different walks of <b>life</b> <b>must</b> contribute something of value, and that his faults, if any, can be ignored." ...|$|E
500|$|Wellek and Warren {{describe}} three {{views of}} a biographical approach, of which only one– the biographical aspects relating {{to the production of}} a work– can be of use; this use, however, is limited. They reject the views that works accurately reflect the author's life or that the author's <b>life</b> <b>must</b> be understood in order to understand a particular work. According to Wellek and Warren, works may indeed reflect the author's experiences, but they may also reflect an author's hopes and dreams, or literary tradition and convention, and as such are [...] "not a document for biography". Likewise, an understanding of personal style (what makes a work [...] "Miltonic", [...] "Keatsian", [...] "Shakespearean", or [...] "Virgilian") does not rely on knowledge of the author's life. They conclude that [...] "it seems dangerous to ascribe to [...] any real critical importance", and that such approaches, if undertaken at all, should be done with a [...] "sense" [...] of the distinctions outlined above.|$|E
500|$|Shadows on the Wall's Rich Kline {{noted that}} the storyline was [...] "compelling and eye-opening" [...] and praised the actors as [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "committed to getting the truth out." [...] He was {{impressed}} with the [...] "lively and fascinating sense of local culture" [...] that dominated the film. Kline, who gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, was mainly concerned with the film's [...] "rather clumsy" [...] direction and screenwriting. Maseko directed with [...] "energy and verve," [...] though his [...] "struggles to capture the human drama" [...] led to the impression that Drum was [...] "a clunky TV movie, with awkward camera angles, wonky editing and clumsy sound recording." [...] Filardi was guilty of a dialogue which [...] "echoes with cliches, while contrived plotting put characters into situations that may be true, but they feel corny and movie-like." [...] Kline also criticised the wide variety of political issues that characterised the film, though added that [...] "maybe this helps us begin to understand what <b>life</b> <b>must</b> have been like under such an oppressive government." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the {{emotional}} {{gulf between the}} state of his domestic affairs {{and the loss of}} his special friendship informs the reading of [...] "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of domesticity. At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth; he said that the poem [...] "gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life". On another occasion, the poet stated, [...] "There is more about myself in Ulysses, which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still <b>life</b> <b>must</b> be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of his loss upon me than many poems in In Memoriam." [...] Hallam's death influenced much of Tennyson's poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, In Memoriam A.H.H., begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.|$|E
500|$|Dunham {{was known}} as Stanley [...] Ann Dunham through high school, then as Ann Dunham, Ann Obama, Ann Soetoro, Ann Sutoro (after her second divorce), and finally as Ann Dunham.:Anyone writing about Dunham's <b>life</b> <b>must</b> address the {{question}} of what to call her. She was Stanley Ann Dunham at birth and Stanley Ann as a child, but dropped the Stanley upon graduating from high school. She was Ann Dunham, then Ann Obama, then Ann Soetoro until her second divorce. Then she kept her husband's name but modernized the spelling to Sutoro. In the early 1980s, she was Ann Sutoro, Ann Dunham Sutoro, S. Ann Dunham Sutoro. In conversation, Indonesians who worked with her in the late 1980s and early 1990s referred to her as Ann Dunham, putting the emphasis on the second syllable of the surname. Toward the end of her life, she signed her dissertation S. Ann Dunham and official correspondence (Stanley) Ann Dunham.:modernized the spelling: The spelling of certain Indonesian words changed after Indonesia gained its independence from the Dutch in 1949, and again under a 1972 agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia... Names containing oe,... are now often spelled with a u... However, older spellings are still used in some personal names... After her divorce from Lolo Soetoro, Ann Dunham kept his last name {{for a number of years}} while she was still working in Indonesia, but she changed the spelling to Sutoro. Their daughter, Maya Soetoro-Ng, chose to keep the traditional spelling of her Indonesian surname. Born in Wichita, Kansas, Dunham spent her childhood in California, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas, her teenage years in Mercer Island, Washington, and most of her adult life in Hawaii and Indonesia.|$|E
500|$|With Shadar defeated, Oliver {{prepares to}} return home, but the White Witch appears and casts a spell known as [...] "manna", an ash-like {{substance}} that turns all living beings {{in the three}} major cities into undead-like creatures. A girl named Pea, who has been appearing to Oliver on occasion, travels with the group and uses her magic to clear the cities of manna and restore the people to normal; the group then travel to defeat the White Witch herself. They discover {{that she was a}} young queen called Cassiopeia from thousands of years ago who had noble intentions, but was manipulated by her [...] "council of twelve", calling themselves the Zodiarchs, who desired to run the country. Feeling powerless, she found and used the manna spell, believing it would bring peace and prosperity to her people. When the horrific effects of manna were revealed, she gradually witnessed the death of all of her subjects, including the council, and found herself on her own; she was gradually driven to despair and became the White Witch, believing that all <b>life</b> <b>must</b> be destroyed in an attempt to [...] "start over". Her power created an illusory version of the council to oversee the destruction of the world, but the remains of her kind intentions also created the council member that helped the group by sending them back in time, as well as Pea, the incarnation of her as a child. Having been defeated, Cassiopeia fuses together with Pea and is restored to her former, kind self. After assisting the group in destroying the Zodiarchy, the last manifestations of the council, Cassiopeia declares that she will dedicate her life to making amends for her actions and Oliver bids farewell to his friends before returning to his old life in Motorville.|$|E

Tessa refuses to submit and spreads doubt among them, resulting in Cole finally killing {{one of his own}} men before MacLeod rescues her. Reviewer Rob Lineberger of DVDVerdict.com commented that [...] "...this episode shows the tough stuff Tessa is made of." [...] Tessa is a very selfless character, although it has, occasionally, been known to put her into rather sticky situations, for example, in the episode [...] "See No Evil", Tessa's friend, Natalie, is attacked by serial killer Michael Tanovsky and Tessa uses herself as bait: [...] "Nobody's watching over his next victim, Duncan... and she's going to die if you and I don't stop him." [...] Lineberger commented that [...] ", Tessa gets a taste for how Duncan's <b>life</b> <b>must</b> feel when she faces the killer." [...] She hits Tanovsky with her car, telling MacLeod [...] "I thought ridding the world of evil would feel better than this." [...] Panzer comments that having Tessa stop the killer [...] "...was kind of an unusual idea , and this {{was the subject of a}} lot of meetings with [...] David Abramowitz, myself and the people from the various networks, domestic and foreign, who were involved." [...] Tessa has a reputation for speaking frankly and for refusing to tolerate any nonsense. In [...] "", when MacLeod refuses to take her where an evil Immortal is, she says, [...] "I know why you don't want me there. You're afraid that what happened to Lucas [...] could happen to you." [...] Tessa has no self-pity and [...] "...doesn't like euphemisms". For example, in [...] "For Tomorrow We Die", MacLeod calls her [...] "contrary by nature" [...] Tessa parks her car without regard to interdictions, can drive a speedboat, is a poor chess player and dislikes war.|$|E
