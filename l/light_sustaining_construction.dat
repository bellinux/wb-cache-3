40|$|The U. S. {{housing market}} boom during the mid- 1990 s and early 2000 s {{propelled}} {{rapid growth in}} the U. S. economy. Housing demand rose sharply, spurring an unprecedented run-up in house prices and unleashing a torrent of new construction. The subsequent collapse of the U. S. housing market pushed the U. S. and world economies into steep recessions. While construction eventually rebounded—starting in late 2009 for multifamily housing and in mid- 2011 for single-family housing—it again slowed {{during the first half}} of 2013. The strength of the continuing U. S. economic recovery will depend in part on whether this slowdown proves temporary or longer term. This article examines forces underlying the housing recovery to determine when <b>sustained</b> <b>construction</b> growth will resume. The analysis suggests that very strong multifamily construction growth is likely to resume by early 2014 and that moderately strong singlefamil...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLight-evoked {{excitatory}} cation current (ΔIC) and inhibitory chloride current (ΔICl) of rod and cone bipolar {{cells and}} AII amacrine cells (AIIACs) were recorded from slices of dark-adapted mouse retinas, and alpha ganglion cells were recorded from flatmounts of dark-adapted mouse retinas. The cell morphology was revealed by Lucifer yellow fluorescence with a confocal microscope. ΔIC of all rod depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCRs) exhibited similar high sensitivity to 500 nm light, but two patterns of ΔICl were observed with slightly different axon morphologies. At least {{two types of}} cone depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCCs) were identified: one with axon terminals ramified in 70 – 85 % of IPL depth and DBCR-like ΔIC sensitivity, {{and the other with}} axon terminals ramified in 55 – 75 % of IPL depth and much lower ΔIC sensitivity. The relative rod/cone inputs to DBCs and AIIACs were analyzed by comparing the ΔIC and ΔICl thresholds and dynamic ranges with the corresponding values of rods and cones. On average, the sensitivity of a DBCR to the 500 nm light is about 20 times higher than that of a rod. The sensitivity of an AIIAC is more than 1000 times higher than that of a rod, suggesting that AIIAC responses are pooled through a coupled network of about 40 AIIACs. Interactions of rod and cone signals in dark-adapted mouse retinas appear asymmetrical: rod signals spread into the cone system more efficiently than cone signals into the rod system. The mouse synaptic circuitry allows small rod signals to be highly amplified and effectively transmitted to the cone system via rod/cone and AIIAC/DBCC coupling. Three types of alpha ganglion cells (αGCs) were identified. (1) ONGCs exhibits no spike activity in darkness, increased spikes in <b>light,</b> <b>sustained</b> inward ΔIC, sustained outward ΔICl of varying amplitude, and large soma (20 – 25 μm in diameter) with an alpha-cell-like dendritic field about 180 – 350 μm stratifying near 70 % of the IPL depth. (2) Transient OFFαGCs (tOFFαGCs) exhibit no spike activity in darkness, transient increased spikes at <b>light</b> offset, small <b>sustained</b> outward ΔIC in light, a large transient inward ΔIC at <b>light</b> offset, a <b>sustained</b> outward ΔICl, and a morphology similar to the ONαGCs except for that their dendrites stratified near 30 % of the IPL depth. (3) Sustained OFFα GCs (sOFFαGCs) exhibit maintained spike activity of 5 – 10 Hz in darkness, sustained decrease of spikes in <b>light,</b> <b>sustained</b> outward ΔIC, sustained outward ΔICl, and a morphology similar to the tOFFαGCs. By comparing the response thresholds and dynamic ranges of αGCs with those of the pre-ganglion cells, our data suggest that the light responses of each type of αGCs are mediated by different sets of bipolar cells and amacrine cells...|$|R

However, authors sustain that not all are sufficiently informed about the current challenges, problems and advances regarding this industry and by this reason many valuable knowledge get lost. Understand the existence of different realities about construction, the shortages of information and state of the art is crucial to propose and implement strategies to support practical solutions. As a part of an on-going investigation, this research includes the revision of the nature, significance and challenges faced by the construction and makes reference to competitive policies, lessons learned and sustainable construction while knowledge management is emphasized as a key element to <b>sustain</b> <b>construction</b> competitiveness.

40|$|Construction {{projects}} are {{a high risk}} business activity. When undertaking projects in an international context, it is further complicated by the risk of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates (FOREX). Construction business performance is affected by these fluctuations. They affect progress and cause delays, which in turn create problems for subcontractors, namely cost overruns, disputes, arbitration, total abandonment and litigation. FOREX fluctuations also cause the price of raw materials to increase, leading the cost overruns. Managing FOREX risk is critical and past research {{have focused on the}} need for adequate insurance, careful planning and management, and foreign exchange futures hedging to overcome issues that have been caused by the FOREX risk. Analysis of FOREX risk in international construction business usually focused only on issues at the project level. There is currently lack of understanding of Organisational Capabilities (OC) to manage the impacts of FOREX risk, which when examined, are seen in isolation. This paper attempts to bridge the gap by discussing the impacts of FOREX fluctuations on the international construction business. The focus is on the OC perspective and the need to develop OC framework to mitigate the risk in <b>sustaining</b> <b>construction</b> business performance...|$|R

40|$|Sanitation related {{diseases}} {{have become}} endemic in southern Africa resulting in increased sanitation and hygiene morbidity and mortality. The region has experienced 318 400 cases of cholera and diarrhoea outbreaks between 2006 and 2012. There is insufficient financing for sanitation and hygiene activities, as people lack basic sanitation services, {{they engage in}} open defecation, {{the primary cause of}} faecal oral disease transmission. This study investigated Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), subsidy free, community based disaster risk reduction approach, for open defecation reduction, in four constituencies in Swaziland. Data collected from households, through a knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) survey illustrated that with appropriate training, involvement of traditional and community leaders, CLTS minimises open defecation. There is need of participatory rural appraisal through regular community monitoring and feedback meetings, as the disgust generated especially for women and youth, through the meetings, as well as group dynamics, steer the <b>sustained</b> <b>construction</b> and use of sanitation facilities. Lack of coordination between Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) leads to slow improvement of sanitation coverage, wherein the same communities are promoting CLTS and others are promoting Subsidy Based Sanitation Intervention (SBSI) which involves subsidies. It is recommended that there be coordination between partners for harmonisation of messages and an integration of the CLTS and SBSI approaches...|$|R

40|$|SummaryFirefly luciferase-catalyzed light {{emission}} from D-luciferin {{is widely used}} as a reporter of gene expression and enzymatic activity both in vitro and in vivo. Despite the power of bioluminescence for imaging and drug discovery, {{light emission}} from firefly luciferase is fundamentally limited by the physical properties of the D-luciferin substrate. We and others have synthesized aminoluciferin analogs that exhibit light emission at longer wavelengths than D-luciferin and have increased affinity for luciferase. However, although these substrates can emit an intense initial burst of light that approaches that of D-luciferin, {{this is followed by}} much lower levels of <b>sustained</b> <b>light</b> output. Here we describe the creation of mutant luciferases that yield improved <b>sustained</b> <b>light</b> emission with aminoluciferins in both lysed and live mammalian cells, allowing the use of aminoluciferins for cell-based bioluminescence experiments...|$|R
