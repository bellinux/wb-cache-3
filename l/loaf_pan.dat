5000|$|A banneton {{is a type}} of basket used {{to provide}} {{structure}} for shaped loaves of bread during proofing. Banneton baskets are also known as Brotform or proofing baskets. It is normally used for doughs that are too soft or wet to maintain their shape while rising. Proofing baskets are distinct from <b>loaf</b> <b>pans</b> in that the bread is normally removed from these baskets before baking. Conventionally, these baskets are made out of wicker, but some modern proofing baskets are made out of rattan. [...] cane, spruce pulp, Terracotta, or polypropylene. A banneton will sometimes have a cloth liner, generally made of linen, to prevent dough from sticking to the sides of the basket. Bannetons become more non-stick with use as a small amount of flour accumulates in them. These baskets are used both to provide the loaf with shape and to wick moisture from the crust. Bannetons come in round or oblong shapes.|$|R

50|$|A <b>pan</b> <b>loaf</b> is a {{style of}} bread loaf baked in a pan or tin. It {{is the most common}} style {{available}} in the United Kingdom, though the term itself is predominantly Scottish and Northern Irish so as to differentiate it from the plain loaf.

5000|$|The name [...] "Pullman" [...] {{was derived}} from its use in the compact kitchens of the Pullman railway cars. Although the Pullman Company is {{credited}} with inventing the lidded baking pans used to create the square <b>loaves,</b> square tin <b>pans</b> existed long before the railroad company. European breadmakers began using the pans in the early 18th century to minimize crust. However, the loaves were selected by Pullman for use on his trains. Three Pullman loaves occupied the same space as two standard round-topped loaves, thus maximizing the use of space in the small Pullman kitchen.|$|R
5000|$|A plain loaf, {{slices of}} which are known in Scots as plain breid (pronounced [...] ), is a {{traditional}} style of loaf made chiefly in Scotland and Ireland. It has a dark, well-fired crust {{on the top and}} bottom of the bread. There is no crust on the sides due to the unbaked loaves being stuck together in batches, baked together then torn into individual loaves afterwards. The term batch loaf is sometimes used. This style of bread does not fit well in most modern toasters due to the greater height of the loaf. This was once the more widely available style of loaf in comparison to the now more common <b>pan</b> <b>loaf.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{separation}} {{procedure was}} developed using S-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography under mildly acidic conditions {{to establish the}} effect of 70 % (v/v) ethanol extractable proteins on bread-making quality. The separation of a 70 % (v/v) ethanol extract of gluten was scaled up successfully from 3 mg to 60 g protein. The use of denaturing and dissociating agents, such as urea or guanidine-HCl, was unnecessary. The pilot-scale fractionation yielded five fractions that were bound to, and eluted from, the column. The fractions differed in gliadin composition as evidenced by lactate-PAGE, SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. The fractions were virtually free of lipid. Isolated fractions were evaluated for their effects on bread-making quality using a <b>pan</b> <b>loaf</b> baking test. The unbound fraction (D) contained lipids, mainly mono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerols, and it increased (cv. Obelisk flour) or decreased (cv. Camp Rémy flour) loaf volume at additions of up to 0 · 5 % on flour weight. At higher levels of addition it had a strong negative effect on loaf volume. The unfractionated extract (containing some fraction D) or the recombined fractions improved loaf volume. All individual fractions improved loaf volume, but to different extents. For {{four out of five}} fractions the improvement corresponded to the statistical prediction of loaf volume by RP-HPLC gliadin peak areas. © 1994 Academic Press. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Several {{types of}} {{equipment}} {{have been used}} to predict dough behaviour during breadmaking. The complexity of requirements means that no device is able to predict all the properties, and therefore, new tests are released continuously. The Chopin Mixolab mixes the dough at different temperatures, allowing the study of dough mixing properties, weakening, gelatinization, gel stability and retrogradation in one test. The objective of this work was to study the suitability of the Mixolab to predict rheological properties and breadmaking quality of local wheats. Flour was obtained from 29 wheat samples  from different genotypes and environments. The correlation of results from traditional analyses  (test weight, protein content, sedimentation volume, wet gluten, Falling Number, Alveograph and Farinograph)   with Mixolab parameters was studied. The properties of two different bread types were compared with all these parameters. Stability and water absorption values from the Farinograph were highly correlated with the respective Mixolab parameters. It was concluded that wheat samples could be sorted by mixing properties in similar order independently of which method was used. Beyond that, gluten strength estimators obtained from these three rheological methods and the sedimentation volume test were highly correlated. Whilst the correlation of Mixolab parameters with <b>pan</b> <b>loaf</b> volume was not as high as traditional ones, Mixolab developing time, stability and C 5 were the best correlated with the most important hearth bread characteristics. Studies performed by other researchers, using wheats from diverse origins, found different results. The need for empirical rheology evaluation with local wheat samples was proved. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Baguettes {{are closely}} {{connected}} to France, {{though they are}} made around the world. In France, not all long loaves are baguettes; for example, a short, almost rugby ball shaped loaf is a bâtard (literally, bastard), or a [...] "torpedo loaf" [...] in English; its origin is variously explained, but undocumented. Another tubular shaped loaf {{is known as a}} flûte, also known in the United States as a parisienne. Flûtes closely resemble baguettes and weigh more or less than these, depending on the region. A thinner loaf is called a ficelle (string). A short baguette is sometimes known as a baton (stick), or even referred to using the English translation French stick. None of these are officially defined, either legally or, for instance, in major dictionaries, any more than the baguette. French breads are also made in forms such as a miche, which is a large <b>pan</b> <b>loaf,</b> and a boule, literally ball in French, a large round loaf. Sandwich-sized loaves are sometimes known as demi-baguettes or tiers.In France a baguette must weigh 250 grams (8.75 ounces), a batard 500 grams (17.5 ounces) and a ficelle 100 grams (3.5 ounces).Baguettes, either relatively short single-serving size or cut from a longer loaf, are very often used for sandwiches, usually of the submarine sandwich type, but also a Panini. They are often sliced and served with pâté or cheese. As part of the traditional continental breakfast in France, slices of baguette are spread with butter and jam and dunked in bowls of coffee or hot chocolate. In the United States, French bread loaves are sometimes split in half to make French bread pizza.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{version of}} babka is {{associated}} with the Eastern European Jewish tradition. This babka is made from a doubled and twisted length of yeast dough and is typically baked in a high <b>loaf</b> <b>pan.</b> Instead of a fruit filling the dough contains cinnamon and/or chocolate. The babka is usually topped with streusel. A similar cake called a kokosh is also popular in Jewish bakeries. Kokosh also comes in chocolate and cinnamon varieties, but it is lower and longer than babka, is not twisted, and not topped with streusel. Cakes of these styles are, properly, couronnes baked in loaf pans, and should not be called babkas.|$|E
50|$|Brioche à tête or parisienne {{is perhaps}} the most classically {{recognized}} form: it is formed and baked in a fluted round, flared tin; a large ball of dough is placed on the bottom and topped with a smaller ball of dough to form the head (tête). Brioche Nanterre is a loaf of brioche made in a standard <b>loaf</b> <b>pan.</b> Instead of shaping two pieces of dough and baking them together, two rows of small pieces of dough are placed in the pan. Loaves are then proofed (allowed to rise) in the pan, fusing the pieces together. During the baking process the balls of dough rise further and form an attractive pattern.Brioche can also be made in a pan without being rolled into balls to make an ordinary loaf.|$|E
5000|$|A bread pan, {{also called}} a <b>loaf</b> <b>pan,</b> is a kitchen utensil {{in the form}} of a {{container}} in which bread is baked. Its function is to shape bread while it is rising during baking. The most common shape of the bread pan is the loaf, or narrow rectangle, a convenient form which enables uniform slicing. The bread pan is made from a conductive material such as metal which might be treated with a non-stick coating. It can also be made of heat resistant glass, ceramic, or a special type of paper that sticks to the dough but is easily removed, once cooked. Bread pans are found in a variety of designs and sizes providing the baker with different possibilities not only for baking bread, but also cakes and puddings.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} non-gluten low Mr wheat {{proteins}} on bread-making quality and dough properties were investigated. Low Mr proteins retarded the re-polymerisation of SDS-unextractable glutenin (glutenin macropolymer-GMP; gel protein) during resting of doughs from the cultivars Obelisk, Camp Remy, Castan and Rektor. Polymerisation in the overly-strong cultivar, Fresco, was not affected substantially. Additions of 0 · 2 % to 0 · 4 % by weight of low Mr proteins to flour increased the relaxation half-times of doughs from cvs Camp Remy and Rektor as measured in a Bohlin VOR Rheometer. Furthermore, the phase angle, δ (ratio of loss modulus to storage modulus), decreased at these levels of low Mr protein addition, indicating {{the formation of}} a dough with greater elastic character. At 0 · 8 % (w/w) addition, the relaxation time decreased and the phase angle increased. The effects on the dough of cv. Obelisk were relatively slight. The complex dynamic moduli of doughs from cvs Camp Remy and Rektor were relatively unaffected by the addition of low Mr proteins, but the moduli decreased when they were added to cv. Obelisk flour. The rate of GMP repolymerisation during resting was related negatively to the phase angle, whereas the complex modulus increased to a plateau value as the rate of GMP reassembly increased. In micro-baking tests with 10 -g and 100 -g <b>pan</b> <b>loaves,</b> increases in loaf volume of 11 % to 12 % were observed with up to 0 · 8 % (w/w) addition of low Mr proteins to cv. Camp Remy dough. For the weaker cultivar, Obelisk, addition of low Mr proteins caused either no increase in loaf volume or a decrease of 13 %, depending on the level of addition. The results indicate that, although low Mr wheat proteins have inconsistent effects on loaf volume, they have profound effects on both the biochemical and rheological properties of dough. © 1995...|$|R
50|$|The term olive loaf {{can refer}} to two {{different}} food products. Primarily, it {{is a type of}} meatloaf or cold cut embedded with pimento-stuffed green olives. A secondary meaning is that of olive bread, a bread where the loaf of bread is laced with whole olives.The luncheon meat often also contains garlic, basil or sweet peppers for additional flavor. Olive loaf is a loaf-type luncheon meat, traditionally cooked in a <b>loaf</b> <b>pan</b> as opposed to a sausage cooked in a casing. Higher quality olive loaf is primarily beef and pork while less expensive olive loaf contains mostly chicken or turkey. Since most less expensive bologna is made from similar meats, and since many companies now cook olive loaf in sleeves to give it a round appearance, it is a common misconception that olive loaf is a sausage like bologna.|$|E
5000|$|A loaf is a shape, usually rounded or oblong, mass of food. It may {{refer to}} a whole article of bread. Technically, any unit of bread is called a [...] "loaf", no matter what its shape, and the loaf can {{therefore}} vary in the ratio of length to width, and in its roundness. However, {{it is common to}} bake bread in a rectangular bread pan, also called a <b>loaf</b> <b>pan,</b> because different kinds of bread dough have different levels of viscosity, meaning that some doughs will tend to collapse and spread out more than others during the cooking process. Doughs with a thicker viscosity can be hand-molded into the desired loaf shape, and cooked without using any kind of walled pan. The shape of doughs with a thinner viscosity can be maintained with a bread pan whose sides are higher than the uncooked dough.|$|E
50|$|Nut roasts are {{commonly}} made with any single type or complementary combination of nuts and legumes desired such as walnuts, hazelnuts, Brazil nuts, pecans, cashew nuts, pistachios, chestnuts, sunflower seeds and peanuts and even lentils. The nuts may be whole, chopped up, or ground and are typically combined {{with one or}} several starches such as breadcrumbs or day-old bread, cooked rice, buckwheat kasha, groats, barley, rye or millet. The nuts and the starches are bound together with aromatics such as onions, garlic, or leeks, with fresh vegetable broth or bouillon cubes used and olive oil or butter. Seasoning is provided by complementary herbs of the cook's choosing. Sautéed mushrooms or truffle shavings or flavored oil, or tomatoes or cheese may be added for extra flavour and variety of texture. Vegemite, Marmite, or soy sauce is sometimes used {{as one of the}} stocks or what the onions are fried in. Some recipes call for a chicken's egg to bind the ingredients together. The whole mixture is then roasted or baked in a <b>loaf</b> <b>pan</b> or other baking dish until firm or a crust forms, and then served with side dishes. Whole nuts may be used as a garnish or decoration for the completed roast.|$|E

And where homemakers do it on small scale, Dorothy Coon, director of Homemakers' Center in one of Toledo's department stores indulges in such neighborliness on a mass scale. She estimates that 800 women each month attend sessions at the cen­ter, not to mention the many pi) rsonal requests that come In one by one. Right now, Mrs. Coon is busy launching the center's canning program for slimmer and perfect­ing plans for drying, brinlng and freezing demonstrations latcr on. She personally has canned dem­onstration jars of strawberries, asparagus and rhubarb. Time for canning them is just around the corner. "The Government," comments Mrs. Coon, "has asked all house­wives to can a little more in ' 44. They are backing up their request by releasing pressure canners for safe home canning. " Pre••ure Canner. Now is the time she says to check old canners and send faulty parts to the manufacturer for repairs. She stresses that the individual manufacturer's direc­tions should be followed in using a pressure canner. Every safety precaution in canning should be observed. Food lJ(lisoning is too deadly to gamble with by using slipshod methods. Plenty of lids will be available for canning even though the jars, such as wide mouth ones, are no longer being manufactured. In sealing glass coffee jars, Mrs. Coon advises punching a few holes in the can's lid that is used as a seal­ing ring. It will make removal easy later on. Although canning is of prime interest at the Homemakers' Cen­ter just now, conservation and meeting every day problems Is the year around theme. Helping women with their cur­rent problems, whether it be making dress forms, fighting moths, a problem In menu plan­ning or infant feeding, is Mrs. Coon's job. Also she likes to pass along good ideas that women who at­tend the center bring in. Current­ly her desk is decorated with the offering of one-a gay centerpiece of tulips, made from nearly whole, dyed egg shells. Wacky Cake Another woman who declared she couldn't bake a cake until someone told her about Wacky Cake bro ht in the recipe.

Spread over cake. And if anyone should be well equipped for adVice, it is Dorothy Coon. She practices what she preaches in her own maidless eight-room home. She is the wife of Charles F. Coon and mother of teen age Zanna and Charles (Sonny) Coon. A Spitz dog which Mrs. Coon gaily says looks like a moth-eaten throw rug com­pletes the family circle. The family helps, of course, each member having specific duties. Mrs. Coon believes in I J t j 1 v schedules, not only for food but work. They are made out a week In advance, so that the family will know what's coming up and be ready to help on them. Food. at Home Food Is purchased once a week and left overs are not only ex­pected, but planned for. A large enough Sunday roast is purchased 80 that It will provide mea. t bails or stew for two more meals. Mrs. Coon admits that meat points "peter out" by the end of the week when low point foods such as wieners and sauerkraut or macaroni and cheese are served. She and her family are all fond of soybeans, which she purchases at health food counters or In the country. They are served baked, in soup or cold in salads. But ahe makes a wry face when creamed soybeans are mentioned. One of the family's favorite ways of having this food Is to mix equal quantities of raw hamburger, cooked soybeans and a bit of chopped onion and salt. They are formed into balls and fried like meat patties. Always at the Coon home this 'oriental food is served with a crisp green salad. Mrs. Coon is undoubtedly one of the handsomest women in To­ledo and her beauty Is strength­ened by a charming and unaf­fected personality.
