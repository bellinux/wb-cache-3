5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had a <b>long</b> <b>tradition</b> of military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5|$|In the Third Intermediate Period and the {{following}} Late Period (664–323 BC), the weakened Egyptian state fell {{to a series of}} outside powers, experiencing only occasional periods of independence. Many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen their claim to the kingship of Egypt. One such group, the Kushite pharaohs of the eighth and seventh centuriesBC, adopted Egyptian-style temple architecture for use in their native land of Nubia, beginning a <b>long</b> <b>tradition</b> of sophisticated Nubian temple building. Amid this turmoil, the fortunes of various temples and clergies shifted and the independence of Amun's priesthood was broken, but the power of the priesthood in general remained.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1920s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) {{reached its}} peak {{membership}} in the South and Midwest after a revival beginning around 1915. Its growth was {{due in part to}} tensions from rapid industrialization and social change in many growing cities; in the Midwest and West, its growth was related to the competition of waves of new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The KKK was strong in the Florida cities of Jacksonville and Tampa; Miami's chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the Miami Country Club. The Klan also flourished in smaller towns of the South where racial violence had a <b>long</b> <b>tradition</b> dating back to the Reconstruction era. An editor of The Gainesville Daily Sun admitted that {{he was a member of}} the Klan in 1922, and praised the organization in print.|$|E
5|$|Mercia had a <b>long</b> <b>tradition</b> of venerating royal {{saints and}} this was enthusiastically {{supported}} by Æthelred and Æthelflæd. Saintly relics were believed to give supernatural legitimacy to rulers' authority, and Æthelflæd was probably responsible for the foundation or re-foundation of Chester Minster and the transfer to it of {{the remains of the}} seventh-century Mercian princess Saint Werburgh from Hanbury in Staffordshire. She may also have translated the relics of the martyred Northumbrian prince Ealhmund from Derby to Shrewsbury. In 910 the Danes retaliated against the English attack of the previous year by invading Mercia, raiding as far as Bridgnorth in Shropshire. On their way back they were caught by an English army in Staffordshire and their army was destroyed at the Battle of Tettenhall, opening the way for the recovery of the Danish Midlands and East Anglia over the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Only two of {{the seven}} {{surviving}} plays can be dated securely: Philoctetes (409 BC) and Oedipus at Colonus (401 BC, staged after Sophocles' death by his grandson). Of the others, Electra shows stylistic similarities to these two plays, which suggests that it was probably written {{in the latter part}} of his career. Ajax, Antigone and The Trachiniae are generally thought to be among his early works, again based on stylistic elements, with Oedipus Rex coming in Sophocles' middle period. Most of Sophocles' plays show an undercurrent of early fatalism and the beginnings of Socratic logic as a mainstay for the <b>long</b> <b>tradition</b> of Greek tragedy.|$|E
