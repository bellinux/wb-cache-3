6000|$|For multitudinousness {{has always}} been the Liberal characteristic. Liberalism never has been nor ever can be {{anything}} but a diversified crowd. Liberalism has to voice everything that is left out by these other parties. It is the party against the predominating interests. It is at once the party of the failing and of the untried; it is the party of decadence and hope. From its nature it must be a vague and planless association in comparison with its antagonist, neither so constructive on the one hand, nor on the other so competent to hinder the inevitable constructions of the civilised state. Essentially it is the party of criticism, the [...] "Anti" [...] party. It is a system of hostilities and objections that somehow achieves at times an elusive common soul. It is a gathering together of all the smaller interests which find themselves at a disadvantage against the big established classes, the <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenant</b> as against the landowner, the retail tradesman as against the merchant and the moneylender, the Nonconformist as against the Churchman, the small employer as against the demoralising hospitable publican, the man without introductions and broad connections against the man who has these things. It is the party of the many small men against the fewer prevailing men. It has no more essential reason for loving the Collectivist state than the Conservatives; the small dealer is doomed to absorption in that just as much as the large owner; but it resorts to the state against its antagonists as in the middle ages common men pitted themselves against the barons by siding with the king. The Liberal Party is the party against [...] "class privilege" [...] because it represents no class advantages, but it is also the party that is on the whole most set against Collective control because it represents no established responsibility. It is constructive only so far as its antagonism to the great owner is more powerful than its jealousy of the state. It organises only because organisation is forced upon it by the organisation of its adversaries. It lapses in and out of alliance with Labour as it sways between hostility to wealth and hostility to public expenditure....|$|E

In 1955 he denounced {{the assumption that}} the English [...] "were in some peculiar way wholly foreign and alien to Wales", and ridiculed basing a nation on [...] "poets, preachers and musicians". He supported reform of the system of leasehold ownership to allow <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenants</b> to buy their freeholds, attacking the sale of estates to financiers.|$|R

5000|$|The City Council's {{pride and}} joy was its {{economic}} scheme known as Dube Village. It was intended [...] "primarily for the thoroughly urbanised and economically advanced Native". Stands, varying in size from fifty by hundred feet to forty by 70 feet, were made available on a thirty-year <b>leasehold</b> tenure. <b>Tenants</b> could erect their own dwellings in conformity with approved plans.|$|R
5000|$|However, by {{the start}} of the 18th century, the {{political}} influence of popularly supported [...] "assemblies," [...] notably the Albany Assembly, had begun to effectively break the legal power of the manor lords, and place it quite firmly in the hands of those who held the vote under the [...] "Lawes of England." [...] This was interpreted in the Province as persons who were freehold land owners and <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenants</b> with a lifetime lease, provided that in either case the land was valued at least £40. Politically, this may not have resulted in much change considering that manor lords won representation of their manors in every election from 1691 to 1776. In fact, only two elections were even contested, and then simply by rival factions within the same manorial families. In the law, however, there was a quite radical change as tenants were converted from mostly [...] "at will" [...] leaseholders, whose lease was at the will of the manor lords, to mostly lifetime leaseholders and freeholders.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the performance of}} the Dean and Chapter of Durham as estate managers from 1541 - 1840, as perceived from the detailed study of one parish. Durham was created as a New Foundation Cathedral in 1541 by Henry VIII and endowed with the lands of the Priory, which had been dissolved in 1539. Durham Chapter administered the same lands until 1840 when central government again intervened with cathedral estates. Cathedral chapters have been described as 'inactive rentier' landlords. Durham Chapter’s management is compared with that of other landlords to see if this description was justified. The Chapter's response to problems and challenges, such as tenant right and inflation in the sixteenth century, civil war and abolition in the seventeenth century and rapidly changing agricultural practices in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}} is considered. The thesis concludes that by 1626 Durham Chapter had created an effective system of estate management, known as beneficial <b>leasehold,</b> which offered <b>tenants</b> security of tenure and fixed rents, while compensating the Chapter for inflation by regular renewal fines, related to the true value of the land. The Chapter were not inactive rentiers in 1640 : they promoted agricultural innovation, especially enclosure of the townships. The work of the Chapter was only interrupted by the Civil War, not fundamentally altered. The Chapter recovered relatively rapidly at the Restoration: their tenants had greater problems because of the costs of war and land purchase. By the nineteenth century, the Chapter were left behind by progressive landlords who controlled their tenants' farming practices and drew a greater financial return from their lands than Durham Chapter achieved. However, progress continued on the Chapter estate, as the security of beneficial <b>leasehold</b> encouraged <b>tenants</b> to invest, for example in restructuring their farms, breeding improved cattle and introducing new field crops and rotations...|$|R
50|$|Thomas Hughes owned {{property}} leased to the Railway Company at 216 Euston Road. Under the lease, Hughes {{was entitled}} to compel the tenant to repair the building within six months of notice. Notice was given on 22 October 1874 from which the tenants had until 22 April to finish the repairs. On 28 November, the tenant railway company sent a letter proposing that Hughes purchase the <b>tenant's</b> <b>leasehold</b> interest. Negotiations began and continued until 30 December, at which point nothing was settled. Once the six months had elapsed the landlord sued the tenant for breach of contract and tried to evict the company.|$|R
40|$|This {{study on}} the late-medieval decline of English manorial demesne {{agriculture}} {{is based on the}} Germanic paradigm of Gutsherrschaft and Grundherrschaft, which historians have utilized to explain the transformation of feudal agriculture, east of the Elbe River, from the 15 th to the 18 th centuries. The former is a manorial regime in which the lord derived his incomes primarily from the commercial exploitation of his demesne lands, using the compulsory labour services of servile tenants. The latter is a manorial regime in which the lord derived his incomes instead primarily from cash rents paid by largely free peasants. In East Elbia, the early-modern shift was from Grundherrschaft to Gutsherrschaft. Late medieval manorial England experienced a reverse shift: from Gutsherrschaft to Grundherrschaft. To explain this transformation, this paper employs a supplementary monetary and fiscal model to prove that the standard Ricardian demographic model is insufficient to explain these changes. My monetary model, based on my prior publications on the deflationary consequences of the first late-medieval bullion famine, from ca. 1375 to ca. 1420, demonstrates that all agrarian prices fell (in nominal terms), while the Ricardian model stipulates that the price fall was limited to grains, and further that the consequent rise in living standards would have led to rising livestock product and other agrarian prices. It also demonstrates that the rise in real wages (agrarian) was partly the result of deflation combined with institutional wage stickiness. My fiscal model demonstrates that the imposition of heavy fixed (specific and not ad valorem) taxes on exports of English wools, by so seriously injuring the chief consumers, the woollen draperies in the Low Countries, quickly led to sharply falling wool sales and (real) wool prices. With such a damaging price-cost scissors, English landlords found that the continued commercial exploitation of their demesnes based on grains and wool was no longer profitable, while leasing those lands to free peasants (abolishing most vestiges of serfdom) was very profitable, since the <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenants</b> had to pay rents whose real value rose during the era of this deflation (ca 1375 - ca. 1420). money; coinage; bullion famines; deflation; manorialism; demesne agriculture; leasing demesnes; serfdom; servile labour services; peasant tenancies; copyholds; leaseholds; Gutsherrschaft; Grundherrschaft; commodity prices; factor prices; labour; wages; ‘wage-stickiness’; interest; grains; wools; livestock products; wool-export trade; wool-export duties; Flanders; woollen draperies...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{ownership}} and consumption patterns within the market have brought many operators to follow {{strategies that are}} more concerned with a retailing orientation. Many of the companies operating pubs are aiming to grow sales, and respond quickly to changes in consumer tastes and fashions. They no longer own brewing facilities and frequently control whole estates of the pubs that are marginal, and where the actions, skills and motivations of local unit managers are crucial for {{the success or failure of}} the property. The exploration of different forms of indirect control via tenancy and lease arrangements is recognition of the need to provide more entrepreneurial incentives for those managing these more marginal properties. In many ways, it is possible to view pubs owned by chains operated through both tenancies and leasing as a form of franchising. Certainly the literature and research of franchising hospitality services can help inform a study of <b>leasehold</b> and <b>tenanted</b> relationships in licensed retailing. Franchising in licensed retailing is almost wholly based on the tenanted/leased agreements, which stem from the ‘tie’. This paper argues that in the more retailing and service quality competitive environment pub operating companies will need to use more traditional franchising approaches than have been practised in the past. </p...|$|R
5000|$|David Berry (born 1795, d.1889): Agriculturalist. He {{emigrated from}} Scotland to New South Wales in 1836 and joined his brother Alexander Berry. He managed the Coolangatta Estate from 1836, {{initially}} utilising convict labour but later, from 1848, providing <b>leaseholds</b> to <b>tenant</b> farmers. By 1863 {{there were some}} three hundred tenants, occupying about 3,500 hectares of farmland. With the death of Alexander Berry in 1873, David Berry inherited the estate. Acknowledged as [...] "large-hearted and generous", he introduced sharefarming, took a particular interest {{in the education of}} the children on the estate, including providing schools and undertaking much of the teaching himself, had many scientific interests (including experimenting with paddle wheel and screw propeller design) and engaged in manufacturing, including building farm machinery and the building of two steamers, Meeinderry and Coomonderry. Roads, wharves and a wide variety of buildings were constructed under his management. He was concerned for the welfare of local Aboriginals and sought to absorb them gradually into the life of the estate. He helped to develop an agricultural society among the increasing Shoalhaven tenantry, and one of his last acts was to provide uniforms and instruments for a local brass band. He died unmarried and without children. His will made large bequests: for the building of a local hospital; a bequest to the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales; and a bequest to the University of St Andrews. As a consequence, the Coolangatta Estate was broken up and land portions were sold off progressively.|$|R

In 1871, for example, he was involved in the case of McGeough v. Savage which involved a dispute over the sale of lumber in the townland, and in which evidence was adduced that 134 trees in Aughanduff, between one and two feet in circumference, had been felled since 1868.

40|$|No {{one who is}} {{studying}} 1 housing law can do so successfully without understanding the legal system within which it operates. In this chapter, we look initially at how English law is made {{and how it is}} applied to the settlement of disputes. The former question involves some knowledge of case law, legislation and EU (European Union) law. The latter requires an understanding of the civil court system and the legal personnel of the law (solicitors, barristers and judges). We shall also look in outline at the law of contract and tort (the law of negligence, trespass, nuisance and occupiers’ liability) in order to provide a foundation for studies in housing law. Subsequently, the chapter provides the reader with an introductory text on the subject of property and housing law. It is not intended to be exhaustive and the reader is referred to the Recommended Reading {{at the end of the}} chapter. Specifically, this chapter examines: Legal studies: The development of English law. Sources of law. Civil court structure. Personnel of the law. Legal personality. Law of contract. Law of tort. Property and housing law: Freehold and leasehold estates. The essentials of a valid lease. The formalities of a lease. Types of leases and tenancies. Enforceability of covenants in leases. Express covenants. Implied covenants. Assigning and sub-letting. Leasehold dilapidations. Termination of leases. Statutory protection of residential <b>tenants.</b> <b>Leasehold</b> enfranchisement. Homelessness. Case studies are used to test some of the above aspects of law...|$|R
