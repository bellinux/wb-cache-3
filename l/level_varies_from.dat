40|$|Environmental {{biomonitoring}} {{has demonstrated}} that organisms such as crustaceans, fish and mushrooms are useful to evaluate and monitor both ecosystem contamination and quality. Particularly, some mushroom species have a high capacity to retain radionuclides and some toxic elements from the soil and the air. The potential of mushrooms to accumulate radionuclides in their fruit-bodies has been well documented. However, there are no studies that determine natural and artificial radionuclide composition in edible mushrooms, in Brazil. Artificial (137 Cs) and natural radioactivity (40 K, 226 Ra, 228 Ra) were determined in 17 mushroom samples from 3 commercialized edible mushroom species. The edible mushrooms collected were Agaricus sp., Pleurotus sp. and Lentinula sp. species. The activity measurements were carried out by gamma spectrometry. The levels of 137 Cs <b>varied</b> <b>from</b> 1. 45 0. 04 to 10. 6 0. 3 Bq kg 1, 40 K <b>levels</b> <b>varied</b> <b>from</b> 461 2 to 1535 10 Bq kg 1, 226 Ra <b>levels</b> <b>varied</b> <b>from</b> 14 3 to 66 12 Bq kg 1 and 228 Ra <b>levels</b> <b>varied</b> <b>from</b> 6. 2 0. 2 to 54. 2 1. 7 Bq kg 1. 137 Cs levels in Brazilian mushrooms are {{in accordance with the}} radioactive fallout in the Southern Hemisphere. The artificial and natural activities determined in this study were found to be below the maximum permissible levels as established by national legislation. Thus, these mushroom species can be normally consumed by the population without any apparent risks to human health...|$|R
