500|$|The {{main pier}} was {{originally}} [...] long, {{and it is}} [...] wide with a cantilever construction. However the low water jetty was damaged in a storm in 1903, rebuilt in 1909 and finally dismantled in 1923 meaning that the pier is now [...] long, Due to architectural features such as abutments {{at either end of}} the pier, the pier resembles a bridge more than other pleasure piers. Fifteen groups of piles support a continuous <b>lattice</b> <b>girder,</b> each set comprising four piles screwed into the river bed at an angle with an X-brace between each adjacent pair. The fitting of screw blades to iron piles, as opposed to the then accepted wooden pile, created a deeper and far more resilient base support. This was one of the innovations brought by Eugenius Birch which have enabled many of the piers he designed to survive. There were problems with oscillations in the structure when bands marched on the pier, both on the opening day and again in 1886. As a result, further horizontal cross braces were added to the piles, and a law was passed banning marching on the pier. The gothic toll house and pierhead buildings were designed by local architect Hans Price.|$|E
500|$|Northwich railway viaduct spans {{both the}} lock cut and the weir stream, and {{was built in}} the 1860s. It {{consists}} of 48 round arches, constructed of blue bricks and red sandstone, with iron spans over the channels. It is around [...] long, provides [...] of headroom over the navigation, and also crosses the River Dane. Hayhurst swing bridge carries the A5509 road over the navigation, and was manufactured by A Handyside and Co. Ltd., of Derby and London, in 1899. It is an asymmetric bowstring <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> bridge, and its timber-framed weatherboarded control cabin is also listed. This and Town bridge, which is located a little further downstream and is of a similar design, are believed to be the two earliest swing bridges in Britain to be powered by electricity. Both bridges were designed by J. A. Saner, who was the Navigation's engineer, and incorporate a sectional pontoon, which is immersed in the river and carries about 80 per cent of the weight of the bridge. Because of the risk of subsidence from the salt workings, the bridges are fitted with screw jacks which allow the deck level to be maintained. Hayhurst bridge was refurbished in 2004 at a cost of £33.5 million. Winnington bridge, the next downstream, was built between 1908 and 1909, to replace the first bridge which was built in 1901. The original design was flawed, and hence the bridge was replaced after only 7 years. A pedestrian walkway was later fitted on the downstream side of the new bridge.|$|E

2500|$|The {{structural}} fuselage of the Types M and N was {{a rectangular}} section, ash framed <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> with wire cross bracing. Poplar formers and stringers produced a more rounded, fabric covered section. The pilot sat well {{down in an}} open cockpit over the wing and behind the upper pylon. A wide range of engines were fitted, including the [...] Anzani three cylinder inverted Y radial engine, the [...] Anzani 6-cylinder two row radial and the [...] Gnome. The last, a rotary engine, was usually covered over the upper part to screen the pilot from oil spray; the Anzanis were mounted uncowled. They all drove large, rather broad chord propellers. [...] The very broad chord, low aspect ratio tailplane was constructed like the wing with a flexible rear surface acting both to improve stability and, by warping, act like conventional elevators, its trailing edge extending well beyond {{the end of the}} fuselage. [...] A small, near rectangular, one piece, rigid fin was pivoted near its leading edge from the extreme tail.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was recycled {{from one}} of Caudron's earlier monoplanes, the very similar Types M and N, and was built around an ash <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> of square section which tapered to the rear. Stringers, stood off from the girder, gave the fabric covered fuselage a more rounded cross-section. An open, single seat cockpit was placed under the wing trailing edge. When it first flew the Type O had an almost square, upright vertical tail {{with little or no}} fin and a large rudder reaching down to the keel. [...] The horizontal tail, narrow and with a straight, unswept leading edge was mounted on top of the fuselage so the rudder operated in an elevator cut-out. Later in the year, the aircraft, now with the 100hp Anzani and a modified upper forward fuselage, had a very different tail with a larger fin which had a long, curving leading edge, its contour continuing into that of a broad, deep rudder. [...] There may also have been wing modifications as well; l'Aéroplane describes the upper and lower wings as having the same span, whereas in Hauet's account the span of the upper wing was the greater.|$|E

2500|$|The bridge {{consists}} of three wrought iron spans of , each on two sandstone abutments with foundations {{at a depth of}} about [...] below water level. The erection of the <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> spans was unusual, because instead of floating them down the river and lifting into position, each was built up piece by piece in situ. [...] The bridge carries a double line of tracks. As the structure superseded a centuries-old ferry, a footbridge alongside the main girders was provided on its eastern side. There is a clearance of [...] above the high water mark that allowed sailing ships to pass beneath it. There are 6lattice girders, two to each span. Each girder contains 700tons of iron and is fastened by 48,115rivets. From {{the north side of the}} river the bridge is approached by a viaduct of 49arches, then a short piece of embankment, followed by 16 more arches. [...] From the south it is approached by a viaduct of 33arches. [...] On its completion, the bridge was the longest of its time. An engraved stone plaque on the northerly portal, located above the running lines, records that the main contractor was Brassey & Ogilvie and the ironworks were by Cochrane Grove & Co.|$|E
2500|$|Max Gerner's GIIR sport, touring and {{training}} biplane was a development of his one-off G I. [...] The two types had low cost, easily repaired structures built from proprietary steel tubing and [...] unswept, constant chord wings with two truss braced spars; both had <b>lattice</b> <b>girder</b> fuselages and were largely fabric covered. Both also had open, tandem cockpits, fixed undercarriages {{and a single}} engine. However, the GIIR was larger, heavier and had a choice of engines which typically doubled the power. The fuselage was lengthened, mostly by increased cockpit separation, strengthened with diagonal cross members between the longerons, which placed the rear cockpit behind, rather than over, the trailing edge. [...] These changes raised the weight by 25% and so wing area was increased by extending the span by 20%. The GIIR retained the N-form interplane and cabane struts of the G I, though the former no longer leaned outwards and the upper wing was somewhat higher over the fuselage. It had two extra inter-spar trusses (six rather than four) in its lower wing, which alone carried ailerons. A newly patented method cramped, rather than welded, trusses and spars together. The [...] GIIR was easier to transport as it wings could be folded parallel to its fuselage despite the move of the fuel reservoir from behind the engine firewall {{to the top of}} the upper wings, for it now consisted of two side-by-side tanks, one on each wing.|$|E
