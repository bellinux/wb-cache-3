Denmark is renowned for its pioneering use of wind energy, Finland and Sweden bioenergy, Norway hydroelectricity and Iceland geothermal energy. All countries aim to be virtually “fossil free” by 2050. This study explores the Nordic energy transition {{through the lens of}} three interconnected research questions: How are they doing it? What challenges exist? And what broader lessons result for energy policy? The study firstly investigates the pathways necessary for these five countries to achieve their <b>low-carbon</b> <b>goals.</b> It argues that a concerted effort must be made to (1) promote decentralized and renewable forms of electricity supply; (2) shift to more sustainable forms of transport; (3) further improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings; and (4) adopt carbon capture and storage technologies for industry. However, the section that follows emphasizes some of the empirical barriers the Nordic transition must confront, namely political contestation, technological contingency, and social justice and recognition concerns. The study concludes with implications for what such historical progress, and future transition pathways, mean for both energy researchers and energy planners...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{spatially}} explicit model of carbon transfers between regions {{of an urban}} area. The carbon transfers represent the metabolic processes due to regional landuse changes. We used the model to identify spatial heterogeneity in the carbon metabolic structure, functions, and relationships within the network. Data for Beijing from 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010, were combined with empirical coefficients, to construct the network. We used ecological network analysis to analyze the structure and function of the network, and to determine the ecological relationships between {{the components of the}} system, their distribution, and their changes over time. The analysis revealed that carbon throughflow of the network decreased and positive relations mostly outweighed negative relations. Exploitation relationships were the dominant type in Beijing during most of the study period, particularly in the northwest before 2000, but moved towards the southeast over time, leaving competition relationships with losses of benefits dominant in the northwest. Mutualism relationships with mainly beneficial carbon flows were dominant in the southeast, increasing in frequency in this region throughout the study period. The results provide a theoretical basis for planning adjustments to the city's structure to achieve <b>low-carbon</b> <b>goals...</b>|$|E
40|$|This article investigates how {{a mix of}} energy-users from Denmark {{perceives}} {{energy and}} environmental {{issues such as the}} affordability of electricity and gasoline, the seriousness of climate change, and preferences for different energy systems. Its primary source of data is a pilot survey and energy literacy test distributed in English and Danish to 328 respondents spread across the country. The survey results are used to test four propositions about energy prices, being “green,” public knowledge and competence about energy issues, and self-sufficiency and sustainable technology. The data supports the propositions that Danes identify with “being green” and prefer national and local policies that endorse sustainable technology and being self-sufficient. However, the data also challenges the propositions that Danes would prioritize low energy prices and affordability as key energy concerns and that they are knowledgeable about energy and environmental issues. In this way, a problematic gap may exist between what many academic articles (and previous surveys) report Danish attitudes to be and what this study suggests they are. Given Denmark's ambitious <b>low-carbon</b> <b>goals,</b> these findings have clear relevance to other communities and countries seeking to decarbonize their own energy sectors...|$|E

40|$|Technological {{capability}} and technology transfer both play {{important roles in}} achieving low-carbon development targets and the concepts of both have appeared in national development and climate policy debates. Yet, they differ. Improving capabilities and transfer mechanisms are two differing approaches to technological development. Technology transfer {{is associated with a}} key political dynamic within international climate policy, in that developing countries request support from industrialised countries. Whereas technological capability focuses on building internal capabilities and is often framed in the context of national industrial policy plans rather than relying on external support. We argue that technology development, a combination of these approaches, can contribute to South Africa’s low-carbon development through innovation and technology-based mitigation actions that increase domestic technological capabilities. Technological capability needs to become a determinant of mitigation action to effectively contribute to achieving South Africa’s <b>low-carbon</b> development <b>goals.</b> International technology transfer and cooperation should contribute to boosting domestic capabilities to advance technological development. Technology transfer based on pure sales will not contribute to achieving long-term <b>low-carbon</b> development <b>goals.</b> Policy relevance: The case of South Africa offers useful insights for policy makers in developing countries, as it is a country at the crossroads of future energy paths. It is important to engage in technology-based mitigation actions to ensure that technology transfer contributes to a country’s <b>low-carbon</b> development <b>goals.</b> Ensuring that technology transfer contributes to development through job creation and local production is a matter of political choice.

This dataset describes {{the characteristics of}} the case study households whose energy use was evaluated as part of the EVALOC (evaluating low carbon communities) project. The characteristics include physical attributes (age, built form, construction), heating systems type and occupancy details. The dataset also shows if they received an Energy Display Monitor (EDM) from their low carbon community. This data collection comprises (1) a questionnaire survey, essential to provide more information about physical characteristics of the dwelling such as age, built form as well as household characteristics such as family size, number of occupants, along with physical and behavioral energy saving improvements that have been deployed. Also, it includes (2) transcripts of the 30 households interviewed who had undergone community-led home energy improvements as well as (3) five year longitudinal annual data (from 2008 - 2012) for household gas and electricity consumption for these households. The (4) EVALOC household energy interview template attached helped gather data on occupant habits and energy behaviors, as well as their perception and expectation related to energy use, controls, comfort and engagement with the community group. Project description: This three-year project brings together an interdisciplinary team of social science and building science-based researchers to assess and explain the changes in energy use due to community activities within six selected case study projects under the Department of Energy and Climate Change's (DECC) Low Carbon Communities Challenge (LCCC) initiative. These low carbon community projects are evaluated in terms of their: (1) impacts (on changing individual and community energy behaviours); (2) effectiveness (on achieving real-savings in energy use and carbon emissions); (3) success (in bringing about sustained and systemic change); (4) Using a combination of 'community-led action research' and a programme of 'monitoring and evaluation' of the DECC-funded interventions. These two core elements are expressed through four inter-related work packages. While work package (WP) 1 focuses on action research with communities involving toolkit development and testing. WP 2 is about measuring, monitoring and mapping the actual environmental performance of low carbon communities, using in-use monitoring equipment, post-occupancy evaluation techniques and a web-based monitoring tool. WP 3 a helps communities use their consumption and generation feedback to work towards <b>low-carbon</b> <b>goals.</b> It is linked with WP 3 b to facilitate sharing of results and reflection through social and community networks within and across communities.

40|$|Building energy {{renovation}} {{is one of}} the pillars upon which the 2050 European <b>low-carbon</b> <b>goals</b> are based. Simultaneously, building {{energy renovation}} is widely recognized as the trump card for the new start of European economy. However, at present the renovation rate of the existing building is very low throughout Europe (approximately 1 %) and investments in high performing buildings are generally mistrusted by stakeholders, due to their high capital costs. In this context, this PhD thesis dedicated its efforts to investigate from the energy and financial perspective the consequences of buildings renovation in the European scene. Particularly, the research boundaries were delineated by focusing on non-residential, multi-functional buildings, that are nowadays poorly studied due to their heterogeneous nature. In this view, the thesis' contributions were addressed at three levels: a) multi-functional buildings as archetypes to input in energy models for long-term energy analysis; b) multi-functional buildings used to test the financial viability of energy efficiency projects, in view of reaching the nearly Zero Energy performance level. As these analyses necessarily require case studies, the attention was directed towards a specific type of multi-functional buildings, hotels; c) multi-functional buildings as test-bed {{to assess the impact of}} co-benefits on the financial performances of energy efficiency projects. Once again, hotel buildings were selected for the development of the detailed analyses. To include archetypes of multi-functional buildings in bottom-up building energy models, a new modelling method was proposed. The method provides a rationale for the classification of energy end-uses into typical and extra, so that the modeling problem is simplified and a coherent use of well-established Reference Buildings modelling methods is allowed. Then, the focus of the research was narrowed to the hotel sector, which was found to lack of reliable energy performance benchmarks and effective performance-based greens labels. Case study buildings were object of energy and financial evaluations. On one side, real hotels were analyzed to test the application of the EU imposed cost-optimal methodology as a support tool to guide private investors' investment decisions. On the other side, an Italian Reference Hotel was modelled and the cost-optimal methodology was applied to investigate the existing energy and financial gaps between cost-optimal and Nearly Zero Energy performance level in Italy. From both perspectives, findings converged to similar conclusions: high performing retrofit are not financially viable, if avoided energy costs are the only operational benefits accounted for. Starting from these outcomes, the thesis investigated how valuation procedures could be exploited to make NZEB retrofit solutions appealing for private investors. Based on a literature review of the co-benefits of energy efficiency projects, 2 different strategies were pursued and tested on the Italian Reference Hotel. The first approach proposed to monetize co-benefits of energy efficiency interventions based on literature and to include them in the well-established cost-optimal methodology. Results highlighted that co-benefits related to the market appreciation of a retrofitted hotel can drastically change the perception of the financial convenience of an ambitious retrofit project. In the latter strategy, the issue of monetizing non-energy benefits was faced directly: a technique to value non-market goods was applied to monetize comfort. Findings proved that hotels guests' willingness to pay for comfortable indoor conditions is higher than the hoteliers' extra costs for providing them. Due to the context-dependent nature of co-benefits, the findings of the 2 applications do not represent generally applicable quantitative benchmarks. Nonetheless, they confirm the leading role that literature attribute to co-benefits in the success of energy efficiency projects...|$|E

Cogenerating reactors can support the European Union <b>low-carbon</b> society <b>goals</b> while providing stability in production and cost. High Temperature Reactor (HTR) technologies are well suited {{for the production of}} “high value” heat by producing temperatures of 200 º- 550 ºC, typically in the form of process steam. Future HTR designs and liquid metal cooled fast reactors could produce heat within and potentially beyond this temperature range. However, little public information is available on these reactor costs. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop “target cost” estimates for a range of competitive European cogeneration market situations, competing against coal and natural gas combined heat and power (CHP) systems. Parametric analysis was used to develop a cost breakdown of the capital, operating, and fuel cycle costs. Sensitivity analysis was used to understand the impact on competitiveness from key cost variables. Results suggest that reactor overnight capital costs of 5000 - 7500 Euro/kWe are needed to compete with fossil-based CHP systems with moderate fuel and carbon costs.

40|$|AbstractDecarbonisation of {{existing}} infrastructure systems requires a dynamic roll-out of technology at an unprecedented scale. The potential disruption in supply of critical materials could endanger such {{a transition to}} low-carbon infrastructure and, by extension, compromise energy security more broadly because low carbon technologies are reliant on these materials {{in a way that}} fossil-fuelled energy infrastructure is not. Criticality is currently defined as the combination of the potential for supply disruption and the exposure of a system of interest to that disruption. We build on this definition and develop a dynamic approach to quantifying criticality, which monitors the change in criticality during the transition towards a <b>low-carbon</b> infrastructure <b>goal.</b> This allows us to assess the relative risk of different technology pathways to reach a particular goal and reduce the probability of being ‘locked in’ to currently attractive but potentially future-critical technologies. To demonstrate, we apply our method to criticality of the proposed UK electricity system transition, with a focus on neodymium. We anticipate that the supply disruption potential of neodymium will decrease by almost 30 % by 2050; however, our results show the criticality of low carbon electricity production increases ninefold over this period, as a result of increasing exposure to neodymium-reliant technologies...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{assessment}} method to analyze whether the disruption in supply {{of a group}} of materials endangers the transition to low-carbon infrastructure. We define criticality as the combination of the potential for supply disruption and the exposure of the system of interest to that disruption. Low-carbon energy depends on multiple technologies comprised of a multitude of materials of varying criticality. Our methodology allows us to assess the simultaneous potential for supply disruption of a range of materials. Generating a specific target level of low-carbon energy implies a dynamic roll-out of technology at a specific scale. Our approach is correspondingly dynamic, and monitors the change in criticality during the transition towards a <b>low-carbon</b> energy <b>goal.</b> It is thus not limited to the quantification of criticality of a particular material at a particular point in time. We apply our method to criticality in the proposed UK energy transition as a demonstration, with a focus on neodymium use in electric vehicles. Although we anticipate that the supply disruption of neodymium will decrease, our results show the criticality of low carbon energy generation increases, as a result of increasing exposure to neodymium-reliant technologies. We present a number of potential responses to reduce the criticality through a reduction in supply disruption potential of the exposure of the UK to that disruption...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to current globe challenging climate change, intervening in city space to guide human activities to promote a low-carbon development (reducing carbon sources and strengthening carbon sinks) attaches great importance, which is an essential step for supporting final sustainable development. When confronted with environmental problems, river-based regions that own both natural landscape and man-made properties are always treated as typical, preferred planning and action spaces (poineering urbanization areas particularly in China). In a word, river-based regions normally act as intervention instruments to carry intervention actions contributing in solving environmental problems. Taking appropriate practical intervention actions in river-based regions needs pertinent planning approach {{that serves as the}} guiding tool and driver behind to support. In this context, this research focuses on the triangulated relation between “low-carbon development”, “river-based regions” and supportive “planning integrated approach”, from theory to practice covering strategic level and operational level of the planning. This research is organized by three parts. In the first part, it starts with explaining the development course and definitions of three key words, and further establishes general theoretical framework regarding low-carbon development in river-based regions. After that in the coming second part, this research analyses two case studies: a main Chinese case (Haihe riverside region in metropolis Tianjin) and a referenced German case (IBA Emscher Park in the Ruhr area). It dissects issues around the mechanism of planning integrated approach guiding practical actions relative to <b>low-carbon</b> development <b>goals,</b> through applying established theoretical framework.

This research is intended to discuss the thinking mode, value orientation, theories as well as practicable methods in terms of current traditional urban planning paradigm in China, for promoting a low-carbon transformation in the rapid urbanization region...|$|R

Concerns about global warming and climate change have generated increasing interest in development of bioenergy crops as a potential source of <b>low-carbon</b> energy. The <b>goal</b> of this research was to quantify environmental and economic effects of using the U. S. CRP land to produce large-scale bioenergy crops. The APEX model was used to evaluate the potential of switchgrass and hybrid poplar production to provide biomass feedstock, sequester soil carbon, and simultaneously provide other environmental co-benefits including improvement of soil and water quality in the MINK region. The environmental results indicate that the level of biomass yields and change in soil organic carbon differ with type of bioenergy crop, soil type, climatic conditions, and cultural management. Converting CRP land into bioenergy crop production and adopting conservation management practices significantly reduced sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loading into water bodies relative to traditional food crop production under conventional and conservation tillage practices. Results on economic effects of reverting CRP land into traditional crop production show a decline in prices of major U. S. commodities and federal government saving of nearly $ 1. 7 billion annually on CRP rental payments. Putting some cropland currently under tradition crop production to produce conservation buffers has insignificant impact on commodity prices.
