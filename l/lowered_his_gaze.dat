6000|$|The {{door opened}} slowly, and the tall figure of Captain Crippen entered {{and stood there}} eyeing them nervously. A neat little speech he had {{prepared}} failed him at the supreme moment.

60|$|An Indian brave, {{whose eyes}} were {{directed}} sentimentally to the stars, {{as though he}} were thinking of his lady-love--or buffalo steaks and marrow-bones--cocked his ears and <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> to earth, but as nothing more was to be seen or heard, he raised his eyes and thoughts again to love--or marrow-bones.|$|E
60|$|The unfortunate steward quailed {{beneath the}} {{severity}} of her glance. Even if he gave a full account of the affair it would not make his position better. It was he who had made all the arrangements with Mr. Smith, and after an indignant glance at that gentleman he <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> and remained silent.|$|E
60|$|The deadly foes {{were once}} again face to face. The chieftain's lofty figure and dark, sleek head, now bare of plumes, towered over the other Indians, {{but he was not}} obliged to <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> in order to look {{straight}} into the hunter's eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud narrated: We {{were with}} the Prophet while we were young and had no wealth whatever. So Allah's Apostle said, [...] "O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> and guard <b>his</b> modesty (i.e., his private parts from {{committing}} illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever {{is not able to}} marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual desire." [...] Volume 7, Book 62, Number 4: ...|$|R
60|$|Eustace <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> {{foot and}} <b>gazed</b> at her meditatively, {{then at the}} odd-job man, then at the scullery-maid, whose voice rose high above the din.|$|R
6000|$|... "Plan hell! You've spoiled my plan an' I've seen about {{enough of}} you." [...] Beasley breathed hard; <b>his</b> <b>lowering</b> <b>gaze</b> boded an {{uncertain}} will toward {{the man who}} had crossed him; his hand still hung low and clutching.|$|R
60|$|Captain Barber {{turned and}} {{regarded}} the mate fixedly; the mate, after a vain attempt to meet <b>his</b> <b>gaze,</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> {{eyes to the}} deck.|$|R
6000|$|Rudi moved a little, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> arms. He {{turned to}} Hendricks, licking his lips. The whites {{of his eyes}} shone wildly. Sweat dripped from his forehead, down his cheeks.

6000|$|For a world Julia {{could not}} have said more; and Miss Emmerson thought that she had said quite {{as much as the}} {{occasion}} required; but Miss Emmerson, it will be remembered, supposed their driver to be Anthony Sandford. The hero, himself, on hearing such a gentle voice so softly replying to his question, could not refrain from turning his face into the carriage, and Julia felt her own eyes <b>lower</b> before <b>his</b> earnest <b>gaze,</b> while her cheeks burned with the blushes that suffused them. But the look spoke volumes--he understands my [...] "Antonio," [...] thought Julia, and perceives that, to me, he is no longer unknown. That expressive glance has opened between us a communication that will cease but with our lives. Julia now enjoyed, for the remainder of their journey to Mr. Miller's, one of the greatest pleasures of love--unsuspected by others, she could hold communion with him who had her heart, by the eyes, and a thousand tender and nameless little offices which give interest to affection, and zest to passion.|$|R

60|$|He lifted <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> {{from the}} idle shells {{to the old}} man's stare.|$|R
60|$|Something in her {{expression}} arrested <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> and he regarded the girl curiously.|$|R
60|$|But ever <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> {{returned}} to the wonderful lily beside the bubbling spring.|$|R
60|$|She {{remained}} {{silent for a}} while, returning <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> till he removed it.|$|R

60|$|Jacinta met <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> unwaveringly, and {{her voice}} had a little thrill in it.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Brown looked {{steadily}} {{into the}} other's face. Sir Allan met <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> blandly.|$|R
60|$|The skipper {{eyed him}} all over. Tommy, {{unconscious}} of offence, met <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> serenely.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes darkened under <b>his</b> <b>gaze,</b> and a slow {{crimson tide}} stained her white face.|$|R
60|$|Ki {{considered}} her, {{till she}} who ever feared and hated him shrank before <b>his</b> <b>gaze.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin {{suddenly}} leaned forward. <b>His</b> <b>gaze</b> was compelling. <b>His</b> {{tone was}} low but terrible.|$|R
60|$|Shefford {{had not yet}} {{control of}} speech. Something in <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> {{appeared}} to drive Joe frantic.|$|R
