5|$|Stratton wrote Social Psychology for International Conduct {{for social}} science {{teachers}} {{who wanted to}} use psychology to analyze international affairs. The book's first part evaluated races. Stratton concluded the Caucasoid and Mongoloid races were innately more intelligent enabling them to build strong cultures. He also stated the prejudice of other people was from {{the social and political}} advantages it brought. Stratton saw nations as made up of individuals and possessing a national character similar to what individuals had. Reviewing the book in the American Journal of Sociology, Ellsworth Faris objected to the author concluding the Northern and Central Europeans were more intelligent than Southern and Eastern Europeans, noting intelligence measures correlated also with <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in America.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} how two indices of spouse support, one relatively general and chronic (perceived overall marital quality), and one relatively situation-specific and acute (spouse support {{while in the}} hospital), separately and in interaction with patient gender, predict postoperative <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stays</b> following major (coronary bypass) surgery. In a sample of 226 male and 70 female patients drawn from three hospitals in the San Diego area, California, {{the results indicated that}} marital quality, in combination with patient gender, predicted postoperative <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> such that relatively poor marital relationships elevated risk for longer stays for female but not male patients. <b>Lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for female patients with higher quality marital relationships were similar to those of male patients (regardless of marital quality). These results were not attributable to any assessed preoperative differences in patient health and were independent of perceptions of spouse support received while in the hospital, which did not independently predict patients' <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Marital quality Hospital support Patient gender Coronary bypass surgery Hospital stay...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> Hospital <b>Stay</b> is an {{important}} issue for the hospital managers, patients and their families. Regarding to the importance of this issue and few similar researches, this study aimed to model the <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> Hospital <b>Stay</b> for myocardial infarction (MI) patients admitted in Vasei hospital of Sabzevar, and to investigate its effective factors. Material and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was performed to model the <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> Hospital <b>Stay</b> for myocardial infarction (MI) patients admitted in Vasei hospital of Sabzevar, in 2012. By using census method, 201 patients were entered to this study and the value <b>of</b> the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> hospitalization as the response variable, and the value of gender, age and residence location of the patients as the independent variables are considered. The data were analyzed using an advanced and new model, zero-truncated generalized poisson regression model, and SAS 9. 2 software. Results: The results showed that the average <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> Hospital <b>Stay</b> <b>of</b> MI patients was 4. 876 days in Vasei hospital. Also, it was found that one year increase in age was related to one day increase in hospitalization of the MI patients. Moreover, the regression models predicted that the average <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> Hospital <b>Stay</b> for female patients was less than male patients, and the average <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> Hospital <b>Stay</b> for the urban residence patients was less than those of rural residence. Conclusions: In this study, a suitable statistical method for analyzing and modeling <b>of</b> the <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> Hospital <b>Stay</b> was obtained. Because <b>of</b> differences in <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> Hospital <b>Stay</b> in different units of hospitals, use of these advanced statistical models is proposed for another hospitals and cities...|$|R
