5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except <b>losartan),</b> beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and <b>losartan</b> are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E
25|$|<b>Losartan</b> is a selective, {{competitive}} angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonist, {{reducing the}} end organ responses to angiotensin II. <b>Losartan</b> administration {{results in a}} decrease in total peripheral resistance (afterload) and cardiac venous return (preload). All of the physiological effects of angiotensin II, including release of aldosterone, are antagonized {{in the presence of}} <b>losartan.</b> Reduction in blood pressure occurs independently of the status of the renin-angiotensin system. As a result of <b>losartan</b> dosing, plasma renin activity increases due to removal of the angiotensin II feedback.|$|E
25|$|<b>Losartan</b> is a uricosuric. As a {{specific}} inhibitor of the urate transporter 1 (SLC22A12, URAT1), <b>losartan</b> blocks the uptake of uric acid into cells, thus leaving more {{available in the}} bloodstream to be filtered and excreted by the kidneys. Because <b>losartan</b> can cause hyperkalemia, individuals should not use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without appropriate monitoring by a physician.|$|E
25|$|Metabolism is {{primarily}} by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Peak plasma concentrations of <b>losartan</b> and EXP3174 occur about one hour and {{three to four}} hours, respectively, after an oral dose. Both <b>losartan</b> and EXP3174 are more than 98% bound to plasma proteins. <b>Losartan</b> is excreted in the urine, and in the feces via bile, as unchanged drug and metabolites. About 4% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine, and about 6% is excreted in urine as the active metabolite. The terminal elimination half lives of <b>losartan</b> and EXP3174 are about 1.5 to 2.5 hours and 3 to 9 hours, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, the FDA {{issued a}} black box warning that <b>losartan</b> can cause fetal toxicity, {{and should be}} {{discontinued}} as soon as pregnancy is detected. Using <b>losartan</b> while pregnant could result in fetal injury or death.|$|E
25|$|Irbesartan was {{developed}} by Sanofi Research and is longer acting than valsartan and <b>losartan</b> and it has an imidazolinone ring where a carbonyl group functions as a hydrogen bond acceptor instead of the hydroxymethyl group in <b>losartan.</b> Irbesartan is a non-competitive inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Losartan,</b> valsartan, candesartan, irbesartan, {{telmisartan}} and olmesartan all {{contain a}} biphenyl-methyl group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Losartan</b> {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{diabetic}} and taking aliskiren.|$|E
25|$|In valsartan, the {{imidazole}} ring of <b>losartan</b> {{has been}} replaced with an acylated amino acid.|$|E
25|$|Then {{the polar}} {{carboxyl}} group {{was replaced with}} a more lipophilic tetrazole group {{in order to increase}} oral bioavailability and duration of action further and the compound thus formed was named <b>losartan.</b> This development took place in 1986 and <b>losartan</b> became the first successful Ang II antagonist drug, approved as such in the United States in 1995 and was marketed by Merck.|$|E
25|$|This {{development}} was an extensive program {{and it is}} estimated that the process from the Takeda structures to the final substance, <b>losartan,</b> took more than fifty person-years of work in biological testing and chemical modifications. This represents an excellent investment given that a recent study estimated that <b>losartan</b> administration in the European union may reduce health care provision costs by 2.5 billion euro over 3.5 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Losartan</b> {{and other}} angiotensin-receptor antagonists exhibit fetal {{toxicity}} {{and should be}} avoided during pregnancy, particularly {{in the second and}} third trimesters.|$|E
25|$|Valsartan, first marketet by Novartis, is a nonheterocyclic ARB, {{where the}} {{imidazole}} of <b>losartan</b> {{has been replaced}} by an acylated amino acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Losartan</b> can, and topical nitrates may, {{reduce the}} {{severity}} {{and frequency of}} attacks, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil may reduce their severity.|$|E
25|$|Angiotensin {{receptor}} blockers or ACE inhibitors may aid {{blood flow}} to the fingers, and {{there is some evidence that}} angiotensin receptor blockers (often <b>losartan)</b> reduce frequency and severity of attacks, and possibly better than nifedipine.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects for <b>losartan</b> are upper {{respiratory}} infections or stuffy nose, dizziness, and back pain. Type 2 diabetics with diabetic kidney disease may experience diarrhea, fatigue, low blood pressure, low blood glucose, elevated potassium, and chest pain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{it was noted}} that a series of imidazole-5-acetic acid {{derivatives}} diminished blood pressure responses to Ang II in rats. Two compounds, S-8307 and S-8308, were later found to be highly specific and promising non-peptide Ang II receptor antagonists but using molecular modeling it was seen that their structures would have to mimic more closely the pharmacophore of Ang II. Structural modifications were made and the orally active, potent and selective nonpeptide AT1 receptor blocker <b>losartan</b> was developed. In 1995 <b>losartan</b> was approved for clinical use in the United States and since then six additional ARBs have been approved. These drugs are known for their excellent side-effects profiles, which clinical trials have shown to be similar to those of placebos.|$|E
25|$|In current medical practice, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system's overactivity (and {{resultant}} hypertension) is {{more commonly}} reduced using either ACE inhibitors (such as ramipril and perindopril) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs, such as <b>losartan,</b> irbesartan or candesartan) {{rather than a}} direct oral renin inhibitor. ACE inhibitors or ARBs {{are also part of}} the standard treatment after a heart attack.|$|E
25|$|Around 14% of orally {{ingested}} <b>losartan</b> is metabolized to its 5-carboxylic acid metabolite EXP 3174. As mentioned before, candesartan cilexetil and {{olmesartan medoxomil}} are inactive ester prodrugs that are completely hydrolyzed to their active forms by esterases during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. These three metabolites are more potent AT1 receptor antagonists than their prodrugs. The other ARBs {{do not have}} active metabolites.|$|E
25|$|Candesartan and {{olmesartan}} {{have the}} highest affinity for the AT1 receptors, followed by irbesartan and eprosartan. Valsartan, telmisartan and EXP 3174 have similar affinities that are about ten-fold {{less than that of}} candesartan. <b>Losartan</b> has the least affinity. ARBs' affinity for the AT2 receptor is generally much lower (or around 10,000 times less) than for the AT1 subtype. Therefore they allow unhindered stimulation of the AT2 receptor.|$|E
25|$|Candesartan {{cilexetil}} (TCV 116) is a benzimidazole {{which was}} developed at Takeda {{and is an}} ester carbonate prodrug. In vivo, it is rapidly converted to the much more potent corresponding 7-carboxylic acid, candesartan. In the interaction of candesartan with AT1 receptor the carboxyl group of the benzimidazole ring plays an important role. Candesartan and its prodrug have stronger blood pressure lowering effects than EXP 3174 and <b>losartan.</b>|$|E
25|$|All of the ARBs {{have the}} same {{mechanism}} of action and differences in their potency {{can be related to}} their different pharmacokinetic profiles. A few clinical head-to-head comparisons have been made and candesartan, irbesartan and telmisartan appear to be slightly more effective than <b>losartan</b> in lowering blood pressure. This difference may be related to different strengths of activity at the receptor level, such as duration and strength of receptor binding.|$|E
25|$|All of the ARBs, {{except for}} {{valsartan}} and olmesartan, are metabolized {{in some way}} by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 2C9, that {{is found in the}} human liver. CYP2C9 is for example responsible for the metabolizing of <b>losartan</b> to EXP 3174 and the slow metabolizing of valsartan and candesartan to their inactive metabolites. Telmisartan is, on the other hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and olmesartan is excreted as the unchanged drug.|$|E
25|$|Mesuximide {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, <b>losartan,</b> montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
2500|$|Several substituents {{have been}} tried at the 4- and 5- {{positions}} on the imidazole ring. The chloro and hydroxymethyl groups connected to these positions in <b>losartan</b> are probably not of much importance in receptor binding since the other ARBs do not possess these functional groups and have comparable or better binding affinities than <b>losartan.</b> Irbesartan has a carbonyl group at the 5-position, functioning as a hydrogen bond acceptor {{in place of the}} hydroxymethyl group of <b>losartan,</b> resulting in a longer binding to the receptor.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{clinical}} evidence shows calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-line treatments for most patients (due to both efficacy and cost), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist such as <b>losartan</b> is recommended as first-line treatment in patients {{under the age}} of 55 who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor. The LIFE study demonstrated <b>losartan</b> was significantly superior to atenolol in the primary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke), with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for a comparable reduction in blood pressure. [...] The maximal effects on blood pressure usually occur within 3–6 weeks of starting <b>losartan.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Losartan</b> is well absorbed {{following}} {{oral administration}} and undergoes significant first-pass metabolism {{to produce the}} 5-carboxylic acid metabolite, designated as EXP3174. About 14% of an oral dosage is converted to this metabolite, which is long-acting (6 to 8 hr) and a noncompetitive antagonist at the AT1 receptor, contributing to the pharmacological effects of <b>losartan.</b> EXP3174 is 10-40 times more potent in blocking AT1 receptors than <b>losartan.</b> In addition, the binding to the target enzyme is pH-sensitive, and the negatively-charged tetrazole ring, which is similar in size to the negative carboxylic acid derivative, {{may contribute to the}} activity of the drug.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Losartan</b> is {{generally}} marketed as the (basic) potassium salt of the aromatized negatively charged tetrazole, called [...] "losartan potassium." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Losartan</b> {{is partly}} metabolized to its 5-carboxylic acid {{metabolite}} EXP 3174, {{which is a}} more potent AT1 receptor antagonist than its parent compound ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Losartan,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Cozaar among others, is an {{angiotensin}} II receptor antagonist drug used mainly to treat {{high blood pressure}} (hypertension).|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} {{angiotensin}} II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonists, <b>losartan</b> is indicated {{for the treatment}} of hypertension. It may also delay progression of diabetic nephropathy and is associated with a positive clinical outcome in that regard. It is a suitable pharmacological agent for the reduction of renal disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria (>30mg/24 hours) or proteinuria (>900mg/24 hours).|$|E

50|$|<b>Losartan,</b> irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, valsartan, fimasartan and azilsartan {{include the}} {{tetrazole}} group (a ring with four nitrogen and one carbon). <b>Losartan,</b> irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, and telmisartan include {{one or two}} imidazole groups.|$|E
