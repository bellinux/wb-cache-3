40|$|An optimally {{designed}} thermosiphon {{for power}} electronics cooling is developed. There exists {{a need for}} augmented grid assets to facilitate power routing and decrease <b>line</b> losses. <b>Power</b> <b>converter</b> augmented transformers (PCATs) are critically limited thermally. Conventional active cooling system pumps and fans will not meet the 30 year life and 99. 9 % reliability required for grid scale implementation. This approach seeks to develop a single-phase closed-loop thermosiphon to remove heat from power electronics at fluxes {{on the order of}} 10 - 15 W/cm 2. The passive thermosiphon is inherently a coupled thermal-fluid system. A parametric model and multi-physics design optimization code will be constructed to simulate thermosiphon steady state performance. The model will utilize heat transfer and fluid dynamic correlations from literature. A particle swarm optimization technique will be implemented for its performance with discrete domain problems. Several thermosiphons will be constructed, instrumented, and tested to verify the model and reach an optimal design. MSCommittee Chair: Mayor, J.

The negative terminal {{of the solar}} cell array can be directly connected {{to the ground in}} the proposed grid-connected <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> to avoid the transparent conducting oxide corrosion that occurs in some types of thin-film solar cell array. The proposed grid-connected <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> consists of a dc–dc <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> and a dc–ac inverter. The salient features of the proposed <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> are that some power electronic switches are simultaneously used in both the dc–dc <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> and dc–ac inverter, and only two power electronic switches operate at high switching frequency at the same time (one is in the dc– dc <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> and the other is in the dc–ac inverter).

30|$|In a MTDC grid, {{the most}} vital component, {{providing}} power exchange {{to and from the}} grid, is the <b>power</b> electronics-based <b>power</b> <b>converter.</b> In comparison to synchronous generators, <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> have a time response that can be several orders of magnitude faster, due to the additional control capabilities and the lack of mechanical inertia.

The inputs and outputs of these converters may be dc, ac, single phase, or multi-phase.

Therefore, the ac-link universal <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> are expected to have higher reliability and smaller size.

40|$|Modern {{electronics}} {{continues to}} push past boundaries of integration and functional density toward elusive, completely autonomous, self-powered microsystems. As systems continue to shrink, however, less energy {{is available on}} board, leading to short device lifetimes (run-time or battery life). Extended battery life is particularly advantageous in the systems with limited accessibility, such as biomedical implants and structure-embedded micro-sensors. The power management process usually requires compact and efficient <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> to be embedded in these microsystems. This dissertation introduces switched-capacitor (SC) <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> designs that make all these techniques realizable on silicon. Four different integrated SC <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> with multiple control schemes are designed here to provide low-power high-efficient power sources. First, a monolithic step-down <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> with subthreshold z-domain digital pulse-width modulation (DPWM) controller is proposed for ultra-low power microsystems. The subthreshold design significantly reduces the power dissipation in the controller. Second, an efficient monolithic master-slave complementary <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> with a feedback controller that purely operates in subthreshold operation region is discussed to tailor for the aforementioned ultra-low power applications. Third, we introduce an efficient monolithic step-down SC power stage with multiple-gain control and on-chip capacitor sizing for self-powered microsystems. The multiple-gain control helps the converter to constantly maintain high efficiency over a large input/output range. The size-adjustable pumping capacitors allow the output voltage to be regulated at different desired levels, with a constant 50 % duty ratio. The monolithic implementations in these three integrated CMOS <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> effectively suppress noise and glitches caused by parasitic components due to bonding, packaging and PCB wiring. Fourth, an efficient step-up and step-down SC <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> with multiple-gain closed-loop controller is presented. The measurements and simulation results in these four <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> demonstrate the techniques proposed in this research. The approaches presented in this dissertation are evidently viable for realizing compact and high efficient SC <b>power</b> <b>converters,</b> contributing to next generation power-efficient microsystems designs...|$|R
