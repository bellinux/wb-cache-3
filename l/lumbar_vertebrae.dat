5|$|Females {{have four}} pairs of mammae, {{as usual in}} oryzomyines. Like most rice rats, Transandinomys species have twelve {{thoracic}} (chest) and seven <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> According to a study in Costa Rica, T.bolivaris has 58chromosomes {{and the number of}} chromosomal arms (fundamental number) is 80 (2n=58, FN=80). Studies in Ecuador and Venezuela have recorded several different karyotypes in T.talamancae, with the number of chromosomes ranging from 34 to 54 and the fundamental number from 60 to 67.|$|E
5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunk of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{has at least}} 26 {{vertebrae}}. In Dinocephalosaurus, {{there appear to be}} no <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> or vertebrae of the trunk lacking ribs.

Each of the gastralia in Dinocephalosaurus is composed of three elements instead of four as in Tanystropheus; they differ in that Dinocephalosaurus only has one element on the midline, while Tanystropheus has two elements that combine to form a midline bar.|$|E

5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of patients in the first 3 days after onset of weakness, which increases to 80% after the first week.|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known {{vertebrae}} of Plesiorycteropus. The animal had {{at least}} seven sacral and five or six <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> A find of associated caudal vertebrae {{from the base of}} the tail, which diminish in size only slowly from front to back, suggests that the tail was long. There is no evidence for the additional joints between the vertebrae that are characteristic of xenarthrans. In the seven known thoracic (chest) vertebrae, the articulations with the intervertebral disks are bean-shaped and much wider from side to side than from top to bottom. In the back thoracics and all lumbars, a longitudinal transarcual canal is present in the neural arch.|$|E
5|$|Pseudoryzomys has 19 or 20thoracic (chest) and <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> 13 {{of which}} bear ribs, as is {{characteristic}} of oryzomyines. The first ribs contact both the seventh cervical (neck) vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra, an important character of the Sigmodontinae. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including Holochilus and Lundomys, the fourth lumbar vertebra lacks the processes known as anapophyses. There are three or four sacral and about 29caudal (tail) vertebrae. Between {{the second and third}} caudal vertebrae, separate bones called hemal arches are present. These display a spinous process at the back, as in both Holochilus and Lundomys. On the humerus, the upper arm bone, the entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; in some other cricetids, it perforates the far (distal) end of the humerus.|$|E

5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of {{ankylosing}} spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, {{which is where the}} largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae</b> injuries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Only ten {{cases of}} primary pyogenic {{spondylitis}} following vertebroplasty {{have been reported}} in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first reported case of primary pyogenic spondylitis and spondylodiscitis caused by kyphoplasty. Case presentation A 72 -year old Caucasian man with an osteoporotic compression fracture of the first <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> after kyphoplasty developed sensory incomplete paraplegia below the first <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra.</b> This was caused by myelon compression following pyogenic spondylitis with a psoas abscess. Computed tomography guided aspiration of the abscess cavity yielded group C Streptococcus. The psoas abscess was percutaneously drained and laminectomy and posterior instrumentation with an internal fixator from the eleventh thoracic vertebra to the fourth <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> was performed. In a second operation, corpectomy of the first <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> with cement removal and fusion from the twelfth thoracic vertebra to the second <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> with a titanium cage was performed. Six weeks postoperatively, the patient was pain free with no neurologic deficits or signs of infection. Conclusion Pyogenic spondylitis is an extremely rare complication after kyphoplasty. When these patients develop recurrent back pain postoperatively, the diagnosis of pyogenic spondylitis must be considered. </p...|$|R

25|$|Research on the Lady's spine {{located a}} smooth lateral curve on the lumbar region (lower spine), with a {{convexity}} towards the left. This {{is an indication}} of lumbar scoliosis. The limits of the curve have been determined. The upper limit is between the twelfth thoracic vertebra and the first lumbar vertebra. The lower limit is between the fourth and fifth <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The center of the curve is between the second and third <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The scoliosis of the Lady is mild, with a Cobb angle of less than 20°. Researchers found no evidence of structural abnormalities in the vertebrae, no fractures, and no congenital anomalies (birth defects). The researchers suspect that the Lady may not have actually suffered from scoliosis while still alive. The curved spine of the mummy may be a postmortem condition, resulting from the position of the body during the mummification process.|$|E
25|$|The muscle fibres of the {{diaphragm}} emerge from many surrounding structures. At the front, fibres insert into the xiphoid process {{and along the}} costal margin. Laterally, muscle fibers insert into ribs 6-12. In the back, muscle fibres insert into the vertebra at T12 and two appendages, {{the right and left}} crus, descend and insert into the <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae</b> at L1 & L2.|$|E
5000|$|Lumbarization is {{an anomaly}} in the spine. It {{is defined by}} the nonfusion of the first and second {{segments}} of the sacrum. The lumbar spine subsequently appears to have six vertebrae or segments, not five. This sixth <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> is known as a transitional vertebra. Conversely the sacrum appears to have only four segments instead of its designated five segments. Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae consist of the process of the last <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> fusing with the first sacral segment. [...] While only around 10 percent of adults have a spinal abnormality due to genetics, a sixth <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> {{is one of the more}} common abnormalities.|$|R

25|$|The {{skeleton}} {{had belonged}} to an individual who, based on evidence of osteoarthritis in the <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> eburnation, and severe wear on the teeth with pulp exposure, was about 50 years old – relatively old for an early human – when he died. The bone structure had a gracile character, which contrasts with the morphology of modern indigenous Australians. Parts of the skeleton had deteriorated in situ: substantial portions of the skull were missing {{and most of the}} bones in the limbs have suffered surface damage.|$|E
25|$|There {{are seven}} {{cervical}} vertebrae, twelve thoracic vertebrae and five <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The number of vertebrae {{in a region}} can vary but overall the number remains the same. The number {{of those in the}} cervical region however is only rarely changed. The vertebrae of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines are independent bones, and generally quite similar. The vertebrae of the sacrum and coccyx are usually fused and unable to move independently. Two special vertebrae are the atlas and axis, on which the head rests.|$|E
25|$|In birds, {{there is}} a {{variable}} number of cervical vertebrae, which often form the only truly flexible part of the spine. The thoracic vertebrae are partially fused, providing a solid brace for the wings during flight. The sacral vertebrae are fused with the <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> and some thoracic and caudal vertebrae, to form a single structure, the synsacrum, which is thus of greater relative length than the sacrum of mammals. In living birds, the remaining caudal vertebrae are fused into a further bone, the pygostyle, for attachment of the tail feathers.|$|E

25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to {{open the front door}} of the {{residence}} and the driver got out to open the door for Moyne. They were suddenly told not to move, as Bet-Zuri emerged and shot Fuller in the chest, causing him to collapse in the driveway and bleed to death in minutes. Hakim then pulled the car door open and shot Moyne three times. The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded to the right of the second <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four of his fingers and went in and out of his chest, causing no serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|Vertebrae {{are defined}} by the regions of the {{vertebral}} column that they occur in, as in humans. Cervical vertebrae are those in the neck area. With {{the exception of the}} two sloth genera (Choloepus and Bradypus) and the manatee genus, (Trichechus), all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae. In other vertebrates, the number of cervical vertebrae can range from a single vertebra in amphibians, to as many as 25 in swans or 76 in the extinct plesiosaur Elasmosaurus. The dorsal vertebrae range {{from the bottom of the}} neck to the top of the pelvis. Dorsal vertebrae attached to the ribs are called thoracic vertebrae, while those without ribs are called <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The sacral vertebrae are those in the pelvic region, and range from one in amphibians, to two in most birds and modern reptiles, or up to three to five in mammals. When multiple sacral vertebrae are fused into a single structure, it is called the sacrum. The synsacrum is a similar fused structure found in birds that is composed of the sacral, lumbar, and some of the thoracic and caudal vertebra, as well as the pelvic girdle. Caudal vertebrae compose the tail, and the final few can be fused into the pygostyle in birds, or into the coccygeal or tail bone in chimpanzees (and humans).|$|E
