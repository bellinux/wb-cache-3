50|$|The {{number of}} spokes in the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> has {{continuously}} changed. Most early cars had four-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{pertains to}} an ergonomic <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim {{designed to promote}} a neutral position to the forearm, reducing stress and fatigue by discouraging fixed wrist positions, i. e., flexion and ulnar deviation. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim of the invention provides a more comfortable driving position, reduces injury associated with airbag deployment, and reduces stress on hands and wrists. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim has one or more hand grip portions that deviate from the XY plane away from the driver. The present invention further concerns <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> comprising {{the rim of the}} invention and vehicles comprising the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> of the invention...|$|R
50|$|There are two wheels, {{the larger}} driving wheel for {{travelling}} in a forward direction, and a trailing <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and 90 degrees to this one. Both the drive <b>wheel</b> and the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> however are constructed of multiple smaller 'planet' wheels {{that allow the}} wheel to be moved laterally. When moving forward the main wheel will be powered and the smaller planet <b>wheels</b> on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> will rotate to avoid the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> dragging. To turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is rotated. To balance from side to side, or to self-balance laterally, the planet wheels on the drive wheel will be powered appropriately.|$|R

50|$|Prior to Nintendo's own Wii <b>Wheel,</b> several {{third-party}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories {{had been}} introduced for the Wii Remote. One released by Ubisoft, the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel,</b> was developed by Thrustmaster. It is bundled with certain games, such as Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT Pro Series. The accessory, which is only for aesthetic/ergonomic enhancement, is meant for driving-style gameplay in which the Wii Remote would be held lengthwise in a two-handed gamepad orientation, steering the subject by tilting the controller. The Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> is also sold separately. Since the Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> was revealed, other similarly designed <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories have been produced, including the Wii Racing Wheel by Intec.|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects in changing the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim tilt angle on the thorax of the Hybrid III and a human body model THUMS with respect to chest deflection and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim contact interaction. It was found that the Hybrid III chest is more sensitive to changes in <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> tilt angle than the THUMS...|$|R
50|$|The first button {{added to}} the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was a switch to {{activate}} the car's electric horn. Traditionally located on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> hub or center pad, the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring which obviated the necessity to move a hand away from the rim. Electrical connections are made via a slip ring. A further development, the Rim Blow <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> integrated the horn switch into the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim.|$|R
25|$|Models {{equipped}} with PDK also include an optional 3-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with gearshift paddles {{as an alternative}} to the standard <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with shift buttons.|$|R
50|$|The {{driver was}} faced by a <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> linked to its central boss by {{three sets of}} four thin spoke like rods. The design of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{reminiscent}} of the early Porsches, ensured minimal disruption of {{the view of the}} instruments behind it. Also behind the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was the column-mounted gear lever.|$|R
50|$|A {{universal}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> {{control interface}} {{can be used}} on most any vehicle with <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> controls, to be used with today's top aftermarket radio manufactures like Pioneer, Sony, Alpine, Kenwood, Eclipse, JVC, Valor, Boyo (Vision Tech), Dual, Visteon, Advent and Blaupunkt. It is used to retain the OEM <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> controls. It has the ability to auto-detect many vehicle makes and aftermarket radios and it will preset the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> controls to the aftermarket radio automatically so no programming is required. If desired it can be manually programmed so the user can make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> controls function the way they want them to, only limited by the functions of the aftermarket radio.|$|R

5000|$|An {{analysis}} of the onboard camera video was submitted by Cineca, which tracked {{the movement of the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> during the race. Having rotated in a fixed arc during the previous laps, during the final seconds a yellow button on the wheel moved several centimetres away from its normal trajectory, with the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> tilting in its own plane, indicating a breaking steering column. Williams introduced its own video to prove the movement was normal in which David Coulthard manhandled an FW16B <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> the effort required to deflect the wheel termed as [...] "quite considerable". Michele Alboreto testified that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> movement was abnormal, stating that the video [...] "proves that something was broken in Senna's Williams. No <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> moves a few centimetres." ...|$|R

50|$|Also {{known as}} a crook lock, or club lock, the first {{generation}} of steering-wheel locks, known as canes, consisted of a lockable bar that connected the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> to the brake pedal or clutch pedal. Later models include devices which are even more visible as they lock across the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and extend out over the dashboard to prevent the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> being turned.|$|R
50|$|From 1898, the Panhard et Levassor {{cars were}} {{equipped}} as standard with <b>steering</b> <b>wheels.</b> Charles Rolls introduced {{the first car}} in Britain fitted with a <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> when he imported a 6 hp Panhard from France in 1898.
