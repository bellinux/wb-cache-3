In a $11.3 billion multi-year <b>loan</b> <b>package,</b> Pakistan received a $7.4 billion loan for 2008–10. The IMF stipulated stringent reform conditions, which included rebuilding the tax structure and privatising state enterprises. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank withheld a combined $3 billion aid in the 2010–11 fiscal year and the IMF withheld since May 2010 the last segment of its aid package.|$|E

The project's total cost {{is expected to be}} $1.1 billion USD.

The state-owned French bank PROPARCO, which is the part of the French Development Agency (AFD) that supports private sector development, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) each lent about USD 100m to Diwaco. The <b>loan</b> <b>package</b> has been put together by the Arab Banking Corporation.

25|$|As {{the deal}} {{worked its way}} through state and federal {{regulatory}} approval, Dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt.

500|$|In December 2009, Zayat was sued by Fifth Third Bank for {{an alleged}} $34 million in unpaid loans. He had taken out {{multiple}} {{loans from the}} bank totaling over $38 million between 2007 and 2009. Fifth Third alleged that Zayat was in default because he failed to make two payments in 2009. As part of the <b>loan</b> <b>package,</b> the bank had a security interest in Zayat Stables' horses, prize money, stallion shares and stallion income. Further, the bank added an amended provision to its later loans stating, [...] "if Zayat Stables defaulted {{on any of the}} Notes, such default would be considered a default under all of the notes thereby entitling Fifth Third to accelerate the principal balance and all accrued interest due and owing under all of the Notes." [...] While Zayat paid off some of the money owed, the bank contended that he remained in default on one loan. The bank alleged that Zayat had lost $52 million between 2006 and 2008, that he had not reported a previous Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy he had filed under the name Ephraim David Zayat, and the bank attempted to foreclose on his horses.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} effects of IMF intervention on debtor and creditor incentives - so-called moral hazard - is mixed. A new test of creditor moral hazard is developed, which uses some new data and some more stringent identifying restrictions. The test examines the response of the market valuation of UK banks to IMF <b>loan</b> <b>packages.</b> It finds a significant positive response for UK banks, with abnormal returns of over 1 % in a number of cases. These excess returns are greater, the larger is the IMF package and the larger is the size of the creditor banks' emerging market portfolio. This effect is significant even once the potentially welfare-enhancing effect of IMF loans in offsetting overpricing problems in international capital markets is controlled for. In short, concrete evidence is found of creditor-side moral hazard associated with IMF support. ...|$|R
40|$|In August of 2007, banks faced {{a freeze}} in funding {{liquidity}} from the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market.

In contrast, foreign banks - with limited access to the deposit market and FHLB advances - lent less in the overnight interbank market and borrowed more from the Federal Reserve's Term Auction Facility (TAF) auctions. Relative to before the ABCP freeze and relative to their non-U.

It continues to have debates on basic questions about the economic framework. Issues deemed resolved may be resurrected with a new Supreme Court decision, a new legislative proposal, a new decision by a regulator, a new move to privatize or create a new regulator.
