25|$|Because {{under this}} {{approach}} land cannot be sown but existing plants can be tended and harvested, {{the approach is}} applied to orchards, vineyards, and other perennial crops. A beit din, or rabbinical court supervising the process, hires farmers as its agents to tend and harvest the crops, and appoints the usual distributors and shopkeepers as its agents to distribute them. Individual consumers appoint the court and its designees as their agents and pay monies to court-appointed designees as agents of the court. Thus, under this approach, a <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement</b> is created whereby the crops themselves are never bought or sold, but rather people are merely paid for their labor and expenses in providing certain services. In modern Israel, the badatz is notable for adapting and supervising such arrangements.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Diddley {{entered into}} a {{licensing}} agreement with the sportswear brand Nike. The Wieden & Kennedy produced commercial in the [...] "Bo Knows" [...] campaign, teamed Diddley with dual sportsman Bo Jackson, and resulted {{in one of the}} most iconic advertisements in advertising history. The agreement ended in 1991, but in 1999, a T-shirt of Diddley's image and [...] "You don't know diddley" [...] slogan was purchased in a Gainesville, Florida sports apparel store. Diddley felt that Nike should not continue to use the slogan or his likeness and fought Nike over the copyright infringement. Despite the fact that lawyers for both parties could not come to a renewed <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement,</b> Nike allegedly continued marketing the apparel and ignored cease-and-desist orders, and a lawsuit was filed on Diddley's behalf, in Manhattan Federal Court.|$|E
2500|$|From {{approximately}} 1952 to 1956, Gloria Swanson {{worked with}} actor Richard Stapley (aka Richard Wyler) and cabaret singer/pianist Dickson Hughes on a musical adaptation originally entitled Starring Norma Desmond, then Boulevard!

Rights holder Paramount Pictures originally had given Swanson verbal permission {{to proceed with the}} musical, but there had been no formal <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement.</b> On 20 February 1957, Paramount executive Russell Holman wrote to Swanson asking her to cease work on the project because [...] "it would be damaging for the property to be offered to the entertainment public in another form as a stage musical." [...] In 1994, Hughes incorporated material from the production into Swanson on Sunset, based on his and Stapley's experiences in writing Boulevard!. A recording of the entire score, which had been housed in the Gloria Swanson archives at the University of Texas, was released on CD in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Since then, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} scholarly argument among art historians on the occasion represented. Edwin Hall considers that the painting depicts a betrothal, not a marriage. [...] Margaret D. Carroll argues that the painting is {{a portrait of a}} married couple that alludes also to the husband's grant of legal authority to his wife. Carroll also proposes that the portrait was meant to affirm Giovanni Arnolfini's good character as a merchant and aspiring member of the Burgundian court. She argues that the painting depicts a couple, already married, now formalizing a subsequent <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement,</b> a mandate, by which the husband [...] "hands over" [...] to his wife the legal authority to conduct business on her own or his behalf (similar to a power of attorney). The claim is not that the painting had any legal force, but that van Eyck played upon the imagery of legal contract as a pictorial conceit. While the two figures in the mirror could be thought of as witnesses to the oath-taking, the artist himself provides (witty) authentication with his notarial signature on the wall.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after it}} opened, there were {{proposals}} {{to extend the}} canal to Market Rasen, but no further action was taken. The canal appears to have become disused in the 1850s, {{a few years after}} the opening of the Market Rasen branch of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway, which came nearer to Caistor than the canal. [...] However some traffic may have continued to South Kelsey, the village at its midpoint, [...] until later in the century. [...] The South Kesley estate was sold by Mr. Foljombe a few years after the canal opened. The new owner, Mr. Skipworth, [...] and his descendents, were resident owners throughout the [...] nineteenth century. [...] Although the canal company continued to legally exist the canal appears latterly to have been managed as if part of the Skipworth estate, but the nature of the <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement</b> for this, if any, is not recorded. [...] Following the cessation of traffic sometime {{in the latter half of}} the nineteenth century, parts of the canal were converted to other use: the fourth lock up was used as the site for a watermill - with the wheel occupying the lock chamber. [...] The canal became dry above the fifth lock and the stonework of the sixth lock removed entirely before 1883. [...] At some date after all traffic had ceased weirs [...] were built across the locks below South Kelsey. [...] Following the sale of the estate by the Skipworth family in the early years of the twentieth century the canal and its associated drainage system fell entirely out of repair. [...] In order to restore proper drainage to the surrounding land, the canal was taken over by the Ancholme drainage authority in 1936, after a formal abandonment order (Caistor Canal Act Revocation Order) had been obtained for the navigation under the 1930 Land Drainage Act.|$|E

40|$|The <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the {{management}} of water resources are currently a complex matrix of rules of various kinds. These rules perform a diverse range of functions. Some are part of what may be described as the macro-legal system for the governance of water resources. This includes paralegal rules in the form of statements of value, objective, outcome or principles. Others are part of the micro-legal system for the governance of water resources. This includes traditional legal rules in the form of statements of standards in relation to individual conduct, behaviour or decision making. These <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements</b> may be international, regional, national or local. Accordingly some apply to nation states within the international community. Others apply to the regulatory agencies making decisions about water resources within nation states. Ultimately most of these <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements</b> apply to those who use and develop water resources for particular purposes and in particular locations. In accordance with this framework, rules explain how water resources should be used in particular circumstances and how decisions should be made to ensure the effective planning and regulation of water resources...|$|R
