As it is stipulated in the Article 11 of the Subsoil Code of Ukraine (the Code) the authorities that administer the industry are limited to central <b>executive</b> <b>bodies</b> and <b>local</b> governments. In particular, it is stipulated in the Code that the Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers carries out public administration in geological exploration, production and protection of subsoil. Other state bodies of public administration include central public authority responsible for state environmental protection policies; central public authority in charge of implementation of state geological exploration and efficient subsoil use policies; central authority in charge of state health and safety control policies.

40|$|Purpose and Originality: The {{article focuses}} on the {{circumstances}} influencing {{the political and social}} consequences of the rationalization of the school network with regard to the <b>executive</b> <b>bodies</b> of municipalities. The purpose of the article is to verify whether unpopular decisions made by the local authorities influence the range of political and social support. Method: The article is based on preliminary research. The analysis is mostly focused on the qualitative studies (in-depth interviews, semi-structured interviews) conducted among selected actors involved in local educational policy creation and implementation. The theoretical framework of the article defines the concept of transformational leadership. Results: Making unpopular decisions is inevitable for local authorities. Although they are rational {{from the point of view}} of the municipality as a whole, they can have negative consequences for <b>local</b> <b>executive</b> <b>bodies.</b> However, the results of the study show that not always the unpopular decision taken by the <b>executive</b> <b>body</b> results in the loss of political support. The study identifies situations in which the leadership style and mode of action were significant. Society: The research problem presented in this article has been present for several years in the Polish public debate as well as in the academic discourse. The question of the style of leadership and its impact on public policies implementation is particularly relevant due to the reform of the education system and consequently changes in the local educational policy. Limitations / further research: The results presented in the following paper are merely initial, but reflect the problem and allow to make only preliminary conclusions. It is necessary to conduct further research focused on the relationship between leadership style and the form of the implementation of public policies in municipalities. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1880s Carlism in Catalonia, like {{elsewhere}} in the country, remained in crisis, its outposts initially inactive and later painfully reconstructed. Nothing is known about Vayreda’s engagement in re-emerging party structures following his return from exile; until the late 1880s there is no information about him either joining official party ranks or taking part in Carlist-sponsored initiatives. He re-approached the local Olot Circulo Tradicionalista {{by the end of}} the decade and joined it formally in 1895. Moreover, he entered <b>local</b> <b>executive</b> <b>bodies,</b> the same year becoming member of the comarcal Junta Tradicionalista. According to his later ex-post declarations, the access did not result from attachment to Carlist dynastical claims; facilitated by traditionalist and religious outlook, it was intended primarily to reinforce the regionalist threads within the movement.According to his contemporary Olot politicians Vayreda aspired to local party leadership, but experience in its structures did not last long. His bid to format local Carlist political profile principally along regionalist lines failed. It was possibly thwarted by provincial authorities, as Vayreda lambasted them for ignoring regionalist fundaments of the Traditionalist program; moreover, he complained about political course incompatible with the spirit of the movement, smelling of [...] "liberalism and authoritarianism". In 1896 he formally left Circulo Tradicionalista. During last years of his life Vayreda’s links with Carlism were lukewarm. When publishing his short literary pieces he preferred not to co-operate with Carlist periodicals. His political relations boiled down to occasional co-operation during electoral campaigns; actually, Olot remained the most Carlist electoral district in Catalonia. Above all, he contributed to the cause in his Carlism-flavored works, inducing some to call him [...] "prohom de la causa".|$|R

The necessity of legislate revision of statutory acts providing the mechanisms of subjection to forms of participative democracy (democracy of participation) is substantiated. The necessity of implementation mechanisms of direct participation of citizens based on a comprehensive approach was proven. Public participation in addressing issues of local importance {{should be based on}} the principle of subsidiarity and consist of a few major aspects: availability of regulations and legislation of a set of mechanisms, instruments and procedures for public participation in local government; establishing dialogue and formation of social partnership {{at the level of the}} local community between <b>local</b> authorities, <b>local</b> <b>executive</b> <b>bodies,</b> socially responsible business and communities; showing initiative, activity and self­organization of the residents of the local community. Key moments while carrying out an active state policy in legal, institutional, regulatory and methodological support of transformation forms of direct participation of the members of territorial community resolving issues of local significance are determined. In such areas as: 1) elimination of the legal shortcomings of the implementation of the interaction of local authorities with the public; 2) improve public awareness; active involvement of citizens advice and making government decisions; 3) facilitate public access to information on the activities of organs of local self­government; 4) formation of trust to the local authorities by bringing members of the local community to the implementation of local projects and program development through the use of differentiated methods by which you may use the potential of each inhabitant given the extent of its activity; 5) introduction of the specialized programs of training and advanced training of officials of local governments and deputies of local councils on the participation of members of the local community in addressing the issues of local significance...|$|R
