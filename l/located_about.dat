5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance persisted 520miles (835km) south of Acapulco on July 3. It moved steadily westward and organized over warm water temperatures of 81°F (27°C). A circulation developed within the system, and on July 9 it organized into Tropical Depression Seven while <b>located</b> <b>about</b> 580miles (930km) southwest of Acapulco. The depression {{turned to the}} west-northwest, and after briefly weakening it organized more to attain tropical storm status on July 10 while <b>located</b> <b>about</b> 745miles (1,200km) south of {{the southern tip of}} Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave crossed Central America {{and entered}} the eastern Pacific Ocean on November 7. An area of convection along the wave tracked westward {{to the south of}} Central America and Mexico, and became more concentrated on November 12 while <b>located</b> <b>about</b> 400miles (645km) south of Acapulco. Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the convection continued to organize. Early on November 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late on November 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized convection for it to be designated Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E while <b>located</b> <b>about</b> 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not upgraded until eleven hours later.|$|E

5|$|Alberto quickly {{strengthened}} while moving northeastward {{through the}} southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into a hurricane about nine hours after attaining tropical storm status. Late on June 3, Alberto attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) while <b>located</b> <b>about</b> 120miles (195km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida. Shortly after peaking in intensity, strong upper-level westerly winds impacted the deep convection of the storm. By early on June 4 Alberto weakened to {{a tropical storm}} after turning sharply westward due to weak steering currents. It drifted erratically as the circulation became exposed, and early on June 5 it degenerated into a convectiveless tropical depression. As a tropical depression, Alberto drifted to the east-northeast and later turned to the east, and late on June 6 it dissipated while <b>located</b> <b>about</b> 70miles (115km) {{off the coast of}} Florida.|$|E
