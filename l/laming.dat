5|$|Bond {{married the}} 23-year-old Mabel Phoebe Isabell née <b>Laming</b> on 29 October 1939, the {{daughter}} of a dock worker, Alfred Thomas <b>Laming.</b> They had two sons and two daughters together, who all survived both Ernest and Mabel. When Bond had retired, he indulged his interests in decorating and gardening, and remained a Freemason. Mabel died in 1992, and on 20 November 2003, Ernest died of prostate cancer in Welling; in his home.|$|E
5|$|When both {{phases of}} the inquiry were completed, <b>Laming</b> began writing the final report. The <b>Laming</b> report, {{published}} on 28 January 2003, found that the agencies involved in her care had failed to protect her, and that on at least twelve occasions, workers involved in her case could have prevented her death, particularly condemning the senior managers involved. On {{the day of the}} launch of the report, Climbié's mother sang her daughter's favourite song as a tribute.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957, Field was {{introduced}} to Jack <b>Laming</b> of Walmer, who as a boy had performed in a hoodening troupe earlier in the century. <b>Laming</b> taught Field more about the historical hoodening tradition, and together they unearthed an old hooden horse that was stored at Walmer's Coldblow Farm; this artefact was later placed on display at Deal Maritime and Local History Museum. In June 1961 Field and his wife then established the first Folkestone International Folklore Festival as a biannual celebration of folk customs; it continued for 28 years.|$|E

5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord <b>Laming,</b> was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted {{that many of the}} organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as many of the participants were black. The subsequent report by <b>Laming</b> made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E

5|$|Kouao {{herself was}} called to the inquiry, {{becoming}} the first convicted murderer to appear in person in a public inquiry.

Giving evidence by video link from prison, Manning apologised for his actions and {{said that it was}} not the fault of the various agencies that Climbié died. Broadcasters applied for access to this video, but <b>Laming</b> refused the application. Climbié's parents gave evidence and were present at most of the hearings, becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries. They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié's death.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Epidemiological {{studies have}} used farmer {{estimates}} of the prevalence of lameness in their flocks. This assumes that farmers can identify <b>lame</b> sheep. Eight movie clips of sheep with locomotion from sound to moderately <b>lame</b> were used to investigate the ability of farmers and sheep specialists to recognise <b>lame</b> sheep. Each participant was {{asked to complete a}} form and indicate, for each movie clip, whether they thought the sheep was <b>lame</b> and whether they would catch it if it was the only <b>lame</b> sheep or if 2 – 5, 6 – 10 or > 10 sheep were equally <b>lame.</b> The farmers' responses were compared with their estimates of flock lameness prevalence and the interval between observing a <b>lame</b> sheep and catching it. Results 178 farmers and 54 sheep specialists participated. Participants could identify even mildly <b>lame</b> sheep but made a separate decision on whether to catch them. This decision was dependent on the severity of lameness and the number of sheep <b>lame</b> in a group. Those who said they would catch the first <b>lame</b> sheep in a group {{were significantly more likely to}} catch mildly <b>lame</b> sheep (farmer-reported median prevalence of lameness 5 % (IQR: 2 %– 6 %)). In contrast, farmers who waited for several sheep to be <b>lame</b> indicated that they would only catch more severely <b>lame</b> sheep (farmer reported median flock lameness 11 % (IQR: 9 %– 15 %)). Approximately 15 % of farmers did not catch individual <b>lame</b> sheep (farmer reported median flock lameness 15 % (IQR: 10 %– 15 %)). The flock prevalence of lameness increased as time to treatment increased and time to treatment was positively correlated with only catching more severely <b>lame</b> sheep. Conclusion If movie-clips are similar to the flock situation, farmers and specialists can recognise even mildly <b>lame</b> sheep but vary in their management from prompt treatment of the first <b>lame</b> sheep in a group to no individual sheep treatments. The former practices would be appropriate to minimise transmission of footrot, a common, infectious cause of lameness and so reduce its incidence. The analysis also suggests that farmers estimate lameness prevalence relatively accurately because farmers who treated the first mildly <b>lame</b> sheep in a group also reported the lowest prevalence of lameness in their flock. </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. <b>Laming</b> had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E
5|$|Maylam {{concluded}} {{that at the}} time, {{there was only one}} hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30pm, accompanied by two musicians – one playing the tambourine and the other the concertina – and a man named Robert <b>Laming</b> who lead the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.|$|E
