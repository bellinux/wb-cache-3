5000|$|Choke chains (also called choke collars, slip chains, check collars, or {{training}} collars) are {{a length of}} chain with rings at either end such that the collar can be formed into a loop that slips over the dogs head and rests {{around the top of}} the dog's neck, just behind the ears. [...] When the leash is attached to the dead ring, the collar does not constrict on the dog's neck. When the leash is attached to the <b>live</b> <b>ring,</b> the chain slips (adjusts) tighter when pulled and slips looser when tension is released. Training with this leash involves a quick jerk with an immediate release, called a leash pop, snap, or correction. This is supposed to correct a dog's unwanted behavior, such as leaving the [...] "heel" [...] position. Pulling harder or longer on the choke chain presses on the dog's esophagus and restricts breathing.|$|E

40|$|Cosmic vortons {{are closed}} loops of superconducting cosmic strings {{carrying}} current and charge. Despite {{a large number}} of studies the existence and stability of cosmic vorton solutions is still an open problem. Numerical simulations of the nonlinear field theory are difficult to perform in (3 + 1) -dimensions, due to the existence of multiple length and time scales. In this paper we study a (2 + 1) -dimensional analogue of cosmic vortons, which we refer to as kinky vortons, where the cosmic string is replaced by a kink string. Many of the expected qualitative aspects of cosmic vortons transfer to kinky vortons, with the advantage that several approximations used in the study of cosmic vortons can be replaced by exact results. Furthermore, the numerical study of kinky vortons requires less computational resources than cosmic vortons, so a number of issues can be addressed in some depth. The radius of the kinky vorton is determined {{as a function of the}} charge and winding number, and it is shown that the chiral limit is a repulsive fixed point. Stability to both axial and non-axial perturbations is demonstrated in the electric and chiral regimes, though surpringly long <b>lived</b> <b>ringing</b> modes are observed. Kinky vortons which are too magnetic are shown to suffer from a pinching instability, which results in a reduction in the winding number and can convert magnetic into electric solutions. 1...|$|R

The heavily-padded warrior must stay to the golden pathway without falling or being hit by any of the sharp or pointed obstacles at any point. It consists of many obstacles designed to knock the warrior off the path, and the configuration consisted of swinging dummies, falling rocks being pushed by demons, a swinging gate, a swinging boulder carousel, a narrow beam with sharp objects and spikes falling down. The warriors then released a drawbridge to the next part of the challenge that consisted of a 3 shield section, sometimes with 4 shields, later changed to 3, followed by a spiky swinging barrel with golden ropes to crawl across. The last part of the challenge consisted of swinging blades/axes. From the third series onwards, gnashing jaws were adding to the end of the challenge. The victor would pass through the golden portal and would compete in the next day of the quest. The burden then fell upon the next warrior with the least amount of <b>lives</b> and <b>rings.</b> This process continues until one warrior is eliminated.|$|R
