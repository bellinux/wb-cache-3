5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped through the mail. New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment {{of beer and}} spirits to customers by requiring a <b>liquor</b> license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of <b>liquor</b> license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard <b>liquor</b> to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a <b>liquor</b> store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the costs associated with}} staff, Minnesota lost some revenue during the shutdown. The Minnesota State Lottery did not sell tickets during the shutdown, which meant the state could have lost about $1.25 million in revenue daily. Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes, which must be affixed to each pack before sale. The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would come to a halt by mid-August if no more tax stamps were issued. The state also stopped issuing <b>liquor</b> purchasing cards, which businesses need in order to purchase <b>liquor</b> from wholesalers. Many stores, bars, and restaurants renewed their <b>liquor</b> purchasing cards before the shutdown. However, the purchasing cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired {{on the first day of}} the shutdown, July 1. <b>Liquor</b> purchasing cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month. Alcohol brand licenses expired, so MillerCoors lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota, and had to have them removed from shelves.|$|E

40|$|Sulfur-free pulping has an {{environmental}} {{advantage over the}} traditional kraft process. This article describes the combustion properties of the black <b>liquors</b> produced from silver birch (Betula pendula) sawdust using three different cooking processes: two sulfur-free cooks (soda-anthraquinone and oxygen-alkali), and one reference kraft cook. It also considers the corresponding black <b>liquors</b> from an integrated forest biorefinery, in which a hot-water pretreatment of feedstock was performed prior to pulping. With the same cooking time, the total burning times for the sulfur-free black <b>liquors</b> were higher (15 – 55 %) than those for the conventional kraft black <b>liquors.</b> However, {{no significant differences were}} noted between the total burning times for black <b>liquors</b> from pretreated feedstock and those from untreated feedstock. Especially in the case of untreated feedstock, the results showed that the kraft black <b>liquors</b> typically swelled more (25 – 45 %) than the sulfur-free black <b>liquors.</b> It was further observed that the kraft and soda-anthraquinone black <b>liquors</b> from the untreated feedstock swelled more than those from the pretreated feedstock, while the oxygen-alkali black <b>liquors</b> swelled less...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the combustion behavior of birch and spruce kraft black <b>liquors</b> obtained from an integrated forest biorefinery concept {{in which a}} hot water extraction of chips was performed before pulping. This pretreatment, aiming mainly at the recovery of various hemicellulose-derived materials, increased the concentrations of lignin and hydroxy acids in black <b>liquors,</b> compared {{with those in the}} reference black <b>liquors</b> without any process modification. On the other hand, the pretreatment decreased the concentrations of volatile acids and other organics (extractives and hemicellulose residues). Because of these characteristic changes, the total burning times (pyrolysis time plus char burning time) of the reference black <b>liquors</b> were somewhat longer than those of black <b>liquors</b> from the modified cooking process. The novel biorefinery-based black <b>liquors</b> also swell more than the conventional ones. This phenomenon was primarily associated with the combined effect of high-molar-mass lignin fragments and hydroxy acids. All of the detected changes in combustion behavior were more intense for birch black <b>liquors</b> than for spruce black <b>liquors...</b>|$|R
5|$|New Jersey {{regulations}} for <b>liquor</b> stores and bars are extensive. Licensed establishments may not offer nudity.

Bars and clubs are prohibited from having a 'ladies' night' or any pricing which is regarded as discriminatory.

40|$|Chinese <b>liquors</b> are internationally {{well-known}} fermentative alcoholic beverages. They have unique flavors {{attributable to}} the use of various bacteria and fungi, raw materials, and production processes. Developing a novel, rapid, and reliable method to identify multiple Chinese <b>liquors</b> is of positive significance. This paper presents a pattern recognition system for classifying ten brands of Chinese <b>liquors</b> based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms in a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) -based electronic nose (e-nose) we designed. We evaluated the comprehensive performance of the MDS-SVM classifier that predicted all ten brands of Chinese <b>liquors</b> individually. The prediction accuracy (98. 3 %) showed superior performance of the MDS-SVM classifier over the back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) classifier (93. 3 %) and moving average-linear discriminant analysis (MA-LDA) classifier (87. 6 %). The MDS-SVM classifier has reasonable reliability, good fitting and prediction (generalization) performance in classification of the Chinese <b>liquors.</b> Taking both application of the e-nose and validation of the MDS-SVM classifier into account, we have thus created a useful method for the classification of multiple Chinese <b>liquors...</b>|$|R

5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a <b>liquor</b> license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the winery. Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their <b>liquor</b> license.|$|E
5|$|The first {{drinking}} age law in New Jersey {{was passed}} in 1846. It allowed {{the parents of a}} student under 21 to sue for up to $10 ($ in modern dollars) in damages against a tavern keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages to their children. In 1880, a criminal statute was enacted, fining businesses that sold <b>liquor</b> to people under 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child. The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate the parental consent provision, thus making it illegal in all cases for a tavern or <b>liquor</b> store to sell alcohol to person under 18. In 1908, the penalties were increased so that a tavern keeper who served a minor could be jailed. Upon the start of Prohibition, New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of alcohol to minors since the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited almost all <b>liquor</b> sales.|$|E

5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the <b>liquor</b> and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The <b>liquor</b> is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus <b>liquor</b> is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E
