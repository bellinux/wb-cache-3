Those deposits are found mainly south of Abtweiler, near the village’s outskirts. The subformation begins with a moderately to coarsely sandy, and in many places detritus-bearing, horizon, Bed R-5. It is capped off by the dark mudstones in the Humberg Bed. Meyer and Schnabel (1988) put the Odernheim am Glan type region’s thickness at 155 m. The subformation contains several indicative horizons that are important for <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> in wide areas of the Saar-Nahe Basin. Foremost among these are fluvial-deltaic, coarsely clastic horizons as well as lacustrine deposits with dark mudstones. To be named here are the Rehborn, Odernheim, Kappeln and Humberg Beds, layered into which are many, mostly thin limestone and cinder tuff horizons.|$|E

Our procedure is an innovative hybrid of knowledge-driven and data-driven schemes that provides a clear protocol for incorporating different types of geophysical data into a 3 D stratigraphic model framework. The limited spatial density of water well bedrock observations precludes detection of the buried valley bedrock topography and renders the water well records alone inadequate for accurate hydrogeological model building.

40|$|Stratigraphy is {{the study}} of layered rock sequences, {{particularly}} in terms of their age and correlation with equivalent rocks elsewhere. It has many different branches of which some of the most fundamental are lithostratigraphy, concerning the subdivision of rock succession into units {{on the basis of their}} lithology and physical characteristics; biostratigraphy, involving the subdivision and correlation of the rock succession based on its contained fossils; and chronostratigraphy concerned with the subdivision and classification of rock successions according to their age. Lithostratigraphic subdivisions are those normally depicted on geological maps and sections and most commonly encountered in the ground engineering industry. However, because of local (site scale) lithological and property variations it is arguable that <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>classifications</b> are of only limited use for site-specific engineering, given that subdivisions are based on generally broad physical characteristics aimed at wider regional correlations. Practical use of stratigraphic subdivisions in ground engineering is further hindered by periodic changes to their nomenclature that has caused confusion to non-specialist users not fully aware of the reasons for making such changes. Despite these apparent limitations, recent research into the geotechnical characteristics of the Lias Group and Lambeth Group deposits in the UK has shown how lithostratigraphy can aid in anticipating regional trends in their characterisitics, properties and behaviour. The studies have also demonstrated how understanding regional geological controls can enhance site specific knowledge, leading to more focussed and cost effective ground investigation planning...|$|R

Thermal conductivities in W(mk) {sup {minus} 1 } averaged over all boreholes, ranged (depending upon temperature and saturation state) from 1. 2 to 1. 9 for TCw, from 0. 4 to 0. 9 for PTn, from 1. 0 to 1. 7 for TSw 1, and from 1. 5 to 2. 3 for TSw 2.

30|$|The Buntsandstein {{rocks that}} were studied here {{represent}} the marginal facies of the Germanic Basin and comprise mainly fluvial to playa deposits. The Odenwald–Spessart High separates different depositional {{areas of the}} studied outcrops (Fig.  1 c). Within the Palatinate Forest, fluvial and aeolian facies alternate, whereas aeolian sediments are absent in the Odenwald (Hagdorn and Nitsch 2009). Since the unconformities that define the basic lithostratigraphic units of the Buntsandstein in the northern Germanic Basin are not clearly documented in the study area, distinction between the different units is difficult (Bourquin et al. 2006; Dachroth 1985; Feist-Burkhardt et al. 2008; Hagdorn and Nitsch 2009; Szurlies 2007). Further complications are introduced by the varying Buntsandstein thicknesses; they vary from about 60  m {{in the south of}} the graben to approximately 500  m around Karlsruhe, but further northward the thickness decreases again to about 300  m (Boigk and Schöneich 1970; Stober and Bucher 2014). Additionally, the Buntsandstein can be found at different depths, ranging from about 1000  m below the land surface, down to 4000  m near Karlsruhe. This is due to intense block tectonics and differences in the subsidence and exhumation history (Boigk and Schöneich 1970; Sauer et al. 1982; Villemin et al. 1986). One consequence of the complex geology is that several <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>classifications</b> of the Buntsandstein units exist (e.g. Backhaus 1974; Hagdorn and Nitsch 2009; Richter-Bernburg 1974). Within the URG, the regional geothermal gradient is elevated to 45 – 50  °C km- 1,  with local hot spots that have temperature gradients of up to 100  °C km− 1 and make the URG a prime target for geothermal exploration in Germany (Schellschmidt and Clauser 1996; Stober and Bucher 2014). This positive temperature anomaly is commonly explained by a raised Moho due to the graben formation (Brun et al. 1992) or by advective fluid flow (Schellschmidt and Clauser 1996; Pribnow and Schellschmidt 2000).|$|R
40|$|The <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> of the Quatemary {{deposits}} {{is based}} on the genesis of the sediments.

The marine -estuarine deposits are restricted to certain time-intervals within the Quatemary and are limited to the northern part of Belgium. Fluvial deposits are found throughout the Quatemary. On the basis of the sedimentological -lithological differentials within the Meuse basin and the Schelde basin a bipartite subdivision of the fluvial deposits is introduced. Eolian deposits are differentiated {{on the basis of their}} grain size distribution, namely sand and silt. The sandy deposits are accumulated in the northern part of Belgium, whereas loess is deposited in the more southern part of the country.

40|$|The palaeogeography and facies {{distribution}} of the Catalan Basin during the Middle Jurassic are reconstructed, {{on the basis of}} outcrops and logs data. A new <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> valid for the Catalan Basin is defined and its equivalence with the correlative units in the lberian Basin and Majorca is discussed. A system of arched, listric-shaped faults dipping towards the Mediterranean sea was a major factor determining the differentiation of the subsident Platform of Tortosa. From a palaeobiogeographical point of view, the ammonite and brachiopod recorded associations from the Platform of Tortosa are taxonornically similar to the associations of the epicontinental European basins. The Catalan Basin and Majorca were two geographically separate areas, maintaining separate biogeographical and taphonomic dispersal ways in the Middle Jurassic. Yet in the Catalan Basin expanded, outer shelf sections were developed during the Garantiana Biochron (Upper Bajocian). During this episode the basin reached the maximum bathymetric values and acted as a biogeographical dispersal area for some taxonomic groups characteristic of the West-Tethys...|$|E
40|$|The Raudvatnet massive {{sulphide}} deposit {{is located}} in Hattfjelldal in Nordland, Northern Norway. Deposit investigations {{have been made by}} mining companies Boliden AB and Aspro AS in the 1960 ’s and 1980 ’s respectively. The Deposit lies in the Bjørkvatnet Nappe belonging to the Lower Køli Nappes of the Upper Allochthon in the North Central Caledonides. Brief structural investigations in the area along with petrographic, geochemical studies were conducted on a selection of samples collected in the field, both from mineralized ore horizons and adjacent lithologies. Geological mapping was conducted to produce an updated geological map of the area along with creation of 4 cross section profile sketches produced from the combined impressions of surface mapping and 4 of the logged drill cores. Geochemical analysis of the host rock of the mineralisation yields a sericite altered quartz keratophyre, which in turn is an altered felsic metavolcanite. The associated metabasites in which the felsic sequence is situated yields anN-MORB type geochemistry. The deposit contains abundant Zn andCu and is classified as a Zn-Cu compositional type. In addition, there are substantial amounts of Pb, Ag and Au as found in various phases associated with the massive mineralisations present. The deposit is characterized as a Kuroko type VMS deposit and is recognized as being a Bimodal mafic type in terms of <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>classification...</b>|$|E
40|$|Linear {{regression}} {{methods can}} be used to quantify geological controls on baseflow index (BFI). This is illustrated using an example from the Thames Basin, UK. Two approaches have been adopted. The areal extents of geological classes based on <b>lithostratigraphic</b> and hydrogeological <b>classification</b> schemes have been correlated with BFI for 44 ‘natural’ catchments from the Thames Basin. When regression models are built using lithostratigraphic classes that include a constant term then the model is shown to have some physical meaning and the relative influence of the different geological classes on BFI can be quantified. For example, the regression constants for two such models, 0. 64 and 0. 69, are consistent with the mean observed BFI (0. 65) for the Thames Basin, and the signs and relative magnitudes of the regression coefficients for each of the lithostratigraphic classes are consistent with the hydrogeology of the basin. In addition, regression coefficients for the lithostratigraphic classes scale linearly with estimates of log 10 hydraulic conductivity for each lithological class. When a regression is built using a hydrogeological classification scheme with no constant term, the model does not have any physical meaning, but it has a relatively high adjusted R 2 value and because of the continuous coverage of the hydrogeological classification scheme, the model {{can be used}} for predictive purposes. A model calibrated on the 44 ‘natural’ catchments and using four hydrogeological classes (low permeability surficial deposits, consolidated aquitards, fractured aquifers and intergranular aquifers) is shown to perform as well as a model based on a hydrology of soil types (BFIHOST) scheme in predicting BFI in the Thames Basin. Validation of this model using 110 other ‘variably impacted’ catchments in the Basin shows that there is a correlation between modelled and observed BFI. Where the observed BFI is significantly higher than modelled BFI the deviations can be explained by an exogenous factor, catchment urban area. It is inferred that this is may be due influences from sewage discharge, mains leakage, and leakage from septic tanks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlpine Corsica {{consists}} of a stack of variably metamorphosed units of continental and Tethys-derived rocks. It represents {{an excellent example of}} high-pressure (HP) orogenic belt, such as the Western Alps, exposed over a small and accessible area. Compared to the Western Alps, the geology of Alpine Corsica is poorly unraveled. During the 1970 s- 80 s, based on either lithostratigraphic or metamorphic field observations, various classifications of the belt have been proposed, but these classifications have been rarely matched together. Furthermore, through time, the internal complexity of large domains has been progressively left aside in the frame of large-scale geodynamic reconstructions. As a consequence, major open questions on the internal structure of the belt have remained unsolved. Apart from a few local studies, Alpine Corsica has not benefited of modern developments in petrology and basin research. This feature results in several uncertainties when combining lithostratigraphic and metamorphic patterns and, consequently, in the definition of an exhaustive architecture of the belt. In this paper we provide a review on the geology of Alpine Corsica, paying particular attention to the available <b>lithostratigraphic</b> and metamorphic <b>classifications</b> of the metamorphic terranes. These data are completed by a new and exhaustive metamorphic dataset obtained by means of thermometry based on Raman Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Material (RSCM). This technique provides reliable insights on the peak temperature of the metamorphic history for CM-bearing metasediments. A detailed metamorphic characterization of metasediments, which have been previously largely ignored due to retrogression or to the lack of diagnostic mineralogy, is thus obtained and fruitfully coupled with the available lithostratigraphic data. Nine main tectono-metamorphic units are defined, from subgreenschist (ca. 280 - 300 °C) to the lawsonite-eclogite-facies (ca. 500 - 550 °C) condition. These units are homogeneous in metamorphism, laterally continuous and have characteristic lithostratigraphic features. This study also suggests a direct link between the pre-orogenic extensional setting and the present-day compressional structure of Alpine Corsica, indicating that large sections of subducted lithosphere were subducted and exhumed as coherent domains. These features provide important insight on the mechanism of stacking and exhumation of HP rocks, and make Alpine Corsica a unique reference for mountain-building processes in Tethyan-type orogens...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 1973. The Marble Delta {{is an area}} of {{approximately}} 40 sq. km in Natal (30 ° 22 ' Long., 30 ° 40 ' Lat.), occupied by Precambrian marble and associated granites. The deeply dissected country was geologically mapped on a scale of I : 6 000. A new <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> of the metasediments is proposed. The base of the lowermost Le Joncguet Formation (composed of dolomitic marble and siliceous beds) is not exposed. This is followed by the predominantly ca. lcitic Oribi Formation with interbedded dolomite and graphitic layers. The marble is unconformably overlain by the Cherrywillingham Formation which comprises mainly amphibolite and granulite. The. three formations together constitute the Marble Delta Group. The main petrological units are calc-silicate marble, metaquartzite, dolomite marble, cluster serpen~ine marble and ce,lcite marble. Graphite layers are considered to have originated in situ from organic remains; there is occasional evidence of ionic transfer of carbon from this graphite by magmatic fluids. The common mineral assemblages are diopside + calcite + dolomite, tremolite + calcite + diopside + quartz, calcite + quartz + dolomite, forsterite + calcite + dolomite, plagioclase + cordierite + garnet + quartz, amphibole + clinopyroxene + plagioclase, hornblende + clinopyroxene + calcite, wollastor~te + calcite + diopside. Other minerals are graphite, antigorite, chrysotile, sphene, spinel, clinohumite, chondrodite, zoisite, clinozoisite, hedenbergite, phlogopite, ilmenite, hercynite, dravite, cummingtonite, talc, apatite, microcline, saponite.

40|$|The present {{research}} {{is on the}} Cretaceous microbio- and litho-stratigraphy of the Cauvery Basin, Southeast India. The planktonic and benthonic foraminifera are used to establish microbiostratigraphic zonations for the mid-Cretaceous succession in the Basin; leading to the first proposal of a benthonic foraminiferal zonation scheme. The schemes are primarily defined for regional application. In {{the absence of a}} formal <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> for the Cretaceous succession in the Basin, a revised lithostratigraphy, in line with standard stratigraphic procedure, is proposed. The systematic taxonomy of the foraminifera studied is documented and revised in line with Western standards. The study shows that, in contrast to the standard European forms, the fauna from the Cauvery Basin is composed of more robust individuals. The study also shows some interesting differences in the planktonic foraminifera from the standard Tethyan assemblage. Comparative studies indicate a longer time range for some of the "index" species and more ornamented forms in the Cauvery Basin. The study records two levels, (I) in the late Albian and (2) from the late Cenomanian to mid-Turonian, when anoxic conditions developed in the Basin. These anoxic events record major taxonomic changes in the planktonic foraminiferal assemblage. The study shows that the anoxic events had a major affect on the microfaunal community and that the post anoxic microfaunal population was dominated by more robust and heavily ornamented individuals. The planktonic foraminifera are used to identify the mid-Cretaceous sea-level changes in the Basin. The pattern of evolution and expansion of the planktonic foraminifera suggest a continuously rising sea-level in the mid-Cretaceous; with four periods of major transgressions. These levels are, at the late Albian, mid-Cenomanian, late Cenomanian-early Turonian and mid-Turonian. The pattern of sea-level changes in the Cauvery Basin followed, in general, the global sea-level curve, but has been influenced by local factors particularly tectonics. A pilot study demonstrates how palaeontology (including ichnology) in conjunction with sedimentology and stratigraphy is used to apply sequence stratigraphy concepts to the late Turonian-Coniacian succession in the Basin. A comprehensive study of Teredolites-infested fossil wood documents the morphological characters of the wood and its palaeoenvironmental significance. The study shows that there exists a close link between the influx of the fossil wood and sea-level dynamics...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the importance of}} mining background and mining experience in two 18 th century Italian scientists who studied the mountains and other terrestrial reliefs with particular attention to their rocks, strata and formations: Giovanni Arduino (1714 - 1795) and Spirito Benedetto Nicolis di Robilant (1724 - 1801). Arduino was a mining expert and land-surveyor who became a field geologist and a mineralogist of European renown {{in the second half}} of the 18 th century. Gaining mining experience over a period of several decades beginning in the late 1730 s, Arduino exhibited growing interest in study and interpretation of the various strata and rocks. During his travels as mining expert and director of mines, he studied Tuscany, the Apennines and the pre-Alps of Veneto and Lombardy. His famed <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>classification</b> of rocks and mountains in four units or 'ordini' (published in 1760 and enlarged in 1774) is strongly indebted to various observations made in the mines, especially with regard to the features of the primitive rocks. From his twenty-year-long mining experience Arduino acquired the skills to interpret rock structures in the field (morphology, lithology, mineralogical or fossiliferous content), the practical tools to analyze features of rocks and minerals in the laboratory through chemical-metallurgical processes, and also the habit of drawing sketches and sections. From 1749 to 1752 Robilant took courses in mineralogy and metallurgy in Freiberg (Saxony) and studied the organization and the productivity of the local mines. He also travelled to other renowned mining areas of Bohemia and Hungary. After his return to Italy, he was nominated General Inspector of the Piedmontese mines. Having undertaken several journeys and mine inspections, mainly in the western Alps, in 1786 Robilant published a detailed Essai Géographique with a large mineralogical map of the territories of the Piedmontese Kingdom (called the 'Regno di Sardegna'), with the exclusion however of the island of the Sardinia itself. This work was part of a practical effort to modernize and improve modest mining enterprises in Piedmont. But it also had a clear intention of connecting mineralogical and lithological research in the field with a general geological theory on the formation of mountains. The aim of this paper is to compare the different geological ideas of Arduino and Robilant on the formation of rocks and mountains, in the light of their mining expertise. This practical knowledge was also an essential element of the theoretical work of Arduino and Robilant on the "classification" of mountains...|$|E
