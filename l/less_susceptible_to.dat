The method is simple, sensitive, requires inexpensive equipment, and produces a permanent record of results. AChE activity is revealed by the Karnovsky & Roots staining technique {{in the presence of}} propoxur, or after exposure of the membrane to paraoxon and rinsing with water. We chose insecticide concentrations that inhibited the sensitive AChE while allowing detectable residual activity of the resistant AChE to remain. By comparing the staining of insecticide-treated and control membranes, susceptible and resistant genotypes for the AChE gene could be distinguished in laboratory strains of mosquitoes (Culex spp. and Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann) and the house fly (Musca domestica L.). Resistant AChE from mosquitoes was <b>less</b> <b>susceptible</b> both <b>to</b> propoxur and paraoxon than the corresponding sensitive AChE, whereas resistant AChE from house fly was <b>less</b> <b>susceptible</b> mainly <b>to</b> paraoxon. The technique worked well for mosquito adults and house fly heads but not for mosquito larvae. Blotted AChE did not show detectable loss of activity during storage of the membranes for 3 wk at 25 -degrees-C. Storage is an important asset of the technique because transportation of live insect material to the laboratory may not be necessary...|$|R

40|$|Demand {{for organic}} {{products}} is intensified {{in many countries}} each year. Following this trend, Brazil produces increasing volumes of organic grape juice. In this way, a survey of organic grape juices made from grapes produced according to this system was carried out where physicochemical composition, minerals, trace elements, and pesticide residues were determined. Variables related to grape juice composition were performed by physicochemical procedures; minerals and trace elements, by inductively plasma optical emission spectrometry; pesticide residues, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{present study}} aimed {{to explain the}} interindividual {{variation}} in periodontitis susceptibility by differences in the initial adhesion rate of Porphyromonas gingivalis to the pocket epithelium of these individuals, and/or by inter-P. gingivalis strain differences in association capacity (adhesion and internalization). METHODS: Adhesion assays were performed on epithelial monolayers (cultured in vitro from pocket epithelium belonging to patients who were <b>less</b> or more <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> chronic adult periodontitis) using 11 genetically different clinical strains of P. gingivalis. RESULTS: Both the disease category (<b>less</b> <b>susceptible</b> versus susceptible) and the interstrain variation {{were found to have}} a significant effect (both P < 0. 05) on the initial bacterial association. The chronic adult periodontitis group showed significantly more association of P. gingivalis when compared <b>to</b> <b>less</b> <b>susceptible</b> patients (4. 2 x 10 (6) versus 3. 5 x 10 (6)). Also, the interstrain variation was significant, with strains Pg 4 and 5 representing the least and best associating bacteria (1. 8 x 10 (6) colony forming units for Pg 4, 9 x 10 (6) for Pg 5). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that periodontitis susceptibility is influenced by both the interindividual differences in pocket epithelium (allowing more adhesion of P. gingivalis) or by the strain type by which the patient is infected (intra-species differences in adhesion capacity). status: publishe...|$|R

Taylor utilizes neurological science {{to show that}} brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways.

5|$|Following {{the reign}} of the Han dynasty, (202 BC–220 AD), the idea of the Buddhist stupa entered Chinese culture, as a means to house and protect scriptural sutras. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties period, the {{distinctive}} Chinese pagoda was developed, its predecessors being the tall watch towers and towering residential apartments of the Han dynasty (as inferred from models in Han-era tombs). During the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) periods, Chinese pagodas were developed from purely wooden structures to use articulated stone and brick, which could more easily survive fires caused by lightning or arson and were <b>less</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> decay. The earliest brick pagoda that remains extant is the Songyue Pagoda, built in 523, and a typical example of a Tang-era stone pagoda is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, constructed in 652. Although Buddhist influences on China waned after the late Tang period, numerous Buddhist pagoda towers were built during the Song dynasty. Tall Chinese pagodas were often built in the countryside rather than within a city's walls, largely to avoid competition with the cosmic-imperial authority embodied in the cities' drum- and gate-towers. The Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, built in a city ward of what was southeastern Chang'an, is among the exceptions.|$|E
5|$|Overexpression of systemin and HypSys {{has been}} found to improve plants' {{tolerance}} to abiotic stress, including salt stress and UV radiation. When prosystemin was over-expressed in tomato, transgenic plants had lower stomatal conductance than normal plants. When grown in salt solutions, transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductances, lower leaf concentrations of abscisic acid and proline and a higher biomass. These findings suggest that systemin either allowed the plants to adapt to salt stress more efficiently or that they perceived a less stressful environment. Similarly, wounded tomato plants were <b>less</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> salt stress than unwounded plants. This may be because wounding decreases the growth of the plant and therefore slows the uptake of toxic ions into the roots. An analysis of salt-induced changes in gene expression found that the differences measured between the transgenic and normal plants could not be accounted for by changes in conventional salt stress-induced pathways. Instead Orsini et al. suggested that the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway determines a physiological state that not only directs resources towards the production of compounds active against pests, but also pre-adapts plants to minimize water loss. These effects are achieved by negatively regulating the production of hormones and metabolites that will force plants to invest additional resources to counteract water loss, a secondary effect of herbivores.|$|E

30|$|This {{study showed}} that iron {{complexed}} by humic acids can be displaced and solubilized {{by the action of}} microbially produced siderophores or root-exuded organic acids. The major drive for the iron removal from the iron complexes is attributed to the stability constants with the new ligands, which are larger than those between iron and the humic acids. However, the extent of Fe displacement was also dependent on both the molecular composition and consequent conformational flexibility of humic materials and the steric hindrance of ligands. Complexes made by humic acids rich in aromatic carbon were <b>less</b> potentially <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> release iron to organic ligands present in the soil solution than complexes formed with alkyl-rich humic acids. In fact, the highly aromatic humic acids are liable to be more conformationally rigid and inhibit the accessibility of the bulky siderophore molecules to the iron-complexing sites.|$|R

Female rats are <b>less</b> <b>susceptible</b> than males <b>to</b> the acute effects of choline deficiency, such as fatty liver and impaired secretion of triglycerides into blood plasma, while they are more <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> inhibition of liver protein synthesis and triglyceride accumulation by ethionine. These differences have been ascribed to sex differences in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine in the liver of rats. The available data indicate that females are more dependent than males on the stepwise methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine rather than the direct incorporation of preformed choline. Continuous prefeeding with choline for three weeks was able to shift the female pattern of response to choline deficiency and ethionine intoxication towards that observed in males; thus, choline caused accumulation of hepatic triglycerides {{and a decrease in}} plasma triglycerides after choline deficiency, while it protected against ethionine induced triglyceride accumulation and protein synthesis inhibition in the liver. These results suggest that choline prefeeding in females makes them more dependent on choline availability and, thus, more <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> a choline deficient diet and less sensitive to ethionine intoxication, as are males.
