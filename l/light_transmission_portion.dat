40|$|We have {{characterized}} overstory <b>light</b> <b>transmission,</b> understory <b>light</b> levels, {{and plant}} communities in mixedwood boreal forests of northwestern Quebec {{with the objective}} of understanding how overstory <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> interacts with composition and time since disturbance to influence the diversity and composition of understory vegetation, and, in turn, the further attenuation of light to the forest floor by the understory. Overstory <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> differed among three forest types (aspen, mixed deciduous-conifer, and old cedar-dominated), with old forests having higher proportions of high light levels than aspen and mixed forests, which were characterized by intermediate light levels. The composition of the understory plant communities in old forests showed the weakest correlation to overstory <b>light</b> <b>transmission,</b> although those forests had the largest range of <b>light</b> <b>transmission.</b> The strongest correlation between characteristics of overstory <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> and understory communities was found in aspen forests. Species diversity indices were consistently higher in aspen forests but showed weak relationships with overstory <b>light</b> <b>transmission.</b> <b>Light</b> attenuation by the understory vegetation and total height of the understory vegetation were strongly and positively related to overstory <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> but not forest type. Therefore, <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> through the overstory influenced the structure and function of understory plants more than their diversity and composition. This is likely due to the strong effect of the upper understory layers, which tend to homogenize light levels at the forest floor regardless of forest type.

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>transmission</b> was {{measured}} through intact, submerged periphyton communities on artificial seagrass leaves. The periphyton communities were {{representative of the}} communities on Thalassia testudinum in subtropical seagrass meadows. The periphyton communities sampled were adhered carbonate sediment, coralline algae, and mixed algal assemblages. Crustose or film-forming periphyton assemblages were best prepared for <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> measurements using artificial leaves fouled on both sides, while measurements through three-dimensional filamentous algae required the periphyton {{to be removed from}} one side. For one-sided samples, <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> could be measured as the difference between fouled and reference artificial leaf samples. For two-sided samples, the percent periphyton <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> to the leaf surface was calculated as the square root of the fraction of incident light. Linear, exponential, and hyperbolic equations were evaluated as descriptors of the periphyton dry weight versus <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> relationship. Hyperbolic and exponential decay models were superior to linear models and exhibited the best fits for the observed relationships. Differences between the coefficients of determination (r 2) of hyperbolic and exponential decay models were statistically insignificant. Constraining these models for 100 % <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> at zero periphyton load did not result in any statistically significant loss in the explanatory capability of the models. In most all cases, increasing model complexity using three-parameter models rather than two-parameter models did not significantly increase the amount of variation explained. Constrained two-parameter hyperbolic or exponential decay models were judged best for describing the periphyton dry weight versus <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> relationship.

40|$|Objective. This study {{measured}} <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> through enamel and dentin and {{the effect}} of exposed dentinal tubules to light propagation. Methods. Light attenuation through enamel and dentin layers of various thicknesses (1 [*]mm, 2 [*]mm, 3 [*]mm, and 4 [*]mm) was measured using specimens that were (1) moist and (2) air-dried (n= 5). Measurements were repeated after the specimens were treated with EDTA. Specimens were transilluminated with a light curing unit (maximum power output 1869 [*]mW/cm 2), and the mean irradiance power of transmitting light was measured. The <b>transmission</b> of <b>light</b> through teeth was studied using 10 extracted intact human incisors and premolars. Results. Transmitted light irradiance through 1 [*]mm thick moist discs was 500 [*]mW/cm 2 for enamel and 398 [*]mW/cm 2 for dentin (p< 0. 05). The increase of the specimen thickness decreased <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> in all groups (p< 0. 005), and moist specimens attenuated light less than air-dried specimens in all thicknesses (p< 0. 05). EDTA treatment increased <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> from 398 [*]mW/cm 2 to 439 [*]mW/cm 2 (1 [*]mm dentin specimen thickness) (p< 0. 05). <b>Light</b> <b>transmission</b> through intact premolar was 6. 2 [*]mW/cm 2 (average thickness 8. 2 [*]mm) and through incisor was 37. 6 [*]mW/cm 2 (average thickness 5. 6 [*]mm).

40|$|During {{the last}} years {{it has been shown}} that diffuse light is {{advantageous}} for many greenhouse crops. Modern greenhouse covering materials are able to transform direct sunlight into diffuse light. After entering the greenhouse sunlight is scattered and penetrates into the crop, where it is absorbed and used for photosynthesis. Experimental research with different crops (e. g., tomato, cucumber, roses) over {{the last years}} showed an improved production under diffuse light conditions, expressed in growth rate or yield of up to 10 % in The Netherlands. In the last five years different glass producers have put a lot of effort in devel-opment of diffusing greenhouse covering materials. Different structures have been developed and applied on glass for greenhouse application. Glass surface treatments result in regular or irregular patterns on glass such as matt/matt, prismatic, satin, texture and v-grooves. Next to that micro structures are combined with nano-structures, such as anti-reflection treatments (AR), in order to improve <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> into the greenhouse. It can be shown that material development was able to improve hemispherical <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> of diffuse glasses by at least 5 % in 2013 compared to before 2007, glasses with larger hemispherical transmission and highly diffusing properties are available. Earlier an evaluation method for diffuse materials had been proposed. That method is mainly based on a measurement of the so-called hemispherical light trans-mission and haze. New possibilities in material technology and increasing knowledge of the relation of diffuse light and crop reactions caused a need to extend evaluation methods. Measuring spatial distribution of transmitted light is suggested next to measuring angular and spectral <b>light</b> <b>transmission.</b> Different new diffuse materials of different producers are measured and evaluated. The results show that diffuse glasses differ in haze and hemispherical <b>light</b> <b>transmission.</b> As well, the choice of basic glass material as the type of anti-reflection treatment are main causes of light spectrum changes. Diffuse structures alone do not cause differences in spectral <b>light</b> <b>transmission.</b> Different structures and AR treat-ments result in different angular <b>light</b> <b>transmission,</b> which explains differences in hemispherical <b>light</b> <b>transmission.</b> Measurements of spatial <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> show that many diffusing glasses only cause a narrow light scattering pattern so far.
