5|$|After being marched {{two miles}} north-west {{of the city}} centre, the victims {{encountered}} a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops. Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot {{in the back of the}} head or the neck by members of the execution squads.|$|E
25|$|Upon arrest, Acremant {{confessed to}} the Ellis and Abdill murders, {{claiming}} that his motive was robbery. According to Acremant, after they refused his demand to write checks made out to him from their business' account, he shot both women {{in the back of}} the head execution-style, having bound and gagged them with duct tape and forced them to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the back of Ellis's pickup truck.|$|E
25|$|These early {{developments}} in formalized ambulance services were decided at local levels, and {{this led to}} services being provided by diverse operators such as the local hospital, police, fire brigade, or even funeral directors who often possessed the only local transport allowing a passenger to <b>lie</b> <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> most cases these ambulances were operated by drivers and attendants {{with little or no}} medical training, and it was some time before formal training began to appear in some units. An early example was the members of the Toronto Police Ambulance Service receiving a mandatory five days of training from St. John as early as 1889.|$|E

25|$|Between 5:00p.m. and 6:00p.m. Schulz {{and another}} man rowed across the harbor {{to see what was}} happening. They {{followed}} the sounds of the shooting until they came to the old citadel. By standing on a bunker at the citadel they could see a long deep trench which was said to have been dug by the Jews the previous day. This was about one kilometer north of the lighthouse. They watched for about an hour or an hour and a half. During that time, three or four trucks arrived at the site, each carrying five Jews. They were forced to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the truck. When the truck reached the site, the driver took the vehicle right up to the trench. Latvian guards, wielding clubs, forced the victims to enter directly into the trench. A squad of five men, possibly Latvians, but more probably German SD men, then shot them in the head. The supervising SS or SD officer then shot again any one not immediately killed.|$|E
500|$|Cattle {{may need}} to be {{deliberately}} thrown or tipped over for certain types of husbandry practices and medical treatment. [...] When done for medical purposes, this is often called [...] "casting", and when performed without mechanical assistance requires the attachment of [...] of rope around the body and legs of the animal. After the rope is secured by non-slip bowline knots, it is pulled to the rear until the animal is off-balance. Once the cow is forced to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> sternal recumbency (on its chest), it can be rolled onto its side and its legs tied to prevent kicking.|$|E

According to the other Family Stone members, most of the album was performed by him alone, overdubbing and sometimes using a drum machine. Other band members contributed by overdubbing alone with Sly instead of playing together as before. For [...] "Family Affair" [...] and some other selections Stone enlisted several other musicians including Billy Preston, Ike Turner, and Bobby Womack instead of his bandmates, and several female vocalists mostly omitted from the final mix.|$|E
500|$|Eve {{was elected}} to the New York State Assembly in 1966 {{following}} several years of service as an independent ward leader in Buffalo. He remained in the Assembly until 2002, sitting in the 177th, 178th, 179th, 180th, 181st, 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st, 192nd, 193rd and 194th New York State Legislatures. Eve rose to prominence in the mid-1960s during Buffalo's civil disturbances and rights. He expanded his notability during the Attica Prison riots. During the Buffalo riot of 1967, Eve attempted to organize formal meetings in order to avert physical confrontations. Eve fought against union policies which disallowed minority participation in apprentice programs that led to high paying union jobs on state construction sites. [...] He threatened New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller that he would <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> front of bulldozers at one of these sites. In 1968, he delayed construction on the State University of New York at Buffalo's Amherst Campus to push through an agreement that New York State and the unions would promote minority access into the construction industry. [...] The protests by supporters of Eve's effort caused Rockefeller to call for an eleven-month construction moratorium starting in March 1969.|$|E

50|$|Fokine {{claimed to}} be shocked by the {{explicit}} ending of Faun, despite {{at the same time}} suggesting the idea of the faun <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a sexual manner on top of the nymph's veil had been plagiarised from his own ballet Tannhäuser, where the hero had <b>lain</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a comparable manner upon a woman. However, Fokine found some points to compliment in the ballet, the use of pauses by the dancers where traditionally there would have been continuous movement, and the juxtaposition of angular choreography with the very fluid music.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the next}} sequence, Eros, the Greek god of love, was {{introduced}} flying over {{a pair of}} lovers frolicking in the pool of water located {{in the center of}} the stadium. The young couple along with Eros symbolize the fact that the humanity which create and shape history is born out of love and passion. This segment introduces the next part of the ceremony, the [...] "Clepsydra", which highlights the themes of the opening ceremony through a celebration of Greek history. The lovers then <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the water, and both fall into a dream state. Throughout the rest of the scenes from history and mythology, Eros flew over the parade, occasionally touching or stepping on the floats moving beneath him, thus reinforcing the theme of love and passion as the source for all history.|$|E

They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday, December 7, 1978 in total poverty. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka. Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Coe's bedroom.

He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robin Jensen writes: [...] "Historians have {{sometimes}} assumed that baptism was usually accomplished by full immersion – or submersion – {{of the body}} (dunking). However, the archaeological and iconographic evidence is ambiguous on this point. Many – if not most – surviving baptismal fonts are too shallow to have allowed submersion. In addition, {{a significant number of}} depictions show baptismal water being poured over the candidate's head (affusion), either from a waterfall, an orb or some kind of liturgical vessel." [...] Eerdman's Dictionary of the Bible also casts doubt on [...] "the usual assumption that all NT baptisms were by immersion", stating that some early baptisteries were deep enough to stand in but not broad enough to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>in,</b> and mentioning that ancient representation of Christ at his baptism show him standing in waist-deep water. The immersion used by early Christians in baptizing [...] "need not have meant full submersion in the water" [...] and, while it may have been normal practice, it was not seen as a necessary mode of baptism, so that other modes also may have been used. Submersion, as opposed to partial immersion, may even have been a minority practice in early Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Old Guard was {{convinced}} that the 1934 Declaration of Principles was an open declaration in favor of armed insurrection; Thomas believed it was a necessary statement to indicate that Socialists would not <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the face of fascism. The Old Guard believed that the anti-war sections of the Declaration of Principles placed the party under the threat of legal prosecution for advocating unlawful actions to oppose war; again Thomas believed that a strong statement was necessary to put capitalism on warning that if it engaged in imperialist war there would be opposition. The Old Guard believed that a united front with the Communists was immoral and would be disastrous for the Socialists, that even limited united action on specific causes should be banned, and even that exploratory discussions about a united front were going too far. Thomas opposed a united front on a general level, including any joint actions in political contests, but he thought that carefully planned united action on specific cases could, and should, take place. And he believed that it was worth while to conduct exploratory talks, even though he felt they would likely lead to nothing. The Old Guard felt that the Socialists' invitation to unaffiliated radicals and the Party's acceptance of former Communists, Lovestoneites, and Trotskyists was turning the party away from democratic socialism and to Communism. Thomas, though he disagreed with the ideology of these anti-Stalinist Communists, was willing to try to work with a party that included them, if they were willing to accept party discipline and not try to take over the Party. The Old Guard considered the Revolutionary Policy Committee, a far-left group within the Socialist Party, a Communist and anarchist group that had no place in a democratic socialist party. Thomas disagreed with the 'romantic revolutionists' in the Revolutionary Policy Committee (as he disagreed with the 'romantic parliamentarians' of the Old Guard), but still felt it was useful to try to salvage some of the enthusiasm and dedication that went into the Revolutionary Policy Committee by permitting its members to remain in the Party if, again, they followed party policy and party discipline." ...|$|E
