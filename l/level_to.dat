40|$|In this paper, {{the probe}} {{absorption}} spectrum of a four-level atom in photonic crystals has been investigated. A model is used, which assumes the transitions {{from the two}} upper <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> one of the lower <b>levels</b> coupled <b>to</b> the modes of the modied reservoir (photonic band gap) and transitions from the two upper <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> the other lower <b>level</b> coupled <b>to</b> the free vacuum modes. The eect of quantum interference in spontaneous emissions from the two upper <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> the lower <b>levels</b> on the absorption spectrum of an atom is investigated in detail. Most interestingly, it is shown that the atom becomes transparent to a probe laser eld coupled to the free space transition only in situations where complete quantum interference takes place in both the free space transitions and the modied reservoir transitions...|$|R

5|$|A quadruple-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double digit number total in four of five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—in a game. This feat is extremely rare: only four players have officially recorded a quadruple-double in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. The first American male player above the high school <b>level</b> <b>to</b> officially record a quadruple-double was Nate Thurmond, who achieved this feat in 1974 while playing for the NBA's Chicago Bulls. The first American female player above the high school <b>level</b> <b>to</b> officially record a quadruple-double was Ann Meyers, who achieved this feat in 1978 while playing for the UCLA Bruins, when women's college sports were {{under the auspices of the}} AIAW. The first male player in NCAA Division I history to record a quadruple-double was Lester Hudson in 2007. The first Division I women's player to have officially recorded a quadruple-double since the NCAA began sponsoring women's sports in 1981–82 was Veronica Pettry of Loyola of Chicago in 1989; only two other women have done so since, and none since 1993. An earlier player, Jackie Spencer of Louisville, accomplished the feat against Cincinnati during the 1984–85 season, but the NCAA did not record assists and steals throughout Division I women's basketball at that time. The Metro Conference, then home to both schools, did officially record these statistics, but the NCAA did not start doing so until 1985–86 for assists and 1987–88 for steals.|$|E

Harvey then struck 122 in the rain affected Third Test at Manchester; he helped Australia take a 42-run first innings lead, but was out for a duck in the second innings. Australia collapsed to 8/35 and were saved from defeat by the rain, which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible.|$|E

40|$|Human {{systemic}} antibody <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> oral {{members of}} the Bacteroides genus were assessed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> B. gingivalis, two homology groups of B. intermedius, B. melaninogenicus, B. denticola, B. loescheii, B. corporis, B. oralis, B. buccae, and B. gracilis were determined in subjects with localized juvenile periodontitis, advanced destructive periodontitis, or adult periodontitis and in normal persons. Significantly elevated serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> B. gingivalis were seen in adult and advanced destructive periodontitis patients. Serum IgM and IgA antibodies were increased in diseased versus normal subjects, whereas negligible levels of serum IgE antibody were detected to this microorganism. Serum IgG antibody <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> B. intermedius were increased in advanced destructive periodontitis patients; however, the frequency of elevated responses were similar among the groups. Extreme antibody <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> the other Bacteroides spp. were occasionally observed in this population. Additionally, all of the elevated levels were found in diseased patients. Distribution analyses of the antibody levels indicated that most patients exhibited a pattern of elevated antibodies to {{a limited number of}} the oral Bacteroides spp. The results suggested that elevated systemic antibody <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> oral Bacteroides spp. are more frequently found in periodontal disease patients. These antibody responses presumably reflect a colonization of the patients. The distribution of the responses may indicate the potential pathogenicity of the microorganisms and is consistent with distinctive host-parasite interactions in this disease...|$|R
