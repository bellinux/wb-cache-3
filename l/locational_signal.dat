40|$|The UK’s {{commitments}} to addressing climate change require a radical {{restructuring of the}} electricity sector. This thesis examines what role the electricity transmission networks could play in this transformation. In order to examine the possible role of policy making within a socio-technical system under conditions of long-term uncertainty, a novel scenario method is developed which accounts for political values, actor dynamics and technological networks. The approach is used to examine possible pathways for the electricity transmission network within alternative policy value-sets, which are defined by the level of <b>locational</b> <b>signal</b> provided to generators in respect of their network usage, {{and the degree of}} anticipatory or strategic planning involved in network policy. The scenarios emphasise the importance of a <b>locational</b> <b>signal</b> which acts at the operational timescale as well as the investment timescale. They also suggest a role for strategic coordination, particularly to join up planning across onshore, offshore and interconnector regimes. However, due to the range of possible generation and network configurations the scenarios span, they do not support the idea of a central design authority working to a single network blueprint. Specific policy recommendations aim to incorporate these suggestions within the grain of the existing policy trajectory and its prevailing value system. The two principle policy recommendations are therefore, the inclusion of a <b>locational</b> <b>signal</b> within the BSUoS charge in order to better reflect network usage at the operational timescale, and the establishment of an independent body with a remit to identify and contribute needs cases for cross-regime strategic coordination opportunities. The latter recommendation could be achieved with some adaption and clarification of the remit of the ENSG. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|The European {{electricity}} {{market design}} {{is based on}} zonal markets with uniform prices. <b>Locational</b> price <b>signals</b> within these zones - necessary to ensure long-term efficiency - are not provided. Specifically, if intra-zonal congestion occurs due to missing grid expansion, the market design is revealed as inherently incomplete. This might lead to severe, unwanted distortions of the electricity market, both in the short- and in the long-term. In this paper, we study these distortions with a specific focus {{on the impact of}} restricted grid expansion under zonal markets. For this,we use a long term fundamental dispatch and investment model of the European electricity system and gradually restrict the allowed expansion of the transmission grid per decade. We find that the combination of an incomplete market design and restricted grid expansion leads to a misallocation of generation capacities and the inability to transport electricity to where it is needed. Consequences are severe and lead to load curtail ment of up to 2 - 3 %. Moreover, missing grid expansion makes it difficult and costly to reach envisaged energy targets in the power sector. Hence, we argue that in the likely event of restricted grid expansion, either administrative measures or - presumably more efficient - an adaptation of the current market design to include <b>locational</b> <b>signals</b> will become necessary...|$|R

For over twenty years economists have known how to calculate the optimal spatial pricing {{for electricity}}, known as nodal or locational marginal pricing. However, such knowledge appears to have been ignored by the designers of most electricity markets, with the key exception of a few US and international markets. Furthermore {{it has been suggested that}} there may be a conflict between the implementation of adequate <b>locational</b> <b>signals</b> and the development of renewable energy because the former may lead to higher network charges which may compromise the profitability (and therefore the feasibility) of renewable energy plants. The literature appears to have already addressed several of the key issues considered by this PhD: spot pricing, optimal spatial pricing, renewable policies, network investments, integration of renewable energy into the power grid. However there seems to be a theoretical and empirical gap in terms of combining these issues together: e. g. given the adoption of optimal spatial pricing, how does this affect the level of production from renewable energy (wind in particular) ? Thus this thesis investigates how different forms of spatial pricing may affect renewable technologies, with regards to both their investment and operating decisions, and what regulatory or other policy implications this might imply. In particular this PhD focuses on the British case, where it is alleged that the introduction of more efficient spatial pricing might compromise the development of generation technologies located in particular areas, especially on-shore wind farms in the north of the country. The research contributes to an important area of current policy debate, given the strong targets for growth in renewable as part of climate change policy and growing concern about energy security.

Generation expansion planning is decided by strategic generation planners (SGPs) trying to maximize their profits, while transmission line investments are planned by a central planner and regulatory body aimed at minimizing the overall operation and network investment costs of the system. Regulatory transmission charges (RTCs) are calculated according to the marginal responsibility of generation investment on transmission network investment costs. An iterative algorithm is proposed to model the interaction taking place between the central planner and SGPs.

Numerical case {{studies on the}} 6 -bus system and the IEEE 30 -bus system show that the proposed method outperforms the other two methods. According to the results, the proposed method is fair and efficient, as it reflects the network topology {{as well as the}} order of magnitude and the location of the generators in the grid. Although the PS method intensifies the <b>locational</b> <b>signals,</b> its principle is only based on logical reasoning and can never be proved. It is also shown that the PS principle ignores the counter-flows and, in turn, results in considerable tariff instability. The proposed method, however, smooths the trend of the Z-bus method to reflect the counter-flows, and therefore helps to reduce the cross-subsidies. This property is truly valuable, since higher counter-flows with excessive rewards bring about unfair competitions. Furthermore, based on a comparison on the 6 -bus system, it is determined that the results of the cost allocation by the Z-bus method change significantly when different MW-mile pricing schemes are used, whereas the proposed method provides more stable results.|$|R

40|$|Amongst the {{commonly}} employed transmission pricing philosophies in the decentralized markets, i. e., point-to-point and point-of-connection (POC), the later {{one can be}} employed for both power exchange (PX) and bilateral trades. POC methodology charges a single rate per MW, depending upon the point of connection. The methodology though apparently simple, easy to implement and understand, entails {{the difficult task of}} fixing up the POC rates. Use of grossly aggregated zonal postage stamps as POC rates damps out the <b>locational</b> <b>signals,</b> while the use of LMPs to devise the spatially variate point charges fails to account for the transmission sunk costs. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a methodology to determine POC rates based on real power tracing. We introduce the concept of tracing based locational transmission price (LTP) which reflects participation of each node in the transmission line flows and hence the sunk costs of the associated lines. Thus, LTP transforms transmission usage of each node into spatially variate price signals.

40|$|Network pricing is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} effective ways to guide future demand and generation connection in distribution networks so as to encourage more efficient network usage and guide optimal development. Presently, the Distribution Reinforce Model (DRM) is utilized for High Voltage (HV) and/or Low Voltage (LV) distribution network pricing in the UK. The shortcoming with the model is that it generates average charges at each voltage level, unable to truly reflect use-of-system by customers as well as provides no <b>locational</b> <b>signals</b> to influence customers' behaviors. The Long Run Incremental Cost (LRIC) charging methodology is recognized by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) being able to produce cost-reflective, locational charges, but it cannot be directly utilized at HV and LV levels due to the complexity of its implementation. This paper aims at applying the LRIC model into HV network pricing by making specific improvements on the model to accommodate the features of HV networks. Firstly, radial distribution network reduction techniques are introduced, which is able to reduce original networks to simple network but maintaining their features for power flow calculation. Thereafter, the equivalent parameters of the reduced networks associated with implementing the LRIC are determined. The proposed method evolves from the original LRIC model, which can reflect the extent of networks needed to service generation and demand, and the degree to which networks are utilized.

When designing the laser systems, {{one of the first}} tasks to be solved is to determine a potential range of laser system operation. The laser system operation range depends on the algorithm for processing laser signals used in laser system. It can be estimated from an equality condition (for the limit range) between the power characteristics of the useful laser signal (coming to the receiver) and the threshold power characteristics of the laser system receiver. Today, practically, all the existing aerosol lidars operate with rather low repetition rate and with rather powerful single pulses. An alternative to it is operation with high repetition rate and with a low power of single pulses. The paper presents comparative analysis of a sounding range for the Aerosol Lidar in UF (0. 355 microns), visible (0. 532 microns) and near infrared (1. 064 microns) spectral ranges for various lidar options (with different repetition rates of laser pulses and different algorithms to process laser <b>locational</b> <b>signals).</b> To estimate the limit sounding ranges L three different algorithms were used: - equality of useful signal power and threshold power of the receiver; equality of useful signal power in the no-accumulation mode and minimum detected (threshold) power in the no-accumulation mode; equality of useful signal power in the accumulation mode and minimum detected (threshold) power in the accumulation mode.

40|$|Keeping a {{contingency}} reserve in power systems {{is necessary to}} preserve the security of real-time operations. This work studies two different approaches to the optimal allocation of energy and reserves in the day-ahead generation scheduling process. Part I presents a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment model to co-optimize energy and the locational reserves required {{to respond to a}} set of uncertain generation contingencies, using a novel state-based formulation. The model is applied in an offer-based electricity market to allocate contingency reserves throughout the power grid, in order to comply with the N- 1 security criterion under transmission congestion. The objective is to minimize expected dispatch and reserve costs, together with post contingency corrective redispatch costs, modeling the probability of generation failure and associated post contingency states. The characteristics of the scheduling problem are exploited to formulate a computationally efficient method, consistent with established operational practices. We simulated the distribution of locational contingency reserves on the IEEE RTS 96 system and compared the results with the conventional deterministic method. We found that assigning locational spinning reserves can guarantee an N- 1 secure dispatch accounting for transmission congestion at a reasonable extra cost. The simulations also showed little value of allocating downward reserves but sizable operating savings from co-optimizing locational nonspinning reserves. Overall, the results indicate the computational tractability of the proposed method. Part II presents a distributed generation scheduling model to optimally allocate energy and spinning reserves among competing generators in a day-ahead market. The model is based on the coordination between individual generators and a market entity. The proposed method uses forecasting, augmented pricing and <b>locational</b> <b>signals</b> to induce efficient commitment of generators based on firm posted prices. It is price-based but does not rely on multiple iterations, minimizes information exchange and simplifies the market clearing process. Simulations of the distributed method performed on a six-bus test system showed that, using an appropriate set of prices, it is possible to emulate the results of a conventional centralized solution, without need of providing make-whole payments to generators. Likewise, they showed that the distributed method can accommodate transactions with different products and complex security constraints...|$|R

Current EU {{involvement in the}} regulation of TSO revenues and transmission grid tarification is rather limited and the existing heterogeneity among national regulatory practices and transmission tariff structures might be an obstacle for functioning competition and adequate investments in the grids. However, we see neither the need nor solid justification for an EU-wide harmonization of the regulation of TSO revenues. ACER should take the responsibility for benchmarking national regulatory practices. Transparency standards should be extended. Innovative solutions to trigger investments (e. g. competitive tendering or a European tariff component) need to be considered. The EU shall call {{for the removal of}} legal barriers that might impede grid investments; it is notably necessary that third parties can invest where incumbent TSOs do not show interest to realize identified priority projects. To increase transparency, the cost components included in electricity transmission tariffs should be harmonized; they should only include costs related to transmission grid infrastructure. <b>Locational</b> <b>signals</b> providing reliable ex-ante signals should be introduced. To avoid a distortion in competition, the EU should fix an average share of the G/L-components; thus, introduce a minimum G-component. The behavior of grid users in the competitive sector must not be distorted, i. e. transmission tariffs covering the long-term cost of infrastructure should not be calculated based on energy transported (i. e. in €/MWh). In the European natural gas sector, there are more than 30 entry-exit zones with mainly administratively determined borders. The EU should set principles for determining the ideal size of entry-exit zones, but let concerned NRAs and TSOs agree on the result. Once market areas are merged, there are good economic reasons to implement a system of common tarification. The role for the EU here should be limited to support sound agreements between the respective stakeholders. We recommend some harmonization in natural gas transmission tarification to ensure that the breakdown of costs among grid users and among entry- and exit points respects the principle of cost-reflectiveness as much as possible. Adequate discounts on short-haul transports should be encouraged. Asymmetric re-allocation of costs, such that ‘captive’ domestic consumers have to bear disproportionately high costs, shall be prohibited.

40|$|Electricity from {{solar energy}} has many {{favorable}} attributes. Despite its current high cost {{relative to other}} technology options, a combination of cost reductions and policy support measures could lead to increasing deployment of solar power technologies. Should this pathway occur, the unique technical and economic characteristics of photovoltaics (PV) and concentrating solar power (CSP) technology will have implications for the wider electric power system. Similarly, {{the characteristics of the}} many elements that constitute electric power systems will have implications for the efficient deployment of these technologies. This thesis attempts to assess these technical and economic implications, and derive regulatory implications that result. A static cost-minimization expansion model with an 8760 hour temporal resolution, adapted from the literature, was developed in order to undertake this investigation. Following analytical development of the model formulation, the model was numerically applied to a simplified representation of the ERCOT power system. This application involved assessing changes in investment, dispatch, prices and emissions across various solar power deployment scenarios. The final portion of the thesis then addressed the complexities associated with developing the necessary transmission that may accompany large-scale solar power deployment. Findings from this work include: a) an explicit representation of the components that constitute the marginal system value of PV capacity under transmission constraints b) reasoning for why the optimal system with large scale solar power capacity includes less baseload capacity in the long term - and insights into how this may not be feasible in real systems, and c) a presentation of how solar power deployment paths diverge across capacity and energy support schemes, and across type of solar technology. In addition, it is found that: d) under perfect conditions, locational market prices will provide the adequate <b>locational</b> <b>signals</b> for `system-ecient' deployment, provided that the solar generators 'see' the signals in their objective functions, and e) the appropriateness of transmission charges for solar generators will vary by circumstance - any charge warranted should be considered in tandem with the system pricing mechanism and any renewable support scheme in place. by James Hubert Merrick.

Risk exposure is highest in the UK and lowest in Germany. From a policy maker's perspective, there is a trade-off between a "high risk" and a "low risk" approach.

In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of energy and cost saving, an innovative probabilistic methodology for evaluating the impact of residential DR choices considering uncertainties related to load demand, user preferences, environmental conditions, house thermal behavior and wholesale market trends has been proposed. The uncertainties related to the stochastic variations of the variables involved are modeled by using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. The combination of MCS and RT distribution market simulation based on D-LMPs are used to assess the operation and impact of the DR method over one month. Simulations results on an 84 -buses distribution network confirmed that the proposed method allows saving costs for residential end-users and making the distribution network much reliable against network congestions thanks to the use of D-LMPs...|$|R
40|$|In the European market, the {{promotion}} of wind power leads to more network congestion. Zonal pricing (market coupling), which does not take the physical characteristics of transmission into account, is {{the most commonly used}} method to relieve congestion in Europe. Zonal pricing fails to provide adequate <b>locational</b> price <b>signals</b> regarding the energy resource scarcity and thus creates a large amount of unscheduled cross-border flows originating from wind-generated power, making the interconnected grid less secure. Prior studies show that full nodal pricing works better in integrating wind power into the grid. In this paper we investigate the effects of applying a hybrid congestion management model, i. e. nodal pricing model for one country embedded in a zonal pricing system {{for the rest of the}} market. We test how nodal pricing works in such a hybrid context with more wind power. We find that, compared to full nodal pricing, hybrid pricing fails to fully utilize all the resources in the network and some wrong price signals might be given. However, hybrid pricing still performs better than zonal pricing. The results from the hybrid pricing model of Poland, Germany, Slovakia and the Czech Republic show that, within the area applying nodal pricing (Poland), better price signals are given; the need for re-dispatching reduces; more congestion rent is collected and the unit cost of power is reduced. The results also show that international power exchange increases between the nodal pricing area and the zonal pricing areas, especially on windy days. Moreover, the nodal pricing area has less unscheduled crossborder power flow from the zonal pricing area entering its network and collects more cross-border congestion rent...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} spatial and {{temporal}} properties of a class of cells termed theta-modulated place-by-direction (TPD) cells recorded from the presubicular and parasubicular cortices of the rat. The firing characteristics of TPD cells in open-field enclosures were {{compared with those of}} the following two other well characterized cell classes in the hippocampal formation: place and head-direction cells. Unlike place cells, which code only for the animal’s location, or head-direction cells, which code only for the animal’s directional heading, TPD cells code for both the location and the head direction of the animal. Their firing is also strongly theta modulated, firing primarily at the negative-to-positive phase of the locally recorded theta wave. TPD theta modulation is significantly stronger than that of place cells. In contrast, the firing of head-direction cells is not modulated by theta at all. In repeated exposures to the same environment, the <b>locational</b> and directional <b>signals</b> of TPD cells are stable. When recorded in different environments, TPD locational and directional fields can uncouple, with the locational field shifting unpredictably (“remapping”), whereas the directional preference remains similar across environments.

40|$|The aim of RETS Revisited is {{to review}} the {{progress}} that has occurred since the original RETS Report in June 2003. Given {{the large amount of}} wind generation planned, and the fact that much of it does not yet have planning consent or firm grid connection offers, it was felt that {{it would be helpful to}} take a further strategic look forward, rather than simply relying on the existing system to react to individual connection applications as and when required. RETS Revisited therefore: K considers the current likely volumes of new renewable generation, the timescales for this generation to be ready for connection to the transmission system and transmission issues impacting on the delivery of projects. K considers the effects on costs to the consumer of the rate of development of the transmission system in accommodating renewable energy to meet Government targets. K makes recommendations for action in order to connect sufficient renewables to meet the 2010 target and the aspirations beyond to 2020. Government policy is clear on the requirement for more renewable energy, and there is a market instrument, the Renewables Obligation, in place until 2027 which is driving the development of renewable projects. The Energy White Paper in 2003 recognised the need for the remodelling of the transmission grid to accept generation in new locations. Wind will be the technology capable of delivering significant capacity by 2010 and beyond. By its very nature the technology has limited ability to respond to <b>locational</b> price <b>signals.</b> In order for new generation projects to be connected, there needs to be a parallel development of transmission infrastructure. Transmission upgrades of over £ 560 m were approved by Ofgem in December 20041. These will assist the flows of electricity from Scotland. There is a need to ensure that these projects are not unduly delayed in construction. A review of the need for the linkage between upgrades to the Scotland-England interconnectors and Beauly-Denny line should be carried out now...|$|R
40|$|Programa de Doctorado Erasmus Mundus en Tecnologías y Estrategias Energéticas Sostenibles / Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Sustainable Energy Technologies and StrategiesThe European Union (EU) {{has adopted}} ambitious targets for {{decarbonization}} {{of the electricity}} sector. Renewable energy sources for electricity (RES-E), especially wind and solar power, will {{play an important role}} in achieving the new policy targets. In a RES-E dominated electricity system of the future, variability and unpredictability of intermittent RES-E will be prominent features that require constant attention over a range of time frames, from day-ahead to real-time. The electricity market mechanisms also need to be adapted to systems with higher variability and limited predictability of generation. This thesis provides an analysis of current and future challenges for the adaptation of short-term European electricity market mechanisms to accommodate a higher penetration of intermittent RESE-E. This thesis make of different quantitative methods such as optimization techniques, data analysis, agent-based modeling, among other to evaluate existing and proposed market designs in order to make policy recommendations. In this context, the Internal Energy Market in Europe should ideally be fostered by a harmonized set of market rules for all the countries that are part of it. In this respect, European institutions may be more ambitious in defining such a single set of rules in the Network Codes instead of proposing minimum requirements that give significant freedom for different national designs. With this latter approach, and because of cross-border electricity trade, there is a real and imminent risk that the current situation of heterogeneity in market designs persists, with a negative impact on both economic efficiency and system security. One stressed argument in this thesis is the intricate interaction between the various short-term market mechanisms, which influences their efficiency. For example, congestion management and balancing mechanisms are strongly interrelated. Network congestions limit the possibility to use balancing resources from any part of the grid; therefore, the cost of balancing services depends on the grid location. As European electricity prices are usually set at the national level, adverse price signals can emerge in the absence of <b>locational</b> price <b>signals.</b> Therefore, with the current changes to- wards more intermittent RES-E in the European generation mix, <b>locational</b> price <b>signals</b> become more relevant. In order to achieve a robust design and well-functioning of the short-term market mechanisms, these mechanisms should be based on competitive market forces, with as little administrative interference and distorted price signals as possible. This thesis provides various examples of current regulations in European countries that generate distortions in the short-term market mechanisms. For example, differences in the allocation of financial responsibility to wind power producers with respect to energy imbalances give different incentives to these market parties to deviate in their bids from the energy forecasts. In addition, the elimination of price caps and floors in systems with high intermittency is required to better manage the intermittency in current and future electricity systems. Furthermore, market regulations such as the priority dispatch rule for renewable sources give rise to operational decisions that are not economically efficient, at least in the short-term. A weak point of the European balancing mechanisms encountered in the development this thesis is a lack of transparency at different levels, mainly in the disclosure of balancing costs and the timely publication of balancing data. This limits the possibility for investment in flexibility and for market parties to react to the costs associated with imbalances. Furthermore, the publication of relevant data would allow a detailed analysis of the systems performance, and actions taken by relevant market parties such as the System Operators. A relevant finding of this thesis is that, depending on the market design, RES-E generators will not necessarily bid the expected energy output in the markets. This is challenging for balancing decisions taken by the system operators close to real time. Furthermore, if additional market distortions exist, market parties (including intermittent RES-E producers) can react to the price signals, with negative effects for the system. This is shown in this thesis with bidding strategies’ modeling in Northern European countries and also supported by data from bids in the Spanish and German markets...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice between}} a zonal or nodal pricing regime {{has been one}} of the most {{contentious}} elements of electricity market design. The pricing regime adopted has implications for real-time operational aspects such as congestion management, as well as for long-term investment decision-making for generation, networks and major loads, via economic <b>locational</b> price <b>signalling.</b> The debate over the potential implications of the pricing regimes on market power and contracting continues. The ability of the pricing regime to capture the fidelity of the underlying power system network is critical for efficient market operation. Linear programming techniques are frequently incorporated in the solution of market dispatch and a fundamental component is the set of constraint equations. Thermal contingency constraints are a very important sub-set of the constraints represented. An aggregative zonal pricing approach may include thermal contingency constraints which incorporate static coefficients of market variables calculated exogenously to the market model. In contrast, an explicit nodal pricing approach can enable dynamic endogenous formulation of these constraints within the market model. Therefore, these zonal and nodal modelling approaches both aim to solve the market dispatch problem, but define the problem differently. These differences potentially have significant implications for market operation and in particular for investment decision-making. This thesis empirically investigates the impact of the linear program feasible solution space definition on electricity market optimal dispatch outcomes, comparing the zonal and nodal modelling approaches. The New South Wales transmission network within the Australian National Electricity Market is investigated over a fifteen-year forecast period, for planning studies to guide network investment. The potential economic efficiency of an intra-zonal network investment is also assessed. Time-sequential security constrained economic dispatch is simulated for the current zonal approach and for the nodal approach developed in this thesis. The results demonstrate that the differences in spot price, congestion and dispatch outcomes between the modelling approaches can be substantial, and different paths for network investments might potentially be progressed. The results highlight that tools used in such optimisation processes should simultaneously capture the intra- and inter-zonal market dynamics, and the trade-offs for network investment within and between zones. The nodal approach developed could play a valuable role in improving the network investment decision-making process...|$|R
