500|$|S.spraguei is {{a popular}} edible among novice {{mushroom}} hunters as it is readily identifiable due to both its appearance and its association with White Pine. Although this distinctiveness renders it unlikely {{to be confused with}} other species, it does share similar characteristics with several other Suillus species. S.spraguei bears some resemblance to the rosy <b>larch</b> <b>bolete</b> (S.ochraceoroseus), but the latter species has a darker spore print, a thicker stem, and grows in association with larch. S.cavipes, another associate of larch trees, is more brownish and has a hollow stalk. S.lakei is less brightly colored than S.spraguei, has a shorter stalk, and usually grows with Douglas fir. S.decipiens has a less intensely red cap when young, but the color of older specimens fade and can resemble S.spraguei. S.decipiens generally has a smaller stature, with a cap ranging from [...] in diameter, and stem that is typically [...] long by [...] thick. Further, its pores are irregular in shape, measuring 0.5â€“1mm in diameter at maturity, and stain a shade of hazel rather than reddish to brownish. It is found in the southeastern United States, from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Texas.|$|E

50|$|Suillus tridentinus is an uncommon, edible {{mushroom}} in {{the genus}} Suillus, found mainly at higher altitudes beneath larches on chalk. It {{can be found}} together with <b>larch</b> <b>boletes,</b> but more scarce.|$|R
50|$|The genus also {{contains}} what {{were known as}} the <b>larch</b> <b>boletes,</b> several species that were described in the genus Fuscoboletinus. These grow in association with larch or tamarack (Larix ssp.). Molecular analysis has shown them to not be a monophyletic group and to be {{mixed in with the}} Suillus species.|$|R
5000|$|The name <b>larch</b> <b>bolete</b> {{is used to}} {{describe}} a number of fungi in the order Boletales which occur in association with species of larch, conifers in the genus Larix. These fungi include: ...|$|E
50|$|Suillus grevillei (commonly {{known as}} Greville's bolete and <b>larch</b> <b>bolete)</b> is a {{mycorrhizal}} mushroom with a tight, brilliantly coloured cap, shiny and wet looking with its mucous slime layer. The hymenium easily separates from {{the flesh of}} the cap, with a central stalk that is quite slender. The species has a ring or a tight-fitting annular zone.|$|E
50|$|Pulvinone, {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{belonging to the}} esters, lactones, alcohols and butenolides classes, is a yellow crystalline solid. Although the pulvinone is not a natural product, several naturally occurring hydroxylated derivatives are known. These hydroxylated pulvinones are produced by fungal species, such as the in Europe common <b>Larch</b> <b>Bolete</b> (Boletus elegans, also known as Suillus grevillei), or by moulds such as Aspergillus Terreus.|$|E
50|$|Suillus viscidus {{forms an}} ectomycorrhizal {{association}} with larch (Larix) specifically, and its distribution is thus {{limited by the}} range of the host tree. It occurs throughout Europe, and also in Japan. In Europe, it is considered an uncommon to rare fungus and it {{is to be found in}} the same habitat as the common <b>larch</b> <b>bolete,</b> Suillus grevillei, and also the rare Suillus tridentinus. Fruiting bodies are found in groups among grass under larch, from summer to autumn.|$|E
50|$|The forest {{provides}} food, nest {{sites and}} protection from predators for several bird species. Year round residents include common redpoll, wren, goldcrest, willow ptarmigan, and common raven. In summer the forest fills with redwings, snipes and meadow pipits along with Eurasian woodcocks and wagtails. Besides birding, the forest offers opportunities for botanizing and picking berries and mushrooms. Edible mushrooms include <b>larch</b> <b>bolete,</b> birch bolete, and slippery jack. Rock bramble is common and raspberries and redcurrants {{can be found}} in parts of the forest. Clear streams form a characteristic part of the forest and the water in all of them is drinkable.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, {{it is only}} {{a century}} after the {{synthesis}} of the first pulvinone that the word Pulvinone turned into a collective term. In 1973, Edwards and Gill isolated the first naturally occurring hydroxylated pulvinone derivative. This trihydroxylated pulvinone was found as one of the main pigments responsible for the yellow colour of the stem and caps of the European mushroom <b>Larch</b> <b>Bolete</b> (Boletus elegans, also known as Suillus grevillei).In the very same year 1973, Seto and coworkers also found hydroxylated pulvinones in cultures of the mould Aspergillus terreus. To insist on their origin - and thereby differentiate them from the hydroxylated pulvinones found in Suillus grevillei - Seto and coworkers named these compounds Aspulvinones. The aspulvinone terminology also incorporates a letter, indicating the order of chromatographic elution of these compounds (hence, the least polar aspulvinone was named Aspulvinone A, the one eluting next Aspulvinone B, etc...).|$|E
