40|$|The {{amounts of}} farm dairy {{effluent}} stored in ponds and irrigated to <b>land</b> have <b>steadily</b> increased with the steady growth of New Zealand's dairy industry. About 80 % of dairy farms now operate with effluent storage ponds allowing deferred irrigation. These storage and irrigation practices cause emissions {{of greenhouse gases}} (GHG) and ammonia. The current knowledge of the processes causing these emissions and the amounts emitted is reviewed here. Methane emissions from ponds are the largest contributor to the total GHG emissions from effluent in managed manure systems in New Zealand. Nitrous oxide emissions from anaerobic ponds are negligible, while ammonia emissions vary widely between different studies, probably because they depend strongly on pH and manure composition. The second-largest contribution to GHG emissions from farm dairy effluent comes from nitrous oxide emissions from land application. Ammonia emissions from land application of effluent in New Zealand were found to be less than those reported elsewhere from the application of slurries. Recent studies have suggested that New Zealand's current GHG inventory method to estimate methane emissions from effluent ponds should be revised. The increasing importance of emissions from ponds, while being a challenge for the inventory, also provides an opportunity to achieve mitigation of emissions due to the confined location of where these emissions occur. © 2015 © 2015 The Royal Society of New Zealand...|$|R

For each we review the mechanisms by which the stressors may affect fish, the likely sources of the stressors within the Etowah, and the management strategies to be implemented under the Etowah HCP to address the stressors.

A mid-level circulation developed to the south of Cape Verde on July 22, though the wave became less distinct as it continued westward. The wave axis crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 31. Convection steadily increased, though it was not until August 4 that the convection began to organize. Dvorak classifications began on August 4, and subsequent to the formation of a low-level circulation the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 6 about 550 miles (885 km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The depression tracked generally northward, under the influence of a ridge over Mexico and a mid-level trough to its west. The center of the depression was initially elongated, with northerly wind shear impacting the structure of the cyclone. This at first prevented further strengthening, though convection increased and organized into banding features as it moved through an area of warm water. On August 8, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Frank, and it soon turned to the north-northwest, brushing the western coastline of Baja California.

There were considerable arguments over {{the duration of the}} mission as flight doctors argued for no more than three orbits. The flight of Korabl-Sputnik 2 nine months earlier had carried two dogs on a six orbit mission, during which the animals had experienced convulsions and thus all subsequent Vostok missions were limited to three orbits maximum. Although dogs and humans were very different physiologically, the doctors were worried about the risks posed on a longer flight. There was also the purely practical aspect of spacecraft recovery. If Vostok 2 flew three orbits, reentry and landing would take place in the wide open steppes of southern Russia, the <b>landing</b> site moving <b>steadily</b> further west with each orbit.

The three orbit limit thus would not only make landing easy, but minimize risks to the cosmonaut posed by prolonged weightlessness.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the future world food demand/supply balance for the next century, in {{relation}} to the land uses, we develop a model in which the society has to supply two types of food demand, namely, processed crop products and meat and dairy products. From the supply side, the society can resort to different classes of land. Each class of land can be allocated wholly or partially either to crop cultivation or to pasture or last to be lain fallow. Primary crop production can be transformed either into processed crop products to satisfy final needs, or into intermediate livestock products used as inputs within the intensive industrial farming system. The livestock products can also be obtained from the extensive grazing system. The increase in world population together with the increase in the per capita income boost the final demand for food products. In order to meet the future food demands, the structure of the livestock production system should be modified, the share of the intensive production system having to be increased. With respect to the optimal allocation of land, we have established different degrees of land scarcity. More precisely, as the land is getting scarcer, the share of the livestock products stemming from the intensive production system is steadily increasing. Thus, the cropland is rising at the expense of pastureland.

40|$|Turkmenistan, {{like all}} Central Asian countries, is {{critically}} dependent on water {{because of its}} arid desert climate. The Amudarya, flowing from the Pamir and Tien-Shan Mountains to the tragically dying Aral Sea, is {{the main source of}} water for all agricultural and non-agricultural uses in Turkmenistan. Given the constancy of water resources and the rapidly growing population in the country, the annual water availability per capita decreased by 50 % during the last 35 years, dropping to 4, 000 cu. m in 2004. Water has thus become the principal strategic resource that determines the region‘s economic development options. Water allocation from Amudarya is governed by regional agreements between all Central Asian states. Turkmenistan‘s share is 22 cu. km per year, or 36 % of the river‘s total runoff. Agriculture is the main water user in Turkmenistan, consuming 95 % of the available resources. The emphasis on the expansion of cotton production in the Soviet era and the strategy of food self-sufficiency aggressively implemented since 1992 have led to accelerated growth of irrigated areas, which increased by nearly 4 times in the last 40 years, reaching 2. 3 million hectares. Almost half this area – 1 million hectares – has been added during the 15 years since independence. Irrigation is expanded without proper engineering attention to efficient conveyance of water, using mostly unlined canals and ditches with loss rates exceeding 30 %. Effective water use per hectare of irrigated <b>land</b> has <b>steadily</b> declined, and it is now one-half of its level in 1970. Inadequate water availability {{is one of the reasons}} for low crop yields in Turkmenistan. The expansion of the collector-drainage network lags far behind the expansion of irrigation: between 2000 - 2004 the collector-drainage network grew by 7 %, while the irrigated area increased by 26 %. This has led to accelerated rise of the groundwater table, deterioration of soil quality, and increased salinity. More that 1. 6 million hectares, or 73 % of irrigated land in Turkmenistan, is salinated. Increased use of concrete or plastic lined ditches, adoption of new efficient technologies – sprinkling, drip-irrigation, subsoil irrigation, and careful attention to water consumption for crop irrigation will significantly reduce water losses and seepage into the ground, and alleviate the problems associated with rising groundwater table. Adoption of water-saving technologies is costly, but it is essential for improved efficiency of water use. This technological approach will make it possible to increase the irrigated area in Turkmenistan to 4 - 5 million hectares while actually raising crop yields. It will thus help the country‘s agriculture achieve its economic potential. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Coherent lidar {{can play}} a {{critical}} role in future planetary exploration missions by providing key guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) data necessary for navigating planetary landers to the pre-selected site and achieving autonomous safe soft-landing. Although the <b>landing</b> accuracy has <b>steadily</b> improved over time to approximately 35 km for the recent Mars Exploration Rovers due to better approach navigation, a drastically different guidance, navigation and control concept is required to meet future mission requirements. For example, future rovers will require better than 6 km landing accuracy for Mars and better than 1 km for the Moon plus maneuvering capability to avoid hazardous terrain features. For this purpose, an all-fiber coherent lidar is being developed to address the call for advancement of entry, descent, and landing technologies. This lidar will be capable of providing precision range to the ground and approach velocity data, and in the case of landing on Mars, it will also measure the atmospheric wind and density. The lidar obtains high resolution range information from a frequency modulated-continuous wave (FM-CW) laser beam whose instantaneous frequency varies linearly with time, and the ground vector velocity is directly extracted from the Doppler frequency shift. Utilizing the high concentration of aerosols in the Mars atmosphere (approx. two order of magnitude higher than the Earth), the lidar can measure wind velocity with a few watts of optical power. Operating in 1. 57 micron wavelength regime, the lidar can use the differential absorption (DIAL) technique to measure the average CO 2 concentration along the laser beam using, that is directly proportional to the Martian atmospheric density. Employing fiber optics components allows for the lidar multi-functional operation while facilitating a highly efficient, compact and reliable design suitable for integration into a spacecraft with limited mass, size, and power resources...|$|R

Owners of small farms, which consist of low-yield agricultural land, can be regarded as investors operating on the real estate market, but those investors have features characteristic of agricultural producers. This study relied on the net present value (NPV) criterion, which is popularly used to assess the effectiveness of investments on the real estate market. A financial feasibility assessment performed with the use of such method in view of afforestation statistics and the 5 % discount rate on the Polish forest market revealed the highest increase in net cumulative cash flows in the first five years, followed by a gradual decrease in successive years. The first negative cash flow was reported in year 20. NPV would remain negative because farmers would be charged with periodic maintenance expenditures until the stand reaches harvestable age at approximately 40 years. The longer the investment period, the lower the profits, even if discount rate is excluded. Investments of the type are difficult to terminate because forests younger than 20 years are difficult to sell at a price that covers growing outflows. Afforestation projects are also influenced by other economic and non-economic factors. The paper validates the research hypothesis that afforestation is a long-term investment that delivers benefits for future generations...|$|R
