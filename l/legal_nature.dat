In a special part of the thesis, {{the historical development of}} a tool and its current legal status is described in selected instruments of nature conservation.

Currently, up-to-date database of information on tree monuments is available. Yet, the Nature Conservation Act does not include just the above-mentioned widely used protection tools.

2500|$|No responsa {{are known}} to exist from before the Mishnah (200 CE); it is {{doubtful}} whether any were written before this period. A tradition held that no halakha (law) should be written down (see Oral Torah). Even when reluctance to write down rulings became obsolete, letters of a <b>legal</b> <b>nature</b> might be written only in cases where laws might likewise be reduced to writing. While the rule prevailed that no laws should be written, no communications of legal content were made by means of letters. Questions were usually communicated orally, or proposed to the academy by a teacher, who transmitted the answer and decision by word of mouth. The rarity of letters on legal problems in the Tannaitic era (the period the Mishnah covers) may be seen from a passage in the Tosefta (Ter. ii. 13 [...] ), which states that Rabbi Gamliel secretly dispatched a messenger with an answer to a question; for if he desired to keep his decision secret, he would probably have sent a letter had such replies been customary at that time.|$|E
40|$|<b>Legal</b> {{instruments}} for <b>nature</b> conservation make knowledge on actual and potential presence of protected {{and endangered species}} in river floodplain ecosystems an important issue in river management. Within river management, many physical reconstruction and management plans are currently being carried out and planned. The expected effects on biodiversity are massive and can be positive as well as negative. Huge amounts of ecological knowledge {{will be required to}} do the legally obligatory assessments. Ecology and legislation are two crucial frameworks for nature conservation in river management. In this thesis, a model that can integrate ecological knowledge with <b>legal</b> {{instruments for}} <b>nature</b> conservation in river management is developed, evaluated and applied. The relation between ecological knowledge and legal instruments is studied by analysing goals, approaches towards nature and species selection and terminology of the two frameworks. Based on {{the results of the study}} it is concluded that BIO-SAFE is an operational and scientifically underpinned model for integration of ecological knowledge and information with <b>legal</b> instruments for <b>nature</b> conservation in river management, that provides useful information in evaluation studies, is valid for impact assessments and insensitive to value judgements. Application of the model showed the effects of river management measures on actual and potential presence of protected and endangered river species. The measures taken can be optimised by increasing the spatial scale, and using detailed knowledge on local potentials. When landscape heterogeneity is maximized and low and intermediate dynamic circumstances are conserved and developed, nature conservation can be combined with flood risk reduction and ecological rehabilitation. The ecological and the <b>legal</b> framework for <b>nature</b> conservation have different goals, criteria for making valid claims and approaches towards nature and species selection. However, there are various opportunities for bridging the gaps in practice, e. g. in jurisprudence, management plans, codes of conduct and effect studies...|$|R

The Asian Wall Street Journal which published them was promptly banned from the country, and Mahathir in his capacity as Home Affairs Minister had Berthelsen's and Pura's work permits revoked. However, the Supreme Court overturned the cancellation of Berthelsen's work permit because he had not been given a chance to answer the charges of the government. As a result, the ban on the Asian Wall Street Journal was also lifted. In a different case, the Supreme Court used its power of judicial review, and nullified amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code which gave the Attorney-General the power to initiate criminal proceedings in the High Court without first going to a Magistrate's Court.

2500|$|... {{literally}} pleasure marriage) is a fixed-term or short-term contractual {{marriage in}} Shia Islam. The duration {{of this type}} of marriage is fixed at its inception and is then automatically dissolved upon completion of its term. For this reason, nikah mut‘ah has been widely criticised as the religious cover and legalization of prostitution. The Christian missionary Thomas Patrick Hughes criticized Mut'ah as allowing the continuation of [...] "one of the abominable practices of ancient Arabia." [...] Shi'a and Sunnis agree that Mut'ah was legal in early times, but Sunnis consider that it was abrogated. Ibn Kathir writes that [...] "here's no doubt that in the outset of Islam, Mut'ah was allowed under the Shari'ah". Currently, however, mut'ah is one of the distinctive features of Ja'fari jurisprudence. No other school of Islamic jurisprudence allows it. According to Imam Jafar as Sadiq, [...] "One of the matters about which I shall never keep precautionary silence (taqiyya) is the matter of mu’tah." [...] Allameh Tabatabaei defends the Shia view in Tafsir al-Mizan, arguing that there are mutawatir or nearly mutawatir traditions narrated from the Shia Imams that Mut'ah is permitted. For example, it has been narrated from Muhammad al-Baqir and Ja'far al-Sadiq that they said [...] "regarding the [...] verse, and there is no blame on you about what you mutually agree after what is appointed." [...] It means that he increases her dowry or she increases his (fixed) period. Sunnis believe that Muhammad later abolished this type of marriage at several different large events, the most accepted being at Khaybar in 7 AH (629 CE) [...] and at the Victory of Mecca in 8 AH (630 CE). Most Sunnis believe that Umar later was merely enforcing a prohibition that was established during Muhammad's time. Shia contest the criticism that nikah mut‘ah is a cover for prostitution, and argue that the unique <b>legal</b> <b>nature</b> of temporary marriage distinguishes Mut'ah ideologically from prostitution.|$|E

The house he alienated to William Virtue, from whom, as before mentioned, it was purchased by the parish of St. George’s, Hanover Square, in 1787; and the library formed a twelve-days’ sale, by Messrs.

Dr. Dibdin declares, that “never was a precious collection of English history and poetry so wretchedly detailed to the public in an auction-catalogue” as that of Mr. Wynne’s library; and yet it will be seen that it must have realised a considerable sum of money.
