5|$|The {{individual}} {{directors are}} allowed to freely interpret the base mythology when they create their games. When referring to this freedom, Tabata has compared the mythos and the concept behind it to Greek mythology; a mythology with common themes and deities, but featuring a large variety of unrelated stories. Toriyama conceived a story for Final Fantasy XIII set primarily around the mythos' deities and their direct relations to the world. Tabata and Nomura both focused more on the human side of the story. Tabata chose to portray the divine elements from a historical standpoint in Type-0, while Nomura created a modern-day setting similar to contemporary Earth in XV, referring far <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mythos' terminology. Nomura was also appointed as the main character designer for all entries in the subseries. In a 2007 interview, Hashimoto compared the planning of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series to film franchises such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: an expansive brand {{on which to build}} multiple Final Fantasy titles planned in advance. The development of all games connected to the mythos was handled by Square Enix 1st Production Department. A trademark for Final Fantasy Haeresis XIII hinted at another entry, but the trademark expired in 2011 and the company did not renew.|$|E
25|$|What {{was perhaps}} most {{significant}} for the LXX, as distinct from other Greek versions, was that the LXX began to lose Jewish sanction after differences between it and contemporary Hebrew scriptures were discovered (see Disputes over canonicity). Even Greek-speaking Jews tended <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> LXX, preferring other Jewish versions in Greek, {{such as that of}} the 2nd-century Aquila translation, which seemed to be more concordant with contemporary Hebrew texts.|$|E

This process encourages authors to meet the accepted standards of their discipline and reduces the dissemination of irrelevant findings, unwarranted claims, unacceptable interpretations, and personal views.

25|$|Charles Gandee, {{associate}} editor at Vogue, {{has said that}} high prices and poor attitudes contributed <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decline of the supermodel. As clothes became less flashy, designers turned to models who were less glamorous, so they wouldn't overpower the clothing. Whereas many supermodels of the previous era were American-born, their accents making for an easier transition to stardom, the majority of models began coming from non-English speaking countries and cultures, making the crossover to mainstream spokesperson and cover star difficult. However, the term continued {{to be applied to}} notable models such as Kristen McMenamy, Eva Herzigová, Carla Bruni, Yasmin Le Bon, Amber Valletta, Shalom Harlow, Nadja Auermann, Helena Christensen, and later, Milla Jovovich.|$|E
25|$|In 58 BC the nobleman Orgetorix instigated a new Helvetian migration, {{in which}} the entire tribe was to leave their {{territory}} (which is now described as corresponding more or <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Swiss plateau) and to establish a supremacy over all of Gaul. They marched from their villages but were stalled by Julius Caesar {{on the banks of}} the Rhône. They marched around and crossed the Jura Mountains, but near the Aeduan oppidum Bibracte, Caesar caught up with the Helvetii and faced at the Battle of Bibracte, which ended in the Helvetii’s retreat and the capture of most of their baggage by the Romans. Following their surrender the Helvetii became foederati, an allied civitas that were required to provide soldiers but were not citizens.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} economic activities in the borough are manufacturing and commerce. Sixty-three percent of all business establishments are dedicated to commerce, which employ 42% {{of the people and}} accounts for 45% of the borough’s GDP. Commerce and services together employ 63.3% of the population. Twenty-four percent of this commerce is wholesale, much of which is tied to the Central de Abasto and the La Nueva Viga markets. However, wholesale businesses have declined 2.8% while retail establishment have increased 8.1%. This has a positive effect on employment, but this activity adds <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> GDP. The largest sector of retail sales is in street markets called tianguis, followed by public markets, street peddlers and lastly through the Central de Abasto.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Akershus County Municipality was {{regarding}} {{what to do}} with the line. The first proposal came in 2002, when it was stated that the metro should terminate at Lysakerelven and that the rest of the line be operated as part of the tramway. Civitas published a report for the county in 2006. Critical remarks regarding costs and patronage issued by Oslo Sporveier were ignored. Based on the report, Akershus County Council passed a metro upgrade of the line. The cost from the municipal border to Kolsås was estimated at 677 million Norwegian krone. Both a metro and a tramway alternative were estimated to give the same traffic. The metro alternative would use four to eight minutes <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city center, while the tramway would have six to eight departures per hour.|$|E
25|$|Thompson was {{to provide}} Rolling Stone with {{coverage}} for the 1976 presidential campaign that would appear in a book published by the magazine. Reportedly, as Thompson was waiting for a $75,000 advance check to arrive, he learned that Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner had cancelled the assignment without informing him. Wenner then asked Thompson to travel to Vietnam to report on {{what appeared to be}} the closing of the Vietnam War. Thompson accepted, and left for Saigon immediately. He arrived with the country in chaos, just as South Vietnam was collapsing and other journalists were scrambling to find transportation out of the region. While there, Thompson learned that Wenner had pulled the plug on this excursion as well, and Thompson found himself in Vietnam without health insurance or additional financial support. Thompson's story about the fall of Saigon would not be published in Rolling Stone until ten years later. These two incidents severely strained the relationship between the author and the magazine, and Thompson contributed far <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> publication in later years.|$|E

25|$|Count 2: Modification of a {{revenue sharing}} {{agreement}} on pre-paid mobile services. Previously, telecom operators {{had to pay}} the TOT a percentage of their revenues for post-paid mobile services. To offer pre-paid services, which are generally cost <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> consumer, AIS negotiated with TOT to design a revenue sharing agreement for pre-paid services that offered less revenue to the TOT comprising an estimated loss of 14.2billion baht (revenue reduced from 25% to 20%) from 2001 to 2006 and another estimated loss of 56billion baht (revenue reduced from 30% to 20%) from 2006 to 2015. The judges ruled that {{the terms of the}} pre-paid agreement harmed TOT while benefiting AIS. The judges did not dispute the fact that TOT's total revenue actually increased substantially {{as a result of the}} agreement, but noted that the rise in pre-paid revenue came about while harming TOT's post-paid revenue. The massive growth in Thai mobile penetration from 13% in 2001 to 80% in 2007, due almost completely to pre-paid services, and the reduction in AIS market share from 68% to 53% in the same period were not taken into account by the court.|$|E
25|$|JPEG uses a lossy form of {{compression}} {{based on}} the discrete cosine transform (DCT). This mathematical operation converts each frame/field of the video source from the spatial (2D) domain into the frequency domain (a.k.a. transform domain). A perceptual model based loosely on the human psychovisual system discards high-frequency information, i.e. sharp transitions in intensity, and color hue. In the transform domain, the process of reducing information is called quantization. In simpler terms, quantization is a method for optimally reducing a large number scale (with different occurrences of each number) into a smaller one, and the transform-domain is a convenient representation of the image because the high-frequency coefficients, which contribute <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overall picture than other coefficients, are characteristically small-values with high compressibility. The quantized coefficients are then sequenced and losslessly packed into the output bitstream. Nearly all software implementations of JPEG permit user control over the compression-ratio (as well as other optional parameters), allowing the user to trade off picture-quality for smaller file size. In embedded applications (such as miniDV, which uses a similar DCT-compression scheme), the parameters are pre-selected and fixed for the application.|$|E
25|$|The {{landscape}} of the river basins is a very wide, flat, well-watered plain continuously refreshed with soil and sediment brought down by the rivers. The lower central plain from the delta north to Ang Thong Province is a flat, low area {{with an average of}} two metres above sea level. Further north and into the plains of the Ping and the Nan the elevation is over 20 m. Then the mountains that are the natural boundary of the Chao Praya watershed form a divide, which has, to some degree, historically isolated Thailand from other Southeast Asian civilisations. In northern Thailand the divide roughly corresponds to a long section of the political border of the country today. Southern portions of the divide's boundary correspond <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation's political border, because isolation in this area was prevented by the ease of transportation along the lowlands surrounding the Gulf of Thailand, allowing a unified Thai civilisation to extend beyond the watershed without issue. The slightly higher northern plains have been farmed for centuries and saw a major change from the 13th century during the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th and 14th centuries and the Ayutthaya Kingdom that succeeded it when rice growing intensified with the introduction of floating rice, a much faster-growing strain of rice from Bengal. The southern swamps meanwhile changed radically from the 18th century when King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke moved the capital of Siam to Bangkok, and a process of canalisation and cultivation began, especially as Thailand began to export rice from 1855.|$|E

500|$|Part of {{the legacy}} {{associated}} with the fu is its use {{as a form of}} sociopolitical protest, such as the theme of the loyal minister who has been unjustly exiled by the ruler or those in power at the court, rather than receiving the promotion and respect which he truly deserves. In the Verses of Chu, one of the works attributed to Qu Yuan is the [...] "Li Sao", {{which is one of the}} earliest known works in this tradition, both as ancestral to the fu as well as its incorporation of political criticism as a theme of poetry. [...] The theme of unjust exile is related to the development of Xiaoxiang poetry, or the [...] poetry stylistically or thematically based upon lamenting the unjust exile of the poet, either directly, or allegorically through the use of the persona of a friend or historical figure (a safer course in the case of a poet-official who might be punished for any too blatant criticism of the current emperor). During the Han Dynasty, along with the development of the fu stylistically, the idea that it incorporate political criticism through indirection and allegory also developed. Han Dynasty historian and author Ban Gu in his Book of Han pointedly refers to a fu by Qu Yuan as a literary example of the use of the theme of the loyal minister who has been unjustly exiled, rather than receiving the promotion and respect which he truly deserves. As Hellmut Wilhelm puts it: [...] "...the Han fu can easily be classified into a limited number of types. All types have one feature in common: almost without exception they can be and have been interpreted as voicing criticism—either of the ruler, the ruler's behavior, or certain political acts or plans of the ruler; or of the court officials or the ruler's favorites; or, generally, of the lack of discrimination in the employment of officials. The few examples that are positive in tone recommend the authors or their peers for employment, or even contain specific political suggestions. In short, almost all fu have a political purport, and, in addition, almost all of them deal with the relationship between the ruler and his officials." [...] Seen in context, Ban Gu's discussion of Qu Yuan and the Chu sao style is <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point of the actual evolutionary path of the fu and more to the point that the main purpose of the fu is political and social criticism through poetic indirection: thus, in fu, paradoxically, the [...] "fantastic descriptions and an overflowing rhetoric...can be reduced to...restraint", as the sociopolitical criticism which was key to the fu was constrained within a very subtle, elaborately indirect, occasional, and allusive mode.|$|E
