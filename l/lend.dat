40|$|We offer a new {{paradigm}} for understanding the impact of financial shocks on the flow of credit to {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). Drawing from research on the <b>lending</b> view of monetary policy and research on SME financial contracting, we introduce the concept of “lending channels. ” A <b>lending</b> channel is a two-dimensional conduit through which SMEs obtain financing. In particular, a <b>lending</b> channel consists of a specific <b>lending</b> technology provided by a specific type of institution. We hypothesize that during financial shocks some <b>lending</b> channels may close and other channels may expand to absorb the slack. We empirically test a possible implication of this hypothesis by examining whether one <b>lending</b> channel, trade credit, played a significant role as a substitute for other <b>lending</b> channels in offsetting a contraction in SME <b>lending</b> of other <b>lending</b> channels during the Japanese financial crisis. We find little evidence that trade credit played such a role.
