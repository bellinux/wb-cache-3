40|$|An {{improved}} {{welding electrode}} for producing weld metal having low amount of hydrogen therein so that hydrogen assisted cracking in weld zone is minimised. This is especially beneficial for welding {{high strength steel}} having tensile strengths of about 70000 psi or above. The reduction of slag /metal reaction temperature during welding {{have been found to}} have additional advantage of reducing the amount of oxygen in weld metal. This provides increased impact properties for the weld metals. The filler metals that resist hydrogen related cracking while also providing good mechanical properties.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} {{the result of}} investigations aimed at determining the hardness of the welded Chromoly (A 4130) steel plate of 2 ” thickness. Multi pass welding for the thick sections was carried out and analyzed for the Chromoly alloy steel plates. The study of hardness at the weld metal reveals that there {{is the presence of}} different micro structure products which yields diverse properties. The welding carried out using GMAW with ER 70 s- 2 electrode. Single V groove design was selected for the butt joint configuration. The presence of hydrogen has been suppressed by selecting <b>low</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>electrode.</b> Preheating of the plate prior to welding reduces the cooling rate which also affects the weld metal microstructure. The shielding gas composition used in this analysis is 80 % Ar- 20 % CO 2. The experimental analysis gives the detailed study of the hardness of the material...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} weld metal {{microstructure}} and properties of <b>low</b> <b>hydrogen</b> covered <b>electrodes</b> where the usual binders (potassium and sodium silicates) {{were replaced by}} polymers. The impermeable covered electrode was produced using the commercial E 7018 formula. Preliminary tests with different polymers and formulation changes were realized to meet the satisfactory weld ability. The best covered electrode at the first stage was evaluated at the second stage. Weld metal diffusible hydrogen, microstructure and mechanical properties were evaluated and compared with traditional <b>low</b> <b>hydrogen</b> covered <b>electrodes.</b> In addition, it were made tests to evaluate the slag and fumes generated during the welding. The impermeable covered <b>electrode</b> diffusible <b>hydrogen</b> content was less than 4 mL/ 100 g of weld metal. This is very low if compared to conventional <b>low</b> <b>hydrogen</b> covered <b>electrodes.</b> Additional <b>hydrogen</b> tests were made after covered electrode moisture exposure under several conditions and confirm the coating resistance. The impermeable covered electrode weld metal showed the same morphology and typical microstructure of weld metal produced by the E 7018 <b>low</b> <b>hydrogen</b> covered <b>electrode.</b> However, the acicular ferrite volume was significantly higher when compared with E 7018 covered electrode. Weld metal tensile and yield strength, elongation and toughness (Charpy V-notch test) overcome the E 7018 <b>low</b> <b>hydrogen</b> covered <b>electrodes</b> properties.

The elevation of fluoride excretion levels is related to the degree of confinement in working conditions.

40|$|A {{survey is}} given on health {{problems}} at welding. Potential hazard from nitrous oxides, ozone, carbon monoxyde, fumes of lead, zinc and cadmium and the fumes containing iron oxides, amorphous silica and oxides of calcium and manganese arc described. The irritative effect of fumes at arc welding with basic (<b>low</b> <b>hydrogen)</b> <b>electrodes</b> {{is believed to}} be due to the content of fluorine in the fumes. The maximum allowable concentration of arc welding fumes have been proposed to 20 mg/m 3, at are welding with basic electrodes 10 mg/m 3. The welders 2 ̆ 7 flash and its prevention are discussed. X-ray or radioactive isotopes used to control welds may also create a health hazard. It is pointed out that the most important accident risk at welding is the hazard of explosion at welding on drums, barrels etc. containing explosive or flamable material.

40|$|Weld {{cracking}} is {{the most}} important problems in constructing steel structures. In order to study weld cracking, each relation as follows has been investigated; the relation between the water content of the flux and the diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal based on JIS hydrogen test method, the relation between the applied stress and the occurrence of weld cracking varied dry conditions of the electrode by using Impant Test, and the relation between the diffusible hydrogen and the fracture by using scanning electron microscope. The results are summarized as follows; (1) In ilmenite type electrode (D 4301) as the water content of the flux is increasing, the diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal is also increasing straightly. Using the dried electrode, a lot of the diffusible hydrogen are included in deposited metal. (2) In <b>low</b> <b>hydrogen</b> type <b>electrode</b> (D 5016 and E 11016) as the water content of the flux is increasing until 2 %, the diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal is rapidly increasing. (3) The electrode that the moisture absorbability is high is E 11016. (4) In high strength steel, the stress range that occurrs in weld cracking becomes wide by using wetted electrode. (5) In the case of using dried electrode (D 4301) and wetted electrode (E 11016) the relation between the applied stress and the fracture time are almost the same results. (6) The fracture has intergranular pattern near the notch in each applied stress in the case of wetted electrode used, and it is considered that this place is the cracking initiation point.
