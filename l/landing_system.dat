5|$|Brønnøysund Airport {{installed}} the SCAT-I satellite-based <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> on 29 October 2007. Avinor's Steinar Hamar stated {{at the opening}} ceremony that the system would have prevented both Flight 710 and Flight 744 at Namsos Airport in 1993. The roll-out, taking place at most of Avinor's regional airports, is scheduled for completion in 2013.|$|E
5|$|On 23 December 1972 at 16:30, the company's most fatal {{accident}} occurred. F-28 LN-SUY Sverre Sigurdson on Flight 239 from Ålesund to Oslo crashed at Asker, killing 40 of the 45 people on board, including {{the crew of}} three. The cause of the accident was never discovered, although a possibility could have been faults with the instrument <b>landing</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 2008, it was {{announced}} that the airport would install a Category III <b>landing</b> <b>system,</b> allowing planes to land in low visibility conditions, such as fog.

5|$|The AW101's {{navigation}} system includes a GPS receiver and inertial {{navigation system}}, VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR), instrument <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> (ILS), TACAN, and automatic direction finding. The Mk1 and Mk3 {{are equipped with}} a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS {{as part of the}} autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.|$|E
5|$|The {{helicopter}} {{operations were}} {{taken over by}} Norsk Helikpoter (later renamed Bristow Norway) when they opened their base on 11 November 2004. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Hammerfest was the second airport to receive SCAT-I, a Global Positioning System-based <b>landing</b> <b>system,</b> when it was installed in 2007. SCAT-I allows aircraft with the system installed to make a safer and less fuel-consuming landings using a gliding instead of step-down approach. This was followed up with an upgrade to the runway safety area and runway lights in 2008 and 2009.|$|E
40|$|Environmental surrogates (land classes) for the {{distribution}} of biodiversity are increasingly being used for conservation planning. However, data that demonstrate coincident patterns in land classes and biodiversity are limited. We ask the overall question, “Are <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> effective surrogates for the spatial configuration of biodiversity for conservation planning?” and we address three specific questions: (1) Do different <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> represent different biological assemblages? (2) Do biological assemblages on the same <b>land</b> <b>system</b> remain similar with increasing geographic separation? and (3) Do biological assemblages on the same <b>land</b> <b>system</b> remain similar with increasing <b>land</b> <b>system</b> isolation? Vascular plants, invertebrates, and microbiota were surveyed from 24 sites in four <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> in arid northwest New South Wales, Australia. Within each <b>land</b> <b>system,</b> sites were located to give a hierarchy of inter-site distances, and <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> were classified as either “low isolation” (large and continuous) or “high isolation” (small patches interspersed among other <b>land</b> <b>systems).</b> Each type of <b>land</b> <b>system</b> supported components of biodiversity either not found, or found infrequently, on other <b>land</b> <b>systems,</b> suggesting that <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> function as surrogates for biodiversity, and that conservation-area networks representing land-system diversity will also represent biological diversity. However, the majority of taxa were found {{on more than one}} land-system type, suggesting that {{a large proportion of the}} plant, arthropod, and microbial biodiversity may be characterized by widespread species with low fidelity to particular <b>land</b> <b>systems.</b> Significant relationships between geographic distance among sites and differences among assemblages were revealed for all taxa except the microbiota. Therefore, as sites on the same <b>land</b> <b>system</b> were located farther apart, the assemblages at those sites became more different. This finding strongly suggests that conservation planning based on land-system diversity should also sample the geographic range occupied by each <b>land</b> <b>system.</b> Land-system isolation was not revealed to be a significant source of variation in assemblage composition. Our research finds support for environmental surrogates for biodiversity in conservation planning, specifically the use of <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> and similarly derived land classifications. However, the need for explicit modeling of geographic distance in conservation planning is clearly indicated. 19 page(s...|$|R

5|$|The airport {{had very}} poor {{operating}} conditions. Whenever an aircraft was to land, the cranes at the shipyard {{had to be}} moved to allow sufficient clearance. Conversely, the airport {{could not be used}} when ships were launched. The industrial buildings were located just next to the taxiway. The control tower was located such that it did not have visual sight of the entire runway. The surrounding terrain, consisting of deep fjords, mountains and a town, made it impossible to install an instrument <b>landing</b> <b>system.</b> This again meant that the airport could only be served during daylight. The airport never received a permanent operating license.|$|E
5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted from ground beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (instrument <b>landing</b> <b>system)</b> mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E
5|$|Airport {{security}} was introduced on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} terminal capacity and the terminal had to be expanded. Makeshift solutions were used, such as plywood boards to allocate people through the security check. In late 2004, the airport started planning an all-new terminal building, as the old terminal was deemed both too small and out of date. Construction of the NOK-115-million terminal started on 24 October 2006. As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based <b>landing</b> <b>system,</b> on 29 October 2007. The new terminal opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored indoors and included a new helicopter terminal. Thon Hotel Torghatten opened in October 2009 and an airport surveillance radar was installed in 2010, making Brønnøysund the first regional airport in Norway to have one.|$|E
40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>system</b> {{changes are}} central to the food {{security}} challenge. <b>Land</b> <b>system</b> science can contribute to sustainable solutions by an integrated analysis of land availability and the assessment of the tradeoffs associated with agricultural expansion and land use intensification.

5|$|In March 1985, Partnair {{was granted}} {{concession}} for scheduled services from Fornebu via Notodden to Stavanger. The route was started on 15 August using a ten-seat Beechcraft 200 Super King Air and flew twice a day, {{five days a}} week. This route was made possible after an instrument <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> was installed at the airport. The NOK2 million cost had been paid for by Norsk Hydro, while Tinfos had paid NOK100,000 for new landing lights. The upgrades also included a new terminal, which included a café in the second story and seating for 14 people. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyrå, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian State Railways. After five months, Partnair had lost NOK1.2 million on the route. In average, they were selling three to four tickets per flight to Stavanger, and one to Oslo. From March 1986, the leg from Notodden to Oslo was dropped and the service to Stavanger reduced. However, the route proved unprofitable and was eventually terminated later the same month.|$|E
5|$|Norving {{operated}} at {{the airport}} until 1990, when the route {{was taken over by}} Widerøe, who initially used the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. The Ministry of Transport and Communications announced in February 1993 that they were considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). Along with Båtsfjord Airport and Vardø Airport, Svartnes, Hasvik Airport was one of three regional airports in Finnmark with government-subsidized routes which did not receive state operating grants. In December Widerøe articulated that Hasvik Airport did not meet the demands for future operation as it lacked proper instruments and did not have an asphalt runway. Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash 8 they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. Additional navigation aids were installed in 1993 and the runway was asphalted in 1995, subsequently resulting in Dash 8 services being introduced. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997. The runway lights were upgraded in 2008 and 2009, followed by the installation of the Global Positioning System-based <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> SCAT-I.|$|E

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>systems</b> are {{described}} based on various characteristics, including land cover composition and agricultural production. However, {{it is uncertain}} to what extent livestock, particularly monogastric livestock, determines <b>land</b> <b>systems.</b> We included monogastrics in a <b>land</b> <b>system</b> classification, and statistically analyzed the land cover composition and agricultural production of otherwise similar <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> with and without monogastric livestock. The results indicate that <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> with monogastrics are statistically different from {{their counterparts in the}} classification without monogastrics in terms of grassland area and crop yields, but are less different in terms of tree area, crop area, and ruminant livestock production. We then used a <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> map that includes monogastrics in the classification and a similar map that does not include monogastrics to project future changes in a novel manner that integrates livestock as a determinant of <b>land</b> <b>systems.</b> The results show that including monogastrics in otherwise similar projections yields less cropland intensification and more cropland expansion in several world regions, including Northern Africa and the Middle East. Other regions, such as Europe and Australia, were characterized by less decrease or more increase in tree area in the application with monogastrics, mainly due to the occurrence of open forests with monogastrics. This study prompts a call for improved characterization of <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> for <b>land</b> use and cover change (LUCC) assessments in order to better represent LUCC driven by monogastric livestock...|$|R
25|$|In {{looking for}} applied {{research}} opportunities, Wild {{discovered that the}} Australian Department of Civil Aviation had been considering a call by the International Civil Aviation Organization for member states to propose a new system to replace the longstanding Instrument <b>Landing</b> <b>System.</b> He very quickly formed {{the concept of a}} microwave <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> and applied his energies to the project with great enthusiasm.

40|$|Land cover data {{is widely}} used for the design and {{monitoring}} of land use policies despite the incapability {{of this type of}} data to represent multiple land uses and land management activities within the same landscape. In this study, we operationalized the concept of <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> for the case of the Lao PDR (Laos). Distinct <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> like shifting cultivation and plantations (land concessions) cannot be fully captured by land cover inventories alone, in spite of their relevance for land use policies. Using a decision tree and a matrix approach, we integrated several datasets for the period 2010 / 11, including land cover, an agricultural census and a land concession inventory. We selected thresholds for distinguishing <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> based on an expert survey. The resulting 17 <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> cover the whole territory of Laos and represent landscapes of 2 × 2 km pixel size. The largest area is occupied by smallholder agriculture <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> intertwined with forests. Only 27 % of the territory are agriculturally undisturbed, dense forest systems. The assessment can serve as a basis to identify areas that could change shortly and locates the full range of <b>land</b> <b>systems,</b> from <b>land</b> concessions to smallholder systems, in one, integrated spatial assessment. The <b>land</b> <b>system</b> representation can help policy makers to link <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> to the diversity of different stakeholders and their backgrounds and support discussions about ecologic and socio-economic consequences of different land uses within a landscape...|$|R
40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>systems</b> are characterised by many {{feedbacks}} {{that can}} result in complex system behaviour. We defined feedbacks as the two-way influences between the <b>land</b> use <b>system</b> and a related system (e. g., climate, soils and markets), {{both of which are}} encompassed by the <b>land</b> <b>system.</b> <b>Land</b> models that include feedbacks thus probably more accurately mimic how <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> respond to, e. g., policy or climate change. However, representing feedbacks in land models is a challenge. We reviewed articles incorporating feedbacks into land models and analysed each with predefined indicators. We found that (1) most modelled feedbacks couple <b>land</b> use <b>systems</b> with transport, soil and market systems, while only a few include feedbacks between land use and social systems or climate systems; (2) equation-based land use models that follow a top-down approach prevail; and (3) feedbacks’ effects on system behaviour remain relatively unexplored. We recommend that <b>land</b> <b>system</b> modellers (1) consider feedbacks between <b>land</b> use <b>systems</b> and social systems; (2) adopt (bottom-up) approaches suited to incorporating spatial heterogeneity and better representing land use decision-making; and (3) pay more attention to nonlinear system behaviour and its implications for <b>land</b> <b>system</b> management and policy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>systems</b> are {{the result}} of human {{interactions}} with the natural environment.
