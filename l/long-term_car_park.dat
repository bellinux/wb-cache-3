25|$|Sydney Airport has road {{connections}} in all directions. Southern Cross Drive (M1), a motorway, {{is the fastest}} link with the city centre. The M5 South Western Motorway (including the M5 East Freeway) links the airport with the south-western suburbs of Sydney. A ring road runs around the airport consisting of Airport Drive, Qantas Drive, General Holmes Drive, M5 East Freeway and Marsh Street. General Holmes Drive features a tunnel under the main north-south runway and three taxiways {{as well as providing}} access to an aircraft viewing area. Inside the airport a part-ring road– Ross Smith Avenue (named after Ross MacPherson Smith)– connects the Domestic Terminal with the control tower, the general aviation area, car-rental company storage yards, <b>long-term</b> <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> heliport, various retail operations and a hotel. A perimeter road runs inside the secured area for authorised vehicles only.|$|E
50|$|Besides the short-stay car {{parking in}} front of the main terminal, Terminal 5 is also served by {{separate}} business and long-term car parks. These are accessed from the airport's perimeter road and are some distance from the terminal. The <b>long-term</b> <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is linked to the terminal by bus, and the business car park is served by an elevated personal rapid transit system (see below).|$|E
50|$|The airport {{has four}} parking areas. Three are <b>long-term</b> <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> {{for a total}} of 564 places. In front of the {{terminal}} building there are an additional 50 parking spaces available for short term parking.|$|R

50|$|The New Markham Vale Loop Road {{has been}} {{completed}} and opens up the former Markham coal field areas to development, linking the town to a new junction (29A) on the M1 motorway, this junction opened in early July 2008. This is part funded by European Union regeneration money. The scheme also reinstates part of the former Chesterfield Canal which crosses the route. There is a long term project to reinstate the canal from Chesterfield to Kiveton where it currently terminates. Sections from Chesterfield to Brimington were reinstated as part of previous stages of the Chesterfield Bypass and opencast schemes on part of the former Staveley Coal and Iron Company site {{which was part of}} British Steel Corporation following Nationalisation. The new Staveley Town Basin was officially opened on 30 June 2012 and forms the centre piece of the imaginative redevelopment of the Chesterfield Canal in Staveley. The basin is designed to provide facilities to enable the economic development of the isolated section in advance of full restoration. It will provide secure short- and <b>long-term</b> moorings, slipway, <b>car</b> <b>parking,</b> cycle racks, toilets and showers as well as a large open play area which can also be used for major waterway events and festivals.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in the {{immediate}} area for the railway station. They are operated by the railway <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> and National <b>Car</b> <b>Parks</b> (NCP).|$|R
50|$|Parking at {{the centre}} is free, however some parking has a three-hour time limit. Out of the 6300 <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> {{approximately}} 2700 are undercover. Along the southern {{fringe of the}} shopping centre is a two deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with centre entrances to both levels scattered throughout. A two deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is also located {{at the rear of}} the centre with entrances to the Gallery North and Loft malls. The majority of disabled <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are located on the top deck of this <b>car</b> <b>park</b> near the Loft entrance. A four level multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is located near Village Cinemas in Knox O-Zone along with open air street parking scattered throughout the complex. An overflow <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is located at the very east of the centre behind the four level multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> with an extended overflow grass area adjacent to this <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
40|$|Large off-street <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are {{traditionally}} modelled as self-standing traffic zones representing origins/destinations in standard network assignment models. However, such a treatment precludes the drivers from choosing alternative <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> as it assumes the <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are their final destinations. This paper discusses {{the feasibility of}} bringing <b>car</b> <b>park</b> choice {{and the effects of}} capacity within a traditional network assignment model. The search time within <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> depends on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy and can be represented by a flow-delay type function on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy/capacity. This research calibrates the search-time function based on practically observed occupancy and search time at two city-centre <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in Leeds, England. The analysis follows a simple fixed search-time method as well as a sophisticated variable search-time method. The results are validated against the observed occupancies at the <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> A <b>car</b> <b>park</b> specific constant was introduced to account for the unobserved preference for a given type of parking facility. In a multiperiod assignment, when <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancies are passed on dynamically, both fixed and variable search-time approaches are seen as an improvement over the standard approach, with the variable search time outperforming the fixed time approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> {{system in}} Malaysia usually required the car drivers to search an empty parking {{space in the}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without providing detail direction toward the available parking space. As the result, drivers may waste {{a lot of time}} and unnecessary energy while they turn around in the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without direction and may cause car traffic congestion in parking space. This paper investigates the problems of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system in Malaysia and finally proposed a Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System using low cost SMS service. The implementation of SMS service into the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system enable drivers to receive information regarding the availability of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces. In this system, the drivers can resend SMS to request for new assignment of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces if they fail to get the previous assigned destination. This paper demonstrates the design and implementation of Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System (WMCPS) using SMS services by Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm in finding the nearest parking space for drivers. The stimulation results reveal the intelligence of this system can efficiently allocate and utilize the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces inside the <b>car</b> <b>park...</b>|$|R
25|$|Travellers by car {{can reach}} the airport via the M2 motorway. The airport {{operates}} four <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> three on-site <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> and one off-site <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> The on-site short stay and main <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are situated within easy {{walking distance of the}} terminal building and an on demand courtesy bus operates to and from the on-site long stay <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> The off-site short or long stay <b>car</b> <b>park</b> called 'Park and Fly' is located just before the main entrance to the airport and is also serviced by a courtesy bus.|$|R

25|$|<b>Car</b> <b>parking</b> {{charges were}} {{introduced}} to the <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> surrounding the shopping centre in 2004. The centre has 5 large <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> providing approximately 4,000 parking spaces.

50|$|With {{perpendicular}} parking, {{also known}} as bay <b>parking,</b> <b>cars</b> are <b>parked</b> side to side, perpendicular to an aisle, curb, or wall. This type of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> fits more <b>cars</b> per length of road (or curb) than parallel parking, and is therefore commonly used in <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> lots and <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> structures.|$|R
