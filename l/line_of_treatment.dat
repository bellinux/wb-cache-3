5|$|Within the osteopathic medical curriculum, {{manipulative}} {{treatment is}} taught as an adjunctive measure to other biomedical interventions {{for a number}} of disorders and diseases. However, a 2001 survey of osteopathic physicians found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT on less than 5% of their patients. The survey follows many indicators that osteopathic physicians have become more like M.D. physicians in every respect —few perform OMT, and most prescribe medications or suggest surgery as the first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{present the}} {{treatment}} rationale and study {{design of the}} AvaALL (MO 22097; ClinicalTrials: NCT 01351415) trial, a multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-arm, phase IIIb study. Patients with advanced non-squamous non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed after four to six cycles <b>of</b> first-line <b>treatment</b> with bevacizumab plus a platinum-based doublet and {{a minimum of two}} cycles of bevacizumab (monotherapy) maintenance treatment will be randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to one of two study arms. Patients treated on arm A will receive bevacizumab 7. 5 or 15 mg/kg intravenously (I. V.) on day 1, every 21 days plus, investigator's choice of agents indicated for use in second-line (limited to pemetrexed, docetaxel, or erlotinib) and subsequent <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> Patients treated on arm B, will receive investigator's choice of agents alone indicated for use in second-line and subsequent <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> but no further bevacizumab treatment. The primary endpoint of this study is overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include the 6 -month, 12 -month, and 18 -month OS rates, progression-free survival, and time to progression at second and third progressive disease (PD), response rate, disease control rates, and duration of response at second and third PD. Additionally, efficacy in the subgroup of patients with adenocarcinoma, and the safety <b>of</b> bevacizumab <b>treatment</b> across multiple <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> will be assessed.

25|$|A {{combination}} of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy has consistently {{been shown to}} be the most effective <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> for people diagnosed with dysthymia. Working with a psychotherapist to address the causes and effects of the disorder, in addition to taking antidepressants to help eliminate the symptoms, can be extremely beneficial. This combination is often the preferred method of treatment for those who have dysthymia. Looking at various studies involving treatment for dysthymia, 75% of people responded positively to a {{combination of}} cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy, whereas only 48% of people responded positively to just CBT or medication alone.|$|E
25|$|The stimulants are {{the first}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in {{patients}} without tic disorders. Current prescribed stimulant medications include: methylphenidate (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and guanfacine), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine and nortriptyline), and newer antidepressants (bupropion and venlafaxine). There have been case reports of tics worsening with bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin). There is good empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy {{for the use of}} desipramine, bupropion and atomoxetine (Strattera).|$|E
25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus {{and treatment of}} metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E

25|$|When {{compared}} to psychotropic medications, review {{studies have found}} CBT-alone to be as effective for treating less severe forms of depression and anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), tics, substance abuse (with the exception of opioid use disorder), eating disorders, and borderline personality disorder, and it is often recommended in combination with medications for treating other conditions, such as severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder, opioid addiction, bipolar, and psychotic disorders. In addition, CBT is recommended as the first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> {{for the majority of}} psychological disorders in children and adolescents, including aggression and conduct disorder. Researchers have found that other bona fide therapeutic interventions were equally effective for treating certain conditions in adults, but CBT was found to be superior in treating most disorders. Along with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), CBT is recommended in treatment guidelines as a psychosocial treatment of choice, and CBT and IPT are the only psychosocial interventions that psychiatry residents are mandated to be trained in.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{people with}} dysthymia will seek out {{treatment}} not necessarily because of depressed mood, but rather due to increasing {{levels of stress}} or because of personal difficulties that may be situation-related. This is hypothesized to be because of the chronic nature of the disorder, and how depressed mood is often {{thought to be a}} characterological pattern for the individual with the condition. Thus, it is only when the person experiences increasing stress that he or she thinks to go to some sort of trained professional for symptom relief. It is usually through the administration of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV that dysthymia is first diagnosed. At this point, {{with the help of a}} trained professional, a certain <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> is often discussed and then selected. It is important to consider all factors in the person's life that may be affected when deciding on a particular course of treatment. Additionally, if one method of treatment does not particularly work for a certain individual, it may be helpful to try something else.|$|E

Outside of the comedic field, the sort of bold play with sound exemplified by Melodie der Welt and Le Million would be pursued very rarely in commercial production. Hollywood, in particular, incorporated sound into a reliable system of genre-based moviemaking, in which the formal possibilities of the new medium were subordinated to the traditional goals of star affirmation and straightforward storytelling.

2500|$|Initial {{treatment}} involves addressing any existing {{infections that}} may have occurred due to the broken state of the skin. Existing wounds are treated with warm compresses, non-adherent (non-stick) dressing, and topical antibiotic ointment. Immunosuppressive agents are administered in attempt to decrease blistering; this is not often effective. The first medication given aiming to heal the wounds are high dose corticosteroids. This is followed by steroid sparing agents [...] which may reduce steroid intake and therefore lessen the side effects. Skin lesions {{are more likely to}} respond to this <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> than mucosal lesions. However, a high level of caution is advised in patients with a confirmed malignancy, where immunosuppression is vital and dictates treatment options. If the initial therapy fails to control the symptoms of PNP, and the condition of the patient deteriorates, a more aggressive approach may be necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{prescribing}} {{medication for}} these conditions which often resolve spontaneously, recommendations {{have pointed to}} improved skin hygiene, good hydration via fluids, good nutrition, and installation of padded bed rails with use of proper mattresses. [...] Pharmacological treatments include the typical neuroleptic agents such as fluphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol and perphenazine which block dopamine receptors; these are the first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> for hemiballismus. [...] Quetiapine, sulpiride and olanzapine, the atypical neuroleptic agents, {{are less likely to}} yield drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. [...] Tetrabenazine works by depleting presynaptic dopamine and blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors, while reserpine depletes the presynaptic catecholamine and serotonin stores; both of these drugs treat hemiballismus successfully but may cause depression, hypotension and parkinsonism. [...] Sodium valproate and clonazepam have been successful in a limited number of cases. Stereotactic ventral intermediate thalamotomy and use of a thalamic stimulator {{have been shown to be}} effective in treating these conditions.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been alleged that the way the {{categories}} of the DSM are structured, {{as well as the}} substantial expansion of the number of categories, are representative of an increasing medicalization of human nature, which may be attributed to disease mongering by psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies, the power and influence of the latter having grown dramatically in recent decades. Of the authors who selected and defined the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, roughly half have had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry at one time, raising the prospect of a direct conflict of interest. The same article concludes that the connections between panel members and the drug companies were particularly strong in those diagnoses where drugs are the first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, where 100% of the panel members had financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry.

40|$|Background: The ongoing {{introduction}} of novel therapies for MM provides clinicians and patients various treatment options in numerous <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> Understanding the current treatment practices and the outcomes in different age groups is of vital importance to understand whether these new treatment {{should be used}} in patients from all age groups and where options for treatment optimization exist. Aims: (i) To describe treatment patterns and corresponding outcomes in terms of response, time to next therapy (TTNT) and overall survival (OS) of Nordic Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients with a focus on age. (ii) To investigate whether age affected the patients' probability of being treated with a conventional (e. g. melphelan prednisone) or a novel treatment (bortezomib, thalidomide or lenalidomide) and whether this treatment choice affected OS in the elderly. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on incident 2960 MMpatients from 24 hospitals in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The database contained information on patient baseline characteristics such as age, gender, international staging system (ISS) stage, albumin, creatine, MM type and response, TTNT and OS over eight <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> The patients were stratified over three age groups...|$|R

6000|$|It was on Christmas-day that Sir Peter Mancrudy, {{the highest}} {{authority}} on such {{matters in the}} west of England, was sent for to see Miss Stanbury; and Sir Peter had acknowledged that things were very serious. He took Dorothy on one side, {{and told her that}} Mr. Martin, the ordinary practitioner, had treated the case, no doubt, quite wisely throughout; that there was not a word to be said against Mr. Martin, whose experience was great, and whose discretion was undeniable; but, nevertheless,--at least it seemed to Dorothy that this was the only meaning to be attributed to Sir Peter's words,--Mr. Martin had in this case taken one <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> when he ought to have taken another. The plan of action was undoubtedly changed, and Mr. Martin became very fidgety, and ordered nothing without Sir Peter's sanction. Miss Stanbury was suffering from bronchitis, and a complication of diseases about her throat and chest. Barty Burgess declared to more than one acquaintance in the little parlour behind the bank, that she would go on drinking four or five glasses of new port wine every day, in direct opposition to Martin's request. Camilla French heard the report, and repeated it to her lover, and perhaps another person or two, with an expression of her assured conviction that it must be false,--at any rate, as regarded the fifth glass. Mrs. MacHugh, who saw Martha daily, was much frightened. The peril of such a friend disturbed equally the repose and the pleasures of her life. Mrs. Clifford was often at Miss Stanbury's bed-side,--and would have sat there reading for hours together, had she not been made to understand by Martha that Miss Stanbury preferred that Miss Dorothy should read to her. The sick woman received the Sacrament weekly,--not from Mr. Gibson, but from the hands of another minor canon; and, though she never would admit her own danger, or allow others to talk to her of it, it was known to them all that she admitted it to herself because she had, with much personal annoyance, caused a codicil to be added to her will. [...] "As you didn't marry that man," [...] she said to Dorothy, [...] "I must change it again." [...] It was in vain that Dorothy begged her not to trouble herself with such thoughts. [...] "That's trash," [...] said Miss Stanbury, angrily. [...] "A person who has it is bound to trouble himself about it. You don't suppose I'm afraid of dying;--do you?" [...] she added. Dorothy answered her with some commonplace,--declaring how strongly they all expected to see her as well as ever. [...] "I'm not a bit afraid to die," [...] said the old woman, wheezing, struggling with such voice as she possessed; [...] "I'm not afraid of it, and I don't think I shall die this time; but I'm not going to have mistakes when I'm gone."

40|$|Typical regimens for {{advanced}} metastatic stage IIIB/IV {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) consist <b>of</b> multiple <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> We present an adaptive reinforcement learning approach to discover optimal individualized treatment regimens from {{a specially designed}} clinical trial (a “clinical reinforcement trial”) <b>of</b> an experimental <b>treatment</b> for patients with advanced NSCLC who have not been treated previously with systemic therapy. In addition to the complexity of the problem of selecting optimal compounds for first and second-line treatments based on prognostic factors, another primary scientific goal is to determine the optimal time to initiate second-line therapy, either immediately or delayed after induction therapy, yielding the longest overall survival time. A reinforcement learning method called Q-learning is utilized which involves learning an optimal policy from patient data generated from the clinical reinforcement trial. Approximating the Q-function with time-indexed parameters can be achieved by using a modification of support vector regression which can utilize censored data. Within this framework, a simulation study shows that the procedure can extract optimal strategies for two <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> directly from clinical data without relying on the identification of any accurate mathematical models. In addition, we demonstrate that the design reliably selects the best initial time for second-line therapy while taking into account the heterogeneity of NSCLC across patients...|$|R

Detailed data on systemic drug use were available for 261 patients (17 %) with OC. In first-line <b>treatment,</b> 87 % <b>of</b> the patients (227 / 261) received platinum-based chemotherapy. Of the 161 patients receiving second-line treatment, 101 patients (63 %) received platinum-based chemotherapy. In third line, this was 51 % (53 / 103).
