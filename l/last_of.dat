5|$|A {{spin-off}} prequel show, First of the Summer Wine, premiered on BBC1 in 1988. The new programme {{was written}} by Roy Clarke and used different actors to follow {{the activities of the}} principal characters from <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> the Summer Wine {{in the months leading up}} to World War II. Unlike its mother show, First of the Summer Wine was not filmed in Holmfirth. Period music was used instead of Ronnie Hazlehurst's score to create a more World War II era atmosphere. New supporting characters were added to those from <b>Last</b> <b>of</b> the Summer Wine. Peter Sallis and Jonathan Linsley were the only actors from the original series to appear in the spin-off: Sallis played the father of his own character from the original show and Linsley appeared during the second series as a different character.|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of timing <b>of</b> the <b>last</b> dose <b>of</b> split nitrogen application on agronomic traits, and nutrient contents of sugarcane. The study was carried out at the National Agricultural Research Centre Islamabad during 1996 - 97. Application timing <b>of</b> the <b>last</b> dose <b>of</b> nitrogen did not affect early stalk population, millable canes, stalk height, stalk girth and total soluble solids (TSS). Application <b>of</b> <b>last</b> dose <b>of</b> N at early stage (<b>last</b> week <b>of</b> March) produced significantly lower cane yield than other timings of N application. Maximum cane yield of 146 t ha - 1 was produced when the <b>last</b> dose <b>of</b> N was applied {{during the first week}} of June. Cane yield produced with the application <b>of</b> <b>last</b> dose <b>of</b> N either the mid May or the first week of July produced statistically similar cane yield that was produced with the application <b>of</b> <b>last</b> dose <b>of</b> N during first week of June. Sugar recovery was significantly decreased with the late application (July 1 st week) <b>of</b> the <b>last</b> dose <b>of</b> N. Maximum sugar yield (15. 70 tha - 1) was produced when the <b>last</b> dose <b>of</b> N was applied during the middle of May. P, K, Zn, and B contents were not affected with the timing of application of nitrogen. However, Mg contents of the tissue increased significantly as the application <b>of</b> the <b>last</b> dose <b>of</b> nitrogen was delayed...|$|R
