40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} an electricity consumer {{equipped with a}} perfect battery, who needs to satisfy a non-elastic load, subject to external control signals.

Furthermore, we show that whenever a feasible schedule exists, we can explicitly define an online (causal) feasible schedule. (2) For a given arrival curve characterizing the load and a given service curve characterizing the control, we compute a sufficient battery size that ensures existence of an online feasible schedule. For an arrival curve determined from a real measured trace, we numerically characterize <b>the</b> sufficient <b>battery</b> size for various types of service curves. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> topic <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> {{has been}} given much attention. With the {{development}} and rapid improvement <b>of</b> transistors, <b>the</b> power requirement <b>of</b> our electronics are quickly becoming higher and higher. Unlike Moore’s law, since <b>the</b> commercialization <b>of</b> its newest iteration, <b>the</b> lithium ion <b>battery</b> (LIB) <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> technology has shown only incremental improvement. Popular fashionable companies such as Tesla has developed electric vehicles with acceptable mileage of around 400 km per change. Even with Elon Musk’s ambitious goals, championing {{the change in the}} whole automotive industry, scientific barriers are met as <b>the</b> theoretical limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> materials are reached. To answer to this, researchers around the globe have revisited old and thought to be too difficult to implement technologies such as <b>the</b> lithium sulfur <b>battery</b> (LIS). A LIS possesses a sulfur cathode and a lithium anode, which leads to one key advantage to LIBs, sulfur can store/bond to lithium at much higher ratios than traditional cathodes in LIBs. Boasting a theoretical energy density of about 5 times that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current LIB, this technology has the potential to ultimately surpass and replace a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LIB out in the market. Unfortunately, the reason it was given up decades ago was due to its debilitating problems. First and foremost, sulfur is a very good insulator making it difficult to efficiently deliver electrons to its reaction sites. Furthermore, during discharge and charge sulfur will dissolve into the electrolyte, upon deposition on insulating spots in the cell it disconnects itself from the circuit. In short the LIS are not durable and suffers from terrible cycle life. To address these challenges, researchers have develop many clever engineering designs such as modification to the electrodes, electrolyte, separator, anode all of which have shown great promise on the lab scale resulting in LIS with impressive performance surpassing LIBs. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> this thesis will be to develop a type of nitrogen doped porous carbon material that will serve as a modifier for the cathode improving its performance over bare sulfur cathodes. A first discharge of 1060 mAh g- 1 was achieved at 0. 2 C and stabilized to ~ 860 mAh g- 1, a ~ 81 % retention in capacity over 100 cycles. This material also offered significant improvements in rate performance. It was able to discharge at 5 C delivering ~ 600 mAh g- 1. Both the cycle stability and rate performance illustrates <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> using nitrogen doping for LIS. In order for LIS to reach the market the one key parameter has to be addressed first and that is <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> sulfur in <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b> Many <b>of</b> publications have displayed near theoretical/ideal performances, seemingly revolutionizing <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> industry, but unfortunately at impractically low loadings. Continuing from the low loading high performance electrodes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> this thesis, <b>the</b> work in the second part will improve upon the porous carbon material allowing its application in high loading electrodes. It was quickly discovered that the nano-sized nitrogen doped porous carbon was unable to yield a robust electrode at higher loadings. Cracks and pinholes formed throughout the electrode leading to <b>the</b> eventual flaking/delamination <b>of</b> material. Larger nitrogen-doped porous carbon was synthesized through a simple addition <b>of</b> NaCl into <b>the</b> synthesis procedure. This aggregated the smaller polymer particles together forming micron size particles. Larger nitrogen doped porous carbon easily formed thick electrodes {{while at the same time}} achieved exceptional electrochemical performance. With a discharge rate of 0. 1 C a specific capacity of 1300 mAh g- 1 was reached stabilizing to 1050 mAh g- 1 after 50 cycles. Moreover, at 0. 2 C and 0. 5 C discharge rates this material delivered ~ 1000 mAh g- 1 and 900 mAh g- 1 respectively on first discharge...|$|R

5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> and <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in <b>the</b> reservoir <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> a severe side impact away from <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> pack, reducing <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> intrusion into <b>the</b> pack.|$|R
30|$|It can be {{seen that}} <b>the</b> output power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> does not have the sudden and large {{variations}} because the ultra-capacitors buffer the power fluctuations, and in particular they deliver power to compensate the WT cut-off due to high winds at 14 : 00. These operating results for the HESS verify <b>the</b> complementary advantages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> and <b>the</b> ultra-capacitors, which help to prolong <b>the</b> life span <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
25|$|Another area of {{research}} focuses on <b>the</b> prevention <b>of</b> thermal runaway in <b>batteries.</b> <b>The</b> researchers coated the anode or separator layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> with microspheres sensitive to heat. An increase in temperature causes the microspheres to melt, blocking transmission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lithium ions and causing <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> to shut down. Microspheres of both polyethylene and paraffin wax were tested with CR2032 Li-ion batteries and demonstrated both successful operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> at normal temperatures and shutdown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> at temperatures below those at which <b>the</b> <b>battery's</b> separator would become damaged.|$|R
