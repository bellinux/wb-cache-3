50|$|The {{basic type}} {{consists}} of a steel cylinder body, a plunger on the top, a spring, a pair of step-cut locks, and a spreader bar. A special type of pliers are used to push in the spring-loaded plunger. This pushes down on the step-cut locks, which pushes {{them away from the}} spreader bars and allows them to come together. This allows the user to slip the <b>locking</b> <b>jaws</b> through a hole made through multiple sheets of material. When the plunger is released the spring pulls the <b>locking</b> <b>jaws</b> back towards the spreader bar, which separates the two jaws. The material sheets are then squeezed in between the step-cut area and the steel cylinder. This keeps the holes in the separate sheets aligned.|$|E

50|$|Both sexes are {{extremely}} territorial and aggressive. Males, however, are particularly agrressive not only towards other males but also towards any organism or object that the anole perceives to be a threat. Males that encounter intruders in their territory will generally perform elaborate bodily displays, extending and recoiling the dewlap and performing various head bobs or pushups. This is usually done {{well before the}} intruder manages to get within close proximity of the defender and the display is often successful at warding off the intruder. However, if the intruding male is persistent then a fight may ensue with the males <b>locking</b> <b>jaws</b> and biting at each other's extremities until either male either gives up and flees or dies of exhaustion. Fights may also prove fatal if a serious wound, such as an amputated limb, occurs and subsequently becomes infected.This species attempts to bite when handled and its powerful jaws are capable of breaking skin. It may also display at a potential predator or captor if one is sighted. Like many reptiles the mouth of this species harbors Salmonella and an infection may occur if a bite breaks the skin.|$|E

40|$|Background: Bevacizumab a {{recombinant}} humanized {{monoclonal antibody}} was approved in 2004 by US FDA for metastatic colorectal cancer. It {{is reported to}} cause potentially serious toxicities including severe hypertension, proteinuria, and congestive heart failure. Aim: To correlate adverse event tetany {{with the use of}} bevacizumab. Materials and Methods : World Health Organization&#x 2032;s Uppsala Monitoring Centre, Sweden, for reporting of adverse drug reactions from all over the world, identified 7 cases with tetany-related symptoms to bevacizumab from four different countries. These 7 patients reported to UMC database developed adverse events described as musculoskeletal stiffness (1), muscle spasm (1), muscle cramps (1), <b>lock</b> <b>jaw</b> or jaw stiffness (4), and hypertonia (1), with hypocalcaemia. Results: After detailed study of the possible mechanism of actions of bevacizumab and factors causing tetany, it is proposed that there is a possibility of tetany by bevacizumab, which may occur by interfering with calcium metabolism. Resorption of bone through osteoclasts by affecting VEGF may interfere with calcium metabolism. Another possibility of tetany may be due to associated hypomagnesaemia, hypokalemia, or hyponatremia. Conclusions: Tetany should be considered as a one of the signs. Patient on bevacizumab should carefully watch for tetany-related symptoms and calcium and magnesium levels for their safety...|$|R

40|$|Features of somatisation {{have been}} shown to predict the onset of {{widespread}} body pain. This study aims to determine to what extent persons with orofacial pain syndromes share these features and to what extent they are uniquely related to oral mechanical factors. We have conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey in the South-East Cheshire area of the United Kingdom involving 2504 individuals aged 18 – 65 years. All participants completed a postal questionnaire which enquired about the occurrence of both orofacial pain and widespread body pain. It also enquired about potential risk factors for one or both conditions. In total, 473 subjects (23 %) reported orofacial pain only, 123 (6 %) widespread pain only, while 85 (4 %) reported both. The number reporting both was significantly higher than would be expected if the symptoms were independent (P< 0. 001). Several oral mechanical factors were significantly associated with both orofacial pain and widespread body pain (grinding teeth, clicking jaw, missing teeth), while two (facial trauma, <b>locking</b> <b>jaw)</b> were specifically related to orofacial pain. Both pain syndromes were associated equally with high levels of psychological distress, indicators of somatisation and maladaptive response to illness. These results suggest that orofacial pain syndromes may commonly be a manifestation of the process of somatisation and the excess reporting of some local mechanical factors amongst persons with these symptoms, may not be uniquely associated with pain in the orofacial region.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Otogenic tetanus is {{a vaccine}} {{preventable}} disease {{which continues to}} be of public health significance. Objectives: To evaluate patients with otogenic tetanus and identify the factors that predisposes patients to it. Methodology: This is a 16 -year retrospective review of all patients managed for otogenic tetanus at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University College Hospital, Ibadan. The essential clinical data collected include demographic data, clinical presentations, tetanus immunization history, duration of hospital admission, management and outcome. Results: There were 66 subjects made up of 45 (68. 2 %) males and 21 (31. 8 %) females. Their age ranged between 2 and 65 years, mean of 7. 7 years but the under 5 years constituted the majority, 56. 1 %. All patients presented with ear discharge, <b>lock</b> <b>jaw</b> and spasms. The onset of symptoms ranged between 3 and 8 days {{with a mean of}} 4. 3 ± 3. 3 days. Only 21. 2 % had history of completed childhood tetanus immunisation. No patient had booster shots. About 98 % had history of use of herbs, charcoal, honey, cigarette, methylated spirit or deodorant in the discharging ear. All were managed with antibiotic ear dressing, tetanus toxoid, human tetanus immunoglobulin, antibiotic therapy and sedative but only 3 % had airway management. The duration of hospital admission ranged from 18 days to 105 days and there were 12. 1 % death. Conclusion: Otogenic tetanus is still a major problem in developing countries and this can be prevented if recommended childhood tetanus vaccination and booster shots regimen are properly taken. Health education on ear hygiene and care of the ear may prevent this disease...|$|R
60|$|The dreadful {{paroxysm}} of insensibility and seeming {{death in}} a case of apoplexy is supposed to be occasioned by a pressure of blood upon the brain, and the remedy, according to the practice of those days, was to bleed the patient immediately to relieve this pressure, and to blister or cauterize the head, to excite a high external action as a means of subduing the disease within. It was the law of England that such violent remedies could not be resorted to {{in the case of the}} sovereign without authority previously obtained from the council. They were guilty of high treason who should presume to do so. This was a case, however, which admitted of no delay. The attendants put their own lives at hazard to serve that of the king. They bled him with a penknife, and heated the iron for the cautery. The alarm was spread throughout the palace, producing universal confusion. The queen was summoned, and came as soon as possible to the scene. She found her husband sitting senseless in a chair, a basin of blood by his side, his countenance death-like and ghastly, while some of the attendants were attempting to force the <b>locked</b> <b>jaws</b> apart, that they might administer a potion, and others were applying a red hot iron to the patient's head, in a desperate endeavor to arouse and bring back again into action the benumbed and stupefied sensibilities.
