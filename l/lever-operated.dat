5|$|Launched in 1987 {{priced at}} £350, Artemiz is the {{flagship}} tonearm whose design {{was also a}} break from established conventions. The arm and headshell is a one-piece construction; the large-gauge aluminium tube interference-fitted at one end into a massive yoke that is the bearing. The tube is flat {{at the other end}} to provide for mounting the cartridge. The arm is finished in a matt resonant paint. Unusually, there is no finger lift for cueing but the arm is fitted with a conventional <b>lever-operated</b> lift/lower assembly.|$|E
5|$|Military squads can be {{assigned}} to a barracks to train in and a uniform (armor and a weapon) can be chosen. Squads can be directly commanded to attack enemies. Crossbows {{can be made for}} ranged attacks and a range with targets can be constructed for training. Walls can be carved into fortifications and be used by ranged-units during attacks. Training areas can be made to train war animals like dogs. Players can use traps and engineering in addition to training an army. Traps can be made by constructing mechanisms and using metal or wood to construct large weapons like spikes, ax blades or cages. More complex <b>lever-operated</b> and pressure plate-triggering trap components are available.|$|E
25|$|Later hidden {{headlamps}} require {{one or more}} vacuum-operated servos and reservoirs, with associated {{plumbing and}} linkage, or electric motors, geartrains and linkages to raise the lamps to an exact position to assure correct aiming despite ice, snow and age. Some early hidden headlamps, such as those on the Saab Sonett III, used a <b>lever-operated</b> mechanical linkage to raise the headlamps into position.|$|E

50|$|A {{door handle}} is an {{attached}} object or mechanism used to manually open or close a door. In the United States, a door handle generally refers to any fixed or <b>lever-operated</b> door latch device. The term door knob or doorknob tends {{to refer to}} round operating mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Grigoryants built a <b>lever-operated</b> gurney {{which made}} it easier for staff to lift the {{patients}} for the transport purposes. Due to post-war rehabilitation and slow economic growth in remote areas of the Soviet Union at the time, such rudimentary necessities were not yet in use in Namangan or its surrounding provincial areas at a time.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} 12 kV switchgear used open switches {{operated by}} 3 ft wooden sticks. This arrangement was quite dangerous by modern standards {{and resulted in}} one fatality and several near miss accidents. In 1902 the switchgear was replaced by oil-enclosed <b>lever-operated</b> switches, and in 1920 the system was again renovated with remotely controlled oil-filled circuit breakers. The 1920 switchboard has been retained to the present day.|$|E
5000|$|However door knobs can be {{difficult}} for the young and elderly to operate. For this reason, door handles in most American commercial and industrial buildings and in many households use a <b>lever-operated</b> handle, rather than a knob, as the lever does not require a tight grip. Levers are also beneficial on doors with narrow stile widths where the reduced backset leaves insufficient space to comfortably turn a door knob.|$|E
50|$|The Type 20 had {{retractable}} landing gear. Each mainwheel was on {{a vertical}} oleo strut under the engine and hinged on a bent axle and a drag strut, both tubular. They were retracted by <b>lever-operated</b> cables into the engine cowlings, with the axle and drag strut lying on the wing underside. In the cockpit there were pointers indicating the undercarriage position and a quick release to lower it. The mainwheels had brakes and the tailwheel castered.|$|E
50|$|Richard Shubb (born January 11, 1945 in Oakland, California) is {{best known}} as the {{inventor}} of the Shubb Capo, a very popular guitar and banjo accessory. His 1978 patent is cited by Sterner's Capo Museum as being {{one of the most significant}} improvements in the development of the capo. He also invented the <b>lever-operated</b> banjo fifth string capo, the compensated banjo bridge, and holds several other U.S. and international patents on musical instrument accessories and improvements.|$|E
50|$|The first {{significant}} lever-action design was the Spencer repeating rifle, a magazine-fed <b>lever-operated</b> breech-loading rifle designed by Christopher Spencer in 1860. It was fed from a removable seven-round tube magazine, enabling the rounds {{to be fired}} one after another, and which, when emptied, could be exchanged for another. Over 20,000 were made, and it {{was adopted by the}} United States and used during the American Civil War, marking the first adoption of a removable-magazine-fed infantry-and-cavalry rifle by any country.|$|E
50|$|The AC-7 {{is derived}} from the AC-7M motor glider, but with a {{significantly}} redesigned fuselage. The AC-7 reduced fuselage whetted area as a result of eliminating the engine and propeller mounting space. It retains the two-seats in side-by-side configuration of the motor glider. Also revised is the complex four-wheeled fixed landing gear of the AC-7M, replaced on the AC-7 by a conventional retractable 400 mm tire, pneumatic-hydraulic suspended, monowheel gear, with a <b>lever-operated</b> hydraulic disc brake.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{earliest}} models, {{power from the}} engine (which was mounted in front, started by rope, and operated with a hand throttle) was transferred by a long drive belt to a simple <b>lever-operated</b> forward/reverse transmission between the rear wheels. This transmission was under the bench seat, and drove power to serrated, cast iron [...] "gears" [...] which drove the wheels through contact friction atop the 2.25x10 semi-pneumatic tire treads. Braking action was accomplished by reversing the transmission.|$|E
50|$|From 1923 to 1951, the Union Cutlery Co. of Olean, New York {{produced}} {{a series of}} <b>lever-operated</b> switchblades designed for the mid and {{upper end of the}} market, featuring celluloid, stag, or jigged bone handles, a bolster-mounted push-button, all featuring the company's KA-BAR trademark on the blade tang. The line included the KA-BAR Grizzly, KA-BAR Baby Grizzly, and KA-BAR Model 6110 Lever Release knives. The largest model was KA-BAR Grizzly, a folding hunter pattern with a broad bowie-type clip point blade.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} was spartan. One publicity blurb {{of the era}} mentions such luxuries as [...] "synchronized wipers", [...] "a <b>lever-operated</b> winker switch", a fuel gauge, and [...] "self-starter activated by turning the ignition key". There was only one, central taillight. The 1959-1960 TLs were not even available with a passenger side windshield wiper. Nonetheless, the Suzulight TL Van was the most expensive car in its class, at ¥398,000. Meanwhile, the Subaru 360 Commercial cost ¥365,000 and a Cony 360 Truck a mere ¥330,000.|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s, Zeiss Ikon (ZI) made a {{wide range}} of {{miniature}} cameras for the 35mm film format. Most cameras used the standard 24×36 mm frame size, like the Contax, Nettax and Super Nettel. However, the ability to take images in fast sequence was a popular marketing element at the time, and several fast-operating models were made. Among these were the Otto Berning's motor-driven Robot cameras as well as the ZI <b>lever-operated</b> Tenax I and Tenax II. These have the smaller square format of 24×24 mm, enhancing faster frame advance.|$|E
50|$|German horns have <b>lever-operated</b> rotary valves, in {{contrast}} to the French horn, which uses piston valves (similar to a trumpet's), and the Vienna horn which uses double-piston valves, or pumpenvalves. A horn without valves is known as a natural horn, changing pitch along the natural harmonics of the instrument. Pitch may also be controlled by the position of the hand in the bell, in effect reducing the bell's diameter. The pitch of any note can easily be raised or lowered by adjusting the hand position in the bell.|$|E
5000|$|George Clymer (1754?-1834) from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was an American {{engineer}} and inventor (he {{is sometimes called}} [...] "George E. Clymer", but this middle initial is probably an error based on a misreading of an early census record; no evidence for a middle name, if he had one, {{has so far been}} found). Around 1813 he invented the Columbian Printing Press. This was a cast-iron, <b>lever-operated</b> replacement for the wooden screw presses which had been in use in Europe since the fifteenth century and in North America since the seventeenth.|$|E
50|$|The 1965 model 172F {{introduced}} {{electrically operated}} flaps {{to replace the}} previous <b>lever-operated</b> system. It was built in France by Reims Cessna as the F172 until 1971. These models {{formed the basis for}} the U.S. Air Force's T-41A Mescalero primary trainer, which was used during the 1960s and early 1970s as initial flight screening aircraft in USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT). Following their removal from the UPT program, some extant USAF T-41s were assigned to the U.S. Air Force Academy for the cadet pilot indoctrination program, while others were distributed to Air Force aero clubs.|$|E
50|$|A pump-action {{centerfire}} rifle was {{a peculiar}} choice {{to compete with}} a lever action. Most hunters preferred the simple <b>lever-operated</b> repeating rifles produced by Winchester, Marlin, and Savage. Remington tried to take the high ground by introducing the John Browning designed semi-automatic Model 8 in 1906, along with {{a new line of}} cartridges for it. The Model 8 didn't sell overly well and Remington felt that a manually operated gun would sell better. Since Winchester had a near lock on the lever-action market, Remington chose a sleek-packaged pump action along with the same four calibers introduced with the Model 8 rifle.|$|E
50|$|The typical early horse-drawn {{hay rake}} was a dump rake, a wide two-wheeled {{implement}} with curved steel or iron teeth usually operated from a seat mounted over the rake with a <b>lever-operated</b> lifting mechanism. This rake gathered cut hay into windrows by repeated operation {{perpendicular to the}} windrow, requiring the operator to raise the rake, turn around and drop the teeth to rake {{back and forth in}} order to form the windrow. In some areas, a sweep rake, which could also be a horse-drawn or tractor-mounted implement, could then be used to pick up the windrowed hay and load it onto a wagon.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in 1955, 60 {{years after}} Winchester's last all-new lever-action design, the Model 88 was unlike any {{previous}} lever-action. A short-throw lever operated a three-lug rotating bolt and rounds were fed vertically from a detachable box magazine: in effect {{it was a}} <b>lever-operated</b> bolt action. These features in a lever-action permitted the use of high-powered modern short-case cartridges with spitzer bullets: [...]243 Winchester, [...]284 Winchester, [...]308 Winchester and [...]358 Winchester. The Model 88 was discontinued in 1973 and is the third best-selling lever-action rifle in Winchester's history, following only the M1894 and M1892. The later Sako Finnwolf and Browning BLR have similar actions.|$|E

5000|$|The German horn is {{the most}} common type of orchestral horn, and is ordinarily known simply as the [...] "horn". The double horn in F/B♭ is the version most used by {{professional}} bands and orchestras. A musician who plays the German horn is called a horn player (or, less frequently, a hornist). Pitch is controlled through the adjustment of lip tension in the mouthpiece and the operation of valves by the left hand, which route the air into extra tubing. German horns have <b>lever-operated</b> rotary valves. The backward-facing orientation of the bell relates to the perceived desirability to create a subdued sound, in concert situations, in contrast to the more-piercing quality of the trumpet.|$|E
5000|$|Safemaker Jacob H. Meyers {{created the}} Automatic Voting Machine in 1888 and {{established}} the Automatic Voting Machine Corporation (AVM) in 1898. Samuel R. Shoup followed his example, built his own lever voting machine and founded the Shoup Voting Machine Corporation in 1905. It [...] "operated {{on a limited}} scale", until [...] "the development and sale of the model 2.5 in the mid 1930s turned the corporation into a successful and profitable operation." [...] The two rivals grew to dominate the American market. By 1928, one of six citizens registered their votes on an AVM or Shoup machine. In all, Shoup sold 100,000 <b>lever-operated</b> voting machines, half of which were still working and in use for the 2000 presidential election.|$|E
50|$|The program {{operations}} are generally available both {{in a standard}} menu system and as icons on optional toolbars. Selecting an image modification option will generally open a window with a tabbed user interface — for selecting within a group of related operations. Each tab will generally contain one or more <b>lever-operated</b> controls, and the tab's image display has a user-operated divider separating the transformed and untransformed versions of the image.The color curves can be controlled (with level limit control) while the resulting histograms are displayed.RAW files can be opened, and TIFF images can be both opened and saved. A special set of 16-bit operations is available for these. Some dynamic range improvement (within 8 bits) may also be achieved {{by means of the}} operation Merge Images DRI.|$|E
50|$|The Colt's unusual {{method of}} {{operation}} had both advantages and disadvantages compared to competing machine gun designs of the day. The <b>lever-operated</b> repeating action gave the weapon a relatively low rate of fire (less than 400 rounds a minute). However, the low rate of fire combined with a heavy barrel also allowed the gun to be air-cooled, resulting in a simpler, lighter, and more portable machine gun compared to water-cooled designs. Though combat reports of action stoppages were not uncommon, most of these could be overcome by manually cycling the action. As gunners gained experience with operating an air-cooled machine gun, {{it became apparent that}} avoiding long continuous periods of fire materially added to the weapon's reliability and barrel life.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chromatic}} harmonica uses a button-activated {{sliding bar}} to redirect {{air from the}} hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate, though one design—the [...] "Machino-Tone"—controlled airflow by means of a <b>lever-operated</b> flap on the rear of the instrument. Also, a [...] "hands-free" [...] modification to the Hohner 270 (12-hole) lets the player shift the tones by moving the mouthpiece up and down with the lips, leaving the hands free to play another instrument. While the Richter-tuned 10-hole chromatic is intended to play in only one key, the 12-, 14-, and 16-hole models (which are tuned to equal temperament) allow the musician to play in any key desired with only one harmonica. This harp can be used for any style, including Celtic, classical, jazz, or blues (commonly in third position).|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of fast-opening doors {{commonly}} used. The simplest and most primitive type of door, a bolted plate or flanged cap {{on some sort of}} hinge, is no longer considered even minimally acceptable for production autoclaves because it is anything but quick in opening and closing. For vessels up to four feet in diameter and rated at not much over 125 psi, a hinged semi-elliptical door secured by <b>lever-operated</b> cam-locking T-bolts works essentially as quickly and as easily as the more commonly used rotating locking ring door. This door design uses up to a dozen or so latching T-bolts on the door hub (see photos), the stationary part fitted to the cylindrical vessel itself, which engage matching lugs welded to the door. When the operating levers are rotated over center, the T-bolts draw the lugs closer and seal the door by means of an O-ring gasket.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, the two central (east-west and north-south) {{corridors}} {{completed in}} 1896 {{were to have}} provided the only ammunition and powder storage for the batteries. Indeed, blueprints from 1896 show rows of stored shells drawn-in along these corridors and in some rooms (see 1896 blueprint detail in photo Gallery below). A total of some 1248 3-foot shells, 624 3.8-foot shells, and 208 5-foot [...] "torpedos" [...] were indicated as planned to be stored in the corridors. An extensive system of shell trolleys ran through the magazine rooms and corridors, to transport the heavy shells out to the pits. The 1910-1914 modifications added a series of <b>lever-operated</b> switches {{to some of these}} shell trolleys (see two trolley/switch photos in Gallery below), so that different stacks of shells could be accessed. The section view in the blueprint image below also illustrates how these shell trolleys were intended to work.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "Camel" [...] {{was about}} 25 ft long, with an 11 ft wheelbase. There were three major variations: the short, medium, and long furnace models. The small units had 17" [...] × 22" [...] cylinders, {{and the others}} had 19" [...] × 22" [...] cylinders. The medium unit had about 23 sq ft of grate area, {{expanded}} to more than 28 sq ft in the large furnace model. The long furnace model had a firebox more than 8 ft long, requiring <b>lever-operated</b> chutes for the fireman to feed {{the front of the}} fire. The fireman worked in the tender, as the firebox was behind the drivers. This design required that the drawbar passed beneath the firebox, and it typically heated to a cherry red color. Even after rebuilds with a more conventional cab design, the fireman worked in the tender. The standard Camel engine had 43" [...] wheels, and was painted green.|$|E
