5|$|Lavender's primary pitch was the spitball, and {{his method}} of {{preparation}} was to lick the ball. In a game on July19, Lavender was about to load the ball when he smelled a <b>liniment</b> on the ball. He reported this to the home plate umpire, who then ejected the Phillies manager, Red Dooin, from the game. Dooin had been caught doing this to another spitballer, Marty O'Toole, a few days earlier. On September26, Lavender and the Cubs were ahead 9–0in {{the top half of}} the ninth inning versus Cincinnati, when the Reds scored 10runs against Lavender and two other pitchers to take the lead 10–9. The Cubs ultimately prevailed and gained the victory by scoring two runs in the bottom half of the ninth. Lavender started just one more game in 1912, a 3–2victory on October5 against St. Louis. Following the season, the Cubs played a series of exhibition games with the Chicago White Sox of the American League called the City Series. Lavender started the first game against Ed Walsh, and the game ended after nine innings with a scoreless tie. Lavender gave six hits and Walsh just one. After the two teams played to a 12-inning tie two days later, Lavender pitched the Cubs to victory in game three. Two additional victories gave the Cubs a 3–0series lead, but the White Sox were able to win four straight games, twice defeating Lavender, including in the series finale. He completed his rookie season with his career-high 16victories, against 13losses, and a 3.04earned run average(ERA) in 251innings pitched.|$|E

This time period immediately following the Civil War marked {{the heyday of the}} horse in American life. Consequently, the Sloan <b>liniment</b> formula was in great demand. For about twenty-five years, Earl and his brother peddled their remedy from farm to farm, and also worked the horse fairs and carnivals.|$|E

25|$|In antiquity, {{pitches and}} resins were used {{commonly}} as medicines. Pliny mentions {{a variety of}} tar-like substances being used as medicine, including cedria and pissinum. Cedria was the pitch and resin of the cedar tree, being equivalent to the oil of tar and pyroligneous acid which {{are used in the}} first stage of distilling creosote. He recommends cedria to ease the pain in a toothache, as an injection in the ear in case of hardness of hearing, to kill parasitic worms, as a preventative for impregnation, as a treatment for phthiriasis and porrigo, as an antidote for the poison of the sea hare, as a <b>liniment</b> for elephantiasis, and as an ointment to treat ulcers both on the skin and in the lungs. He further speaks of cedria being used as the embalming agent for preparing mummies. Pissinum was a tar water that was made by boiling cedria, spreading wool fleeces over the vessels to catch the steam, and then wringing them out.|$|E
500|$|Homer {{began to}} study music, and was allowed to help Timothy clerk at the store the elder Davenport {{purchased}} when he first moved to Silverton. Timothy required Homer to milk the cows, but otherwise Homer was to [...] "study faces and draw." [...] He was well-liked by the villagers, but they considered him shiftless—they did not consider drawing to be real work. He exhibited a love of animals, especially fast horses and fighting cocks. [...] Davenport later wrote that his fascination with Arabian horses was reawakened in his adolescent years with his admiration of {{a picture of an}} Arabian-type horse found on an empty can of horse <b>liniment.</b> He carefully cleaned the can and kept it as his [...] "only piece of artistic furniture" [...] for many years until forced to leave it behind when he moved to San Francisco.

50|$|<b>Liniments</b> are {{typically}} sold to relieve pain and stiffness, such as from sore muscular aches and strains, or arthritis. These {{are typically}} formulated from alcohol, acetone, or similar quickly evaporating solvents and contain counterirritant aromatic chemical compounds such as methyl salicilate, benzoin resin, menthol, or capsaicin; they produce {{a feeling of}} warmth within the muscle of the area they are applied to, typically acting as rubefacients via a counterirritant effect.|$|R
50|$|It {{is used in}} high {{concentrations}} as a rubefacient and analgesic in deep heating <b>liniments</b> (such as Bengay) to treat joint and muscular pain. Randomised double blind trial reviews report evidence of its effectiveness that is weak, but stronger for acute pain than chronic pain, and that effectiveness may be due entirely to counter-irritation. However, in the body it metabolizes into salicylates, including salicylic acid, a known NSAID.|$|R
50|$|<b>Liniments</b> are {{commonly}} used on horses following exercise, applied either by rubbing on full-strength, especially on the legs; or applied in a diluted form, usually added to {{a bucket of water}} and sponged on the body. They are used in hot weather to help cool down a horse after working, the alcohol cooling through rapid evaporation, and counterirritant oils dilating capillaries in the skin, increasing the amount of blood releasing heat from the body.|$|R
2500|$|DMSO is {{commonly}} used in veterinary medicine as a <b>liniment</b> for horses, alone or {{in combination with other}} ingredients.

[...] Also in horses, DMSO is used intravenously, again alone or in combination with other drugs. [...] It is used alone for the treatment of increased intracranial pressure and/or cerebral edema in horses.|$|E

2500|$|Heraclitus' life as {{a philosopher}} was {{interrupted}} by dropsy. The physicians he consulted were unable to prescribe a cure. Diogenes lists various stories about Heraclitus' death: In two versions, Heraclitus was cured of the dropsy and died of another disease. In one account, however, the philosopher [...] "buried himself in a cowshed, expecting that the noxious damp humour would be drawn out of him by {{the warmth of the}} manure", while another says he treated himself with a <b>liniment</b> of cow manure and, after a day prone in the sun, died and was interred in the marketplace. [...] According to Neathes of Cyzicus, after smearing himself with dung, Heraclitus was devoured by dogs.|$|E
50|$|Heat (thermotherapy) {{is usually}} applied at least 48-72 {{hours after the}} initial injury. It is used to improve blood flow and {{subsequently}} healing, and to increase extensibility of tissues. Improved blood flow can also encourage fluid reabsorption, which reduces swelling, and encourages phagocytic cells to enter {{the site of the}} injury. <b>Liniments</b> are sometimes used to increase heat to an area. Both heat and cold have been shown to decrease muscle spasm and pain.|$|R

2500|$|The {{legs of a}} horse require routine {{observation}} for lacerations or swelling. [...] Everyday care involves {{brushing the}} legs with a brush to remove dirt and mud. [...] A currycomb is generally not used below the knees. [...] It is common to have excess hair trimmed from the fetlock to prevent excess accumulation of mud and moisture {{that may lead to}} skin problems, such as rain rot or scratches. [...] Many riders wrap the horse's legs with protective boots or bandages to prevent injury while working or exercising. [...] After a ride, it is common for a rider or groom to hose off the legs of a horse to remove dirt and to ease any minor inflammation to the tendons and ligaments. [...] <b>Liniment</b> may also be applied as a preventative measure to minimize stiffness and ease any minor strain or swelling. [...] If the horse has been overworked, injured, or is to be transported, a standing bandage or shipping boot may be placed on the horse's legs for protection, to hold a wound dressing, or to provide support. [...] Leg wraps are useful in preventing injury or for treating horses with leg injuries. [...] Veterinarians may recommend using wraps during rehabilitation to prevent further injury. [...] Another common use for leg wraps is to protect the legs of horses while being shipped in a horse trailer.|$|E
