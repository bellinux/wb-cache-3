40|$|Research on the {{barriers}} and <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> {{climate change adaptation}} identifies many factors, but describes few processes whereby adaptation is constrained or may indeed fail to avoid catastrophic losses. It often assumes that barriers are by and large distinct from <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> adaptation. We respond to recent calls for comparative studies {{that are able to}} further knowledge about the underlying drivers of barriers and <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> adaptation. We compare six cases from across Australia, including those in alpine areas, rivers, reefs, wetlands, small inland communities, and islands, with the aim of identifying common underlying drivers of barriers and <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> adaptation. We find that the path-dependent nature of the institutions that govern natural resources and public goods is a deep driver of barriers and <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> adaptation. Path-dependent institutions are resistant to change. When this resistance causes the changes necessary for adaptation to be slower than changes in climate, then it becomes a <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> adaptation. Full Tex...|$|R
