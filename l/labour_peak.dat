40|$|Although weeds in Niger are {{generally}} considered to cause {{more harm than good}} if not controlled and weed control causes a <b>labour</b> <b>peak</b> in crop production, various weeds are traded as feed, food or construction material. Weeds are undesirable {{at the onset of the}} rainy season as they may cause yield losses, but their occurrence after millet flowering entails little yield losses and farmers exploit them for various purposes. Livestock plays a key role in the traditional household economy of mixed−farming systems in Niger. During the rainy season, feed demands of animals can be satisfied by fresh grasses and herbaceous plants. At the onset of the dry season, animals prefer millet leaves and weeds to millet stalks. During the dry season feed is most limited due to the scarcity of biomass from natural pastures and the decomposition of stover. At rural and urban markets, fodder weeds such as Alysicarpus ovalifolius ("Gadigy " in local Djerma language), Commelina forskalaei (Balassa), Eragrostis tremula (Kullum) and Zornia glochidiata (Markbu) are traded. Laboratory analyses of these weeds revealed a two times higher crude protein content than low quality roughages such as millet stover.

40|$|In the {{literature}} on the evolution of farming systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, the food versus cash debate on the competition versus complementarity between food and export crops (such as cotton) in agricultural development seems to offer contrasting views on rural development. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to revisit these schools of thought through an empirical case study in northern Côte d’Ivoire. Farming systems are distinguished through the presence of cotton and the degree of intensification and mechanization. Non-mechanized cotton systems are severely constrained by labour bottlenecks during field preparation of cotton fields due to competition with food crops and are barely able to subsist. Mechanization, as part of the cotton program, enables cotton farms to spread <b>labour</b> <b>peaks</b> and dramatically increase cropped areas. Our findings suggest that both development theories in reality coexist rather than contrast and that neither of both simultaneously applies on all farming systems. farming systems, adoption, cotton, animal traction, Côte d’Ivoire...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, batch {{management}} systems (BMSs) are more frequently applied on a pig farm than traditional continuous production systems. But till today, {{little research has}} been identified about pig breeders’ perceptions of BMSs. Therefore, a survey was built to assess advantages and disadvantages, perceived by the producers of each BMS, focusing on biosecurity, management and labour. The survey was completed by 45 farmers. Results revealed that 4 -BMS and 5 -BMS farmers were more satisfied about hygiene (P= 0. 0060) and health conditions (P= 0. 0225) on their farm compared to the farmers with remaining BMS. This could be explained by the need for only one farrowing room and the low number of batches required in both BMSs. Possibly due to this higher amount of farmers being satisfied about their biosecurity, a reduced piglet vaccination coverage (P= 0. 0399) and a more labour efficient management (P= 0. 0101), were indicated by those farmers. However, almost no one among those farmers indicated the absence of <b>labour</b> <b>peaks</b> in the list of advantages, probably because the weekly routines differ over the weeks, unlike a 1 -BMS and a 3 -BMS. To conclude, this research provides essential information about farmers’ perceptions concerning biosecurity, management and labour for all BMSs but these results need to be confirmed by quantitative biosecurity measurements. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: HIV/AIDS {{is leading}} {{to the loss of}} labor through {{sickness}} and subsequent death, this {{is leading to}} the neglect of farm and off-farm activities, with the subsequent loss of potential income and food security. The situation is sensitive to seasonal <b>labour</b> <b>peaks</b> in agriculture. This study was done to determine the impact of high HIV prevalence in farming systems and food security in Pala Bondo District, Kenya. Methods: In this study, 386 respondents were randomly chosen in Pala Sub-Location. The respondents and key informants were interviewed using structured questionnaire. The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 16. Results: It was established that majority of respondents (67 %) were between 18 and 35 years {χ 2 = (1, N = 386) = 13. 430, p = 0. 000 } (chimney effect). The study also established that 83. 5 % of respondents were married {χ 2 = (1, N= 370) = 166. 277 p = 0. 000 } and predominant occupation being farming and fishing (61 %), while 52. 8 % of farm labour was by hand, 26 % by oxen, and 4. 9 % mechanized. 73. 2 % of respondents only farm 0. 25 to 2 acres, 48 % mentioned lack of labour in land preparation {χ 2 ((1,N = 321) = 113. 146, p = 0. 000), in planting {χ 2 (1, N = 321) = 29. 28, p = 0. 000 }.

Maize Shellers are increasingly needed to serve demand from poultry sector because manual shelling is very laborious. Comparing with manual shelling, results indicate that power operated Maize Shellers look like a wise investment (5 – 8 acres for 25 % internal rate of return or IRR). However, it makes economic sense to operate shellers at higher capacities, and along with the high capital cost (Tk 1 18, 000 – 22, 000) to save large numbers of labours to farmers and maize traders.

National and international organic standards should not only be more aligned towards their claimed sustainability objectives but also clearly distinguish from future integrated production standards.

40|$|In South Patagonia, Argentina, {{sweet cherry}} {{is the main}} fruit-tree crop grown for export, {{resulting}} in a highly seasonal labour demand. Managers of deciduous perennial fruit orchards must consider both biological and economic relationships in selecting crop species and orchard design. This makes decisions at the farm-level extremely complex, as especially in such perennial crops, strategic (`what to plant¿, `with which technology¿ and `how much area of each activity¿, i. e. the final design) and tactical (`when, what and how to plant in time¿, the pathway to the planned farm) decisions have a long-term effect. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the consequences of different strategic and tactical decisions at farm scale in fruit production systems of South Patagonia, considering the variation in interests and aims of different stakeholders, and using a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the consequences of possible changes in external conditions. A dynamic farm-scale optimization model called OPTIFROP was developed to generate alternative farm development plans, by allocating, in the course of the time horizon of the run, production activities to different land units, while optimising different objective functions, subject to several constraints. Although time-dependent, dynamic, mathematical programming models for analysing farming systems have been described in literature, the dynamic aspects of long-term decision-making in orchard design and their impact on the sequential (annual) nature of orchards in different growth phases (i. e. medium-term decision-making), need a higher time-staged dynamic approach with a staircase matrix structure. The model includes two objective functions at farm level: (1) maximization of the present value of cumulative financial result, which is the main objective for growers, and (2) maximization of cumulative farm labour, which is an objective often mentioned by policy makers. The inter-months deviation for labour demand (during the period of high labour demand, November¿April) was included as an upper-bound. Input and output coefficients for the land use options considered in OPTIFROP were quantified using the Technical Coefficient Generator FRUPAT. Model results indicated that the present value of cumulative financial result and the cumulative farm labour are conflicting to a very limited extent. Timing and feasibility of implementing certain combinations of production technologies are affected by resource endowments and initial conditions, but these factors do not influence land use selection in the long term. Land use selection is driven by the objectives of the stakeholders. OPTIFROP showed that, through introduction of alternative crops, substantial reductions in <b>labour</b> <b>peaks</b> in the period November¿April could be achieved with a relatively small reduction in farm income. The sensitivity of the model solution to the cherry price suggests that the fruit production sector of South Patagonia should pay more attention to the robustness of their land use plans and take preventive measures to avoid being caught by a possible crisis due to changes in the context...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{magnitude}} of child malnutrition including severe child malnutrition is especially {{high in the}} rural areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo (the DRC). The aim of this qualitative study is to describe the social context of malnutrition in a rural part of the DRC and explore how some households succeed in ensuring that their children are well-nourished while others do not. Methodology This study is based on participant observation, key informant interviews, group discussions and in-depth interviews with four households with malnourished children and four with well-nourished children. We apply social field theory to link individual child nutritional outcomes to processes at local level and to the wider socio-economic environment. Findings We identified four social fields that have implications for food security and child nutritional outcomes: 1) household size and composition which determined vulnerability to child malnutrition, 2) inter-household cooperation in the form of ‘gbisa work party’ which buffered scarcity of <b>labour</b> in <b>peak</b> seasons and facilitated capital accumulation, 3) the village associated with usufruct rights to land, and 4) the local NGO providing access to agricultural support, clean drinking water and health care. Conclusions Households that participated in inter-household cooperation were able to improve food and nutrition security. Children living in households with high pressure on productive members were at danger of food insecurity and malnutrition. Nutrition interventions need to involve local institutions for inter-household cooperation and address the problem of social inequalities in service provision. They should have special focus on households with few resources in the form of land, labour and capita...|$|R

40|$|The energy {{expenditure}} under power tiller and bullock farming systems was studied {{to explore the}} energy requirement at different stage of rice production {{and to find out}} the activity contributed major share of energy. Energy was divided into direct energy and indirect energy. Direct energy included labour, animal and fuel consumption obtained by multiplying energy coefficient. The indirect energy included machinery use, seed, fertilizer, pesticides etc. The direct and indirect energy constituted the total energy requirement expenditure for both farming systems. Intercultural operation was the highest consumer of labour both farming systems as this operation was done manually. In land preparation, power tiller farming system consumed 3 times more energy than bullock farming system but there was a saving of 58 % time thus requiring less <b>labour</b> during <b>peak</b> periods. Transplanting operation required energy of 143 MJ ha - 1 and 125 MJ ha - 1 respectively for power tiller and bullock farming system. Fertilizer and irrigation consumed largest (47 - 50 %) and second largest (21 - 25 %) energy in both the farming systems. Bullock farming system consumed more labour energy (1448 MJ ha - 1) than that of the power tiller farming system (1305 MJ ha - 1). Total energy requirement under power tiller farming system was 15, 751 MJ ha - 1 whereas 13, 781 MJ ha - 1 was consumed under bullock farming system i. e. 17. 74 % higher energy input was used in power tiller farming system than that of bullock farming system.

The data was generated on 36 medium (50 – 80 cows) and large (> 80 cows) spring calving dairy farms over a 12 -m period. A questionnaire survey recorded the levels of available labour on the farms, i. e. family or hired, full-time or part-time. Additionally, all farm operators recorded their labour input to different tasks.

The survey report revealed that 96 percent rice growers planted well-adapted high yielding coarse rice variety IR- 6. All the farmers followed recommendations regarding land preparation using tractor and tractor-mounted implements. Half of the population used their self-produced seed, which was kept under profaned conditions. Majority of the farmers raised rice nursery {{during the month of}} April to mainly escape from the attack of rice stem borer. More than half (56 %) used optimal age (30 - 40 -days-old) rice nursery. Almost all the population (96 %) used transplanting method but none of them used the line method of transplantation. Although, a big fraction (36 %) of the sampled population was illiterate, yet all were applying recommended doses of fertilizers. Similarly, most of the growers (70 %) were impelled to apply canal water at 4 - 8 days interval according to the water schedule given by the Revenue department. Majority of the population reported weeds and pest (stem borer) in rice crop. The per hectare rice yield of the farmers interviewed, although, exceeds the national average rice yield but none of the growers could fully exploit the potential yield of the cultivar. The frequency of the sampled population for getting information from nearby growers was very high mainly due to uncertain and insufficient knowledge provided by the other sources. Fifty-four percent of the farmers needed loan for the purchase of fertilizers, insecticides etc for rice crop and thirty-two percent declared banks as the suitable source of credit.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers how {{the transition}} from craft manufacture to mechanized glass production affected the organization of work and the consequences for the recruitment of labour. Based on gender and ethnicity, the dissertation studies {{the composition of the}} workforce, the significance of qualifications, and differences in career paths and length of stay have been investigated at Surte glassworks 1943 – 1978. Charles Tilly’s theory of durable inequality is applied to analyse whether primarily gender and ethnicity had any effect on the assignment of tasks and on discrimination. In conclusion, the results from Surte are compared with conditions at Kosta glassworks. Whereas Surte’s specialty was machine-made bottles, Kosta was geared to craft production of utility glass and art glass. After mechanization at Surte, machine-tenders were counted among the most qualified category, instead of the glass-blowers who had previously been in demand. Manufacture at a pace regulated by machines led to more routine chores such as inspection and packaging. At Kosta, with its focus on craft, glass-blowers still had the highest positions and had learned glass-blowing in the traditional way through practical exercise. At neither Surte nor Kosta did women have any opportunity to receive comparable training. After the Second World War there was a growing need for labour at both Surte and Kosta, and to keep production going the main alternative was foreign <b>labour.</b> The <b>peak</b> was reached in the 1960 s, and of roughly 660 collectively employed workers at Surte in November 1964, almost 40 % were immigrants, chiefly from Finland. Kosta at the same time, with just under 330 employees, had slightly under 10 % foreign workers, mainly from Greece. Kosta attracted a number of skilled glass-workers from abroad, but the majority of immigrants there, and all those at Surte, lacked experience of glass manufacture At neither Surte nor Kosta, with their different production methods, is there any evidence of durable inequality based on ethnicity. The assignment of tasks was guided rather by the functions in demand at the companies and by the applicants’ qualifications. Internal training and career opportunities were open to all male workers, regardless of which country they came from. On the other hand, the gender division of labour at both glassworks created durable inequality for all women regardless of nationality.   Projektet delfinasierat av Kulturparken Småland. </p...|$|R

Many marriages were unregistered, further weakening women's claim on land.

50|$|Farmers in Starrs Point and Canard {{began to}} discuss {{building}} a large dyke {{at the mouth}} of the Canard River in 1809. They may have been inspired by the three mile long Wickwire Dyke completed near Wolfville in 1808. The Planters at Canard had gradually added to the Acadian dykes along the edges of the river but a dyke at near the mouth of the river would reclaim an additional 700 acres of farmland from the Minas Basin and save the maintenance of the many smaller dykes along the river which protected over 2,000 acres. A plan was organized in 1811. Materials were gathered and construction began in 1817. The dyke was named after the Duke of Wellington following his defeat of Napoleon in 1815. The new structure was a dramatic change from the Acadian dyke systems which were only a few feet high in most places. The Wellington Dyke would be 50 feet high, 120 feet at the base and over 300 feet long with additional embankments stretching over a mile just in from the mouth of the river. The aboiteau or sluice which allowed the river to drain was 100 feet and 14 feet wide. The work was financed and organized solely by the 70 farmers of the Wellington Marsh Body. It was built in stages seasonally, between high tides using only human and animal <b>labour.</b> At its <b>peak</b> over 100 teams of horses and oxen and 300 men worked on the dyke. Rum rations were issued as an incentive with extra shares for those who had to work in the water. In some places the swift tidal currents swept away nine out of every ten cart loads of fill.|$|R

Well-adapted coarse rice variety IR- 6 was used in the research project. Thirty days old rice nursery was used in transplanted plots while wet pre-germinated seed was broadcast in direct seeded plots. Data were recorded on various growth and yield parameters like plant height (cm) productive tillers m- 2 unproductive tillers m- 2 panicles m- 2 spikelets panicle- 1 sterility and normal kernels percentage, 1000 -grain weight (g) paddy yield (t ha- 1) leaf area index (LAI), net assimilation rate (NAR) at 45 and 90 days after sowing (DAS), stem borer moths resting behaviour at 30, 45 and 60 DAS and white heads plant- 1 after 90 DAS in all experiments of the project The sample size in experiment 1 was determined by using simple random sampling procedure of probability sampling. A sampling frame was developed that carried details of farmers involved in rice production. This was identified by collecting information from the key informants. The findings of the survey elucidated that water shortage high cost of inputs, non-availability of skilled <b>labour</b> during <b>peak</b> planting season, sub-optimal plant population, weeds and pest infestation high dependence of knowledge on nearby growers and low price of rice in the local market were the major restrictions in higher yields of rice. In experiment 2, the effects of transplanting dates and number of seedlings hill- 1 were found to be significant in most of the agronomic and physiological parameters studied. The highest paddy yield during 2002 and 2003 (5 and 8. 1 t ha- 1) respectively, higher net return of Rs. 7, 830 and 23, 330 ha- 1 and benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of 0. 44 and 1. 32 were recorded on 20 th June planted crop with 1 seedling hill- 1 during both the experimental years. Similarly in experiment 3 the effect of planting techniques (transplanting vs. direct seedling) and weed control practices including granular herbicide Sunstar 15 WG (Ethoxy sulfuron) conventional hand weeding and herbicide Machete 60 EC (Butachlor) significantly influenced the yield and yield contributing attributes during either year of the study Both the Sunstar and Machete application proved their efficacy against the weeds but could not match with hand weeding treatment. Minimum weed population m- 2 dry weed control strategies On the basis of research findings, it is concluded that conventional transplanting technique on flat with a plant-to-plant and row-to-row spacing of 20 cm is most suitable on planting date 20 th June with 1 seedling hill- 1 Among weed control practices, hand weeding is most effective followed by herbicide treatment Machete 60 EC.

40|$|It’s time {{to create}} {{opportunities}} for lower skilled workers in our region, argue Peter Mares and Nic Maclellan AT THE Pacific Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea this week John Howard is under renewed pressure to allow Pacific Islanders {{to work in}} Australia. The topic has long been on the agenda for Island leaders but at past forums Australia has side-stepped the issue. This time it will be harder to dodge, since access to the Australian labour market is {{a key component of}} the Pacific Plan - the blueprint on regional integration developed by the forum secretariat for consideration at this year’s leaders’ meeting. Australia and New Zealand want the forum island countries to speed up the implementation of regional trade agreements that will open their markets to foreign goods and capital. The island states insist that increased labour mobility is integral to these trade deals. This is not just a negotiating tactic. Remittances from overseas workers are already a crucial source of revenue for many island states (for example Fiji earns more from remittances than from either sugar or garment exports). Under a more liberal trade and investment regime the importance of remittances will grow: island governments hope offshore employment can replace jobs shed by industries that are currently subsidised or protected, and that workers’ remittances will help to compensate for revenue lost as import tariffs are removed. Without increased remittance income, the island states’ trade deficits will balloon from their already high levels, increasing their dependence on Australian aid. Shadow Pacific Affairs spokesman Bob Sercombe has recognised this link - labour mobility is an integral (if rather vague) component of his recent policy proposal for a ‘Pacific Community’, which helps to explain why it was so warmly endorsed by many Pacific leaders. There are other pressures on Australian to start thinking seriously about this issue. The combination of youth bulge (40 per cent of Pacific Islanders are under 20 years of age) and a lack of jobs is a volatile mix. Even if trade liberalisation eventually produces the economic nirvana in the Pacific that free market economists predict (which we doubt), there will be a lag before new jobs become available. Meanwhile, on the domestic front, Australia has labour shortages that could be eased by employing Pacific Islanders, most notably in horticulture. The shortage of seasonal workers was highlighted in the National Farmers’ Federation Rural Labour Action Plan released last month. The NFF rightly argues that more must be done to increase domestic participation in the agricultural labour market. One obvious measure is better accommodation and transport options for seasonal workers. The NFF also recognises that much more could be done to encourage Indigenous workers into the horticultural industry (as demonstrated in a successful scheme supported by Noel Pearson’s Cape York Partnerships). But the NFF has also cautiously opened the door to a new visa for offshore workers in agriculture. The NFF is not proposing a guest worker scheme on the German model, where workers are separated from home and family for years at a time. The proposal is for a seasonal workers scheme to cover temporary gaps in the rural <b>labour</b> market at <b>peak</b> periods (like harvests). It stresses that overseas workers should be limited to industries and regions where there is evidence of a labour shortage, that they must be employed at local wages and conditions, that the program must contain an element of training and that the workers should come from countries that receive Australia aid dollars. These are sensible starting points. Another crucial element of any such scheme is that overseas workers should go {{home at the end of}} the season with the expectation of returning to Australia the following year. Canada’s long-running seasonal agricultural workers program shows that the promise of future employment dramatically reduces the risk of overstaying: foreign workers have little incentive to disappear into the community if they know a job awaits them next season. Facilitating the annual rotation of workers to and from Australia in this way has other advantages. It enables growers to retain the skills acquired by their offshore labour force. It encourages workers to repatriate money and skills gained in Australia and to invest them in enterprises at home. And it ameliorates the social costs of labour migration by limiting the separation of workers from their families and communities. The Australian government is considering recruiting Pacific Islanders to bolster troop numbers in an overstretched defence force, our rugby teams are stronger for the inclusion of the Pacific’s best players and we are busily importing Pacific doctors and nurses to staff our hospitals with little regard for the impact this brain drain may have on island nations. It’s time to look at creating job opportunities for those lower skilled workers left behind. • Peter Mares and Nic Maclellan work on the Pacific Labour and Australian Horticulture Project at the Institute for Social Research at Swinburne University, with funding from the Australian Research Council.
