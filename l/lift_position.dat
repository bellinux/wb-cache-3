50|$|When {{selecting}} an anchor, {{consider the}} element formwork and {{the ease of}} placement and securing of the anchor prior and during the pouring of the concrete. For example, some of the anchors shown in figures 4-6, can be placed into thin wall elements as the anchor chair maintains the position relative to the element thickness. As {{the orientation of the}} void determines the <b>lift</b> <b>position</b> of the lifting clutch, the wire chair can be secured against the element reinforcement to maintain this orientation during the concrete pour and set.When an anchors load resistance must consider load reduction factors, this would imply that the particular selected anchor will form a different failure crack zone. For example, the anchors depicted in figure 5, a footed anchor has the tendency to overload the concrete cover in thin wall panels, hence is more susceptible to side blow-out failure than a hairpin style anchor, depicted in figure 8.|$|E

In general, camless engine technologies have been known for improving fuel efficiency, enhancing power output, and reducing emissions of internal combustion engines. Electro-hydraulic valve actuators are used to eliminate the camshaft of an existing internal combustion engines and used to control the valve timing and valve duration independently. This paper presents novel electro-hydraulic actuator design, dynamic simulations, and analysis based on design specifications required to satisfy the operation performances.

40|$|The Home <b>Lift,</b> <b>Position</b> and Rehabilitation (HLPR) Chair, {{developed}} at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has unique capabilities and a unique shape as compared to conventional wheelchairs and powered chairs. The evaluation of its static and dynamic stability is necessary to ensure rider safety. Recently, the HLPR Chair was converted into an autonomous forklift for the manufacturing industry. The HLPR forklift includes articulated forks that replace the chair from the original HLPR Chair design. Both the HLPR Chair and HLPR forklift prototypes can carry approximately 114 kg (250 lb) beneath an upper rotation joint (i. e., rotates the seat or the forks). HLPR stability was evaluated based on the American National Standard (ANSI) and the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) wheelchair and forklift standards.

40|$|A {{tilt rotor}} is an {{aircraft}} {{of a special}} kind, which possesses {{the characteristics of a}} helicopter and a fixed-wing airplane. However, there are a great number of important technical problems waiting for settlements. Of them, the flight control system might be a critical one. A tiltrotor aircraft comprising a pair of contra-rotating co-axial tiltable rotors on the longitudinal center line of the aircraft. The rotors may be tiltable sequentially and independently. They may be moveable between a <b>lift</b> <b>position</b> and a flight position in front of or behind the fuselage. In this paper we present a project aimed for the designing of a small scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with Tiltrotor configuration (that uses two rotating rotors). he current paper describes the adopted design methodology, the mathematical and computational models created to represent the UAV, the physical components that constitute the UAV, and the results obtained so far. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), also known as a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) or unmanned aircraft, is a machine which functions either by the remote control of a navigator or pilot or autonomously. A UAV is defined as a powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry payload. India‘s requirement of these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has become prior need for fighting in the northeast, against threat of terrorism, tension along the Pakistan border and its emerging role as a regional naval power and subsequent need for surveillance. The military wants to acquire at least 1, 500 unmanned systems in the next 3 - 4 years, ranging from man-portable drones to high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) vehicles. Indian military is using Israeli-built UAVs such as the Heron, Searcher Mk II and Harop from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). Till date India has mostly deployed medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drones. While the country lags in deployment of UAVs, it wants to develop an integrated program. RUSTOM (English: Warrior) is a Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MALE UAV) being developed by DRDO for the three defence services. Indian scientists are still working on its further developments to meet the requirements. This report is basically a case study on the design, development, technology used, working of Rustom and their earlier predecessors. It also includes the advancements which are going to be installed in the upcoming RUSTOM-H, a unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the experimental {{investigation of the}} cavitation phenomenon and its main consequences on the normal operation of a safety relief valve (SRV). More particularly, limitation of the mass flux discharged and alteration of the hydraulic fluid forces behavior is of main interest for the proper design and sizing of such devices. In nuclear or thermal engineering systems, the use of SRVs is mandatory since it represents the ultimate protection device before an accident occurs, caused by a sudden pressurization of the system. A careful design and sizing of the SRV is therefore essential. The complete understanding of the physics {{taking place in the}} flow through the valve is required to guaranty and optimize the security of the protected process. In order to investigate the above effects of cavitation in a SRV, two different orifice sized valves (API 2 J 3 type and a transparent model based on an API 1 1 / 2 G 3 type) are tested in two different experimental facilities expressly built for this purpose. Instead of using a spring, the design of both valves allows the adjustment of the disc at any desired lift. Hence the static behavior of the valves is investigated. Both facilities, operating at different magnitude scales, allow the study of single phase and cavitating flow conditions required to properly determine the most important hydraulic characteristics, and access on any potential scaling effect between both sized SRVs. Experimental techniques used for the determination of the hydraulic characteristics include temperature, flow rate, fluid forces and pressure measurements both upstream and downstream the test sections. Results show a similar influence of cavitation on the flow characteristics of both valves, minimizing any potential scaling effect. The liquid pressure recovery factor FL, which is normally used to identify a choked flow condition in a control valve, is experimentally determined {{for the first time in}} a SRV. The existence of a local minimum located at small openings of the lift indicates a change on the flow characteristics of both valves, which is related to the location of the minimum cross section of the flow that does not remain constant for every <b>lift</b> <b>position.</b> An extended experimental campaign is performed to analyse the effect of the blowdown ring adjustment located around the nozzle of the API 2 J 3 valve. Results confirm that the position of the ring has an important contribution for the hydraulic forces acting on the valve disc. In the second part of the research, precise optical diagnostic techniques are successfully applied in the transparent valve to locally characterize the flow topology in a SRV experiencing cavitation. These results are innovative and enrich the experimental database available in the literature for the characterization and understanding of the flow physics in such devices. In a first configuration, high speed visualization is applied to observe qualitatively the flow pattern and the inception of liquid vaporization. Particle tracking results suggest that vapor bubbles are formed in the core of vortices detached from the shear layers attached to the valve. These rotational structures promote lower pressure regions allowing the liquid to vaporize. In the second configuration, particle image velocimetry is applied to extract the velocity field in both single phase and cavitating flow conditions. Results of PIV confirm the existence of a submerged jet just downstream the minimum section. This jet is characterized by two non-symmetric shear layers at its sides. Under cavitation conditions, PIV results confirm that vapor bubbles are formed preferentially inside the jet shear layers. The phenomenon of mass flux limitation caused by cavitation is reproduced at small openings of the valve and interaction with the flow topology is highlighted. It is observed that limitation of the flow occurs when the vena contracta is shifted towards the minimum geometrical section of the flow. Finally, instabilities of the flow downstream the critical section are investigated in the frequency domain by means of time resolved data. Results suggest that vortex shedding mechanism is dominated by a constant Strouhal number which is slightly affected by the valve opening. In the last part of the research, the methodology used in water is extended and applied to cryogenic liquids. Two different geometries are investigated experimentally and numerically using water and liquid nitrogen as working fluids. Results suggest that both the flow coefficient (determined at single flow conditions), and the liquid recovery factor (used to identify choked flows), are independent on the fluid properties and therefore, an hydraulic similarity relation can be proposed. This research project was carried out at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (VKI), in Belgium, in close collaboration and with the funding of Centre Technique des Industries Mécaniques (CETIM) in France.

40|$|Background. The {{sniffing}} {{position is}} often considered optimal for direct laryngoscopy. Another concept of airway configuration involving a laryngeal vestibule axis and two curves {{has also been}} suggested. We investigated whether this theory can be supported mathematically and if it supports the sniffing position as being optimal for direct laryngoscopy. Methods. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed in 42 normal adult volunteers. The airway passage was divided into two curves - primary (oro-pharyngeal curve) and secondary (pharyngo-glotto-tracheal curve). Airway configuration was evaluated in the neutral, extension, head <b>lift,</b> and sniffing <b>positions.</b> The airway passage, point of inflection (where the two curves meet), its tangent, and the line of sight were plotted on each scan. Results. The point of inflection lay within the laryngeal vestibule in all <b>positions.</b> The head <b>lift</b> and sniffing <b>positions</b> caused the tangent {{to the point of}} inflection to approximate the horizontal plane. The sniffing, extension, and head <b>lift</b> <b>positions</b> caused a reduction in the area between the line of sight and the airway curve compared with the neutral position. Conclusions. A two-curve theory is proposed as a basis for explaining airway configuration. The changes in these curves with head and neck positioning support the sniffing position as optimal for direct laryngoscopy. Application of this new concept to other forms of laryngoscopy should be investigated. © 2010 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Journal of Anaesthesia.
