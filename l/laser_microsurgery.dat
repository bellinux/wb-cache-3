2500|$|These {{improvements}} in surgical techniques have allowed many tumours to be resected (removed) [...] by transoral (through the mouth) surgical approaches (TOS), using transoral endoscopic {{head and neck}} surgery (HNS). Consequently surgery became used more, increasing to 35% of cases by 2012. This approach has proven safety, efficacy and tolerability, and includes two main minimally invasive techniques, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral <b>laser</b> <b>microsurgery</b> (TLM). No direct comparisons of these two techniques have been conducted, and clinical trials in head and neck cancer such as ECOG 3311 allow either. They are associated with substantial postoperative morbidity, depending on extent of resection but compared to older techniques have shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, less pain, and less need for gastrostomy or tracheostomy, and less long term effects, which are minimal {{in the absence of}} postoperative radiation (RT), or chemoradiation (CRT). TORS has the practical advantage that angled telescopes and rotating robotic surgical arms provide better line of sight. Outcomes of minimally invasive procedures also compare favourably with more invasive ones. In early stage disease, including involvement of neck nodes, TORS produces a 2-year survival of 80–90%. TLM similarly, is reported to have a five-year survival of 78% and local control rates of 85–97%. In addition to early disease, minimally invasive surgery has been used in advanced cases, with up to 90% local control and disease specific survival. Postoperative swallowing was excellent in 87%, but long term dysphagia was associated with larger (T4) cancers, especially if involving the base of the tongue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a novel, motorized, multi-degrees-of-freedom (DoF), microsurgical forceps tool is presented, {{which is}} based on a {{master-slave}} teleoperation architecture. The slave device is a 7 -DoF manipulator with: (i) 6 -DoF positioning and orientation, (ii) 1 open/close gripper DoF; and (iii) an integrated force/torque sensor for tissue grip-force measurement. The master device is a 7 -DoF haptic interface which teleoperates the slave device, and provides haptic feedback in its gripper interface. The combination of the device and the surgeon interface replaces the manual, hand-held device providing easy-to-use and ergonomic tissue control, simplifying the surgical tasks. This makes the system suitable to real surgical scenarios in the operating room (OR). The performance of the system was analysed through the evaluation of teleoperation control and characterization of gripping force. The new system offers an overall positioning error of less than 400 μm demonstrating its safety and accuracy. Improved system precision, usability, and ergonomics point to the potential suitability of the device for the OR and its ability to advance haptic-feedback-enhanced transoral <b>laser</b> <b>microsurgeries...</b>|$|R

40|$|Respiratory papillomatosis is a {{rare and}} often severe disease, usually {{localized}} in the larynx. It may cause respiratory distress and even life-threatening obstruction of the airways. Treat-ment is generally based on the evaporation of the lesions with a CO 2 <b>laser,</b> but <b>microsurgery,</b> cytotoxic and/or cytostatic drugs, interferons, and vaccines are also used. Cidofovir [(S) - 1 -(3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) cytosine] (HPMPC) was shown to suppress the growth of tumors induced by rabbit papillomavirus as well as human papillomavirus (HPV). The efficacy of cidofovir was assessed in 17 patients with se-vere respiratory papillomatosis. Cidofovir at a concentration of 2. 5 mg/ml was injected directly in the different laryngeal papillomatous lesions during microlaryngoscopy under general anes-thesia. Biopsies were taken before the treatment was started both for anatomopathology and vi-ral typing. HPMPC kinetics in serum was moni-tored in three patients, the drug levels being de-termined by high-performance liquid chroma-tography. Complete disappearance of the papillomatosis was observed in 14 patients. Four patients relapsed and were successfully treated again with cidofovir. Of the three remain-ing patients, one progressed while under treat-ment with cidofovir, after an initial marked re-sponse.

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether <b>laser</b> endoscopic <b>microsurgery</b> is a reliable and appropriate approach to treatment of laryngeal supraglottic cancer.

Surgical steps and oncologic results are reported. These 12 patients with supraglottic cancer underwent transoral laser surgery (TNM classification: T 1, 3 patients; T 2, 9 patients; N-, 9 patients; N+, 3 patients; M-, 12 patients). On the basis of the different subsites removed, the following resections were performed: 1 limited excisional biopsy (false chord), 3 wide excisional biopsies (2 or 3 subsites), 2 simple epiglottectomies, 1 extended epiglottectomy, 3 horizontal supraglottic laryngectomies, and 2 horizontal supraglottic laryngectomies that were extended to the anterior commissure and to one arytenoid, respectively. Five patients underwent functional neck dissection, and one patient underwent post-operative radiotherapy at sites of tumour and lymph nodes. Temporary tracheotomy was carried out in 10 patients. Mean follow-up was 33. 3 months. No local recurrences were noted. Local control was thus 100 %. Aspiration was the main post-operative problem, but there were no cases of aspiration-associated pneumonia. Moreover, no patient needed laryngectomy or a permanent tracheotomy for aspiration. In conclusion, although our experience with supraglottic cancers treated by endoscopy is still too limited to confirm the definitive oncologic validity of this type of surgery, in our hands, it seems to be a reasonable tool in selected cases and a safe, time- and cost-effective alternative to traditional surgery or radiotherapy for selected supraglottic carcinomas...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>lasers</b> in <b>microsurgery</b> {{and in particular}} in neurosurgery offers many advantages such as, e. g., hemostasis, no-touch (i. e. aseptic) procedures, and pinpoint accuracy. However, these advantages can often not be fully exploited since adequate laser beam delivery techniques are not available. Traditionally micromanipulators attached to the surgical microscope and also laser-handpieces are used. Such techniques require that one hand of the surgeon is used to direct the laser beam, leaving only one hand free for the adjustments of the microscope, suctioning, and dissection. Moreover, precise and continuous aiming along complex targets in deep confined anatomical spaces is extremely difficult with such systems. In this work, we present a novel technique for laser surgery which allows to overcome the basic pitfalls of the traditional delivery techniques. The idea is to slave the laser position to the surgeons line of sight. Such an eye guided laser surgery allows to free completely the surgeon's hands and enables him to easily guide the laser along any target line in the object field of the microscope by simply looking at it. The goal of this thesis work consisted in demonstrating the technical feasibility of this idea by developing an experimental prototype. In a first step the problems of eye tracking on an operating microscope are addressed. Among the different possibilities to detect the position of gaze, we have chosen a video based technique. A special eyepiece allowing to obtain the infrared image of the surgeon's eye and an optimized infrared illumination source allowing to enhance the contrast of the eye image are described. The second step consisted in critically reviewing the different solutions to couple a laser beam to the operating microscope and in discussing all aspects concerning the system soft- and hardware. The technical performances of this first eye-guided laser aiming system are then analyzed. The results confirm that the speed of response {{of the system is}} sufficient for microsurgery. The resolution of the laser aiming in the operating field depends on the magnification of the microscope. A value of 62 micrometers is achieved at the highest magnification. A second part of the thesis is concerned with the study of some aspects of human vision relevant to the ability of the surgeon to control the laser with his regard. The most important issues in this context are saccadic eye movements, the fixation characteristics and ocular dominance. They have been investigated by measuring the corresponding characteristics of test persons on the eye guided laser system. The eye movements during laser aiming consists of a succession of rapid saccades and longer fixations of the eye. The dynamics of these jerks constitutes a problem with respect to laser dosimetry. We demonstrate that adequate filtering allows to obtain a smooth laser aiming with a constant laser energy deposition. The stability of fixation is analyzed with respect to ocular dominance and it is shown that there is no disturbing influence on the ability to maintain stable laser aiming. The system is slightly sensitive to head motions of the surgeon. A 3 -D mathematical model has been developed to describe this sensitivity. The model has been verified experimentally. It constitutes to our knowledge the first description of the sensitivity of the eye tracking technique to head motions. It allows to optimize the parameters of the prototype in order to limit the effect of head movements on the accuracy of the eye tracking. The experiments on eye guided laser aiming with test persons also revealed that untrained persons are able to perform complex laser aiming and point addressing tasks with this first prototype with a minimum of training. The use of the eye guided laser system in real operating conditions is described in the last part of this work. Different surgeons were able to perform the first eye guided laser assisted microvascular anastomoses in vivo on the rat. One of them used the system {{for the first time and}} his successful interventions clearly demonstrated the important ergonomic advantages of this highly evolved man-machine interface...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: During {{anaphase}} B in mitosis, polymerization {{and sliding}} of overlapping spindle microtubules (MTs) {{contribute to the}} outward movement the spindle pole bodies (SPBs). To probe the mechanism of spindle elongation, we combine fluorescence microscopy, photobleaching, and <b>laser</b> <b>microsurgery</b> in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Results: We demonstrate that a green laser cuts intracellular structures in yeast cells with high spatial specificity. By using <b>laser</b> <b>microsurgery,</b> we cut mitotic spindles labeled with GFP-tubulin at various stages of anaphase B. Although cutting generally caused early anaphase spindles to disassemble, midanaphase spindle fragments continued to elongate. In particular, when the spindle was cut near a SPB, the larger spindle fragment continued to elongate {{in the direction of}} the cut. Photobleach marks showed that sliding of overlapping midzone MTs was responsible for the elongation of the spindle fragment. Spindle midzone fragments not connected to either of the two spindle poles also elongated. Equatorial microtubule organizing center (eMTOC) activity was not affected in cells with one detached pole but was delayed or absent in cells with two detached poles. Conclusions: These studies reveal that the spindle midzone is necessary and sufficient for the stabilization of MT ends and for spindle elongation. By contrast, SPBs are not required for elongation, but they contribute to the attachment of the nuclear envelope and chromosomes to the spindle, and to cell cycle progression. <b>Laser</b> <b>microsurgery</b> provides a means by which to dissect the mechanics of the spindle in yeast...|$|E
