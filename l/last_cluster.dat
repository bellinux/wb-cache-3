Reference strains for this cluster are PCC6301 (formerly Anacycstis nidulans) and PCC6312, which were isolated from fresh water in Texas and California, respectively. Cluster 2 also {{is characterized by}} low salt tolerance. Cells are obligate photoautrotrophs, lack phycoerythrin, and are thermophilic. The reference strain PCC6715 was isolated from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park. Cluster 3 includes phycoerythrin-lacking marine Synechococcus species that are euryhaline, i.e. capable of growth in both marine and freshwater environments. Several strains, including the reference strain PCC7003, are facultative heterotrophs and require vitamin B12 for growth. Cluster 4 contains a single isolate, PCC7335. This strain is obligate marine. This strain contains phycoerthrin and was first isolated from the intertidal zone in Puerto Peñasco, Mexico. The <b>last</b> <b>cluster</b> contains what had previously {{been referred to as}} ‘marine A and B clusters’ of Synechococcus. These cells are truly marine and have been isolated from both the coastal and the open ocean. All strains are obligate photoautrophs and are around 0.6-1.7 µm in diameter. This cluster is, however, further divided into a population that either contains (cluster 5.1) or does not contain (cluster 5.2) phycoerythrin. The reference strains are WH8103 for the phycoerythrin-containing strains and WH5701 for those strains that lack this pigment. [...] More recently, Badger et al. (2002) proposed the division of the cyanobacteria into a α- and a β-subcluster based on the type of rbcL (large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) found in these organisms. α-cyanobacteria were defined to contain a form IA, while β-cyanobacteria were defined to contain a form IB of this gene. In support for this division Badger et al. analyze the phylogeny of carboxysomal proteins, which appear to support this division. Also, two particular bicarbonate transport systems appear to only be found in α-cyanobacteria, which lack carboxysomal carbonic anhydrases.|$|E

40|$|The {{technological}} and safety properties of 35 indigenous strains of Enterococcus faecium isolated from two Egyptian cheeses were characterised {{in order to}} determine their ability for rational manufacture of diversified and typical dairy products in the Middle East. A great diversity was observed within the 35 strains {{on the basis of their}} technological properties. A statistical analysis made it possible to distribute the 35 strains of E. faecium into different groups. Three groups were identified in terms of their acidification activity, measured by the Cinac system: a group of strains that quickly acidified milk, a second that moderately acidified milk, and a <b>last</b> <b>cluster</b> that revealed weak acidification activity. On the basis of texturing properties that were evaluated using a texturometer and a viscometer, a cluster of strains produced viscous and firm gels, a second cluster included fairly viscous, firm and cohesive gels, and a last group generated slightly viscous, but firm and very cohesive gels. By considering the aroma profiles that were determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, four clusters were identified. One cluster displayed a high dimethyl disulfide level, a second group of strains was highly aromatic, a third cluster led to typical "lactic" products, and the <b>last</b> <b>cluster</b> made it possible to obtain low aromatic products. None of the 35 strains proved to be beta-haemolytic on the basis of the characterisation of their safety properties. The resistance to 20 antibiotics was assessed by the disc diffusion method. The 35 isolates were sensitive to 12 antibiotics, and among them, one isolate was resistant to only two antibiotics (nalixidic acid and streptomycin). The resistance to eight antibiotics was strain-dependant. Finally, this study demonstrates that some indigenous strains of E. faecium displayed interesting technological properties for cheese manufacture, together with good safety characteristics. They could be useful for the manufacture of typical products in Egypt. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Different check-in behaviors with the same check-in location will produce the phenomenon of location duplication because of location candidate function in LBSN system. The current density-based spatial clustering algorithms have the following problems: ①difficulty to find density peak point. ②clustering error caused by check-in point objects with duplicate positions. In order to solve these problems, we proposed a fast search density peaks and clustering method for check-in data, based on clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP). Firstly, position repetition frequency was introduced and calculated to illustrate the number of the check-in position duplications data. Secondly, a new type of point feature was constructed by adding position repetition frequency of the original check-in position data, which was used as study object to search density peaks. At <b>last,</b> <b>clustering</b> algorithm based on density peak point was constructed in which density connectivity was taken into account to ensure the continuity and integrity of density clusters.
