5000|$|Some South and Middle American Turdus thrushes {{are also}} named as robins {{such as the}} {{rufous-collared}} robin. The Australian [...] "robin redbreast", more correctly the scarlet robin (Petroica multicolor), is {{more closely related to}} the crows and jays than it is to the European robin. It belongs to the family Petroicidae, commonly called [...] "Australasian robins". The red-billed <b>leiothrix</b> (<b>Leiothrix</b> <b>lutea)</b> is sometimes named [...] "Pekin robin" [...] by aviculturalists. Another group of Old World Flycatchers, this time from Africa and Asia, is the genus Copsychus; its members are known as magpie-robins, one of which, the Oriental magpie robin (C. saularis), is the national bird of Bangladesh.|$|R
40|$|Capsule The Red-billed <b>Leiothrix</b> (<b>Leiothrix</b> <b>lutea)</b> is a superficially sexually {{monochromatic}} colourful bird {{native to}} the Indian subcontinent, which has colonized many locations across the world as an introduced species. We investigated the best method to accurately sex the species, capturing and measuring the colour and external morphometry of a sample of 57 individuals, which were later sexed molecularly from blood samples. We found that sexes showed no dimorphism in biometry or size of wing coloured-patches. However, a Discriminant Function based on hue of the throat, chroma of the crown and lightness of the breast allowed us to determine sex with an accuracy of 91 %. © 2013 Copyright British Trust for Ornithology.

50|$|The red-billed <b>leiothrix</b> (<b>Leiothrix</b> <b>lutea)</b> is {{a member}} of the family Leiothrichidae, native to {{southern}} China and the Himalayas. Adults have bright red bills and a dull yellow ring around their eyes. Their backs are dull olive green, and they have a bright yellow-orange throat with a yellow chin; females are somewhat duller than males, and juveniles have black bills. It has also been introduced in various parts of the world, with small populations of escapees having existed in Japan since the 1980s. It has become a common cagebird and amongst aviculturists it goes by various names: Pekin robin, Pekin nightingale, Japanese nightingale, and Japanese (hill) robin, the last two being misnomers as it is not native to Japan.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} Habronematidae parasites (order Spirurida) have been {{described}} as occasional parasites of avian species; however, reports on passerines are relatively uncommon. From 2007 to 2008, 11 passerine deaths at The North Carolina Zoological Park in Asheboro, NC, USA, were associated with ventricular habronemiasis, which was determined to be the cause of death or a major contributing factor in 10 of the 11 individuals. The number and species affected were 5 Red-billed <b>Leiothrix</b> (<b>Leiothrix</b> <b>lutea),</b> 2 Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), 2 Golden-headed Manakin (Pipra erythrocephala), 1 Blue-grey Tanager (Thraupis episcopus), and 1 Emerald Starling (Coccycolius iris). Affected animals displayed nonspecific clinical signs or were found dead. The ventricular nematodes were consistent in morphology with Procyrnea sp. Koilin fragmentation with secondary bacterial and fungal infections was the most frequently observed pathologic lesion. Secondary visceral amyloidosis, attributed to chronic inflammation associated with nematodiasis, was present in 4 individuals. An insect intermediate host is suspected but was not identified. Native passerine species within or around the aviary may be serving as sylvatic hosts...|$|R
40|$|The Red-billed <b>Leiothrix</b> (<b>Leiothrix</b> <b>lutea)</b> is an {{invasive}} species which {{has recently been}} found to be locally abundant in eastern Liguria (Italy). The song production of this bird was recorded over the course of an entire year (2011) and evaluated using both aural information and applying innovative automatic processing metrics. Our findings revealed that the Red-billed Leiothrix has loud vocalizations that are heard for most of the year, including in July and August when other birds are silent. Its song production has been estimated to amount to 37 % of the sounds uttered by the entire bird community. The next most vocal species are the European Robin (36 %), the Common Blackbird (18 %), the Subalpine Warbler (5 %) and the Sardinian Warbler (1 %). The Red-billed Leiothrix {{can be seen as a}} new acoustically dominant species and, consequently, a potential modifier of the soundscape patterns of the indigenous bird community. The modification of acoustic traits in the repertoire of both indigenous species and the Red-billed Leiothrix is to be expected according to a co-evolution hypothesis...|$|R

A survey for forest birds was conducted in Kalaupapa National Historical Park in 2005 to determine presence-absence and abundance. Forest bird surveys were conducted using the variable circular plot method. Survey stations were established 140 m apart along six transects of variable length. Stations were surveyed for birds from March – May 2005. Also included in the analysis are data from a Hawaii Forest Bird Survey in 2004 for two transects located in the park. Of the nine native species that once inhabited the island, only three remain: We detected the Apapane (Himatione sanguinea), Iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea) and Maui Amakihi (Hemignathus virens wilsoni). As on other islands, Molokai now supports a number of non-native birds including: the Barn Owl (Tyto alba), Black Francolin (Francolinus francolinus), Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis), House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), Japanese Bush-warbler (Cettia diphone), Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Nutmeg Mannikin (Lonchura punctulata), Red-billed <b>Leiothrix</b> (<b>Leiothrix</b> <b>lutea),</b> Skylark (Alauda arvensis), Spotted Dove (Streptopelia chinensis), and White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus). The results from the survey will be used to develop comprehensive monitoring and management plans for avian species in Kalaupapa National Historical Park.

Ka'āpahu, Haleakalā National Park was acquired by the National Park Service in 1999. Inventories of vegetation, forest birds, and non-native mammals in this newly acquired area were identified as a priority for the National Park Service. To satisfy the forest bird and non-native mammal inventories, presence or absence and distribution surveys were conducted in 2002. A follow-up forest bird survey was conducted in May 2005. Results of the forest bird surveys showed the presence of four native forest bird species: Maui 'Amakihi (Hemignathus virens wilsoni), Maui 'Alauahio (Paroreomyza montana newtoni), 'I'iwi (Vestiaria coccinea), and 'Apapane (Himatione sanguinea sanguinea). Five alien forest bird species were detected: the Japanese Bush-warbler (Cettia diphone), Hwamei (Garrulax canorus), Red-billed <b>Leiothrix</b> (<b>Leiothrix</b> <b>lutea),</b> Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), and Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis). No endangered bird species were detected. Results suggest that non-native Japanese Bush-warbler, Hwamei and Japanese White-eye may be expanding their range. Results of the non-native mammals survey showed presence of black rats (Rattus rattus), small Indian mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus), feral pigs (Sus scrofa), axis deer (Axis axis), and feral goats (Capra hircus) throughout the transect. We did not capture or record signs of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), Polynesian rats (Rattus exulans), mice (Mus musculus), dogs (Canis lupus), or feral cats (Felis catus) during the survey. However, based on information in other areas throughout the park and on Maui it is very likely that all of these animals occur in Ka'āpahu. The Haleakalā National Park and the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring program, Pacific Island Network funded this project. This inventory was carried out under a cooperative agreement (Task Agreement No. CA 8012 -AO- 001) between the National Park Service, Pacific Island Network and the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa...|$|R
40|$|Angiosperms {{diversification}} {{was primarily}} driven by pollinator agents, but non-pollinator agents also promoted floral evolution. Gentiana lutea shows pollinator driven flower color variation in NW Spain. We test whether insect herbivores and livestock, which frequently feed in G. lutea, {{play a role}} in G. lutea flower color variation, by answering the following questions: (i) Do insect herbivores and grazing livestock show flower color preferences when feeding on G. <b>lutea?</b> (<b>ii)</b> Do mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (seed predators, insect herbivores and livestock) jointly affect G. lutea reproductive success? Insect herbivores fed more often on yellow flowering individuals but they did not affect seed production, whereas livestock affected seed production but did not show clear color preferences. Our data indicate that flower color variation of G. lutea is not affected by insect herbivores or grazing livestock...|$|R
40|$|The African bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a {{polyphagous}} pest that attacks many crops in sub-Saharan Africa. The pest is currently managed through chemical control, and by planting Bt-transgenic cotton. Trichogrammatoidea lutea Girault (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is an indigenous egg parasitoid of H. armigera in southern Africa. The study was undertaken {{to determine the}} potential of T. lutea as a biological control agent for augmentative releases {{as an alternative to}} chemical control, and {{to pave the way for}} the development of a mass-rearing method. The biology of T. lutea was examined in the laboratory on H. armigera, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe), and Cadra (formerly Ephestia) cautella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The objectives of the study were to determine (i) the exposure time of UV-irradiation required for killing the embryos of the hosts and the effect of UV-irradiated eggs on life history parameters of T. <b>lutea,</b> (<b>ii)</b> which host(s) and temperature(s) (18, 21, 24, 27, 30 and 35 °C) are suitable for mass-rearing of T. lutea, and (iii) the longevity and age-related reproductive biology of T. lutea on H. armigera. Findings of this study showed that 13 minutes of UV-irradiation were sufficient to kill embryos of all three host species. Life history parameters were not influenced by UV-irradiation but by host species. Parasitism, number of progeny per parasitized egg, proportion of females, and developmental time of T. lutea aried on different host species at temperatures ranging from 18 to 30 °C. Trichogrammatoidea lutea did not develop at 35 °C. Overall parasitism by T. lutea was higher on H. armigera and Cadra cautella compared to Chilo partellus. The number of progeny per parasitized egg was highest on H. armigera compared to Cadra cautella and Chilo partellus. The proportion of females was highest on Chilo partellus, intermediate on Cadra cautella, and lowest on H. armigera. For all species and temperatures tested, parasitism and number of progeny per parasitized egg by T. lutea was highest on H. armigera at 27 °C. The lower threshold for development of T. lutea on all hosts was approximately 12 °C. Female T. lutea parasitized eggs of H. armigera soon after eclosion, with the highest parasitism achieved on the day of eclosion. Though T. lutea parasitized eggs for up to 14 days, it may not be economically viable to keep them in cultures for more than three days since progeny became male biased three days after eclosion. The average longevity of female and male T. lutea was 9 and 6 days, respectively. The life table parameters of T. lutea, the net replacement rate (Ro), mean generation time (T), and instantaneous rate of population increase (rm) were 25. 5, 9. 79, and 0. 33, respectively. The timing of inundative releases of T. lutea must be synchronised with the time that eggs of H. armigera are abundant in the field. The results of this study indicate that T. lutea is a good candidate for further testing for augmentative biological control of H. armigera in the field. If successful, T. lutea may provide opportunities for expanding tactics in the management of H. armigera in southern Africa. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.
