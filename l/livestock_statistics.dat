40|$|Introduction : Family Poultry (FP) are {{birds of}} {{indigenous}} breeds living in almost symbiotic relationship with human communities. The chickens are usually free ranging, or have very limited restrains on {{their access to}} the village environment. African <b>livestock</b> population <b>statistics</b> for 1995 indicates poultry {{to be the most}} numerous species of farm animal (Anonymous, 1996 a). More than 80 % of poultry are kept in rural areas and contribute substantially to annual egg and meat production (Sonaiya, 1997). Throughout Africa poultry production stems from ancient traditional practices. FP is the most important type of poultry kept on the continent. In general, village producers keep small flocks of between 5 and 20 birds per household (Gueye, 1997 a). Women and children {{play a key role in}} their management (Kitalyi, 1996). Because of its productivity, FP production has been neglected and is frequently considered by farmers as an insignificant occupation compared with other agricultural activities. Nevertheless, outside urban centers and especially in non-coastal areas, FP provides the population with a vital source of protein and income. In addition, they play an important role within the context of many social and/ or religious ceremonies. Although this type of poultry constitutes an important part of food security for rural households in South Africa, scientists have not explored this area of research for improving or recording this production system. Yet, FP survived for decades without being wiped out, in the interim, their keepers have gathered and stored a wealth of knowledge and experience, ensuring the survival of this genetic resource. The objective of this study was to collect the baseline data on FP production systems, determine their production constraints and achieve data for future use in the intervention strategies...|$|R
40|$|Large mammals re-introduced into {{harsh and}} {{unpredictable}} environments {{are vulnerable to}} stochastic effects, particularly in times of global climate change. The Mongolian Gobi is home to several rare large ungulates such as re-introduced Przewalski's horses (Equus ferus przewalskii) and Asiatic wild asses (Equus hemionus), but also to a millennium-old semi-nomadic livestock herding culture. The Gobi is prone to large inter-annual environmental fluctuations, but the winter 2009 / 2010 was particularly severe. Millions of livestock died and the Przewalski's horse population in the Gobi crashed. We used spatially explicit <b>livestock</b> loss <b>statistics,</b> ranger survey data and GPS telemetry to {{provide insight into the}} effect of a catastrophic climate event on the two sympatric wild equid species and the livestock population in light of their different space use strategies. Herders in and around the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area lost on average 67 % of their livestock. Snow depth varied locally, resulting in livestock losses following an east-west gradient. Herders had few possibilities for evasion, as competition for available winter camps was high. Przewalski's horses used three different winter ranges, two in the east and one in the west. Losses averaged 60 %, but differed hugely between east and west. Space use of Przewalski's horses was extremely conservative, as groups did not attempt to venture beyond their known home ranges. Asiatic wild asses seemed to have suffered few losses by shifting their range westwards. The catastrophic winter 2009 / 2010 provided a textbook example for how vulnerable small and spatially confined populations are in an environment prone to environmental fluctuations and catastrophes. This highlights the need for disaster planning by local herders, multiple re-introduction sites with spatially dispersed populations for re-introduced Przewalski's horses, and a landscape-level approach beyond protected area boundaries to allow for migratory or nomadic movements in Asiatic wild asses...|$|R
40|$|In the Philippines, {{several studies}} {{pointed out that}} samples from Rice and Corn Production Survey no longer suffice to provide “acceptable ” {{estimates}} of <b>Livestock</b> and Poultry <b>statistics.</b> Simulation studies considered the use of inventories of different animals as stratification variables or size measures. However, {{the results showed that}} the use of a particular animal type would not necessarily yield efficient estimates for other animal inventories. This leads to the use of multiple frame sampling methodology as an ideal data collection method which entails high costs. This paper proposes the use Principal Component (PC) -based scores as the stratification variable as an alternative to multiple frame sampling to lower the costs because a PC summarizes information contained in a set of auxiliary variables (e. g. inventory for different animal types); nevertheless, PC’s also give premium to variables with large variability. Thus, the relatively “rare ” animals, i. e. those present in very few barangays only, can potentially sway the PC to their advantage {{at the expense of the}} more “common ” and, perhaps, the more important animal types. Hence, the authors recommend that only the inventories of the more important animals are included in the generation of the PC scores that will be used to stratify the population of interest. Various sampling experiments are performed using barangay level data on different animal inventories in order to determine the efficiency of the estimates using the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 83 - 94. This study {{investigates the}} {{tensions}} surrounding livestock enumeration in the Cape Colony {{in the late}} nineteenth century. The study situates <b>livestock</b> <b>statistics</b> in an historical context which is intended to provide some indication of what these statistics meant for contemporary actors. This study looks at the significance of the enumeration oflivestock by the state, both for the state and for farmers, and focuses specifically on the semi-nomadic 'trekfarming' population ofthree districts of the Cape Colony - ClanwiHiam, Calvinia and Namaqualand - referred to {{for the purposes of this}} study as the North-western Cape. Livestock enumeration was considered a central component of the officially-sanctioned fund of 'knowledge' on the colony's livestock that was used as the basis of state policy and pastoral reform interventions. <b>Livestock</b> <b>statistics</b> were also a contentious issue in the colony during this period. While certain sectors of the inhabitants of the colony viewed statistics as an indispensable aspect of 'modern' life and put pressure on the colony's civil service to provide more reliable statistics, other sectors of the population viewed enumeration with suspicion. This thesis looks at the tensions surrounding agricultural statistics, and argues that this contest had its roots in the fact that statistics had come to be regarded as a symbol of the 'progressive' agriculture that was sweeping the colony during this period. Ultimately, however, the effectiveness of state knowledge on livestock throughout this period would prove to be constrained by the state's particular preoccupation with the growth of 'progressive' agriculture. Gaps existed in official knowledge on agriculture in the colony which would allow farmers in outlying regions such as the North-western Cape a degree of liberty in their farming practices and use of natural resources...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examined}} the optimal combination of enterprises in livestock industry in South-West Nigeria. Stratified random sampling technique was employed in collecting data from 360 <b>livestock</b> farmers. Descriptive <b>statistics,</b> budgetary technique and linear programming model were employed for data analysis. Six livestock enterprises, non-integrated poultry, piggery and fishery and horizontally integrated poultry/fishery, poultry/piggery and poultry/piggery/fishery were identified. Livestock farmers {{in the area are}} aged with low level of education and large household size do not operate at optimal level based on the available resources. The budgetary analysis shows that the most profitable enterprise combination is integrated poultry and piggery while the enterprise that yielded the least net farm income is non-integrated poultry enterprise. The profitability of integrated and non-integrated livestock enterprises is limited by high cost of production in which the feed cost constitutes the lion’s share. The optimal enterprise combinations are the integrated poultry and fishery and integrated poultry/piggery enterprise with poultry/piggery combination being the most efficient. The policy implication from this study requires that both farmers and government must team up to find a means of reducing feed cost by financing livestock research centers and state agricultural development programmes to develop genetically improved breeds of livestock which efficiently converts feed. Labour as a resource was the most limited in the area, there is therefore the need for research to focus critically on indigenously automated livestock equipment that can perform tasks like feeding, vaccination, etc. Farmers in South-West Nigeria and by extension, Nigeria as a whole should concentrate and intensify their livestock combination practices especially that of poultry/piggery, which is the optimal combination enterprise and that of poultry/fishery enterprise combination because of their high profitability levels.

It addresses two main problems. First, it makes a spatially explicit assessment of fodder supply and demand extracted from a data poor environment. Fodder supply is assessed by combining rainfall-based production functions and rule-based assessment for prevailing land use. Fodder demand {{is based on a}} data consistency check of <b>livestock</b> <b>statistics</b> concerning herd size, composition and geographical distribution. Second, individual herd movements have to be evaluated jointly in concurrent migration patterns to assess local pressures on fodder resources. We, therefore, apply a transition model that relates stock levels to seasonal migration routings for all Afar sub-clans jointly so as to localize the hot spots where feed demand exceeds forage supply. Critical areas come to the fore, especially, near fringes of Highlands and {{in the southern part of}} the Afar. A sensitivity test shows that ‘Baseline’ scenario is close to the ‘Best’ but under ‘Worst’, the Afar region would fall into despair.

40|$|In the 19 th century, {{statistics}} in Luxembourg {{were only the}} by-product of governmental administration for purposes of the trade with neighbouring countries and the organisation of parliamentary elections (see also 1. 2). As Luxembourg was a rather poor country in the 19 th century, the government hesitated {{to spend money on}} a central statistical office (CSO). The more so as the senior officials did not understand the need of having a separate statistical office. A commission of high senior government officials from the ministry of the interior (Arrêté royal grand-ducal du 6 mars 1855) was in charge of planing the statistical needs of the country and the work was delegated to minor civil servants. The first “statistical office ” or more appropriately, the first statistical service was founded early in the 20 th century (instituted by law the 25 th of June 1900) and became an independent institution in 1921 when the commission of senior government officials, in charge of supervising the work, was suppressed. The foundation of the Office de Statistiques in 1900 marked the beginning of regular statistical publications.
