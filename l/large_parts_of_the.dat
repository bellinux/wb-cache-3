5|$|From {{the late}} 19th century onwards the castle site {{was subject to}} {{considerable}} development. A new road – Upper Bugle Street – was built through the old bailey site, and various local council buildings constructed.

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{industries}} in the Guild's Lake area was a sawmill built in the 1880s. Although <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land remained undeveloped until the early 20thcentury, lumber mills, grain storage structures, railroads, and docks appeared along the waterfront. The Guild's Lake Rail Yard, built by the Northern Pacific Railway in the 1880s, became an important switching yard for trains.|$|E
5|$|The Albanian {{revolt of}} 1432–36 {{was a series}} of {{conflicts}} between Albanian rebels and the Ottoman Empire during the early period of Ottoman rule in the region.

5|$|Arbroath was the {{location}} of the Battle of Arbroath in 1446. A series of disagreements between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath, Alexander Lindsay, third Earl of Crawford and Bishop James Kennedy of St Andrews resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop's lands and burning his properties. Lindsay was excommunicated for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. <b>Large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the Duke of Edinburgh. After the flood the Memorial Park, which had been laid out after World War II was extended.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the colonial period, the region of South Kasai formed part of the Luba Empire, a {{federation}} of local kingdoms with a degree of cultural uniformity. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baluba spread across <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kasai-Katanga savannah along the Kasai river basin and eventually developed into a number of ethnic subgroups, notably the Luba-Kasai and the Luba-Katanga. Although never united into a single centralised state, the groups retained a degree of emotional attachment based around shared origin myths and cultural practices. Other groups, like the Songye and the Kanyok, also had long histories in the Kasai region.|$|E

5|$|In {{that year}} he rebelled against Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518), whose fiscal {{stringency}} {{and promotion of}} Miaphysitism were widely unpopular, and allowed Vitalian to quickly win over <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army {{and the people of}} Thrace to his cause. After scoring a series of victories over loyalist armies, Vitalian came to threaten Constantinople itself, and forced Anastasius to officially recant his adoption of Miaphysitism in summer 515. Soon after, however, as Anastasius failed to honour some of the terms of the agreement, Vitalian marched on Constantinople, only to be decisively defeated by Anastasius' admiral, Marinus.|$|E
5|$|Nagar was {{defeated}} by Mari in year seven of the Eblaite vizier Ibrium's term, causing the blockage of trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia. Later, Ebla's king Isar-Damu concluded an alliance with Nagar and Kish against Mari, and the campaign was headed by the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish, who led the combined armies to victory in a battle near Terqa. Afterwards, the alliance attacked the rebellious Eblaite vassal city of Armi. Ebla was destroyed approximately three years after Terqa's battle, and soon after, Nagar followed in c. 2300 BC. <b>Large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city were burned, an act attributed either to Mari, or Sargon of Akkad.|$|E
5|$|Pallas has unusual dynamic {{parameters}} {{for such a}} large body. Its orbit is highly inclined and moderately eccentric, despite being at the same distance from the Sun as {{the central part of}} the asteroid belt. Furthermore, Pallas has a very high axial tilt of 84°, with its north pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates (β,λ) = (30°,−16°) with a 5° uncertainty in the Ecliptic J2000.0 reference frame. This means that every Palladian summer and winter, <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year, with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years.|$|E

Only four faculty including Tamesis and silviculture professor Teodoro C. Delizo, along with five students returned upon the resumption of classes.

5|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) station along the Rockaway Beach Branch. The LIRR station opened in 1913 {{to replace the}} nearby Ramblersville station. The LIRR ceased operations at this station in 1950, and the New York City Transit Authority bought {{the section of the}} Rockaway Beach Branch that included this station in 1952. The subway station opened on June 28, 1956. Between 2000 and 2003, the subway station was completely reconstructed and a transfer to the new AirTrain JFK was built. The rebuilt complex was completed on December 17, 2003, providing easier access to JFK Airport for <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} are in ruins, excavations {{have determined}} that al-Rahba went through at least eight undated construction phases probably starting from the early Ayyubid period. For the most part, each phase utilized different architectural techniques and fortification concepts, {{and none of the}} phases affected the entire extent of the building at one time. One common theme of the phases was the restoration or strengthening of al-Rahba's western and southeastern sides, which faced the desert plateau and were the most exposed areas of the fortress. In contrast, the northern side facing the population centers remained largely unchanged.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war, Henry's {{government}} faced the task of rebuilding royal authority across <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. By the end of 1217 many former rebels were routinely ignoring instructions from the centre, and even Henry's loyalist supporters jealously maintained their independent control over royal castles. Illegally constructed fortifications, called adulterine castles, had sprung up across much of the country. The network of county sheriffs had collapsed, and with it the ability to raise taxes and collect royal revenues. The powerful Welsh Prince Llywelyn posed a major threat in Wales and along the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|After the French {{conquest of}} Algeria, Abdelkader El Djezairi {{declared}} war against France, and requested assistance from Sultan Abd al-Rahman of Morocco. When the Sultan responded favorably, it triggered the Franco-Moroccan War. France sent warships to bombard Tangier on 6 August 1844, destroying <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{city and its}} defenses. The French then bombarded Essaouira, and occupied the Iles Purpuraires. After the French army defeated the Moroccan cavalry at the Battle of Isly on 14 August 1844, Sultan Abd al-Rahman asked for peace with France, leading to {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Tangier on 10 September 1844. Morocco's defeat caused a revolt in Rabat; in Salé, the city's nobility, known as the Sharif, {{sent a letter to the}} Sultan complaining about the lack of weapons and ammunition in the city.|$|E
5|$|Cadw {{carried out}} a major {{restoration}} project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. <b>Large</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, {{with the exception of}} the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.|$|E
