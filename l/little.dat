5|$|After the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient <b>Little</b> Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed, but by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect, so six <b>Little</b> Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base. The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 <b>Little</b> Boy assemblies in 1947 {{for use by the}} Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft (which could be launched from, but not land on, the Midway-class aircraft carriers).

5|$|Kyousuke's {{younger sister}} is Rin Natsume, the main heroine of <b>Little</b> Busters!, and is {{initially}} {{the only female}} member of the <b>Little</b> Busters. She does not communicate well with others due to her poor social skills and {{can be seen as}} inarticulate. Due to this, she is shy, and is usually seen alone. Rin loves cats and at school takes care of several strays. Riki's roommate and fellow member of the <b>Little</b> Busters is Masato Inohara who loves to work out and improve his muscle mass. He has a particular fondness for Riki, which he is more than willing to express out aloud.

Lawrence, who is still involved with Sarah, disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning <b>Little</b> Bee in to the police. When he informs <b>Little</b> Bee that he is considering this, she responds that allowing her to stay would be {{what is best for}} Sarah, so if Lawrence turns her in, <b>Little</b> Bee will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair. The two reach an uneasy truce. After spending several days together, Sarah, Lawrence, <b>Little</b> Bee and Charlie take a trip to the park.

During a trip to the same beach where they first encountered one another, soldiers arrive to take <b>Little</b> Bee away. Despite being captured, <b>Little</b> Bee is not dispirited, and instead is ultimately hopeful at the sight of Charlie playing happily with a group of Nigerian children.|$|E
5|$|<b>Little</b> Red's {{flights to}} Manchester ended in March 2015 {{with the final}} flights to Edinburgh and Aberdeen departing on 26 September 2015. The planes were {{returned}} for Aer Lingus' sole use in the Republic of Ireland following the final passenger fights of <b>Little</b> Red. After the closure of <b>Little</b> Red, all but three of the Heathrow slots were returned to BA and absorbed back into their operation, thus granting them a monopoly on UK mainland domestic flights at Heathrow {{for the first time}} since British Midland Airways (as BMI were named at the time) moved into Heathrow in 1982. However this was dependent on another airline not being willing to take the place of <b>Little</b> Red in running domestic flights from Heathrow. Virgin leased out the three slots it retained. In 2017, the remaining <b>Little</b> Red slots were taken over by Flybe.|$|E
