5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> their words appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
5|$|Boy Scouts <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{the ideals}} {{spelled out in}} the Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Outdoor Code, the Scout motto ("Be prepared"), and the Scout slogan ("Do a good turn daily"). They wear a uniform and work {{together}} in patrols of four to ten boys with an elected patrol leader. Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors. The advancement system provides opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance. Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as role models and mentors, but they are expected to plan their own activities within the troop and to participate in community service. Opportunities are provided for leadership training with practical application.|$|E
5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E

25|$|Both campuses have a Ptolemy Stone, {{an astronomical}} {{instrument}} invented {{by the ancient}} Greek astronomer Ptolemy to measure the altitude of celestial bodies, in this case, the sun. The St. John's Ptolemy Stones are outdoor objects with a movable metal dial affixed (a prismical concrete column in Annapolis and a granite boulder in Santa Fe); this device was the precursor to the sextant. Freshman and sophomore math classes <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this stone to calculate the apparent movement of the sun along the ecliptic. The students' use of the Ptolemy Stones underscores the mathematics and laboratory programs' connection to the practical experimentation and hands-on experience of the natural world.|$|E

40|$|Introduction This paper {{reports on}} {{university}} students' experiences of learning information literacy. Method Phenomenography {{was selected as}} the research approach as it describes the experience {{from the perspective of the}} study participants, which in this case is a mixture of undergraduate and postgraduate students studying education at an Australian university. Semi-structured, one-on-one interviews were conducted with fifteen students. Analysis The interview transcripts were iteratively reviewed for similarities and differences in students' experiences of learning information literacy. Categories were constructed from an analysis of the distinct features of the experiences that students reported. The categories were grouped into a hierarchical structure that represents students' increasingly sophisticated experiences of learning information literacy. Results The study reveals that students experience learning information literacy in six ways: <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> find information; <b>learning</b> a process <b>to</b> <b>use</b> information; <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> information <b>to</b> create a product; <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> information <b>to</b> build a personal knowledge base; <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> information <b>to</b> advance disciplinary knowledge; and <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> information <b>to</b> grow as a person and to contribute to others. Conclusions Understanding the complexity of the concept of information literacy, and the collective and diverse range of ways students experience learning information literacy, enables academics and librarians to draw on the range of experiences reported by students to design academic curricula and information literacy education that targets more powerful ways of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> find and <b>use</b> information...|$|R
500|$|All healthy, {{normally}} developing {{human beings}} <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development {{is essentially the}} same for children acquiring sign or oral languages. This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In The Descent of Man, naturalist Charles Darwin called this process [...] "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".|$|E
500|$|Land snails are an {{especially}} important food item when drought or hard weather {{makes it hard}} to find other food. The thrush often uses a favourite stone as an [...] "anvil" [...] on which to break the shell of the snail before extracting the soft body and invariably wiping it on the ground before consumption. Young birds initially flick objects and attempt to play with them until they <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> anvils as tools to smash snails. The nestlings are mainly fed on animal food such as worms, slugs, snails and insect larvae.|$|E
500|$|The campus {{underwent}} a substantial facelift in 2009, as new faculty offices and instructional spaces were created within the newly renovated Saint Joan of Arc Convent, {{which is now}} known as Joseph Hall. Joseph Hall is named after the third Abbot of Saint Anselm Abbey and former Bishop of Portland, Maine, Bishop Joseph John Gerry. At an estimated cost of $2.5 million, Joseph Hall has a Bloomberg trading room, where business students <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a Bloomberg terminal for real-time tracking of financial markets. Constructed in 1919, Joseph Hall served as the first monastery outside of Alumni Hall for over 100 Benedictine monks. In 1955, when the current abbey was built, the Sisters of Saint Joan of Arc, from Quebec, Canada moved in from Bradley House (across campus), and the building was renamed the [...] "Saint Joan of Arc Convent." [...] Their departure in 2008 ended over 50 years of service to the college, as the sisters were cooks, seamstresses and performed other domestic services for the monastic community.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Schuur {{appeared}} as a guest performer on Sesame Street. In an interview by Elmo, she answered questions about how a blind person can <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> other senses to get along in the world. In 1998, she was a special guest on [...] "Ray Charles in Concert", {{a benefit for the}} Miami Lighthouse for the Blind. [...] She performed at Carnegie Hall in a tribute to Irving Berlin in 1988, and again in 1996 in a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald. Schuur gave a performance in 1999 to honor Stevie Wonder at The Kennedy Center Honors. She sang [...] "I Just Called to Say I Love You" [...] arranged and accompanied by Herbie Hancock. Entertainment writer Jake Elyachar rated this {{as one of the top}} 20 best performances ever given on the Kennedy Honors series. Wonder was visibly emotionally moved by the performance. She was awarded the Helen Keller Achievement Award by the American Foundation for the Blind in 2000. Late in 2003, Schuur released Midnight, featuring original songs written by Barry Manilow for the album. Manilow's long-time songwriting team, which included co-producer Eddie Arkin, and lyricists Marty Panzer, Bruce Susan, and Adrienne Anderson, contributed to the project. Manilow produced the album and also performed on it. The guest artists were Brian McKnight and Karrin Allyson and it was backed by Tony-winner Bill Elliott and the Bill Elliott Swing Orchestra. Her second live album, Diane Schuur: Live In London, was recorded at Ronnie Scott's, a historic jazz club in London's Soho District. Scott's is the site of previous live albums by Ella Fitzgerald and Nina Simone.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong's {{first two}} books, An English Phonetic Reader (1923) and A Burmese Phonetic Reader (1925, with Pe Maung Tin), {{were part of}} the London Phonetics Readers Series, edited by Daniel Jones. Books in this series {{provided}} a phonetic sketch as well as texts transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet. Her English Phonetic Reader included transcriptions of passages written by Alfred George Gardiner, Henry James, Robert Louis Stevenson, Thomas Hardy, and John Ruskin. Jones had encouraged Armstrong to write a phonetic reader of English in [...] "narrow transcription". One of the chief distinctions of [...] "narrow transcription" [...] for English was the use of the additional phonetic symbols for vowels, such as [...] (as in the RP pronunciation of [...] ), [...] (...) , and [...] (...) [...] In the analysis behind a Jonesian [...] "broad transcription" [...] of English, the principal difference between those vowels and the vowels [...] (...) , [...] (...) , and [...] (...) , respectively, was thought of as length instead of quality; accordingly, the absence or presence of a length diacritic was used to distinguish these vowels instead of using different symbols. Armstrong's narrow transcription for the reader used these extra vowel symbols and explicitly marked vowel length with the diacritics [...] 'half-long' and [...] 'long'. She also discussed the use of narrow transcription in her first paper for Le Maître Phonetique, published as one of its [...] ( [...] , [...] "Feature articles"); Armstrong implored the journal's readers to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the extra symbols. Armstrong's An English Phonetic Reader, Armstrong and Ward's Handbook of English Intonation, and Ward's The Phonetics of English were the first to popularize this transcription system for English.|$|E
