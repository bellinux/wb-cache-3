60|$|Many {{explanations}} of the Jason myth have been given by Scholars who thought they recognised elemental phenomena in the characters. As usual these explanations differ widely. Whenever a myth has to be interpreted, {{it is certain that}} one set of Scholars will discover the sun and the dawn, where another set will see the thunder-cloud and lightning. The moon is thrown in at pleasure. Sir G. W. Cox determines {96} 'that the name Jason (Iason) must be classed with the many others, Iasion, Iamus, Iolaus, Iaso, belonging to the same root.' Well, what is the root? Apparently the root is 'the root i, as denoting a crying colour, that is, a loud colour' (ii. 81). Seemingly (i. 229) violet is a <b>loud</b> <b>colour,</b> and, wherever you have the root i, you have 'the violet-tinted morning from which the sun is born.' Medea is 'the daughter of the sun,' and most likely, in her 'beneficent aspect,' is the dawn. But (ii. 81, note) ios has another meaning, 'which, as a spear, represents the far-darting ray of the sun'; so that, in one way or another, Jason is connected with the violet-tinted morning or with the sun's rays. This is the gist of the theory of Sir George Cox.|$|E
40|$|It {{is usually}} {{taken for granted}} that {{synaesthesia}} (e. g., sweet voice) is a metaphor. However, the fact that partly di erent interpretations have also been proposed suggests that further research is needed. Based on a critical review of the alter- native positions on the topic and on {{a detailed analysis of}} relevant data, I argue in this paper that synaesthesia (in both its conventional and living instances) is indeed a metaphor, displaying a con ict between separate sensory concepts that cannot be connected in terms of a consistent conceptual relationship. e clearer and more explicit account of synaesthesia proposed in this paper in turn fosters clearer understanding of (a) the relationship with other gures that can involve the senses, such as metonymy, hypallage, and simile, and (b) the possible role of (multi) sensory perceptual experience in conditioning association preferenc- es in linguistic synaesthesia (e. g., <b>loud</b> <b>colour</b> vs. a less likely to occur coloured loudness) ...|$|E

Set to a discordant and raw soundtrack by the Kills the runway show depicts four periods in the Patty Hearst kidnapping saga. The first is innocence; represented via the use of white dresses, blouses and pinafores. The next phase is Hearst at college; slogan tees, cuffed shorts, bandanas, denim and <b>louder</b> <b>colour</b> accents such as red, yellow and blue highlight this change, whilst the slow seeping of black into the palette suggests the darkness which will come. The third period is during her period as a fighter with the SLA; uniform-like khakis drench this radical phases pallet. The last phase is purely black, featuring black corsages to symbolise the death of Patty's innocence. Influences: ...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1970s, rockabilly music {{enjoyed a}} renewed period of {{popularity}} {{and there was}} a resurgence of interest in Teddy Boy fashions. The look was promoted by Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren through their shop Let it Rock, on London's King's Road. This new generation of Teds adopted some aspects of the 1950s but with a large glam rock influence, including <b>louder</b> <b>colours</b> for drape jackets, brothel creepers and socks and shiny satin shirts worn with bootlace ties, jeans and big-buckled belts. George Harrison and John Lennon emulated this style in the early formation of the Beatles. The 1970s Teddy Boys often sported flamboyant pompadour hairstyles in addition to long sideburns [...] and were alleged to prefer hairspray over grease to style their hair. In the late 1970s, the new generation became the enemies of the Westwood and Sex Pistol-inspired punk rockers. In the spring of 1977, street battles between young punks and aging teds happened on London's King's Road, where the earliest new wave shops, including Westwood and McLaren's Sex (by now not selling zoot suits and ted gear anymore), were situated.|$|R
6000|$|The row {{had arisen}} about that beastly Jennie again. Jennie was his wife's friend, and, by no {{invitation}} of Mr. Coombes, {{she came in}} every blessed Sunday to dinner, and made a shindy all the afternoon. She was a big, noisy girl, {{with a taste for}} <b>loud</b> <b>colours</b> and a strident laugh; and this Sunday she had outdone all her previous intrusions by bringing in a fellow with her, a chap as showy as herself. And Mr. Coombes, in a starchy, clean collar and his Sunday frock-coat, had sat dumb and wrathful at his own table, while his wife and her guests talked foolishly and undesirably, and laughed aloud. Well, he stood that, and after dinner (which, [...] "as usual," [...] was late), what must Miss Jennie do but go to the piano and play banjo tunes, for all the world {{as if it were a}} week-day! Flesh and blood could not endure such goings on. They would hear next door, they would hear in the road, it was a public announcement of their disrepute. He had to speak.|$|R
5000|$|The line {{took some}} time to re-open after the war, the draw of the zoo being lost meaning the glen itself was less {{frequently}} visited. Only one locomotive returned, for the 1950 season {{but over the next}} twelve years the seasons were somewhat sporadic and no timetable was officially issued. 1962 proved the final season, with [...] "Polar Bear" [...] refusing to hold a head of steam. The final two seasons were known as the [...] "fairground era" [...] as the stock was all painted in <b>loud</b> <b>colours</b> with blue and red dominating, and fairground-style lettering and lining applied to the locomotive. By the late 1960s the engines had been removed from the glen and Polar Bear was restored as an operating exhibit at Amberley Working Museum, West Sussex and Sea Lion first went to Kirk Michael railway station as a static museum piece for a spell, before going to Loughborough where it remained until 1987 when it was finally restored and returned to service on the restored line. The railway became a footpath, only to be disturbed by the occasional walker. It seemed that this unique piece of Manx heritage was lost. Much of the railway's infrastructure was lost at this time, the distinctive station canopy being demolished in 1979 and the remaining smaller buildings lost also.|$|R
6000|$|The name of Pururavas, again, is 'an {{appropriate}} {{name for}} a solar hero.' [...] . Pururavas meant the same as [Greek], 'endowed with much light,' for, though rava is generally used of sound, yet the root ru, which means originally 'to cry,' is also applied to colour, {{in the sense of}} a <b>loud</b> or crying <b>colour,</b> that is, red. {69a} Violet also, according to Sir G. W. Cox, {69b} is a <b>loud</b> or crying <b>colour.</b> 'The word ([Greek]), as applied to colour, is traced by Professor Max Muller to the root i, as denoting a [...] "crying hue," [...] that is, a loud colour.' It is interesting to learn that our Aryan fathers spoke of 'loud colours,' and were so sensitive as to think violet 'loud.' Besides, Pururavas calls himself Vasistha, which, as we know, is a name of the sun; and if he is called Aido, the son of Ida, the same name is elsewhere given {69c} to Agni, the fire. 'The conclusion of the argument is that antiquity spoke of the naked sun, and of the chaste dawn hiding her face when she had seen her husband. Yet she says she will come again. And after the sun has travelled through the world in search of his beloved, when he comes to the threshold of Death and is going to end his solitary life, she appears again, in the gloaming, the same as the dawn, as Eos in Homer, begins and ends the day, and she carries him away to the golden seats of the Immortals.' {69d} ...|$|R
5000|$|William Austin (1966) says “Mahler {{expanded}} the orchestra, going ahead to a historic climax {{in the direction}} already marked by Beethoven, Berlioz and Wagner… The purpose of this famous expansion was not a sheer increase in volume, but {{a greater variety of}} sound with more nearly continuous gradations… Mahler only occasionally required all his vast orchestra to play together, and his music was as often soft as <b>loud.</b> Its <b>colours</b> were continually shifting, blending or contrasting with each other.” Adorno (1971) similarly describes Mahler’s symphonic writing as characterised by “massive tutti effects” contrasted with “chamber-music procedures”. The following passage from the first movement of his Symphony No. 4 illustrates this: Only in the first bar of the above is there a full ensemble. The remaining bars feature highly differentiated small groups of instruments. Mahler’s experienced conductor’s ear led him to write detailed performance markings in his scores, including carefully calibrated dynamics. For example in bar 2 above, the low harp note is marked forte, the clarinets, mezzo-forte and the horns piano. Austin (1966) says that “Mahler cared about the finest nuances of loudness and tempo and worked tirelessly to fix these details in his scores.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Poppe {{worked in}} an eclectic historicising style which drew most on the Renaissance and the Baroque; {{in the first}} part of his career he was greatly {{influenced}} by what he had seen in Italy and especially France. In the 1870s he began to build more in the style of the English Gothic revival. His buildings were richly ornamented inside and out; as his career progressed, he increasingly worked with large interior decorating firms, especially Bembé of Mainz, who executed his ship interiors. The result was popular with his wealthy clients; at the turn of the century he was Bremen's most prominent architect; but after fashions changed, was outmoded. Kreyenhorst Castle was demolished in the 1920s. His ship interiors have been described as [...] "overblown, over-decorated, and dark", as [...] "a seagoing baroque collage of high ceilings, massive pillars, gilded balustrades, trumpeting cherubs, and gigantic statuary," [...] as [...] "temples of high baroque, grand galleries of an aspiration so Valkeyrian that only megalomaniacs might dally there in comfort or good conscience", by Cunard executives who visited the [...] and [...] in 1903 as [...] "bizarre, extravagant and crude, <b>loud</b> in <b>colour</b> and restless in form, obviously costly, and showy to the most extreme degree" [...] and by a contemporary American as [...] "'two of everything but the kitchen range', then gilded." [...] The architecture critic Walter Müller-Wulckow described the Bremen Cotton Exchange, which started to shed its profuse ornamentation after exposure to the elements, as the [...] "crassest" [...] manifestation of [...] "cancerous" [...] building styles.|$|R
60|$|These rival cries {{were the}} signals {{for a fight}} between the two bands of gladiators {{in the face of}} the hustings, the body of the people little interfering. Bully Bluck seized Magog Wrath's colours; they wrestled, they seized each other; their {{supporters}} were engaged in mutual contest; it appeared to be a most alarming and perilous fray; several ladies from the windows screamed, one fainted; a band of special constables pushed their way through the mob; you heard their staves resounded on the skulls of all who opposed them, especially the little boys: order was at length restored; and, to tell the truth, the only hurts inflicted were those which came from the special constables. Bully Bluck and Magog Wrath, with all their fierce looks, flaunting <b>colours,</b> <b>loud</b> cheers, and desperate assaults, were, after all, only a couple of Condottieri, who were cautious never to wound each other. They were, in fact, a peaceful police, who kept the town in awe, and prevented others from being mischievous who were more inclined to do harm. Their hired gangs were the safety-valves for all the scamps of the borough, who, receiving a few shillings per head for their nominal service, and as much drink as they liked after the contest, were bribed and organised into peace and sobriety on the days in which their excesses were most to be apprehended.|$|R
60|$|Even at first, {{when the}} {{vexatious}} {{sense of the}} city of the Doges reduced to earning its living as a curiosity-shop was in its keenness, {{there was a great deal}} of entertainment to be got from lodging on Riva Schiavoni and looking out at the far-shimmering lagoon. There was entertainment indeed in simply getting into the place and observing the queer incidents of a Venetian installation. A great many persons contribute indirectly to this undertaking, and it is surprising how they spring out at you during your novitiate to remind you that they are bound up in some mysterious manner with the constitution of your little establishment. It was an interesting problem for instance to trace the subtle connection existing between the niece of the landlady and the occupancy of the fourth floor. Superficially it was none too visible, as the young lady in question was a dancer at the Fenice theatre--or when that was closed at the Rossini-- and might have been supposed absorbed by her professional duties. It proved necessary, however, that she should hover about the premises in a velvet jacket and a pair of black kid gloves with one little white button; as also, that she should apply a thick coating of powder to her face, which had a charming oval and a sweet weak expression, like that of most of the Venetian maidens, who, as a general thing--it was not a peculiarity of the land- lady's niece--are fond of besmearing themselves with flour. You soon recognise that it is not only the many-twinkling lagoon you behold from a habitation on the Riva; you see a little of everything Venetian. Straight across, before my windows, rose the great pink mass of San Giorgio Maggiore, which has for an ugly Palladian church a success beyond all reason. It is a success of position, of colour, of the immense detached Campanile, tipped with a tall gold angel. I know not whether it is because San Giorgio is so grandly conspicuous, with a great deal of worn, faded-looking brickwork; but for many persons the whole place has a kind of suffusion of rosiness. Asked what may be the leading colour in the Venetian concert, we should inveterately say Pink, and yet without remembering after all that this elegant hue occurs very often. It is a faint, shimmering, airy, watery pink; the bright sea-light seems to flush with it and the pale whiteish-green of lagoon and canal to drink it in. There is indeed a great deal of very evident brickwork, which is never fresh or <b>loud</b> in <b>colour,</b> but always burnt out, as it were, always exquisitely mild.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2005. The aim of {{this study}} has been to {{theoretically}} and empirically explore the nature of personal archetypes, aspects of personality and psychological well-being, as well as the relationship between archetypes and aspects of personality and psychological well-being. This study was conducted according to the new paradigm emerging with the field of psychology, focusing on health and psychological well-being, so diverging from the conventional pathogenic meta-perspective in which the focus is on illness /pathology/abnormalities. T his new paradigm focuses on strengths and positive aspects of human functioning. It has become clear that an individual is a dynamic, holistic, psychophysical, multi-dimensional organism, and therefore psychological health and wellness must consequently be studied from holistic and multidimensional perspectives, with recognition of various health domains / life dimensions (physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual, social and vocational). According to the Archetypal Theoretical exploration, Archetypes are the psychological correlations and symbolic representations of typical instinctive human behaviour, such as attitudes, feelings, modes of action, thought processes and impulses. These emotional-imaginable mental structures functionally shape personal experiences, and therefore behaviour towards situations and objects. Personology indicates that acquiring a personality means the optimum development and realization of the whole person as a dynamic, holistic, psychophysical, multi-dimensional organism. This includes all conscious and unconscious processes and the harmonization of polar psychophysical energy. Personality is not something static, but a dynamic process of growth that can be compared metaphorically to a journey towards becoming an individuated / self-actualised person. The functional centre of the psyche that organizes this developmental journey of personality is the Se& and the process is called individuation. During the inner journey towards individuation, and through each major chronological stage of development, a person is confronted by certain life-issues and natural psychological growth patterns. This calls forth certain Archetypes that act as guiding mechanisms on the developmental journey, empowering a person with certain innate psychological SeIf-Strengths, giving expression to certain essential qualities and integrating parts of the personality. Within the different dimensions of a person, archetypes are instinctive symbolic representations of these Self-potentials / Self-strengths, which empower the personality with coping skills, and act as neurotic defense entrenchments, preventing illness, and thus enhancing psychological well-being. Although archetypal development is a fundamental part of human development universally, different cultures and genders identify more strongly with certain archetypes and show a difference in progression through the stages of the journey. In the empirical study an availability sample (n = 300 students between the ages of 18 and 25) consisting of males and females (from two major cultural groups: White and Black South Africans) has been used. Personal Archetypes have been operationalized by means of the Pearson-Maw Archetypal Indicator (Pearson & Mum, 2003). Certain aspects of personality have been operationalized by means of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory /iWO PI-R: E&A] (Costa & McCrae, 1992) and psychological well-being have been operationalized be means of the Sense of Coherence Scale (Antonovsky, 1987), the Aflectometer 2 (Kammann & Flett, 1983), the Satisfaction With Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen & Grzfi, 1985), the Life Orientation Test (Scheier & Carver, 1985), the General Health Questionnaire (Goldberg & Hillier, 1979) and the Generalized Self-eflcacy Scale (Schwaner & Jerusalem, 1995). Favourable internal Cronbach Alpha reliability indices and validity, comparable with those reported in literature have been found for most of the scales and sub-scales. The mean scores found for the Total Group and for the different groups (Male, Female, Black and White) have been compared and interpreted. The White cultural group mainly focuses on the Sage, Jester, Caregiver, Lover and Creator archetypes, while the Black cultural group mainly focuses on the Sage, Warrior and Ruler archetypes. As a Total Group its main focus is on founding and understanding truth behind appearance and illusions. They value high mindedness, thinking of authority as something earned by attaining wisdom or expertise. Sometimes they evaluate others in a cold, judgmental way and may also feel disconnected from real life / the greater world, resisting certain changes. They may lack the ability to let go of certain old habits/relationships/thought patterns,which are no longer important in their lives. The White cultural group is actively concerned with issues of personal responsibility and freedom, and yet has not fully developed a sense of personal identity, power and authenticity, while identifying itself with a f e d m e cast, which may indicate cooperativeness, receptiveness and emphasis on living in process with each other and the natural world. The Black cultural group, on the other hand, is actively concerned with issues of personal power and freedom, and yet has not fully developed a sense of personal identity, responsibility and authenticity, while identifying itself with a masculine cast, which may indicate hierarchical cultural structures, competitiveness, aggressiveness and an emphasis on achievement and mastery. It seems as if cultural and socio-political influences underlie {{the differences between the two}} cultural groups within this study. The Total Group showed moderately high levels of psychological well-being, and according to the indices for personality seems to be affectionate, friendly, have positive emotions of joy, happiness, love, excitement, is considerate and showed active concern over the well-being of others. Some significant differences have been found between the two cultural groups. The White Group are more caring, empathetic and compassionate towards themselves and others, while the Black Group are more demanding, disciplined, assertive and competitive. The White Group is furthermore more modest humble than the Black Group, which may believe it is superior. The White Group tends to focus more strongly on enjoyment joy, excitement, stimulation, bright <b>colours,</b> <b>loud</b> environments, liberation, freedom, and are likely more playful, present-orientated, curious and unconcerned with what others may think, than the Black Group, which is less focused on playfulness, excitement-seeking, impulsiveness and constant stimulation. Furthermore the White Group experiences a higher level of positive emotion than the Black Group, which is less joyful and happy. These differences are found for the current research group and should not be considered indicative of the difference between these cultures in general. No significant differences have been found between the two gender groups, but further analysis of the cultural-gender groups revealed that the White Group of Women are the most modest of all the cultural-gender groups and tends to experience a higher level of activity, and thus is more energetic and fast pacing than the Black Group of Women (that probably prefer a more easy and calm tempo lifestyle). The exposition of correlations indicated that more practically significant correlations are found between personal archetypes and certain aspects of personality, than between personal archetypes and psychological well-being. Significant correlations (with personal archetypes) are found on 9 of the personality sub-scales, while on 2 aspects of personality no significant correlations are found. Significant correlations (with personal archetypes) are found on 4 of the psychological well-being scales and sub-scales, while on 6 aspects of psychological well-being no significant correlations are found. No practically significant correlations are found between two of the archetypal sub-scales (Pmr 5 : Seeker 62 Pmr 6 : Destroyer) and other scales and subscales for personality and psychological well-being. It has been concluded that archetypes have returned to contemporary psychology as measurable constructs that could serve as valuable indicators of personality development and psychological health and well-being across age, culture and gender lines. Recommendations for further research and for the practical implication of the findings have been made. Master...|$|R
