5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its <b>low</b> <b>volatility</b> and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
25|$|Low {{temperature}} ionic liquids (below 130K) {{have been}} proposed as the fluid base for an extremely large diameter spinning liquid mirror telescope {{to be based on}} the Earth's moon. Low temperature is advantageous in imaging long wave infrared light which is the form of light (extremely red-shifted) that arrives from the most distant parts of the visible universe. Such a liquid base would be covered by a thin metallic film that forms the reflective surface. <b>Low</b> <b>volatility</b> is important in lunar vacuum conditions.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{an interest rate}} model with log-normally distributed rates in the terminal measure in discrete time. Such models are used in financial practice as parametric versions of the Markov functional model, or as approximations to the log-normal Libor market model. We show that the model has two distinct regimes, at high and <b>low</b> <b>volatilities,</b> with different qualitative behavior. The two regimes are separated by a sharp transition, {{which is similar to}} a phase transition in condensed matter physics. We study the behavior of the model in the large volatility phase, and discuss the implications of the phase transition for the pricing of interest rate derivatives. In the large volatility phase, certain expectation values and convexity adjustments have an explosive behavior. For sufficiently <b>low</b> <b>volatilities</b> the caplet smile is log-normal to a very good approximation, while in the large volatility phase the model develops a non-trivial caplet skew. The phenomenon discussed here imposes thus an upper limit on the volatilities for which the model behaves as intended. ...|$|R
25|$|An inverse ETF, {{like any}} {{leveraged}} ETF, needs to buy {{when the market}} rises and sell when it falls {{in order to maintain}} a fixed leverage ratio. This results in a volatility loss proportional to the market variance. Compared to a short position with identical initial exposure, the inverse ETF will therefore usually deliver inferior returns. The exception is if the market declines significantly on <b>low</b> <b>volatility</b> so that the capital gain outweighs the volatility loss. Such large declines benefit the inverse ETF because the relative exposure of the short position drops as the market fall.|$|E

25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was methanol (methyl alcohol). Methanol was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very <b>low</b> <b>volatility</b> compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} international {{evidence for}} the presence of the day of the week effects in stock market returns denominated in both local currencies and the US dollars in most of the nineteen countries in the sample for the period July 1993 to July 1998. The observed daily patterns differ for local and dollar returns, the latter being exhibiting lower daily means and higher standard deviations. In local currency terms, a pattern of higher returns around the middle of the week, Tuesday and then Wednesday; and a lower pattern {{towards the end of the}} week, Thursday and then Friday, are observed. In dollar terms, a higher pattern occurs around the middle of the week, Wednesday and then Tuesday; and a lower one is observed towards the end of the week, Thursday and then Friday. The lower patterns are more apparent in both cases. Volatility is the highest on Mondays in both local and dollar returns. Local returns have the <b>lowest</b> <b>volatility</b> towards the end of the week, Thursday and Friday, whereas the <b>lowest</b> <b>volatility</b> of dollar returns are observed on Tuesdays.

25|$|To {{choose the}} matrix for each solid analyte, three {{criteria}} must be considered. First, it should dissolve the solid compound to be analysed (with {{or without the}} aid of a cosolvent or additive), thus allowing molecules of that compound to diffuse to the surface layers, replenishing the sample molecules that have been ionized or destroyed by interaction with the fast atom beam. It {{should also be noted that}} another mechanism for explanation of ion formation in FAB involves the idea that sputtering occurs from the bulk rather than the surface, but in that case, the solubility is still largely important to insure homogeneity of solid analyte in the bulk solution. Secondly, the matrix should have a <b>low</b> <b>volatility</b> under the conditions of the mass spectrometer. As mentioned above, as the matrix is depleted, the ionization decreases as well, so maintaining the matrix is vital. Thirdly, the matrix should not react with the solid analyte in question, or if it does react, it should be in an understood and reproducible way. This ensures reproducibility of analysis and identification of the actual analyte rather than a derivative of the analyte.|$|E

Mortality isn't necessarily the most important metric for measuring impacts in aquatic environments, as sub-lethal concentrations change organisms' life histories in meaningful ways.

Ionic liquids' substituent diversity simplify the process of identifying compounds that meet safety requirements.|$|E
2500|$|The {{overall goal}} of the matrix {{compound}} is to present the sample to the atom beam at a high mobile surface concentration. For maximum sensitivity, the sample should form a perfect monolayer at {{the surface of a}} substrate having <b>low</b> <b>volatility.</b> This monolayer effect can be seen in that once a certain concentration of analyte in matrix is reached, any concentration above that is seen to exhibit no effect, because once the monlayer is formed, any additional analyte is beneath the monolayer, and thus not affected by the atom beam. The concentration needed to cause this effect is seen to change as the amount of non-volatile matrix changes. So concentration of solid analyte needs to be considered in the preparation of the solution for analysis so that signal from [...] "hidden" [...] analyte is not missed.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide new {{insights}} into the relationship between technical analysis and implied market volatility (VIX) by calculating technical trading rules with the VIX price data, as opposed to the stock prices. Three trending trading rule signals are calculated on the prices of three major US indices and the VIX prices. The results reveal that the trading signals calculated with the VIX level provide large, statistically significant profits that are in excess of the profits from the traditional computation. Sub-period analysis reveals that technical trading rules were most (least) profitable during the period with the highest (<b>lowest)</b> <b>volatility</b> levels. ...|$|R
2500|$|Officially, the Indian rupee has a market-determined {{exchange}} rate. However, the RBI trades {{actively in}} the USD/INR currency market to impact effective exchange rates. Thus, the currency regime {{in place for}} the Indian rupee with respect to the US dollar is a de facto controlled exchange rate. This is sometimes called a [...] "managed float". Other rates (such as the EUR/INR and INR/JPY) have the volatility typical of floating exchange rates, and often create persistent arbitrage opportunities against the RBI. Unlike China, successive administrations (through RBI, the central bank) have not followed a policy of pegging the INR to a specific foreign currency at a particular exchange rate. RBI intervention in currency markets is solely to ensure <b>low</b> <b>volatility</b> in exchange rates, and not to influence the rate (or direction) of the Indian rupee in relation to other currencies.|$|E

We gather questionnaire data on the managers' traits and combine it with exercise data. Managers in our sample expect <b>low</b> <b>volatilities</b> (compared to historical estimates) and are well diversified and modestly risk averse. This implies that the value-cost wedge of options can be smaller than usually assumed. The exercise decisions vary with expected volatility, managerial wealth, and mental accounting.
