40|$|North American {{grassland}}s and grassland {{birds have}} declined drastically due to habitat degradation by fire suppression (i. e., woody encroachment), fragmentation, and conversion to croplands. A better understanding is needed {{of the relationships}} among disturbance regimes (e. g., fire), resultant vegetation changes, and grassland bird communities to effectively manage remaining grasslands and grassland birds. I assessed the relationship between post-fire succession, and mean relative abundance and nesting ecology of breeding grassland birds (i. e., nest-site selection and nest success) in mesquite-dominated rangeland of the Texas Rolling Plains, where prescribed fire {{is used as a}} tool to manage shrub encroachment. Brush cover, grass cover, and visual obstruction generally increased with post-fire succession, and bare ground decreased with post-fire succession. Species richness, grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), Cassin??????s sparrows (Aimophila cassinii), and dickcissels (Spiza americana) responded positively to post-fire succession, and <b>lark</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Chondestes grammacus) responded negatively to post-fire succession.; abundance of these avian groups was low on the control sites. During 2004 ?????? 2005, 90 grassland bird nests were monitored. I found conflicting results for vegetation parameters important to nest site selection and probability of nest success. For all species except <b>lark</b> <b>sparrows,</b> nest-site location was positively associated with visual obstruction and with grass or forb cover. However, the probability of nest success increased with lower visual obstruction, bare ground cover, or grass cover. Grassland bird abundance, nest-site location, and nest success had differing associations with vegetation variables. These results suggest that to effectively manage remaining grasslands for sustainable breeding grassland bird populations, managers should engage in practices that keep habitat in multiple vegetative successional stages...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} abundance of grassland birds was estimated on an 81 -ha (200 -acre) dry to dry-mesic sand prairie in south, west Wisconsin over an 18 -year period (1987 - 2004). Birds were surveyed three {{times during the}} breeding season on seven, 2 -ha (5 -acre) strip transects in six different burn units. We compared results to time since fire and other habitat features. The average rotation of prescribed fires in the burn units ranged from three to six years. Seven species were selected for detailed analysis. These were grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum),- 18 -year average of 1. 33 birds per ha, field sparrows (Spizella pusilla) at 0. 64 birds/ha, eastern meadowlarks (Stumella magna) at 0. 54 birds/ha, <b>lark</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Chondestes grammicus) at 0. 50 birds/ha, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) at 0. 18 birds/ha, dickcissels (Spiza americana) at 0. 17 birds/ha, and vesper sparrows (Poocetes gramineus) at 0. 07 birds/ha. Observed bird densities by burn year indicated the year of burning to be unique {{in relation to other}} years in the burn cycle. Mourning doves and vesper and <b>lark</b> <b>sparrows</b> were detected in greater densities in the year of a burn compared to the years pre- or post- burn. In contrast, grasshopper sparrows, eastern meadowlarks, field sparrows, and dickcissels were observed at lower densities during the year of a burn than in the pre- or post-burn years, but they were never eliminated. For some species, such as lark, field and vesper sparrows, the removal of woody vegetation {{during the early years of}} the study period may have affected abundance. With the exception of vesper sparrows, overall management actions at Spring Green Preserve, including the prescribed burning regimen, appear to allow its grass land bird populations to be maintained...|$|R
