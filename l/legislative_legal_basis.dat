5000|$|The {{first of}} the western European {{directives}} dealing with waste management was the [...] "Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on Waste." [...] It didn't mention batteries or chemicals but specified the regulation of [...] "particular categories of waste," [...] which was later referenced to by both Battery Directives as a <b>legislative</b> or <b>legal</b> <b>basis.</b> The first version of the European Council Directive on Batteries and Accumulators 91/157/EEC was approved on March 18, 1991. It covered many battery types, including industrial, automotive, dry-cell, lead-acid, alkaline, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal-hydride, lithium, lithium-ion, mercury, etc. The first program in the directive was set for a six-year duration, starting in 1993.|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for a given measure can {{influence}} the procedure by which legislation is adopted, and thereby the scope and content of EU policy. The ambiguity surrounding the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental acts based in Articles 130 s and 100 a {{opened the way for}} a 'legal-basis game', where EU institutions chose the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987 - 93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130 s and 100 a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental legislation during the period 1987 - 99. I conclude that, although the legal-basis game is played out with respect to certain acts, {{there is little evidence that}} it is a regular and systematic feature of the policy process in the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{structure}} of legal bases according to competences, instruments, and procedures; as well as <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in the European Union {{before and after the}} introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its main contribution lies in the analysis of general criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation as they have been developed under supranational EU law. It discovers several flaws inherited in the quest for the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> on the grounds of overlapping competences, divergent inter-institutional interests, and inconsistencies in the courts’ judgements. In addition, the previous pillar structure of the EU has also led to cross-pillar litigation which is particularly the case in the area of external relations. With the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon, the previous pillar structure has been abolished and the former third pillar has been integrated into the realm of supranational EU law. While the intergovernmental sphere is thus minimised to the area of common foreign and security policy, <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> conflicts will continue to occur between this area and the TFEU as well as within the TFEU itself. In addition, the Lisbon Treaty has even created new problems concerning the choice of the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis,</b> most notably as regards the newly codified competence categories as well as the new hierarchy of legal instruments. This may require the development of new criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in order to guarantee legal certainty in these areas for future cases...|$|R
