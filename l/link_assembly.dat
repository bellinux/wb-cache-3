40|$|Following an {{incidence}} to an aircraft, a few {{components of}} the main undercarriage assembly were sent to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that the piston of the extension/retraction jack has failed by bending overload. There were no evidences of progressive failure such as fatigue or stress corrosion cracking in this component. Deformation pattern seen on the other components suggested that during landing, the pivot assembly had rotated around the bearing axis connected with the links. Such a rotation had resulted in downward bending of the piston rod leading to its fracture. Analysis suggests that the situation under which the above said rotation in the pivot assembly with the piston in fully extended position is possible only when the attachment points of the <b>link</b> <b>assembly</b> with the undercarriage barrel, the pivot and the attachment point of the radius rod with the wing structure are not in one line.

40|$|A large {{variance}} {{exists in}} the amplitude of the Stellar Mass - Halo Mass (SMHM) relation for group and cluster-size halos. We show that the magnitude gap between the brightest central galaxy (BCG) and its second or fourth brightest neighbor accounts for {{a significant portion of}} this variance. We find that at fixed halo mass, galaxy clusters with a higher magnitude gap have a higher BCG stellar mass. This relationship is also observed in semi-analytic representations of low-redshift galaxy clusters in simulations. This SMHM-magnitude gap stratification likely results from BCG growth via hierarchical mergers and may <b>link</b> <b>assembly</b> of the halo with the growth of the BCG. Using a Bayesian model, we quantify the importance of the magnitude gap in the SMHM relation using a stretch factor, which we find to be significantly non-zero. The inclusion of the magnitude gap in the SMHM relation results in a large reduction in the inferred intrinsic scatter in the BCG stellar mass at fixed halo mass.

In 2004, Bashtanov and colleagues reported the contribution of different extracellular links to bundle stiffness. We simulated Bashtanov’s experimental protocol using a three-dimensional finite element bundle model with geometry measured from a typical striolar hair cell. Unlike any previous models, we separately consider two types of horizontal links: shaft links and upper lateral links. Our most important results are as follows. First, we identified the material properties required to match Bashtanov’s experiment: stereocilia Young’s modulus of 0. 74 GPa, tip <b>link</b> <b>assembly</b> (gating spring) stiffness of 5300 pN/μm, and the combined stiffness of shaft links binding two adjacent stereocilia of 750 ∼ 2250 pN/μm. Second, we conclude that upper lateral links {{are likely to have}} nonlinear mechanical properties: they have minimal stiffness during small bundle deformations but stiffen as the bundle deflects further. Third, we estimated the stiffness of the gating spring based on our realistic three-dimensional bundle model rather than a conventional model relying on the parallel arrangement assumption.

This leads to introduce the impacts of the industrial activities to the environment as crucial requirements, side by side to traditional ones such as production cost, product quality and quick response to market demands. Comparing to other sectors among the industry field, the manufacturing sector is {{a key player in}} this eco-friendly transformation because of its massive impacts contribution. Energy optimisation {{is one of the most}} important features of the developing sustainable manufacturing system; since it has very strong influence on limiting these bad impacts, which often cause increase in the operational cost. This research describes a framework, and its software, which proactively predicts and then optimises the energy consumption of an assembly machine throughout its lifecycle, in particular at the design phase where alternative machine designs and configurations can be examined and evaluated based on their potential energy consumption. The proposed framework benefits from the component-based approach as the modular component is the basic entity to be (re) used and (re) configured throughout machine development process, and virtual engineering technology which facilitates investigating component and machine behaviours virtually with high degree of reliability and robustness throughout its lifecycle.

40|$|Molecular {{control of}} plasmon {{coupling}} is investigated in biomolecule-linked nanoparticle assemblies in two-particle, small cluster, and extended network formats. The relationship between structure and optical properties is explored through comparison of measured spectra with simulated spectra calculated using structural models based upon measured structural parameters. A variety of techniques {{are used to}} characterize nanoparticle assemblies, including ensemble extinction and elastic scattering spectroscopy, single-assembly scattering spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. Initially, molecular control of plasmon coupling is investigated in ~ 100 nm assemblies composed of 13 nm gold "satellite" particles tethered by duplex DNA to a 50 nm gold "core" particle. Comparison of core-satellite assemblies formed with duplex DNA tethers of varying length demonstrates that, while core-satellite separation {{is controlled by the}} number of base pairs in the DNA tether, structural properties such as core:satellite ratio and yield are independent of DNA tether length. Thus, plasmon coupling within these assemblies is determined by the number of base pairs in the duplex DNA tether; compact assemblies in which tethers are composed of fewer base pairs exhibit plasmon bands that are red-shifted relative to the bands of extended assemblies, indicating increased plasmon coupling in the compact assemblies. Subsequently, core-satellite assemblies are formed with reconfigurable DNA nanostructure tethers that modulate interparticle separation in response to a molecular stimulus. Assembly reconfiguration from a compact to an extended state results in blue-shifting of the assembly plasmon resonance, indicating reduced interparticle coupling and lengthening of the core-satellite tether. Comparison between measured and simulated spectra revealed a close correspondence and provided validation of the structural models that <b>link</b> <b>assembly</b> plasmonic properties with DNA control of interparticle separation. Plasmon coupling is investigated also in binary metal systems. A new method for forming stable oligonucleotide-silver conjugates is presented, and controlled plasmon coupling is observed in reconfigurable core-satellite assemblies composed of 20 nm silver satellites linked to a 50 nm gold core by DNA tethers. Reconfiguration of the DNA linkers from a compact to an extended state results in decreased plasmon coupling and a blue-shift of the gold core plasmon resonance, similar to the response observed in analogous structures formed with gold satellites. Simulations of structures composed of gold and silver cores and satellites are performed to determine how the optical properties of binary metal assemblies may differ from those composed of a single metal. It appears that gold plasmons are systematically red shifted by silver particles, whereas plasmons supported by silver particles appear differentially sensitive to gold particles according to whether the silver particle is in a core position or a satellite shell. Next, the plasmonic properties of immobilized binary nanoparticle assemblies that incorporate a single strongly scattering component that acts as a template for assembly of weakly scattering plasmonic particles are investigated. Assemblies are composed of a streptavidin-coated gold "core" nanoparticle and BSA-biotin-coated gold or silver "satellite" particles. Through correlation of measured and simulated spectra, the dependence of assembly optical properties upon satellite coverage and satellite orientation about the core is addressed. It appears that plasmon coupling in gold core-gold satellite structures depends upon satellite orientation about the core and can manifest as either peak shifting or peak splitting, while the gold plasmon response to silver satellite assembly appears to be independent of satellite orientation. Finally, binary coupling is studied in one-dimensional particle pairs and three-dimensional extended networks composed of gold and silver particles linked by DNA. Investigation of particle pairs is performed by correlating assembly structure and optical properties. From both measured spectra, and simulated spectra based upon models that incorporate measured structural parameters, it appears that plasmon coupling within gold-silver particle pairs results in damping of the silver band and enhancement of the gold band. The optical response of plasmon coupling in extended networks composed of gold and silver particles is found to be qualitatively similar to coupling observed in unlike particle pairs. However, spectral simulations reveal that interactions between unlike components in binary gold and silver nanoparticle networks lead to modulation of coupling between like particle plasmons as well as pair-wise damping and enhancement.

A fast component (< 10 - 8 s) accounted for the majority of injection, while the remainder occurred on the microsecond time scale. We attribute the multiexponential injection kinetics to electron transfer from a range of conductionband and trap states. Interfacial charge recombination occurred on the microsecond time scale, and the kinetics were independent of the MAA chain length.
