For many fans, {{participating in the}} club had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the game itself and more with {{being a part of}} the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee {{and the other to}} cross the Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the shape of the bridge than the fact that arch was derived from arcus, meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E

50|$|Aside from {{tangible}} {{measures of}} national defense, such as standing military {{and security forces}} and hardware, are various institutional structures of government and functionality that have <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> directly <b>with</b> military or security factors, but more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> underlying public attitudes and risks. These institutional structures and perceptions have had their own challenges and adjustments after the Cold War.|$|R

25|$|The California Sound {{gradually}} {{evolved to}} reflect a more musically ambitious and mature world view, becoming <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, other countercultural motifs, and war. A derivative form of the California Sound was later classified as sunshine pop.|$|E
25|$|Training of {{the camel}} corps had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the Egyptian camel drivers who were often {{familiar}} with camel care and control, being mainly {{concerned with the}} problems the Australian and British officers and NCOs, who had transferred from the Army Service Corps and other AIF units, had {{in dealing with the}} animals. During this time, {{one or more of these}} men were regularly sent to hospitals with camel bites. Of the Australians, 49 were eventually commissioned and six became company commanders, so the Anzac and Imperial/Australian Mounted Divisions had a strong national component in their supporting camel transport.|$|E
25|$|In December 2003, André told UK {{journalist}} Angus Batey that, {{following a}} Detroit concert {{in the midst}} of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case was <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Parks than with the lawyers. In April 2005, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyers were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest. Later that same year, the members of OutKast were dropped as co-defendants, and Parks' lawyers continued to seek action against LaFace and parent company BMG.|$|E

25|$|Another example are {{historical}} role-playing sims such as 1880s Victorian London and The 1920s Berlin Project. While only {{encouraged to}} do so in 1880s Victorian London, visitors to the 1920s Berlin Project are required to dress accurately as part of the history based immersive experience. Sims may incorporate rules that have <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> thematic realism, and more to do with adhering to community guidelines. For instance, one rule that is commonly seen is the prohibition or restriction of underage avatars in role-playing sims that feature sexual content; these rules are separate from Linden Labs' sim restrictions, as they restrict underage characters played by adult players.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October 1856, freethinkers {{association}} De Dageraad ("The Dawn") {{was founded}} in Amsterdam by the editorial staff of the magazine, including Günst (publisher of De Dageraad) and the first chair Rudolf Charles d'Ablaing van Giessenburg (1826–1904). In total, 44 men joined the new society. There was no balloting, and partly due to d'Ablaing's sympathy towards feminism, it was during his chairmanship (1856–1865) that women were readily admitted. A similar association, De Lichtstraal ("The Lightbeam"), founded in 1855 by Goose Wijnand van der Voo in Rotterdam with 20 members and an identically named magazine, merged with De Dageraad in 1857. De Dageraad's character had less and <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> freemasonry and, increasingly, focused on rationalism and the natural sciences.|$|E
25|$|The group's surf {{music was}} not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale. However, {{previous}} surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach Boys did. Their early hits helped raise {{the profile of the}} state of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for Southern California, as opposed to Hollywood. This also associated the band with surfing, hot-rod racing, and a contemporaneous teenage lifestyle and fantasy. The California Sound gradually evolved to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature world view, becoming <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, other countercultural motifs, and war.|$|E

[...] Lanre Bakare of The Guardian commented that [...] "Fathers manage the rare feat of melding pop and politics into a potent mix, and continue a tradition - begun {{by the likes of}} Smith & Mighty, Tricky and Massive Attack - of reinterpreting pop, hip-hop and soul through the filter of black British life." [...] Writing for Exclaim!, Kyle Mullin called the record [...] "a perfect storm of influences and talent." ...|$|R
5000|$|Victor is also {{notable for}} being {{actively}} lazy; he kept himself fit {{because it was}} <b>less</b> effort <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things <b>with</b> decent muscles, and {{put a lot of}} work into avoiding work (as his University career illustrates).

25|$|Women's {{suffrage}} {{was achieved}} in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on fighting this. Suffragists scoffed at antisuffragists. Anna Howard Shaw, {{president of the}} National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working {{under the influence of}} male forces. Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by women themselves. Arguments employed by antisuffragists {{at the turn of the}} century had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a woman's place in the home as much as it had to do with a woman's proper place in the public realm. In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society. What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.|$|E
25|$|John Maynard, born 1598, {{came over}} from England {{with his wife}} Elizabeth (Ashton) Maynard around 1635. Five generations later, Isaac Maynard was {{operating}} a mill in Marlborough. When he died in 1820 at age 41 his teenage son, Amory Maynard, took over the family business. The City of Boston bought Amory's water rights to Fort Meadow Pond in 1846. He partnered with William Knight to start up a woolen mill operation on the Assabet River. Amory and his wife Mary (Priest) Maynard had three sons: Lorenzo (1829-1904), William (1833-1906) and Harlan (1843-1861). Amory managed the mill from 1847-1885 (Knight retired in 1852). Lorenzo took over from 1885 to 1898. William had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the family business - he lived in Boston a while, then Maynard again, then off to Pasadena, California in 1885 for reasons of ill health (possibly tuberculosis). He recovered and moved back east to Worcester in 1888 {{for the remainder of}} his life. Harlan died at age 18.|$|E
25|$|On 19 August, the Amazigh {{towns of}} Nalut and Kabaw in the Nafusa Mountains {{announced}} {{a boycott of}} the House of Representatives, which they claimed was unconstitutional. The Nalut Municipal Council, along with Nalut's revolutionary brigades and civil society organisations called on Salem Ignan, the towns representative, {{to withdraw from the}} parliament, which they claimed had an obvious bias towards Haftar's Operation Dignity, as seen in {{the fact that it was}} based in Tobruk. The Kabaw town leadership claimed that they would not recognise any decisions made by the new parliament, and also that the towns representative, Ali Al-Asawi, did not, and had never, represented the town. Both towns in particular rejected the House's call for foreign intervention in Libya in response to the upsurge in violence. Despite the timing of the announcements, the boycotts were seen as having more to do with long standing Amazigh boycott of the parliament over the issue of Amazigh representation, and <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the opposition to the parliament from Misrata and Islamist groups. It was immediately unclear whether the representatives from the towns would boycott the parliament.|$|E

500|$|Indigenous {{people in}} North and South America {{conceptualized}} a third gender for men-women and women-men. These roles were recorded of the Coahuiltecan Indians in Texas, Timucuan in Florida, and Cueva in Panama. In Cree, {{the term for}} a man who took the role of a woman was ayekkwew; the Zuni word for a woman who took the role of a man was katsotse (boy-girl), and the Mohave give women the term hwame.

500|$|Generally, modern 5November {{celebrations}} are run {{by local}} charities and other organisations, with paid admission and controlled access.

David Cressy summarised the modern celebration with these words: [...] "The rockets go higher and burn with more colour, but they have less and <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> memories of the Fifth of November... it might be observed that Guy Fawkes' Day is finally declining, having lost its connection with politics and religion.

500|$|A Marxist {{critique}} of Postan {{emerged from the}} 1950s onwards, captured in the academic journal Past & Present. This school of thought agreed that the agrarian economy was central to medieval England, but argued that agrarian issues had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> demography than with the mode of production and feudal class relations. In this model the English economy entered {{the crisis of the}} early 14th century because of the struggles between landlords and peasant for resources and excessive extraction of rents by the nobility. Similar issues underpinned the Peasants Revolt of 1381 and later tax rebellions. Historians such as Frank Stenton developed the [...] "honour" [...] as a unit of economic analysis and a focus for understanding feudal relations in peasant communities; Rodney Hilton developed the idea of the rise of the gentry as a key feature for understanding the late medieval period.|$|E
5000|$|The Historian of the NNSC {{described}} this situation as: The Americans and South Koreans, no longer {{hampered by the}} presence of the Czechoslovacs and Poles and free to accelerate the modernization of their armament, now showed <b>less</b> haste <b>to</b> <b>do</b> away <b>with</b> a body which had ceased to inconvenience them and might even serve to restrain the propaganda against them by the North Koreans and Chinese. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission thus remains a facade, maintained only because of apprehension about the void which would occur if it were abolished.|$|R

60|$|Like all {{sea-going ship}} carpenters, and more {{especially}} those belonging to whaling vessels, he was, {{to a certain}} off-hand, practical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or <b>less</b> have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years' voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For {{not to speak of}} his readiness in ordinary duties:-- repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull's eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.|$|R
500|$|Jovovich co-created and {{mastered}} {{an alien}} fictional language of over 400 words for her role. She wore a costume {{that came to}} be known as the [...] "ACE-bandage" [...] costume; the body suit designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier was made of medical bandages. The Fifth Element was selected as the opening film for the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and its worldwide box office gross was over $263 million, more than three times its budget of $80 million. The Fifth Element was often praised for its visual style; critic James Berardinelli wrote, [...] "Jovovich makes an impression, although her effectiveness has little to do with acting and <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> dialogue". Jovovich was nominated for [...] "Favorite Female Newcomer" [...] at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards and [...] "Best Fight" [...] at the MTV Movie Awards. The film inspired a video game and a planned Leeloo action figure, but the figure was never released due to licensing problems. In a 2003 interview, Jovovich said Leeloo was her favorite role.|$|E
500|$|When Nixon died in 1994, {{his daughters}} invited Agnew {{to attend the}} funeral at Yorba Linda, California. At first he refused, still bitter over how he had been treated by the White House in his final days as vice president; {{over the years he}} had {{rejected}} various overtures from the Nixon camp to mend fences. He was persuaded to accept the invitation, and received a warm welcome there from his former colleagues. [...] "I decided after twenty years of resentment to put it aside", he said. A year later, Agnew appeared at the Capitol in Washington for the dedication of a bust of him, to be placed with those of other vice presidents. Agnew commented: [...] "I am not blind or deaf to the fact that some people feel that ... the Senate by commissioning this bust is giving me an honor I don't deserve.

500|$|Despite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man {{is not in}} {{the public}} domain. Several for-profit ventures {{involving}} the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright has <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> money than with artistic integrity: [...] "I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional." [...] As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment.|$|E

25|$|In 1559, Catherine and Henry II {{attended}} {{a performance of}} the tragedy Sophonisba by Trissino, adapted earlier by the poet Mellin de Saint-Gelais to Catherine's commission. The performance style of the day inserted musical interludes unrelated to the plot between the acts, devoted to praise of the royal court. Princesses and other high-ranking ladies performed on this occasion, which celebrated royal and noble marriages. Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme, claimed in his memoirs that having seen Sophonisba shortly before her husband's death, Catherine refused to watch any more tragedies, believing the play had brought him bad luck. Tragedy went out of fashion at the court soon afterwards, replaced by the new genre of tragicomedy, though the change in taste may have had <b>less</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Catherine than with the revulsion of the court against {{the violence of the}} times. Genevra, staged at Fontainebleau on 13 February 1564, adapted into French from an episode of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, was the first tragicomedy known to have been performed for the French court.|$|R
