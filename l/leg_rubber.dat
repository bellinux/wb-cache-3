50|$|However, Foggy {{returns home}} to warn Beggar So, {{who has been}} injured by <b>Rubber</b> <b>Legs.</b> Beggar So sends Foggy to a {{sickness}} teacher for herbs to cure him, and the doctor teaches him a dreaded style called 'Sickness Boxing'. Now, armed with this sick form of fighting, Foggy is ready for Drunk Mantis. In the end, Foggy goes berserk and kills <b>Rubber</b> <b>Legs.</b> Unable to escape from his trance, he sees <b>Rubber</b> <b>Legs</b> when he looks at Beggar So and attacks him. The film closes with a freeze frame as Foggy leaps after his adopted father as the doctor watches on.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from its}} tube centre section the {{fuselage}} is wholly laminate with strengthening bulkheads and ribs. The fuselage becomes slender towards the fin {{and has a}} constant chord tailplane and elevators. The fin has sweep on its leading edge and extends into a small keel below the fuselage. The cockpit seats two in side-by-side configuration, with dual controls including a split, central control column. It is enclosed with a single-piece windscreen and deep side transparencies. The Jora normally has a fixed, tricycle undercarriage, though a conventional undercarriage is an option. The mainwheels are mounted on inverted tubular steel A-frames, hinged to the lower fuselage; the nosewheel is on a forward-leaning leg and is steerable. Some Joras have single cantilever main <b>legs.</b> <b>Rubber</b> springs are used on all legs; the main wheels have hydraulic disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|The planet Miron/Myron {{is portrayed}} as being built almost entirely out of chrome, with its capital at Miron/Myron City. The {{inhabitants}} are portrayed as robot-like creatures with flexible arms and <b>legs</b> like <b>rubber</b> hoses. Their feet are cupped and they have antennae and a third eye in the centre of their foreheads.|$|R
50|$|The {{undercarriage}} {{was fixed}} with the mainwheels under aircraft fairings and on split axles centrally {{mounted on a}} transverse V-strut from the central lower fuselage. The track was 2.70 m. Short, faired <b>legs</b> with <b>rubber</b> shock absorbers and drag struts were attached to the outer lower fuselage. The steerable tailskid also had a rubber damper.|$|R
50|$|The Swift had a fixed, {{conventional}} undercarriage with faired main <b>legs</b> and wheels, <b>rubber</b> {{shock absorbers}} and half-axles hinged under the fuselage. The main wheels had brakes and the tailwheel was steerable.|$|R
50|$|Rubber pants {{for infants}} wear over cloth diapers fell into two categories. Some {{were made of}} natural rubber and had rubber gathers at the waist and <b>legs.</b> The <b>rubber</b> pant itself was sized generously so the {{stretchy}} characteristic of rubber was not utilized and some air circulation took place within the oversized pants. Some were made of latex rubber that utilized the stretchy characteristic and fit very snugly over the diaper, leaving no air space.|$|R
50|$|College {{professor}} John Hathaway {{is writing}} a book about jealousy and how he doesn't believe in it. He isn't the least bit perturbed, for example, when his lovely wife Julie is the object of desire {{in the eyes of the}} school's football star, <b>Rubber</b> <b>Legs</b> Ryan.|$|R
50|$|The two outer Salmson engines were mounted, uncowled, on {{the forward}} wing bracing struts, with {{extended}} streamlined bodies behind them which {{connected to the}} rear bracing strut; the forward struts were reinforced by jury struts to the wing roots and the rear bracing struts by vertical jury struts to the rear spar. The Potez 40 had a tailwheel undercarriage with its main <b>legs</b> with <b>rubber</b> shock absorbers mounted vertically below the outer engine extensions; the mainwheels were hinged on widely spaced V-Struts from the lower fuselage and were sometimes enclosed under spats.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{distinctive}} {{forms of}} eccentric dancing had names like <b>rubber</b> <b>legs</b> or legomania. Rubberlegging involved leg shaking or snaking {{in a style}} later used by Elvis Presley, while legomania added leaps and kicks in the air. An example of legomania is Ray Bolger's performance as the Scarecrow singing [...] "If I Only Had a Brain" [...] in The Wizard of Oz.|$|R

5000|$|On 2 July 1998, {{he led a}} {{ceremony}} to raise the West Papuan flag in Biak, following which, activists clashed with police, resulting in injuries to a dozen officers. The Indonesian military occupied Biak Island four days later and fired on the activists; Karma has alleged that more than 100 protesters were killed and buried on nearby islands, though a precise death toll is unknown. Human Rights Watch protested the Indonesian government's actions, noting that {{in the months that}} followed, it [...] "continuously failed to carry out a serious investigation of these incidents, or hold accountable the perpetrators of abuses against the people in Biak". Karma himself was wounded in both <b>legs</b> by <b>rubber</b> bullets. He was then arrested, tried, and sentenced to six-and-a-half years' imprisonment for treason; the sentence was overturned on appeal after Karma had been in prison for ten months.|$|R
5000|$|William H. Martin also owned a foundry {{higher up}} on Spring Street, at Bennett Street. In 1906, W.H. Martin, W.R. Martin, Miss May C. Martin, B.J. Hall, and J.G.

[...] He {{was the sole}} proprietor until 1921 when, in that year, he transferred ownership to his son-in-law, Richard Goyne. Under Goyne, times changed and the foundry began fabricated steel. It built mining tools, equipment, and vehicles, such as the side-dump ore car, ball mill, and scoop feed. It also built non-mining commercial vehicles. [...] In 1947, it diversified. A new division began selling welding supplies, <b>legging</b> supplies, <b>rubber</b> products, and Bethlehem Steel wire rope while another division began producing a centrifugal juicer ...|$|R

2500|$|The pusher {{configuration}} [...] Siemens-Halske Sh 10 five cylinder radial was aerodynamically faired {{into the}} upper wing trailing edge but was not structurally connected to it; instead, four tubes from the fuselage formed the engine mounting. The fuel tank was within the forward section of the upper wing, feeding the engine by gravity with some pressure assistance. The fuselage was of mixed construction. From the nose to the lower wing leading edge, a region which included the two cockpits, it was a flat sided wooden structure, covered in plywood; aft, it was built from wire braced, welded steel tubes and fabric covering. This section included the lower wing mounting. The tail surfaces were fabric covered, over mixed steel and duraluminum frames. The incidence of the tailplane could be adjusted for pitch trimming. [...] The L.71 had a simple, fixed conventional undercarriage with short axles hinged to the lower fuselage longerons and forward braced with short horizontal struts. Sprung, telescopic <b>legs</b> with <b>rubber</b> shock absorbers were attached to the outer end of the axles and to the upper fuselage longerons.|$|R
2500|$|Siddle {{also gave}} a fine account of {{himself on the}} South African <b>leg</b> of the <b>rubber,</b> in which the Australians triumphed 2–1. [...] Going into the 2009 Ashes series, he had notched up 29 Test wickets {{at an average of}} 27.65. [...] That it had come in six Tests against the South Africans and one in India, and with an economy rate of only 2.57 an over, made his record still more impressive. In the first Test of the 2009 Ashes Series, Siddle took 2/97 in the first day's play. In the fourth Test of the 2009 Ashes Series, Siddle took 5/21 in the first day as his career best.|$|R
2500|$|The {{rules of}} the 1924 Lympne trials were revised to allow more {{practical}} aircraft, rather than motor-gliders. [...] Parnall therefore built a two-seat version, the Pixie IIIA with its fuselage extended by 3ft 2 in (965mm) to allow a second cockpit, one now above each wing spar and the wing span extended to 32ft 5 in. [...] A demountable upper wing, attached by N form interplane struts and several cabane struts and of markedly smaller span and deep central chord allowed the IIIA to be flown either as monoplane or biplane. Its undercarriage <b>legs</b> now had <b>rubber</b> compression shock absorbers. [...] Two were built, one with a 32hp Bristol Cherub III engine {{and the other with}} a 35hp Blackburne Thrush. [...] After the trials and in the following year, the Thrush was replaced with a 1,100 cc Anzani. [...] In 1926, both IIIAs were converted to permanent monoplane configuration as Pixie IIIs, both now with the Bristol engine.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{and built}} by Krupp AG {{to compete with}} the Rheinmetall 7.5 cm Pak 40, the Pak 41 was {{intended}} from the onset {{to take advantage of the}} Gerlich principle to increase shot velocity. In addition to its squeeze bore design and the use of a tungsten core flanged shell, the Pak 41 incorporated several novel features. One feature was that the barrel was split into three distinct sections: the rear part was parallel-sided and conventionally rifled; the central part was unrifled and tapered down; at the muzzle end, the last 27.6 in was parallel-sided again but remained unrifled. Another novel feature was the attachment of the split trail <b>legs</b> and solid <b>rubber</b> tires directly to the gun shield to save weight. The gun cradle was set inside a special ball mount attached to the gun shield. The cradle itself was cylindrical, covering the whole of the rear half of the barrel.|$|R

5000|$|Williams {{was born}} in Atlanta in 1907. He became {{employed}} as dancer with Bobby Grant's Female Impersonators in 1919 and became a spectacle. He later won several Cakewalk and Charleston competitions and other dancing contests and achieved success on Vaudeville, going on tours with the Theater Owners Booking Association. He got his nickname [...] "Rubberlegs" [...] because he danced {{as if he had}} <b>legs</b> made of <b>rubber.</b> In 1933 he appeared in the short film Smash Your Luggage, and appeared in shows like the [...] "Cotton Club Parade" [...] and [...] "Blackbirds of 1933". He was a regular performer at The Cotton Club and the Apollo in Harlem, and at the Southland ballroom in Boston, and according to Count Basie, he became the venue's most prominent attraction with his elaborates dances. He also appeared as a singer with prominent artists such Count Basie Orchestra, Fletcher Henderson, Chick Webb and Charlie Parker, and sang on the first recording of Dizzy Gillespie's [...] "Hot House" [...] on April 1, 1945 in New York City.|$|R
25|$|Fly tying {{material}} {{can be anything}} used to construct a fly on a hook. Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, balsa and wire. Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also {{a wide array of}} synthetic materials. Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and saddle hackle, so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. Synthetics such as <b>rubber</b> <b>legs,</b> plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer. Whereas lead wire was the traditional method of weighting flies, today's weighting materials include glass, brass and tungsten beads and cones as well as lead. Silicone, epoxy, kevlar thread and other modern materials are regularly incorporated in artificial fly patterns.|$|R
40|$|In Annie Dilliard’s {{autobiography}} {{of her childhood}} in Pittsburgh, she {{tells the story of}} when throwing snowballs at passing cars and one motorist stopped his car, got out and gave chase to her group of rapscallions. She describes her red-alert reaction and the burst of adrenaline that whisked her and her fellow marksmen off into the alleys and backyards of their neighborhood. She narrates, with breathless detail, her redoubled efforts at escape when a look back showed the man in the long winter coat and business suit gaining on her and an accomplice. Dilliard and her cohort made snow tracks like footprints at a crime scene crisscrossing and doubled back, around the sides and backs of houses, through the hedges, up and down the lawns of Point Breeze, taking every short cut and narrow passage way through the neighborhood and still losing ground to their bloodhound pursuer. With <b>rubber</b> <b>legs,</b> pounding heart, burning lungs and reeling minds, finally the kids are grabbed by the man and the three [...] the victim turned lawman and the two perps [...] stagger and gasp and cough without a word.

5000|$|The 1990s 12" [...] Action Man {{was closer}} in {{construction}} {{to the poor}} quality imitations of the original line; very limited articulation, with equipment not to scale (see illustration below). The hands could not really grasp any of the accessories. These figures were essentially G.I. Joe Hall of Fame bodies with {{a different set of}} head moulds, some of which had [...] "fuzzy" [...] hair. Later examples improved on the articulation, depending on the price point. The figures were marked [...] "©Hasbro International 1993" [...] across the buttocks. Some came with blue shorts, reminiscent of the late 70s-80s body. The articulation of neck, waist, arms and legs varied as mentioned. Some, like Tiger Strike (see below) have <b>rubber</b> <b>legs,</b> no waist, elbow or wrist pivot, and a head that only looks left/right. Even the more articulated versions cannot compare to the range of motion offered by their early predecessors; for example, the knee/ankle joints only pivot up/down; they do not rotate, and the waist does not allow for rotate and [...] "lean" [...] to the extent possible with earlier figures. The feet on all body variants are like Barbie; not to scale with the body. Unfortunately, these bodies are also grossly overweight in comparison, {{and as a result of}} this and the small feet, they are much more difficult to pose freestanding. The more articulated bodies were also of a harder plastic, rather than the softer vinyl/rubber used for basic figure limbs that were similar to Barbie's [...] "Ken". Basic figures were available in a variety of configurations such as Tiger Strike and Sport Extreme, as well as deluxe sets such as Sky Dive, CrimeBuster and Raid and Roller Extreme. The more expensive sets contained the more articulated figures.|$|R
