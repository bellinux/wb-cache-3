Nearby cities are called Tinspit (which is {{mentioned}} by Vendetta to have miniature golf) and Molding. They eat clams, beef jerky, grape punch, and lots of onions, including onion soda. The town is coastal {{and was in the}} past famous for its clams. Before Vendetta came with her fiends, Clamburg was apparently a happy place, as shown in a commercial. It had beaches, happy inhabitants, a thriving clam industry, and a polka music festival.|$|E
25|$|A better {{solution}} came {{along in the}} form of the US's AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case, however, the missile in question had a truly long range of just under 2,000km. Considering the distance from London to Moscow is about 2,500km, Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites not far off the British coast, with complete immunity. Skybolt seemed <b>like</b> <b>such</b> a good solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Manifest Destiny was {{the idea}} that it was God’s will for the United States to expand because it is Protestant, democratic, and white. It {{promoted}} the notion of American racial superiority, casting all nonwhites, including Native Americans, Mexicans, and blacks, as inferior beings. John L. O'Sullivan coined the phrase in 1845, first using it in his newspaper, the United States Democratic Review. Manifest destiny soon became an important element of American political rhetoric. It called for the expansion of the United States and was a justification used by southerners for extending slavery. An example of this was the annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk used the argument of manifest destiny to support his intentions of claiming Texas. In 1845, Texas entered the United States as the fifteenth slave state. Since whites were seen as superior beings, slavery didn’t seem <b>like</b> <b>such</b> a brutal practice. The whites were not the ones suffering, and that is all that mattered.|$|E

500|$|Despite her success, Smith is {{considered}} by some music critics {{to be one of}} the most underrated vocalists in country music history due to the decision not to pursue super stardom with the non-country general media market <b>like</b> <b>such</b> contemporaries as Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, and Tammy Wynette. Artists such as Parton, George Jones, and Chely Wright have cited Smith as either one of the best vocalists in the music industry or their favorite female artist.

500|$|With no {{knowledge}} of the fashion industry, Morgan decided to make a film on the topic after being shocked by the news of the collapse of Rana Plaza. After spending several days getting information, and discovering the industry's human rights violations and [...] "staggering environmental impacts", he was sure he had to make the film. He had also previously had an appreciation for the genre, saying he was [...] "actually fascinated by those [...] films that follow one person". Like Morgan a non-connoisseur of fashion, executive producer and eco activist Lucy Siegle said that she does not <b>like</b> <b>such</b> films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry. It is The True Cost differential in her opinion; it [...] "goes there and then someit unravels the grim, gritty, global supply chain of fast fashion". Nevertheless, the film purposely does not give viewers a clear answer on how to solve the problems as there are [...] "no straightforward answers". Morgan commented, [...] "I'm probably most proud that we avoided easy answers and instead chose to trust people to both feel and think deeply about the issues raised." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} Grey and Shepherd's fight was {{described}} by Buchman as having [...] "no more taboos", {{compared to the other}} story lines developed in the episode: [...] "Even though it was a minor fight, it's very revealing for Meredith. This is probably the longest relationship she's every been in, and the first with someone she feels a genuine connection with. We might know Derek will come back, but she doesn't." [...] The last scene of them in the episode has been deemed [...] "a milestone of sorts for Meredith", with the goal to determine her to admit how new to this romantic development in her personal life she actually is, after years of being known as the woman with habitual excessive drinking and sexual relationships with inappropriate men. Also noted was the aftermath of Alex and Addison's kiss in the previous episode: [...] "What's most painful about that scene? Not that Alex effectively shut Addison down in such a cold and direct manner. But that it seems <b>like</b> <b>such</b> a waste of chemistry. When they went into that closet, the last thing we wanted to see them do is pour water on their fire", stated Buchman, noting how the scene was written to be [...] "frustrating, shocking, and therefore unexpected" [...] for the audience.|$|E
500|$|Kurt's {{scenes with}} Blaine {{and with his}} father evoked very {{divergent}} opinions from reviewers. Canning made mention of [...] "a great conversation between Blaine and Kurt that felt very real for kids in this situation" [...] and noted he was [...] "glad it wasn't an easy talk for either of them". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson agreed, and said of their [...] "debate over the existence of bisexuality" [...] that [...] "it was refreshing to see Glee portray a conversation like it really goes down in reality. It’s also good to see them not treat Kurt <b>like</b> <b>such</b> a saint all the time." [...] Semigran wrote that Kurt showed [...] "an unflattering side of himself", and Gonzalez stated that she [...] "was completely on Blaine's side here": Kurt [...] "wasn't fair" [...] and [...] "was sort of unlikable" [...] for once, though she did add that [...] "he's allowed to be flawed". Blaine's [...] "sudden confusion over his sexual orientation" [...] was deemed a [...] "false note" [...] by Reiter, who called his [...] "overwrought speech" [...] at the Lima Bean [...] "off-key". Harper was unhappy that [...] "major plot points like a gay character thinking he might be bi or straight get instigated, sorted out and wrapped up within an hour", and said {{she thought it was}} [...] "hurtful" [...] for Blaine to [...] "accept a date with Kurt's friend" [...] after he and Kurt had [...] "agreed to sort of work on a potential relationship between the two of them" [...] in the [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] episode.|$|E
500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And I hate to say this, because it sounds <b>like</b> <b>such</b> a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E

500|$|Enforcement and {{compliance}} with seat belt laws varies by state. (Massachusetts, {{which had the}} lowest death rate per 100 million miles traveled in 2015, was among the states with the lowest use of seat belts.) Some states require motorcycle helmets while others do not. Speed limits, traffic density, topography, climate and many other factors affect the divergent accident rates by state. Speed limits in Texas, Utah, and Rhode Island are prima facie rather than absolute. This allows motorists in those states to defend against a speeding charge {{if it can be}} proven that the speed was reasonable and prudent. In good driving conditions, many drivers in prima facie states presume (usually correctly) that police will allow some tolerance in enforcement. Even in states with absolute speed limits, enforcement and penalties vary from one state to another. For these and other reasons, state-to-state comparisons are difficult. There are many studies examining increases in Interstate speed limits from 55mph to 65, 70 and 75mph. Some found that fatality rates increased significantly on Interstate highways where speed limits were raised. One study that examined the change from 55 to 65mph found higher Interstate speed limits improved overall highway safety by drawing traffic from less safe secondary highways to safer Interstate highways. Since the changes to 80mph speed limits in some states (and 85mph on one section of a toll highway in Texas) are relatively recent, robust analysis is not yet available. Anecdotal evidence suggests actual vehicle speeds did not increase as much as speed limits did. Also, police may be enforcing the new higher limits more strictly than they enforced the prior limits. In some states, police have reallocated resources to focus more on impaired and distracted driving. The higher speed limits are predominantly in rural states, which tend to be Republican states. To many Republican voters, speed limits (and seat belt laws) are seen as intrusions on personal liberty. According to transportation historian Owen Gutfreund, state governments may raise speed limits because raising the speed limit “sounds <b>like</b> <b>such</b> an easy regulatory win.” It’s a simple way to “get government out of your face.” ...|$|E
