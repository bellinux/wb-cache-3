5|$|Runway 09R/27L, the {{original}} and primary runway, is <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to receive the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. Originally a taxiway, runway 09L/27R was inaugurated in February 2012. Its shorter length and width allow it to handle smaller aircraft such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747. It is mainly used when runway 09R/27L is undergoing maintenance, and as air traffic to the airport rises {{it will be used}} more often. North of these runways are the three parking aprons: the cargo, passenger terminal and MRO aprons. The passenger terminal apron contains parking stands on both the north and south sides of the terminal.|$|E
5|$|The outer, {{light-emitting}} {{layer of}} a star {{is known as the}} photosphere. Temperature estimates of the photosphere of Wolf 359 range from 2,500 K to 2,900 K, which is sufficiently cool for equilibrium chemistry to occur. The resulting chemical compounds survive <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> observed through their spectral lines. Numerous molecular bands appear in the spectrum of Wolf 359, including those of carbon monoxide (CO), iron hydride (FeH), chromium hydride (CrH), water (H2O), magnesium hydride (MgH), vanadium(II) oxide (VO), titanium(II) oxide (TiO) and possibly the molecule CaOH. Since there are no lines of lithium in the spectrum, this element must have already been consumed by fusion at the core. This indicates the star must be at least 100 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{were among}} the first animals to be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a relative lack of aggression, a manageable size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated animal that is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival. Feral sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of feral horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recognized as distinct breeds.|$|E

5|$|Under Henry II {{the castle}} was {{adequately}} maintained, but little additional work was undertaken to improve it. A castle-guard system was established, under which lands around Cambridge were granted to local lords {{on the condition}} that they provide guard forces for the castle, and the castle was primarily used to hold the sheriff's court and records. King John expanded the castle in the years before the First Barons' War of 1215 to 1217, but this work was concentrated on constructing a new hall and chamber, at the cost of £200. During the war, the rebel barons, supported by Prince Louis of France, captured much of eastern England; Cambridge Castle fell in 1216. The castle was returned to royal control after the war, but Henry III only conducted basic maintenance of the fortification. Cambridge was attacked again during the Second Barons' War in 1266. This time the town and castle held <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relieved by Henry's forces, but the king reinforced the city defences with a large ditch, later known as King's Ditch.|$|E

A similar study in Louisiana found that in a 41-month period, nearly 30,000 box turtles were taken from the wild for resale, many for export to Europe.

25|$|In 1911/1912, Hearne toured Australia {{with one}} of the strongest England sides ever.

25|$|From the 1880s onwards, {{there was}} a {{widespread}} belief among biologists that Darwinian evolution was in deep trouble. This eclipse of Darwinism (in Julian Huxley's phrase) {{grew out of the}} weaknesses in Darwin's account, written with an incorrect view of inheritance. Darwin himself believed in blending inheritance, which implied that any new variation, even if beneficial, would be weakened by 50% at each generation, as the engineer Fleeming Jenkin correctly noted in 1868. This in turn meant that small variations would not survive <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> selected. Blending would therefore directly oppose natural selection. In addition, Darwin and others considered Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics entirely possible, and Darwin's 1868 theory of pangenesis, with contributions to the next generation (gemmules) flowing {{from all parts of the}} body, actually implied Lamarckism.|$|E

50|$|A major {{advantage}} of air-to-surface missiles for ground attack by aircraft is the standoff distance they provide: missiles can be launched {{from a distance}} without coming within range of the target's air defences.
