5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical Public Exposure Studies were {{conducted}} to assess past releases and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime cancer risk to a <b>laborer</b> from the 1957 Rocky Flats fire. The key shows the cancer risk due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor <b>laborer</b> in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 fire. The original, complete figure - {{as well as many}} others showing the risks of past exposures - can be viewed in the Summary of Findings from the Historical Public Exposure Studies.|$|E

The Feature of the contract labor is different at present and at the period of higheconomic growth following World War II. This paper explores {{the differences between the}} past and thepresent. The present contract <b>laborers</b> work in the electric machine industry and automobile industry. They are dispatched to a lot of factories. They do core work at production lines. They are non-skilled,temporary and lower wage <b>laborers.</b> On the other hand, the past contract <b>laborers</b> worked in the steel industry and shipbuilding industry. They were dispatched to a few factories. They did supplementary work at production lines. They were skilled, lifetime and higher wage <b>laborers.</b> In a word, working condition for the present contract <b>laborers</b> is inferior to the past. There is the accepted theory that the non-skilled <b>laborers</b> like the present contract <b>laborers</b> will be lost in postindustrial society. So, will the contract <b>laborers</b> be lost in Japan? This paper verifies that theory too.

A total of 7, 360 foreign <b>laborers</b> were enrolled for stool examination in our hospital, and the merthiolate iodine formaldehyde method was used to diagnose intestinal parasite infection. In total, 331 (4. 5 %) foreign <b>laborers</b> were found to be infected, and Blastocystis hominis was identified as the most prevalent intestinal parasite (2. 54 %), followed by Trichuris trichiura (0. 54 %) and hookworm (0. 53 %). Parasite infection rates among <b>laborers</b> of different nationalities were also significantly different (p < 0. 001). Forty-two intestinal-parasite-infected foreign <b>laborers</b> received anti-parasitic therapy in our hospital, and treatment was successful. Among the 154 intestinal-parasite-infected foreign <b>laborers</b> who did not receive treatment in our hospital but were later re-examined, 132 were parasite-free. B. hominis has been the most prevalent intestinal parasite infecting foreign <b>laborers</b> in Taiwan ever since it was added to the list of infections to be screened for stool examination by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control in 2002. It is important to closely monitor, control and treat parasite-infected foreign <b>laborers</b> to minimize the danger to public health...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A total of 400 child <b>laborers</b> by snowball sampling technique and 400 school children by random sampling technique {{were included in the}} study.
