5|$|The writers {{had wanted}} an episode where Burns becomes {{bankrupt}} and shows what Burns would be <b>like</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{person in the}} real world. The idea with the recycling plant was that Burns {{did not have any}} sort of evil plan, he just could not help being himself. Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff joked about this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 check really is.|$|E

500|$|In 1966, {{the first}} fossils of S. freyi were {{collected}} by Edmund Frey and his wife during a trip collecting mineralogical specimens in the Magothy exposure near Cliffwood Beach in Raritan Bay, New Jersey. They found a large deep red piece of amber embedded in clay containing a number of insects, including some Diptera flies. The approximate age of the fossils {{dates back to the}} Cretaceous, 92 million years ago. Donald Baird of Princeton University first notified Carpenter about the recent discovery, and David Stager of the Newark Museum arranged to transfer the specimens to be studied and examined. At the time, the existence of ants of Cretaceous age was significant, but the ants were most likely not detected as much of the amber around the site was previously collected. The discovery of the ants confirmed the existence of Cretaceous ants, and the appearance of the workers closely matched the speculations of what Mesozoic ants looked <b>like.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of these finds, E. O. Wilson and colleagues erected the new subfamily Sphecomyrminae and designated the genus Sphecomyrma (meaning [...] "wasp ant") as the type genus in an article they published in 1967 in the journal Science. The published paper included the first description of S. freyi, which was named after Edmund Frey and his wife. A holotype and a paratype of the species were collected and moved to the Museum of Comparative Zoology, but the holotype was accidentally destroyed. However, a neotype specimen numbered AMNH-NJ-112 was collected from the Sunrise Landing site near Brunswick in 1994, and was subsequently donated to the museum. The holotype was destroyed because the amber was accidentally cracked in half, separating the two workers from each other and later stored in a wooden cabinet in an uncovered draw with other fossil insects for 30 years; the piece eventually deteriorated, appearing more dark and fractured.|$|E

Hayley Krischer of Salon agreed that Clair is [...] "everyone’s favorite" [...] and [...] "undoubtedly the best TV mom", despite being [...] "too calm, too gorgeous, too successful" [...] to be realistic. The Daily Beast wrote, [...] "Clair Huxtable was not only the perfect mom, but also a great role model as someone who never sacrificed either her career as a high-power lawyer or her family life." [...] Praising the character for transcending both racial and generational barriers, Patrice Evans of Jezebel described Clair as [...] "the perfect professional mom". The author went on to claim that while other famous television mothers such as June Cleaver, Carol Brady and Edith Bunker have gradually suffered a loss in [...] "potency" [...] over time, Clair instead remains a relevant maternal figure every television mother created since can only aspire to be <b>like.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> [...] "family-balancing professional African American woman", Clair has had a profound influence on The Cosby Shows viewers. According to Susan Douglas, author of The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women, Clair was [...] "the first African American mother on television ... with whom white women identified and wanted to emulate." [...] US Weekly recognized Clair as [...] "one of TV's first working mothers", while NewNowNext's Brian Juergens credits the character with making the 1980s a [...] "boom time for great sitcom moms" [...] by [...] "breaking the mold in an essential way".

2500|$|Critics {{have further}} noted that, since {{the novel is}} a first person {{narrative}} by Humbert, the novel gives very little information about what Lolita is <b>like</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person, that in effect she has been silenced by not being the book's narrator. Nomi Tamir-Ghez writes [...] "Not only is Lolita's voice silenced, her point of view, the way she sees the situation and feels about it, is rarely mentioned and can be only surmised by the reader... since it is Humbert who tells the story... {{throughout most of the}} novel, the reader is absorbed in Humbert's feelings". Similarly Mica Howe and Sarah Appleton Aguiar write that the novel silences and objectifies Lolita. Christine Clegg notes that this is a recurring theme in criticism of the novel in the 1990s. Actor Brian Cox, who played Humbert in a 2009 one-man stage monologue based on the novel, stated that the novel is [...] "not about Lolita as a flesh and blood entity. It's Lolita as a memory". He concluded that a stage monologue would be truer to the book than any film could possibly be. Elizabeth Janeway writing in The New York Times Book Review holds [...] "Humbert is every man who is driven by desire, wanting his Lolita so badly that it never occurs to him to consider her as a human being, or as anything but a dream-figment made flesh".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Real Thing, Faith No More {{developed}} somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour.

He told Kerrang! magazine [...] "My drummer says he’s gonna kidnap , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he’ll be forced to find a style of his own". In a separate interview, he clarified his comment, remarking [...] "I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?.'" [...] Roddy Bottum responded by saying [...] "To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and i'd like to think they're doing it... <b>like</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> favour". Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that [...] "It just kind of {{came out of the}} blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth. I mean, if he's gonna talk about me in interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me. Maybe one day we'll have a breakoff, just breakdance." ...|$|E

In a 1993 character popularity poll for the series, Weekly Shōnen Jump readers voted Goku second, after his son Gohan. He came in first in the magazine's 1995 poll, as well as in a 2004 poll amongst fans of the series for the book Dragon Ball Forever. In a 2005 The Daily Reader article entitled [...] "The Greatest Geek Movie Heroes of All Time", Goku is the only animated character listed, and is ranked tenth.

In 2000, Goku placed third in an Animax poll of favorite anime characters. NTT customers voted him as their third favorite black haired male anime character. Despite his positive reception, Goku also received negative feedback for his characterization in Dragon Ball Super due to how his constant desires for fighting stronger enemies resulted in setting up a story where all universe could be destroyed. While Anime Now's Richard Eisenbeis believes Goku is determined to protect his universe, the fact that he does not care about other loser universes being destroyed also received negative response. In January 2017, Nowaza won two Guinness World Records for her longevity as Goku; she has been the sole voice actor for the role for over 23 years.|$|E
