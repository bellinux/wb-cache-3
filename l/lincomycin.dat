5|$|Clindamycin is a semisynthetic {{derivative}} of <b>lincomycin,</b> a natural antibiotic {{produced by the}} actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis. It is obtained by 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of <b>lincomycin.</b> The synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in 1966.

5|$|The X-ray crystal {{structures}} of clindamycin bound to ribosomes (or ribosomal subunits) derived from Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Haloarcura marismortui have been determined; {{the structure of}} the closely related antibiotic <b>lincomycin</b> bound to the 50S ribosomal subunit of Staphylococcus aureus has also been reported.|$|E
5|$|It does so by {{preventing}} {{the formation of}} the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl transferase activity), close to the binding sites of chloramphenicol, <b>lincomycin,</b> and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent.|$|E
25|$|In photoinhibition studies, repair {{is often}} stopped by {{applying}} an antibiotic (<b>lincomycin</b> or chloramphenicol) to plants or cyanobacteria, which blocks protein synthesis in the chloroplast. Protein synthesis occurs only in an intact sample, so <b>lincomycin</b> {{is not needed}} when photoinhibition is measured from isolated membranes. The repair cycle of PSII recirculates other subunits of PSII (except for the D1 protein) from the inhibited unit to the repaired one.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lincomycin</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{classified as a}} constituent of the lincosamide group, which typically feature a 6,8-dideoxy-6-aminooctose lincosamine. In <b>Lincomycin</b> A, this sugar moiety (referred to as methylthiolincosamide) is linked via an amide bond to an amino acid derivative (referred to as propylhygric acid). <b>Lincomycin</b> biosynthesis occurs via a biphasic pathway. Propylproline and methylthiolincosamide are each synthesized separately, which are then condensed to form N-demethyllincomycin and finally methylated by S-adenosyl methionine to give <b>lincomycin.</b>|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>lincomycin</b> as an {{antibiotic}} {{has been largely}} superseded by clindamycin which exhibits improved antibacterial activity. Clindamycin also exhibits some activity against parasitic protozoa and {{has been used to}} treat toxoplasmosis and malaria.|$|E
50|$|In the {{biosynthesis}} of {{the amino}} acid moiety of <b>lincomycin,</b> tyrosine comprises {{seven of the}} nine carbons in the prophylhygric acid, while the remaining two carbons are added in reactions with S-adenosyl methionine. Glucose is converted via glycolysis and the hexose monophosphate pathway to phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate, respectively, which are converted via the shikimate pathway to tyrosine and dihydroxyphenylalanine. Although the multistep conversion of dihydroxyphenylalanine to propylproline remains unknown, experiments involving accumulation of 1,2,3,6-tetradehydro-propylproline in mutants lacking a reductase requiring <b>lincomycin</b> cosynthetic factor suggests a biosynthetic scheme that Kuo and coworkers have modified from Brahme et al. to accommodate the remaining steps leading to propylproline.|$|E
50|$|A two-hour {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} 600 mg of <b>Lincomycin</b> achieves average peak serum levels of 15.9 µg/mL and yields therapeutic levels for 14 h for most susceptible gram-positive organisms. Urinary excretion ranges from 4.9% to 30.3% (mean: 13.8%).|$|E
50|$|The gel is not {{recommended}} {{for those who are}} allergic to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, any components of the formulation, or <b>lincomycin.</b> Individuals previously diagnosed with regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, or antibiotic-associated colitis are also recommended not to use it.|$|E

50|$|In the USA, {{resistance}} of Brachyspira species collected 2008-2010 was common only against <b>lincomycin</b> (80% had MIC of 32 or 64), MIC's were moderatetly high against gentamicin, while resistance to valnemulin(4.7%) and tiamulin (3.2% of isolates) was yet uncommon, {{as reported in}} the only U.S. study to date, from Iowa.|$|E
50|$|Clindamycin {{phosphate}} is a water-soluble ester of the semi-synthetic antibiotic clindamycin, {{which is}} synthesized from <b>lincomycin.</b> Like the macrolide antibiotics, {{it acts as}} a bacteriostatic agent by interfering with the 50S subunit of the ribosome of Propionibacterium acnes, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and preventing bacteria from replicating.

50|$|Clindamycin is a {{derivative}} of <b>lincomycin,</b> {{with a slow}} action against blood schizonticides.
