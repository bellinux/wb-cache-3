5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day <b>level</b> <b>it</b> does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E

5|$|After Hitler's {{release from}} prison on 20 December 1924, the Nazi Party was officially refounded. In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organise the {{formation}} of a new bodyguard unit, the Schutzkommando ("Protection Command"). Hitler wanted a small group of tough ex-soldiers like Schreck, who would be loyal to him. The unit included old Stoßtrupp members like Emil Maurice and Erhard Heiden. The unit made its first public appearance in April 1925. That same year, the Schutzkommando was expanded to a national <b>level.</b> <b>It</b> was also successively renamed the Sturmstaffel ("Storm Squadron") and then finally the Schutzstaffel ("Protection Squadron"; SS) on 9 November 1925. Schreck became SS member #5. He was asked by Hitler to command the bodyguard company. Schreck never referred to himself as Reichsführer-SS, but the title was retroactively applied to him in later years.|$|E
5|$|Canada is {{a federal}} {{parliamentary}} democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal <b>level.</b> <b>It</b> {{is one of the}} world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks.

5|$|Located on the Atlantic {{coast of}} the Sahara Desert, it lies {{on the west coast}} of Africa. With the {{exception}} of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbour. Nouakchott is largely flat and only a few meters above sea <b>level.</b> <b>It</b> is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.|$|E

5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms {{in a way}} that is clear and widely agreed is important, as some {{disputes}} in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or family or order; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different <b>level</b> <b>it</b> must be renamed.|$|E
5|$|Norton Internet Security 2000, {{released}} January 10, 2000, was Symantec's {{first foray}} beyond virus protection and content control filters. Its release followed an alliance between Internet provider Excite@Home and antivirus vendor McAfee.com to provide Internet subscribers with McAfee's new firewall software, McAfee Personal Firewall. Version 2000s firewall, based on AtGuard from WRQ, filters traffic at the packet <b>level.</b> <b>It</b> can block ActiveX controls and Java applets. Other functionalities include cookie removal, and banner ad blocking. ZDNet found the ad blocker removed graphics {{that were not}} ads, breaking pages. Adjusting the settings fixed the problem, however the process was complicated. ZDNet noted {{the lack of information}} presented concerning attacks the firewall blocked. Norton LiveUpdate downloads and installs program updates.|$|E

After obtaining suffrage at the federal level, women quickly rose in political significance, with the first woman on the seven member Federal Council executive being Elisabeth Kopp, who served from 1984–1989, and the first female president being Ruth Dreifuss in 1999.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).

The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves.
