50|$|A {{trench drain}} (also channel <b>drain,</b> <b>line</b> <b>drain,</b> slot drain, linear drain or strip drain) is a {{specific}} type of floor drain containing a dominant trough- or channel-shaped body. It is used for the rapid evacuation of surface water or for the containment of utility lines or chemical spills. Employing a solid cover or grating that is flush with the adjoining surface, this drain is commonly made of concrete in-situ and may utilize polymer- or metal-based liners or a channel former to aid in channel crafting and slope formation. Characterized by its long length and narrow width, the cross-section of the drain {{is a function of the}} maximum flow volume anticipated from the surrounding surface. Channels can range from 1 in to 2 feet in width, with depths that can reach 4 ft.|$|R

Postoperative autotransfusion begins in the operating room when the <b>drain</b> <b>line</b> is placed and the surgical site is closed. Typical postoperative cases are total knee and hip replacements. Autotransfusion is continued and is effective while the patient actively bleeds during the immediate postoperative phase of recovery. Autotransfusion is ended when bleeding is stopped or is significantly slow, and is discontinued by connecting an ordinary self draining device to the <b>drain</b> <b>line(s).</b> Available for postoperative autotransfusion are universal bifurcated connectors which can accommodate two <b>drain</b> <b>lines</b> of any size, these connectors can be attached to the standard ten foot double lumen suction line for postoperative use.|$|R

50|$|The popular {{trend in}} trench drains are linear systems. Linear as in <b>line</b> <b>drain.</b> Made from {{materials}} such as polymer concrete, fiberglass, structural plastic and steel, liner systems are the channel and grate components that are assembled in the trench and around which concrete is poured to form a drain system. By themselves, these liner systems {{do not have the}} strength and integrity to hold up under the physical requirements needed for the drain. A concrete (or asphalt) drain body is required to encase the channel to give the channel compressive strength and rigidity to ensure the drain will be able to withstand the traffic load it was designed to handle.|$|R

40|$|Municipal {{sanitary}} sewer systems are, {{second to the}} drinking water system, the most important public health asset of a city. When they are properly operating, that is, carrying the wastewater and sewage away from homes and businesses and to the treatment plant, they protect the pub-lic from the potential health hazards associated with human waste. However, when blockages in the pipes cause backups into homes or businesses or overflows in streets or right-of-ways, the health of citizens is at risk. One {{of the factors that}} contributes to sewer line blockages is the intrusion of tree roots. Landowners and landscape professionals {{should be aware of the}} location of sewer lines when planning land-scapes.

40|$|A {{non-uniform}} <b>drain</b> <b>line</b> distributed {{power amplifier}} (DPA) based on GaAs PHEMT technology and employing a broadband impedance transformer is presented. In the DPA topology, each device {{contributes to the}} overall output impedance of the amplifier. The value of the load impedance is chosen for optimal power performance across the required frequency range of the four-section PHEMT DPA with non-uniform <b>drain</b> <b>line.</b> An m-derived section is implemented at both terminations of the gate line. Each device is supplied with 5 V, while a bias voltage of 0. 44 V is applied to each gate, resulting in Class AB operation for the active devices. The necessary phase velocities synchronization between the gate and <b>drain</b> <b>lines</b> is achieved by adopting a non-uniform gate line design and selecting an output load equal to 12. 5 ω. In order to match the entire circuit to a standard 50 ω load over the broad frequency range of operation, a wide-band impedance transformer having a transformation ratio of 1 : 4 has been implemented...|$|R
50|$|Distillation was {{performed}} by a process akin to charcoal burning, involving the entire village in a group effort. A large, shallow conical pit was dug, 100 feet (30 m) in diameter and lined with clay. A central drain was constructed, with an underground <b>lined</b> <b>drain</b> leading outwards to a collection pit beyond the burning pit. This drain was protected by a strainer dome to avoid ash entering the tar drain and to separate the burning bark from the flammable tar. The pit was then stacked with carefully arranged layers of birch bark, above an insulating and filtering layer of linden husks. The bark was very carefully stacked, {{so that there was}} no airspace between layers and so combustion could be controlled. A completed pit might be filled ten or twenty feet high (3-6 m). An airtight cover of earth, animal dung and damp fireproof material was placed over the pit, {{in the manner of a}} charcoal clamp. A fire of straw was then lit in the centre, spreading slowly outwards into the birch bark.|$|R

Whereas the former test campaign within WP 31320 [RD 2] estimated the damping and frequency characteristic of the cryogenic liquid the actual test report within WP 31330 deals with static tests of the cryogenic liquid. The aim of these tests is to analyze the filling, draining and stratification behavior of liquid nitrogen with respect to different thermodynamic boundary conditions inside the CTD. Except the initial boiling test all other test cases were performed with a thermally chilled tank. Additionally during all types of tests pressure levels, flow rates of liquid and vapor, wall- and fluid temperatures, liquid fill levels are recorded as well as videos of the CTD (all tests) and the <b>draining</b> <b>line</b> (<b>draining</b> test cases) ...|$|R

Ks values were 10 to 130 times greater for the constant head permeameter compared to the Guelph permeameter method and were significantly different at all depths for the two measurement methods.
