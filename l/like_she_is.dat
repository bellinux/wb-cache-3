500|$|... "Beat of My Heart" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics wrote that Duff sounds <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> bored and [...] "going through the motions" [...] on the song. She further stated that Duff has [...] "lost her sauciness and ironically, her spunk" [...] in the song. Avoledo concluded her review by calling [...] "the bland electro pop" [...] song an [...] "insult to the genre. It's like spilling ramen on a Vivenne Westwood evening gown." [...] A reviewer from CBBC Newsround {{commented that the}} song is so repetitive that you will feel like [...] "you've listened to it 20 times after just one play". The reviewer praised the heartbeat present on the track, writing that it [...] "make it {{a bit of a}} foot-tapper", but deemed the lyrics to be [...] "meaningless". The reviewer concluded that: [...] "You'll find yourself humming it but will be hard pushed to remember what on earth she was singing about!" [...] Spence D. of IGN wrote that [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] does not try for subtlety as it utilizes the [...] "much overused heartbeat" [...] for the [...] "foundation rhythm" [...] of the song.|$|E
500|$|Chloe's {{relationship}} with her mother is one tackled both off-screen and behind the scenes. In a brainstorming session, Mack, Gough and Millar {{came up with the}} idea that Chloe's mother had left her at a young age. Mack wanted to make the character a [...] "latchkey kid", in an effort to explain why she is out all hours of the night. Mack feels that Chloe has real abandonment issues, which play on the fact that she never feels <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> good enough for anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same way that she loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends. One of Chloe's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility. This fear also affects Clark, who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe, like it did Pete.|$|E

When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having [...] "a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before. That was quite remarkable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Non-Scientologists Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos {{described}} in a 1990 article in the LA Times how Scientologists believe that when a person dies—or, in Scientology terms, when a thetan abandons its physical body—they go to a [...] "landing station" [...] on the planet Venus, where the thetan is re-implanted and told lies about its past life and its next life. The Venusians take the thetan, [...] "capsule" [...] it, and {{send it back to}} Earth to be thrown into the ocean off the coast of California. They quote Hubbard as saying, [...] "If you can get out of that, and through that, and wander around through the cities and find some girl who looks <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> going to get married or have a baby or something like that, you're all set.

2500|$|On March 14, {{clips of}} {{controversial}} sermons from Obama's former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, resurfaced on YouTube and received heavy airtime on cable news television. Among other things, Wright said, [...] "God damn America for treating our citizens {{as less than}} human. God damn America {{for as long as}} she acts <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> God and she is supreme." [...] Four days later, Obama responded to the controversy in a 37-minute speech, speaking openly about race and religion in the United States. He denounced Wright's remarks while refusing to condemn the pastor himself, and he attempted to pivot from the immediate circumstances to address the larger theme of [...] "A More Perfect Union." [...] The speech was regarded as [...] "breathtakingly unconventional" [...] in its political strategy and tone, and it received generally positive reviews in the press. The New York Times weighed in with an editorial: [...] "Senator Barack Obama, who has not faced such tests of character this year, faced one on Tuesday. It is hard to imagine how he could have handled it better." [...] Ten days later, the speech had been watched at least 3.4 million times on YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|Sophia Bush portrays Brooke Davis. [...] "What I do {{like about}} her– {{the things that}} I have had to portray her going through– you always learn a lesson from Brooke", stated Bush. [...] "She always manages to pick herself up when she falls on her face. And I respect that. She is not all high and mighty and she doesn't act <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> always right. She {{has a lot of}} {{convictions}} and she is [...] really loyal friend. I appreciate how loyal she is. She doesn't take betrayal lightly and she doesn't think it is OK to lie to someone." [...] Brooke is the beautiful captain of the high school cheerleading squad, and the best friend of Peyton, and close friend of Haley. She has twice been a girlfriend to Lucas. Though her life appears perfect at the beginning, she is seen to suffer from having to deal with her distant parents, her friends' inability to take her seriously, and the betrayal of Lucas and Peyton when they date behind her back leaving her hurt.

2500|$|The {{character}} was created as {{the sister of}} established character, Brooke Freeman (Beth Allen) due to Blampied's and Allen's physical similarity. Bree first appeared on the show when Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva) mistook her for his girlfriend – Brooke. Although Bree tried {{to get on with}} Brooke, the feelings were not mutual and Brooke struggled to accept her sister. Whilst the two characters were getting to know each other, so too were their actresses; Blampied and Beth Allen and the two shared a dressing room. Blampied herself was an only child, but found working alongside Allen reassuring, [...] "I was kind of getting to know Beth in an almost sisterly way at the same time Bree and Brooke were getting to know each other. So it's kind of worked for me." [...] After Vinnie left Brooke for her behaviour towards Bree, he and Bree started an affair, creating a love triangle between the sisters. Bree revealed to Vinnie that her qualifications as a surgeon were dodgy and alerted Brooke. However instead of deepening the rival between the two, it only forced the two closer together. Blampied explained the situation stating; [...] "Instead of throwing Bree under a bus, Brooke decides she quite likes that Bree has a big secret, because it makes her more human – or more <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> ... Brooke decides she is going to take Bree under her wing and help her out of the mess. In many ways Bree becomes Brooke's little protege. I think they've both had the chance to let their guard down with one another. Now that Brooke has seen Bree at her lowest – desperate and vulnerable – it has endeared her to Brooke." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duncan takes Anne to a recital by a {{choir of}} monks, one of whom, Paul, is an Immortal. Neither man realises that the song being sung is [...] "The Song Of The Executioner", as the unseen {{impresario}} who organised the concert is Kalas, an Immortal with scores to settle with both Duncan and Paul. Kalas kills Paul and then sets about destroying MacLeod, first by framing Joe for dealing drugs then by killing two of Anne's patients and fabricating hospital records {{to make it}} look <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> responsible. Duncan realises that Kalas is behind this and, having cleared Joe and Anne, confronts his enemy. As they fight, Anne sees Duncan fall to his death, but Richie gets her away before Duncan revives. In the midst of this, Richie embarks on a new career in motorcycle racing. Rather than tell Anne the truth, especially with Kalas at large, Duncan leaves Seacouver, arranging for Maurice to buy back the barge in Paris. Arriving in Paris, Duncan is greeted by Hugh Fitzcairn, who is teaching cookery at the Cordon Bleu, ("Star Crossed"). The normally philandering Fitz is in love but has a rival, who tries |to kill him by running the two Immortals off the road. At the same time, Richie arrives in France, looking to build on his American successes in motorcycling. Whilst Fitz tells Duncan he should trust Anne, Kalas frames Fitz for the murder of his rival. On the run, Fitz is confronted by Kalas, who beheads him as MacLeod helplessly watches.When Duncan comes for Kalas, his nemesis escapes into a cloud of steam.Determined to finish Kalas, Duncan seeks Joe's help. Kalas owns a nightclub and Duncan [...] "persuades" [...] the bartender to tell him where Kalas has gone. Kalas has captured his own Watcher and is looking for information on"Methos", the legendary oldest Immortal. After Kalas kills one of the Watchers' historians, Donald Salzer, Dawson sends Duncan to a researcher on the Methos Chronicle, Adam Pierson. Duncan is stunned to find that Pierson is Methos. Kalas confronts Methos, who escapes and sets up Duncan to take his head, realising that he cannot handle Kalas, but Duncan could. Duncan refuses, but when he confronts Kalas at Methos' apartment, their fight is interrupted by the police, who arrest Kalas for Salzer's murder after Adam Pierson identifies Kalas. Before he vanishes from Paris, Methos tells Duncan that he couldn't take the chance on Kalas winning. In the two part season Finale, Amanda arrives at the barge, being very, very nice to Duncan, which always arouses his suspicions, ("Finale"). Eventually, she tells him that she broke Kalas out of jail, to kill him, but that Kalas got away. Kalas, using the thugs employed by his cellmate, wastes no time in coming for MacLeod and, as Duncan and Amanda try to find him, finds Maurice, who Duncan rescues {{in the nick of time}} and sends out of Paris. Kalas captures Amanda, intending to use her as bait, but she escapes. A new problem arises, when Joe Dawson and Methos arrive at the barge. Christine Salzer, the widow of Donald Salzer, the historian Kalas murdered, has found a database created for the Watchers and intends to give it to the newspapers. Dawson tries to stop her, even trying to shoot her, but MacLeod prevents him from becoming a murderer, taking the bullet himself. As the Immortals think that their secret will be on CNN, Kalas intercepts Christine and kills her, taking the vital disk. He uses the information to find the European head of the Watchers and kills him. He gives Duncan a choice - surrender to him or Kalas will broadcast the information on the disk. Watchers and Immortals combine to hunt Kalas down. Methos tells Duncan to fight Kalas and Amanda and Duncan, faced with the destruction of their world, finally admit their feelings for each other openly. Duncan faces Kalas on the top of the Eiffel Tower and takes his enemy's head. The Quickening of such a powerful Immortal surges through the steelwork of the tower and overloads the Paris power grid, plunging the city into darkness and, in the process, blowing up Kalas' computer and destroying the disk. After celebrating Duncan's victory over Kalas and remembering Paul and Fitzcairn, Joe and Methos leave Duncan and Amanda alone to work out how much of what they said to each other they really want to take back.|$|E
