40|$|International {{audience}} Scheduling {{decisions in}} the diffusion area of a semiconductor manufacturing facility have an important impact on the overall performance of a plant. Consequently, we want to optimize those decisions while taking real-world constraints into account. The problem we address is a generalization of a job shop with multiple resources per operation. We aim to optimize several objectives that comprise throughput and waiting time. The operations to be performed in the diffusion area are cleaning or furnace operations that need specific machines. To obtain practicable schedules, we consider complex machines of that area in detail and include their components as resources in our model. Complex machines consist of tubes, boats and a <b>load</b> <b>port.</b> A tube {{is the place where}} processes are conducted. A boat is a moveable carrier for wafers needed for all operations in a machine. The <b>load</b> <b>port</b> is the place where wafers are loaded and unloaded. For those resources, we are given synchronization constraints that can be explained using two characteristic examples: Firstly, if a loading operation uses the <b>load</b> <b>port</b> of a machine, the corresponding unloading operation must use the <b>load</b> <b>port</b> of the same machine. Secondly, after a specific boat is loaded, it cannot be used elsewhere before being unloaded. So, a resource can be blocked even if no operation is currently using it. Many approaches from literature extend the job shop problem to the needs of realworld problems. However, we are not aware of any work that addresses resource dependencies as described above. For the given problem, we present a construction algorithm to find an initial solution. We propose a suitable disjunctive graph representation that adapts ideas from Dauzère-Pérès and Paulli (1997) and introduce moves that form a basis for different metaheuristics. Finally, we present results of an implementation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} are {{presented}} the formulations {{of the fundamental}} maritime transportation problems and then is studied the case when restrictions are inclusions. In classical mathematical programming problems, in general, and in maritime transportation problems, in particular, we admit that we know exactly the coefficients which interfere in the problem. This assumption is not satisfied in most real problems because: the coefficients of the problem are submitted to measurement errors; the coefficients are not known exactly, but we known only that they belong to some convex sets. Next, we will study the maritime transportation problem, in general, {{and then we will}} study the case when restrictions are inclusions. In economical analysis of a voyage of a vessel Q, we have in view the following criterions: the reduction of voyage duration, the reduction of fuel consumption and avoidance exposing the vessel and equipments to excessive fraying or damages. In maritime transportation problem there is the following axiom: when the economical criterion is contradictory to vessel safety criterion, in choosing the route is priority the safety criterion. This axiom is called the navigation principle. Because the unit costs (per ton of transported merchandise) depends on: l- the type of merchandise; the distance and duration of voyage between the <b>loading</b> <b>ports</b> " "i and the unloading ports " "j; the type of the vessel " "k, then they represent a quantity lijkc characterized by 4 indices. Therefore, the classical maritime transportation problem is the following: Let determine the merchandise quantities lijkx (of type l) transported on the route. i j with the vessel of type k such that the sum 1 1 1 1 q pm n lijk lijk l i j k c x to be minimal...|$|E
40|$|Operations {{research}} has proven {{itself to be}} advantageous in several areas of the industry for many years, but is operations research a good approach to operational maritime planning? Expressions {{used to calculate the}} initial stability of a vessel are often non-linear. Optimisation models demand linearity, and approximated linearisations of the proven stability formulas needed to be developed. This was arguably found to be the biggest challenge when modelling the cargo stowage optimisation model. The characteristics of the RoRo shipping industry have been examined to gain a better understand of the segment. Further, some methods for calculating the initial stability of floating bodies have been presented for the readers that are not already familiar with this area of science. The thesis has used a published optimisation model as a foundation for further expansions. The model is a mathematical formulation of a cargo stowage problem in the RoRo shipping segment, where a predetermined vessel ships mandatory and optional cargoes from fixed <b>loading</b> <b>ports</b> to unloading ports. The reference model controls the vertical and transverse stability of the vessel by imposing constraints that are linear approximations of stability formulas. The model was expanded to ensure the longitudinal stability of the vessel as well. Additionally, the definitions of the existing vertical and transverse stability constraints were altered to provide more accurate co-ordinates for the expanded optimisation model. The computational study showed that the original model was able to find the optimal solution faster than the expanded model. The stowage flexibility was also better than for the expanded model, and the revenue generated was equal or higher in the original model for all scenarios. This was because the expanded model is of a greater size than the original, and is much more constrained in terms of stowage on the various decks. The expanded model divides the decks on the vessel not only into lanes, as the original model does, but also into slots. It can therefore ensure the longitudinal stability of the vessel as well. In addition to this, the lanes and slots in the expanded model are subject to lower and upper bounds for width and length, respectively. The original model allows the width of a lane to take values from zero up to the total width of the deck. In the original model, the size of the set of lanes therefore does not dictate the division of decks into lanes. This was found good for stowage flexibility, but is problematic to defend from a stability and safety perspective. </p...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, navigation-related {{forecasts}} {{in central}} Europe cover short- to medium-range lead times {{linked to the}} travel times of vessels to pass the main waterway bottlenecks leaving the <b>loading</b> <b>ports.</b> Without doubt, this aspect is still essential for navigational users, but {{in light of the}} growing political intention to use the free capacity of the inland waterway transport in Europe, additional lead time supporting strategic decisions is more and more in demand. However, no such predictions offering extended lead times of several weeks up to several months currently exist for considerable parts of the European waterway network. This paper describes the set-up of a monthly to seasonal forecasting system for the German stretches of the international waterways of the Rhine, Danube and Elbe rivers. Two competitive forecast approaches have been implemented: the dynamical set-up forces a hydrological model with post-processed outputs from ECMWF general circulation model System 4, whereas the statistical approach is based on the empirical relationship ("teleconnection") of global oceanic, climate and regional hydro-meteorological data with river flows. The performance of both forecast methods is evaluated in relation to the climatological forecast (ensemble of historical streamflow) and the well-known ensemble streamflow prediction approach (ESP, ensemble based on historical meteorology) using common performance indicators (correlation coefficient; mean absolute error, skill score; mean squared error, skill score; and continuous ranked probability, skill score) and an impact-based evaluation quantifying the potential economic gain. The following four key findings result from this study: (1) as former studies for other regions of central Europe indicate, the accuracy and/or skill of the meteorological forcing used has a larger effect than the quality of initial hydrological conditions for relevant stations along the German waterways. (2) Despite the predictive limitations on longer lead times in central Europe, this study reveals the existence of a valuable predictability of streamflow on monthly up to seasonal timescales along the Rhine, upper Danube and Elbe waterways, and the Elbe achieves the highest skill and economic value. (3) The more physically based and the statistical approach are able to improve the predictive skills and economic value compared to climatology and the ESP approach. The specific forecast skill highly depends on the forecast location, the lead time and the season. (4) Currently, the statistical approach seems to be most skilful for the three waterways investigated. The lagged relationship between the monthly and/or seasonal streamflow and the climatic and/or oceanic variables vary between 1 month (e. g. local precipitation, temperature and soil moisture) up to 6 months (e. g. sea surface temperature). Besides focusing on improving the forecast methodology, especially by combining the individual approaches, the focus is on developing useful forecast products on monthly to seasonal timescales for waterway transport and to operationalize the related forecasting service...|$|E
