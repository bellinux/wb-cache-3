5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, the Parole Board granted Baker a {{full and}} {{unconditional}} pardon. Commentators have suggested that in 1945, the Board of Pardons and Parole could have <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> charge to voluntary manslaughter, which would have carried an average 15-year sentence and saved her life.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, aged 16, Board was {{a member}} of the London Olympiades squad that won the 4 × 100 m relay title at the Women's AAA junior championships. Later that year, she showed her {{versatility}} with a career best leap of 5.80 m in the Long Jump and indoor wins over 60 yards (7.2) and 300 yards (42.0). She also <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> 100 y best time to 10.9 and her 220 y best to 24.7.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 15, due to the {{frequency}} of performances at different venues (up to six venues per day) that she had, her voice was affected due {{to the development of}} nodules on her vocal chords. Following the advice of the doctor, she took a year off and to keep herself occupied, she attended art lessons with her cousin. After a year, she started performing again despite the change in her vocal range, which <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> voice by an octave (eight keys).|$|E

25|$|She {{followed}} this momentous triumph with {{a run of}} four wins at 400 m in five international events, most notably securing the only victory for Britain's women (in a time of 53.7) in the 1967 European Cup, final in Kiev on 15 September. That season she also <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> 200 m personal best to 24.6 and her 880 y best to 2.08.7. Recognition of a highly successful season came when she was chosen as Athlete of the Year by the Athletic Writers' Association.|$|E
25|$|At 19:16 on 13 June 1917, Manchuria was {{standing}} out of New York Harbor {{in a thick}} fog when she collided with the United States Navy monitor , suffering damage below the waterline. Attempting to clear, Manchuria scraped the Amphitrite′s bow, and her propeller strut fouled her cable, holding her fast for 20 minutes. Manchuria <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> boats and her crew abandoned ship; two section patrol boats and a motor sailer stood by and took her lifeboats in tow. Ultimately, Manchuria was towed and beached off Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York.|$|E
25|$|Whiting did {{not survive}} the opening months of the War of 1812. Having sailed from Plymouth, she entered Hampton Roads on 8 July 1812 with despatches for the American government, and <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> anchor. Unfortunately war had been {{declared}} about two weeks earlier. As Maxey was being rowed ashore, the Norfolk privateer Dash, under Captain Garroway, was leaving port and captured her. Dash had one large gun on a pivot, and a crew of 80. Not only were a third of Whitings crew in her boat, the rest were not at the guns as they were unaware that Britain and the United States were now at war.|$|E

Mayor Fennell chose to voluntarily not accept the council-assigned pay, thereby <b>lowering</b> <b>her</b> salary by 20 percent. Fennell voluntarily removed a Marketing, Advertising and Promotion Account ($60K/year) from her 2014 budget. Council colleagues attacked various budget items, including expenditures for a 'vehicle' and a 'contract driving service, for 10 years'.|$|R
25|$|In November, Yeo <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> own {{national}} {{mark in the}} 50 metre breaststroke to 32.75 at the Tokyo leg of the 2012 FINA Swimming World Cup. Seven days later at the eighth and final leg in Singapore, Yeo set two more national records. In the 200 metre breaststroke, the time was lowered to 2:29.74 and in the 50 metre breaststroke she stopped the clock at 32.72, wiping 0.03 seconds from her record set in Tokyo. After finishing equal third in the 50 metre breaststroke in a new personal best time of 33.09 at the Dubai Asian Swimming Championships, Yeo set a further two national records at the 2012 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Istanbul. Although she did not advance to the semifinals, Yeo clocked 1:09.28 in the 100 metre breaststroke to wipe 0.76 seconds from her previous mark and clocked 32.63 in the 50 metre breaststroke, improving on her previous record by 0.09 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The ships reached Dunedin Star on 1 or 2 December. Nerine {{launched}} {{some of her}} supply-laden Carley floats {{to reach}} the shore party, but the strong current swept them away. She {{moved closer to the}} shore, launched her remaining floats and returned to Walvis Bay. Temeraire launched her motor boat and took 10 men off Dunedin Star, but the boat shipped a lot of water which stopped her motor. The Norwegian boatmen then rowed {{for an hour and a}} half to Manchester Division, which took the 10 survivors aboard. The Norwegians were now so exhausted that Temeraire had to take them and their boat back aboard. The next day Sir Charles Elliot arrived. Temeraire again <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> motor boat, which in four trips rescued the remaining 32 men from Dunedin Star and transferred them all to Sir Charles Elliot. In the heavy sea the tug then struggled to get alongside Manchester Division to transfer all of the rescued men except Captain Lee and his Chief and Second Engineers, who were taken aboard Nerine.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Seeadler encountered another steamship, which {{refused to}} identify itself. The German ensign was raised and a shot fired across {{the bow of}} the Lundy Island, which was carrying sugar from Madagascar. The steamer still refused to heave to, and Luckner fired four rounds directly at her. The steamer then hove to and <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> boats, but her captain ignored an order to come to Seeadler. A German boarding party was sent over and discovered that the crew had abandoned ship when the first shots were fired, leaving the captain alone on board. Captain Bannister later told Luckner that he had previously been captured by a German raider and had given his parole, which he had broken; thus, he was not anxious to be a prisoner of war again. Luckner continued his voyage southwards, and by 21 January he was in mid-Atlantic between Brazil and West Africa when he found the 2,199 ton French three-masted barque Charles Gounod, which was loaded with corn. She was quickly dispatched, but her log book recorded information about other ships she had met and their intended route.|$|E

25|$|Lim {{closed out}} {{the year by}} winning four medals at the 2013 Southeast Asian Games in Naypyidaw, Burma. In the 50 metre freestyle, Lim, the two-time champion, defended her title again and <b>lowered</b> <b>her</b> games record to 25.69. In her other {{individual}} event, Lim finished fourth in the 100 metre freestyle in 56.85. In the 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay, Lim with Quah Ting Wen, Lynette Lim and Tao Li won gold in 8:13.99. The time was slower than the national open and Games records of 8:09.91 and 8:11.75 set in 2009, but is the second fastest since the 2010 banning of non-textile swimsuits. In the 4 × 100 metre medley relay, Lim with Tao, Samantha Yeo and Quah Ting Wen won gold in 4:13.02. Lim's 56.20-second freestyle split was the fastest in textile swimsuits since Joscelin Yeo's 56.03 and 56.19 in 2001 and 2005 respectively. Lim fourth medal was a silver in the 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay with Quah, Mylene Ong and Lynette Lim in 3:49.00. Finishing 1.34 seconds behind Thailand, the national open record of 3:45.73 and textile-best time of 3:48.38 remained intact.|$|E
