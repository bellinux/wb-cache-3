Index extension was (L:B) = 10,23 (higher index ratio of length to width of the shell shows its degree of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility).</b> This allowed destroyers to withstand severe wave activity (five-meter wavelength of 100 meters). It also provided vysokohnuchkoyu steel (with a time fracture resistance of 55 kg / mm 2 [...] ).Strength and flexibility provided hull {{of a set of}} longitudinal and transverse ribs. Calculation of the frames was carried out from the stern to the bow of the ship. The main feature of the design of the shell was the use of a set of longitudinal ribs (41 - 139 units) in the boiler and engine room. The body is composed of 8-mm vertical stakes height 1050 mm, with double steel angles at the upper and lower edges, two dnyschevyh and other airborne stringer on each side, and one carling (350 × 1-1,5 mm [...] ) on each side.The whole design with 4 mm steel deck of the second floor and upper deck with longitudinal septa, 6-9 millimeter siding and 11.5 mm deck Stringer, were sufficiently strong and rigid structure, which was opposed longitudinal bending moment at different operating conditions.Since the construction of the ship included a double bottom mizhdonnyy space divided flora (peredilkamy) into compartments where fuel is stored. For machine and boiler compartment vertical keel gradually declined and proceeded to a vertical stem shaped and molded sternpost.Cross set consisting of frames (double angles 6 mm interconnected cakes - 4.5 mm sheets) and Bims upper and residential decks (5 mm angles).

Using flow diverter stent alone to treat cerebral aneurysm is recognized as a safe and effective method. However, flow diverter stents currently available have limitations due to their braided structures. In this paper a novel flow diverter stent is proposed. It {{is made out of}} nitinol tubes that provide adequate radial stiffness and tailored surface coverage to overcome problems of currently available braided stents while retaining low porosity and excellent <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility.</b> Finite element analysis using Abaqus has been conducted to investigate radial stiffness, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility,</b> and maximum strain during packaging of a series of novel stent designs with varied geometric parameters. Results show that porosity below 70 % can be achieved and provides radial stiffness and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility</b> comparable to those of the Neuroform stent that is commonly used for stent assisted coiling.

40|$|In this work, {{shape memory}} polymer {{neurovascular}} stent prototypes {{based on a}} previously proposed design were thermo-mechanically characterized to expand on the clinical efficacy of the device. The stents were made by dip-coating pins in a thermoplastic polymer solution and subsequently covalently crosslinking the polymer using UV irradiation to yield thermoset tubes. These crosslinked tubes were CO 2 laser engraved to produce the complex stent geometry. Experiments were conducted to determine the physiologically relevant mechanical behavior of these devices. Three point bend tests were performed to determine the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility</b> of deployed stents at room temperature and body temperature. The resulting <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility</b> data was compared to currently available stent systems. Radial behavior tests were conducted on stent prototypes and polymer tubes using a radial compression system that interfaces with a tensile tester. Crimping and radial recovery behavior experiments measured the pressure exerted by the device {{as a function of}} strain recovery at discrete temperatures. Crimped polymer tubes, representing idealized polymer stents, were deployed in the compression station at fixed diameters. These tests represented the constrained recovery environment of an occluded vessel and quantified recovery pressures as a function of temperature. Material characterization techniques such as dynamic mechanical analysis, tensile testing, and gel fraction studies were employed to further quantify the clinical relevance of this device. These devices proved to have <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility</b> values comparable to or better than many stents currently available on the market, which makes them attractive for neurovascular applications requiring navigation of tortuous vessels. Additionally, Shape memory tests demonstrated a one second device deployment, which minimizes the amount of heat introduced into the body. This study also provides a body of data useful for further optimization of this medical device, such as desirable crimping pressures, optimal crimping temperatures, and device deployment pressures...|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} {{stiffness of}} naked DNA {{is evident from}} measured values of longitudinal persistence length (∼ 150 bp) and torsional persistence length (∼ 180 bp). These parameters predict that certain arrangements of eukaryotic transcription activator proteins in gene promoters should be much more effective than others in fostering protein-protein interactions with the basal RNA polymerase II transcription apparatus. Thus, if such interactions require some kind of DNA looping, DNA loop energies should depend sensitively on helical phasing of protein binding sites, loop size, and intrinsic DNA curvature within the loop. Using families of artificial transcription templates where these parameters were varied, we were {{surprised to find that}} the degree of transcription activation by arrays of Gal 4 -VP 1 transcription activators in HeLa cell nuclear extract was sensitive only to the linear distance separating a basal promoter from an array of bound activators on DNA templates. We now examine the hypothesis that this unexpected result is due to factors in the extract that act to enhance apparent DNA flexibility. We demonstrate that HeLa cell nuclear extract is rich in a heat-resistant activity that dramatically enhances apparent DNA <b>longitudinal</b> and torsional <b>flexibility.</b> Recombinant mammalian high-mobility group 2 (HMG- 2) protein can substitute for this activity. We propose that the abundance of HMG proteins in eukaryotic nuclei provides an environment in which DNA is made sufficiently flexible to remove many constraints on protein binding site arrangements that would otherwise limit efficient transcription activation to certain promoter geometries...|$|R

40|$|Cerebral {{aneurysm}} {{is common}} lesion among adult population. Current {{methods for treating}} the disease have several limitations. Inspired by fern leaves, we have developed a new stent, called leaf stent, which can provide a tailored coverage at the neck of an aneurysm and thus prevent the blood from entering the aneurysm. It alone {{can be used to}} treat the cerebral aneurysm and therefore overcomes problems existing in current treating methods. The paper focuses on the numerical simulation of the leaf stents. The mechanical behaviour of the stent in various designs has been investigated using the finite element method.

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility</b> of a continuously welded railway track and the methodology {{for the analysis of}} the longitudinal displacement of rails under the effects of passing trains is developed to investigate the longitudinal behavior of rails. The purpose of this analysis is to explore the changes of longitudinal stress distribution in the rails due to mechanical loading applied by a travelling train. A half track system is used to derive the equations required to obtain the magnitude of deflection and force of rails and these values are scaled to produce the displacement pattern using the method of superposition. The {{mathematical model}} is translated into MATLAB and validation of the program is verified through comparisons of displacement patterns generated by a computer software LONGIN. Analysis of a straight track due to train braking was performed over a track length of 1000 m.

40|$|AbstractThe {{angiographic}} patency and histologic {{characteristics of}} a new balloon-expandable tantalum stent were studied after implantation intervals ranging from 1 to 32 weeks in atherogenic miniature swine peripheral and coronary arteries. Stents were placed in 34 arteries (10 coronary and 24 iliac arteries) {{in a total of}} 13 swine. Two swine died within 24 h of stent implantation. Follow-up angiography was performed before death was induced in 11 swine (8 coronary and 19 iliac arteries) and revealed 100 % patency without evidence of lumen stenosis, thrombosis or migration of the stents. The neointimal thickening was maximal at 4 weeks after stent implantation and was at its minimum at 32 weeks after implantation with reendothelialization of the stents generally complete at that time. An advantage of this balloon-expandable device is its inherent <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility.</b> The coil configuration allowed the nondeployed stent to negotiate acute bends in coronary arteries to reach the site of implantation and also allowed the deployed stent to conform to the natural contour of tortuous coronary arteries. The tantalum device was remarkable for its radiographic visibility, which greatly aided its placement under fluoroscopic guidance. This study demonstrates this slent's ease of implantation, excellent patency rate and absence of restenosis due to neointimal proliferation for up to 8 months in this atherogenic swine model...|$|E
40|$|Objective—To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} and angiographic {{results of the}} first clinical application of a new balloon expandable stent, the NIR stent, characterised by high <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility</b> and low profile before expansion, and by high radial support and minimal recoil and shortening after expansion.  Design—Single centre survey of unselected lesions in consecutive patients.  Setting—Tertiary referral centre.  Patients and lesions— 93 stents of various length (9,  16, and 32  mm) were implanted in 64  lesions in 41  patients. Twenty lesions (31 %) were longer than 15  mm, and 17  lesions (27 %) were located in vessels with a diameter smaller than 2. 5  mm. Extreme tortuosity of the proximal vessel was present in 15  lesions (23 %). All patients were treated with aspirin and ticlopidine. All lesions were evaluated before and after treatment by quantitative angiography, and in 47  lesions (75 %) the stent expansion was also controlled by intracoronary ultrasound. Clinical follow up was available in all patients and angiographic follow up was performed in 53  lesions (84 %), at a mean (SD) interval of 5. 4  (1. 7) months.  Results—Deployment of the stent failed in two lesions (3 %). Minimum lumen diameter increased from 1. 01  (0. 54)  mm to 2. 94  (0. 49)  mm, and diameter stenosis decreased from 66 (15) % to 7 (11) %. There was one in-hospital non-Q wave myocardial infarction, one sudden death after 40  days, and 17  target lesion revascularisations (27 %). Angiographic restenosis (⩾  50 % diameter stenosis) was documented in 19  lesions (36 % of all lesions with angiographic follow up), with an average residual diameter stenosis of 43 (21) % and minimum lumen diameter of 1. 63  (0. 74)  mm. Restenosis was more common in vessels with a reference diameter <  2. 5  mm (45 %) and for lesions longer than 15  mm (46 %).  Conclusions—The NIR stent could be used successfully in most lesions, achieving optimal angiographic results with very few in-hospital or subacute cardiac events. The angiographic restenosis rate and need for target lesion revascularisation remained high in this unfavourable lesion subset, especially in small vessels and long lesions.    Keywords: coronary stenting;  quantitative angiography;  intravascular ultrasound;  restenosi...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the feasibility, safety and efficacy of elective and urgent deployment of the new intravascular rigid-flex (NIR) stent in patients with coronary artery disease. Background. Stent implantation has been shown to be effective in the treatment of focal, new coronary stenoses and in restoring coronary flow after coronary dissection and abrupt vessel closure. However, currently available stents either lack flexibility, hindering navigation through tortuous arteries, or lack axial strength, resulting in suboptimal scaffolding of the vessel. The unique transforming multicellular design of the NIR stent appears to provide both <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility</b> and radial strength. Methods. NIR stent implantation was attempted in 255 patients (341 lesions) enrolled prospectively in a multicenter international registry from December 1995 through March 1996. Nine-, 16 - and 32 -mm long NIR stents were manually crimped onto coronary balloons and deployed in native coronary (94 %) and saphenous vein graft (6 %) lesions. Seventy-four percent of patients underwent elective stenting for primary or restenotic lesions, 21 % for a suboptimal angioplasty result and 5 % for threatened or abrupt vessel closure. Fifty-two percent of patients presented with unstable angina, 48 % had a previous myocardial infarction, and 45 % had multivessel disease. Coronary lesions were frequently complex, occurring in relatively small arteries (mean [±SD] reference diameter 2. 8 ± 0. 6 mm). Patients were followed up for 6 months for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events. Results. Stent deployment was accomplished in 98 % of lesions. Mean minimal lumen diameter increased by 1. 51 ± 0. 51 mm (from 1. 09 ± 0. 43 mm before to 2. 60 ± 0. 50 mm after the procedure). Mean percent diameter stenosis decreased from 61 ± 13 % before to 17 ± 7 % after intervention. A successful interventional procedure with < 50 % diameter stenosis of all treatment site lesions and no major adverse cardiac events within 30 days occurred in 95 % of patients. Event-free survival at 6 months was 82 %. Ninety-four percent of surviving patients were either asymptomatic or had mild stable angina at 6 month follow-up. Conclusions. Despite unfavorable clinical and angiographic characteristics of the majority of patients enrolled, the acute angiographic results and early clinical outcome after NIR stent deployment were very promising. A prospective, randomized trial comparing the NIR stent with other currently available stents appears warranted...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. This study {{evaluated}} the delivery characteristics and vascular response to placement {{of a novel}} balloon-expandable stent in swine with experimentally induced atherosclerosis. Background. The Multi-Link stent is a balloon-expandable stainless steel stent with an interconnected ring structure {{designed to provide a}} high degree of compressive resistance while preserving <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility.</b> The placement characteristics and vascular response to this stent in atherosclerotic coronary arteries have not been characterized. Methods. We tested the delivery characteristics and vascular response to the Multi-Link stent in 19 miniature swine with experimentally induced coronary atherosclerosis created in 37 coronary artery segments by overstretch balloon injury and high cholesterol diet. Quantitative coronary angiography was used to define stent performance characteristics, such as lesion dilation and compressive resistance. Pathologic assessment of the stented arteries was used to evaluate the immediate and long-term vascular response to stent placement. Results. Nineteen (95 %) of 20 stents were successfully implanted in the left anterior descending (n = 11), left circumflex (n = 7) or right (n = 1) coronary artery. The baseline angiographic minimal lumen diameter of the stented coronary segment was 2. 48 ± 0. 09 mm (reference diameter 2. 87 ± 0. 06 mm, mean ± SE) and increased to 2. 82 ± 0. 05 mm (p < 0. 001) after stent placement. The ballooninflated stent diameter was 2. 98 ± 0. 06 mm with minimal recoil to a final minimal lumen diameter of 2. 82 ± 0. 06 mm at 15 min after implantation (p = 0. 001). Angiographic and histologic follow-up at 72 h (n = 7), 14 days (n = 4) and 56 days (n = 8) demonstrated that all stents were patent, without evidence of migration, intraluminal filling defects or side branch occlusion. At 56 days, mean neointimal thickness was significantly greater at the stent wire sites in the region of the plaque where the media was absent than the stent wire sites, where the internal elastic lamina was intact with underlying normal media (0. 48 ± 0. 01 vs. 0. 27 ± 0. 02 mm, p < 0. 0001). Compared with the nonstented atherosclerotic lesions, after 56 days the stented vessels had a mildly reduced lumen area when normalized to the proximal reference vessel (2. 81 ± 0. 27 vs. 2. 68 ± 0. 30 mm 2, p = 0. 07). The mean change in the area within the external elastic lamina relative to a normal proximal reference segment was significantly greater in stented vessels (1. 45 ± 0. 34 mm 2) than nonstented atherosclerotic vessels (0. 44 ± 0. 28 mm 2, p = 0. 033). Conclusions. Morphologic data confirm that the principal beneficial effect of stent placement is vessel expansion and attenuation of constrictive remodeling. In vessels with eccentric atherosclerotic fibrocellular plaques, the presence of normal media underlying the stent determines the degree of neointimal formation. These data may be useful in understanding the mechanism of stent restenosis in patients with prior percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty...|$|E
40|$|Stents are {{rigid and}} {{perforated}} tubular structures, which are inserted into {{blood vessels in}} order to prevent or inhibit the constriction of blood flow, restoring the normal blood flow, when blood vessels are clogged, being used in 70 % of angioplasties. These medical devices assume great importance in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) which are {{the leading cause of death}} worldwide. In the European Union CVD account for 40 % of deaths and assume an estimated annual cost of 196 billion euros[1]. Stents must possess certain requirements, in order to, adequately, perform its function, such as biocompatibility (so that its use does not c ause damage on the health of its user), mechanical strength, radiopacity (so that it is easy to view), <b>longitudinal</b> <b>flexibility,</b> ease of handling, corrosion resistance and having high strength and high radial expansion ability to recover. Stents can be made of different materials, but metals, particularly stainless steel, are the most common. However, metallic stents present several dRawbacks such as corrosion and restenosis, leading to health complications for the patient, or even death. In order to minimize these disadvantages, new materials, like fibrous materials, have been used [2]. Monofilaments present high potential for stents development because, in addition to its biocompatibility, these materials allow the application of various surface treatments, such as antibacterial coatings. Furthermore, monofilament exhibit excellent mechanical properties, like greater stiffness and good results when subjected to compression, tensile and bending forces, since these forces will be directly supported by the monofilament [3]. To minimize the reaction of the human body and Limit the adhesion of microorganisms to the stent surface, some coatings have been developed, including the use of novel metals with antimicrobial properties, like silver. The main objective of this study was the development of fibrous stents, incorporation of silver oxide nanocoating. For the development of the stent, polyester monofilaments with 0. 27 mm of diameter were used in braiding technology, with a mandrel diameter of 6 mm and a braiding angle of 35 ⁰. The mechanical behaviour of the stent were evaluated by mechanical testing under longitudinal and radial compression, bending. The results of compressive strength tests are according with value from literature: 1. 13 to 2. 9 N for radial compression and 0. 16 - 5. 28 N to longitudinal compression. From literature is also possible to verify that stents must present 75 % of unchanged diameter during the bending test and must possess a porosity between 70 % and 80 % [4]. The produced polyester stent presents values of 1. 29 N for radial compression, 0. 23 N for longitudinal compression, 80 % of porosity and 85. 5 % of unchanged diameter, during bending tests. For the antibacterial functionalization, silver oxide nanocoatings were prepared, through reactive magnetron g, with an Ag target in an Ar +O 2 atmosphere. In order to evaluate the nanostructure and morphology of the coatings, d ifferent technique s like X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and and X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS were used. From the analyses of XRD it is possible to verify that the peaks corresponds to planes of Ag 2 O and MATERIAIS 2015 Porto, 21 - 23 June, 2015 characterize a cubic phase. The presence of Ag 2 O is corroborated by XPS spectrum, where it is possible to observe silver, not only, in oxide state, but a lso in mettalic state, and it is possible to verify the presence of silver clusters, confirmed by SEM analysis. Films’ roughness and topography, parameters influencing the wettability of the surface and microorganism adhesion, were measured by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and it was observed that the roughness is very low (under 10 nm). Coatings’ hydrophobicity and surface tension parameters were determined by contact angle measurement, and it was verified the hydrophobic behavior of the coatings. For antibacterial tests were used Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (IE 186) and Staphylococcus aureus(ATCC 6538), and halo inhibition zone tests were realized. Ag+release rates were studied by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP -MS). The obtained results suggest that silver oxide coatings do not modify significantly surface properties of the substrate, like hydrophobicity and roughness, and present antimicrobial properties for both bacteria used...|$|E
