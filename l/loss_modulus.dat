However, these materials present important differences in their behavior in cyclic testing. For instance, the significant <b>loss</b> of <b>modulus</b> the bitumen exhibits at {{early stages of the}} test or its total recovery when loading is removed.; Comparison between two types of cyclic testing applied to bitumens, time and strain sweep tests has proven that this phenomenon is related with the nonlinear behavior of the bitumen, thixotropy and viscoelasticity, and that the amount of <b>modulus</b> <b>loss</b> during the initial part of cyclic testing {{is directly related to the}} strain applied.; Using the framework of the work potential theory, a new expression has been found for the damage law that describes the <b>loss</b> of <b>modulus</b> of bitumens during the linear phase of the fatigue tests. Additionally, a procedure is proposed to estimate the fatigue relation between the strain applied and the number of cycles to failure using only the data obtained in strain sweep tests. These relations fit reasonably well the experimental data obtained in more time consuming time sweep tests.; Applying this estimation procedure implies a great time savings in the characterization of the fatigue behavior of asphalt binders and the determination of their fatigue laws.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-four patients with liver tumours > 1  cm prospectively underwent MR elastography using 50 -Hz mechanical waves and a full three-directional motion-sensitive sequence. The model-free viscoelastic parameters (the complex shear modulus and its real and imaginary parts, i. e. the storage and loss moduli) were calculated in 72 lesions after exclusion of cystic, treated or histopathologically undetermined tumours. RESULTS: We observed higher absolute shear modulus and <b>loss</b> <b>modulus</b> in malignant versus benign tumours (3. 38 [*]±[*] 0. 26 versus 2. 41 [*]±[*] 0. 15 kPa, P[*]<[*] 0. 01 and 2. 25 [*]±[*] 0. 26 versus 1. 05 [*]±[*] 0. 13 kPa, P[*]<[*] 0. 001, respectively). Moreover, the <b>loss</b> <b>modulus</b> of hepatocellular carcinomas was significantly higher than in benign hepatocellular tumours. The storage modulus did not differ significantly between malignant and benign tumours. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of <b>loss</b> <b>modulus</b> was significantly larger than that of the absolute shear modulus and storage modulus when comparing malignant and benign lesions.

40|$|During sewing at high speed, {{the needle}} thread is {{subjected}} to repeated tensile stresses, heat, bending, pressure, torsion and wearing. These stresses act on the thread repeatedly and the thread passes 50 - 80 times through the fabric, the needle eye and the bobbin case mechanism, before getting incorporated into the seam. As a result both the sewing thread and the yarns in the fabric get abraded / severed during the seaming process.

This study may represent a worst-case "incising effects" scenario: although the incising patterns and depths selected for study represent commonly used industrial practices, the incising process itself was performed on dry lumber, which is not the standard practice of the treating industry. As we had expected on the basis of Canadian results, incising affected bending properties, such as modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, and work to maximum load. Our results show that the combined incising-preservative effect on mean property values for lumber incised in the dry condition prior to treatment was in the range of a 0 to 10 % <b>loss</b> in <b>modulus</b> of elasticity, 15 % to 25 % <b>loss</b> in <b>modulus</b> of rupture, and 30 % to 50 % loss in work to maximum load.

While these results specifically apply to only MSR-graded standard 38 -mm- (nominal 2 -inch-) thick lumber and to lumber incised in the dry condition prior to treatment, they do imply that the new U.
