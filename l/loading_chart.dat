For the floating platform the maximum snap-load occurs for a wider range between 9 and 11 seconds.

When delays in the packet arrival over the network takes place that information instead of slowly flowing to all the nodes can be transferred to the centralized node at once when autonomous system is established and this can be then further transferred to the nodes without delay that need to send their packets using that path.

Thermal properties of construction materials {{are the least}} factors considered during material selection process since strength, economy, and aesthetics are more sought after. Also, with the rising rate of global warming, more solar radiation would reach building surfaces, leading to increased energy requirements for cooling, especially in the tropical regions.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the telehandler is also its biggest limitation: as the boom extends or raises while bearing a load, it acts as a lever and causes the vehicle to become increasingly unstable, despite counterweights in the rear. This means that the lifting capacity quickly decreases as the working radius (distance between {{the front of the}} wheels and the centre of the load) increases. When used as a loader the single boom (rather than twin arms) is very highly loaded and even with careful design is a weakness. A vehicle with a 5,000 lb (2.2ton) capacity with the boom retracted may be able to safely lift as little as 400 lb (225 kg) with it fully extended at a low boom angle. The same machine with a 5,000 lb lift capacity with the boom retracted may be able to support as much as 10,000 lb (5ton) with the boom raised to 70°. The operator is equipped with a <b>load</b> <b>chart</b> which helps him determine whether a given task is possible, taking into account weight, boom angle and height. Failing this, most telehandlers now utilize a computer which uses sensors to monitor the vehicle, and will warn the operator and/or cut off further control input if the limits of the vehicle are exceeded, the latter being a legal requirement in Europe controlled by EN15000. Machines can also be equipped with front stabilizers which extend the lifting capability of the equipment while stationary, as well machines with are fully stabilised with rotary joint between upper and lower frames, which can be called mobile cranes although they can typically still use a bucket, and are also often referred to as 'Roto' machines. They are a hybrid between a Telehandler and small crane.|$|R

40|$|In this Master's thesis the sea lift {{operation}} from {{a supply}} vessel onto a oil platform has been evaluated. Two {{models have been}} built and analysed with different input parameters, as well {{as compared with the}} current <b>load</b> <b>charts</b> based on the calculation procedure found in the standard EN 13852 - 1. The most critical part of the sea lift operation with regards to the structural safety of the crane is the lift-off from the supply vessel deck. The snap-load in the lift wire will depend on the motions of the lifted object, which is following the supply vessel deck motions. For floating platforms the motions of the crane tip must be accounted, and hence the coupled system of the supply vessel and the platform must be evaluated to estimate the extremal snap-loads in the lifting wire. The two simulation models have been developed in the simulation program SIMA, which is a state of the art simulation program developed especially for simulation of marine operations. The first model is built to represent a fixed platform, and is hence a general model representing bottom-supported and jack-up platforms. The second model is modelled as a semi-submersible platform, representing the Kristin platform located at Haltenbanken in the North-Sea. The wave statistics for Haltenbanken have been analysed to find the most common significant wave heights, spectral peak periods and wave headings for the area over time. The extremal snap-loads are found by fitting a Gumbel distribution to the respective simulation results sample. It is found that the probability level of exceedance for the dynamic factors given by EN- 13852 are deviating between the models. For the different significant wave heights for the fixed platform, the EN 13852 - 1 represents a probability of exceedance of 0. 999 when the container is placed in the stern end of the supply vessel deck. For the floating platform the same probability of exceedance are roughly 10 % below the standard, and is hence much more conservative.|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{project has}} been carried out at the AkzoNobel International Paint factory in Angered, Sweden. The purpose of this thesis has been to {{increase}} the capacity at the factory’s P 3 pan charging department and to improve the weekly charging schedule by calculating ideal lead times for the most frequently produced products. Due to the large product range (around 130 different products), product lead times were not measured from start to end. Instead all possible work tasks used to manufacture the different products were identified in order to set a standard time for each work task. The work tasks were then combined into a sequence using the unique work order for each product. The work tasks and their sequences were created in the software AviX, which summarized the standard times for all work tasks into complete lead times for each product. Each work task’s standard time was established either by direct time study measurements, usage of the SAM predetermined time system in AviX or a combination of the two. Most of the data collection for the work tasks was done using a video camera. In total 70 product lead times were created in AviX, which historically covers 93. 4 percent of the production in the P 3 pan charging department. Each lead time was visualized by a so-called scheduling bar divided into different colors, which represented different types of times, such as machine times and time for manual work. These scheduling bars were then used in a new <b>load</b> <b>chart</b> scheduling system created in Microsoft Visio. The result indicates that using this scheduling system could on average give an increased capacity of more than 120 percent. The capacity increase can be used to assure that the weekly volume demand is always met. It will also free up time to work with continuous improvements and 5 S as well as time for training of the charging personnel...|$|R

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} is to develop a design methodology which correlates main structural design parameters, whose production is characterised by high levels of standardization, such as the height of gutter or the distance between frames, with actions on the greenhouse. The methodology, based on the use of charts and abacus, permits a clear and a direct interpretation of the structural response to design load combinations and allows the design of structural improvements with the aim of the optimization of the ratio benefits (structural strength) /costs. The study of structural interaction domains allowed a clear and a direct interpretation of the structural response to design load combinations. The diagrams highlight not only if the structure fulfils the standard requirements but also the safety levels with respect to design load combinations and allow the structural designer how to operate in order to optimize the structural response with standard requirements achieving the best ratio benefits (structural safety) / costs. The methodology was developed basing on criteria assigned by EN 13031 on two different kinds of greenhouse structures: an arched greenhouse with a film plastic covering and a duo pitched roof greenhouse cover with rigid plastic membranes. Structural interaction domains for arched greenhouse showed a better capability of the structure to resist to vertical loads then to horizontal one. Moreover, the climatic load distribution on the structure assigned by EN 13031 is such that the combination of climatic actions is less dangerous for the structure then their individual application. Whilst, duo pitched roof steel greenhouse interaction domains, showed a better capability of the structure to resist to vertical loads then to horizontal one and that, in any case, the serviceability limit states analysis is more strict then the ULS one. The shape of structural domains highlighted that the combination of actions is more dangerous for the structure then the application of single <b>loads.</b> <b>Charts</b> and abacus very easy to interpret and can be used also by non technicians in order to arrange a quick and reliable estimate of the costs of the structure. For instance, it is sufficient to know characteristic values of snow loads and wind speed to evaluate what is the distance of frame of the arched greenhouse to fulfil EN 13031 requirements...|$|R
