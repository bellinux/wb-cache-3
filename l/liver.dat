5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute <b>liver</b> failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from <b>liver</b> failure, the mainstay of management is <b>liver</b> transplantation. <b>Liver</b> transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for <b>liver</b> transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of <b>liver</b> support have been used including partial <b>liver</b> transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own <b>liver</b> regenerates. Once <b>liver</b> function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and <b>liver</b> metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted <b>liver</b> cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific <b>liver</b> tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire <b>liver,</b> but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|After a {{potential}} dormant {{period in the}} <b>liver,</b> these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle. The parasite escapes from the <b>liver</b> undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host <b>liver</b> cell.|$|E
40|$|The {{extractable}} and nonextractable collagen and glycosaminoglycuronans (GAG) {{were estimated}} and characterized in 32 dried, defatted human <b>livers</b> obtained at necropsy. 10 had normal <b>livers.</b> 22 of the 32 <b>livers</b> were from patients who drank in excess: 5 had fatty <b>livers,</b> 7 had alcholic hepatitis, and 10 had cirrhosis. <b>Livers</b> with alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis had significantly increased total and 1 N NaCl-extractable collagen. Only alcoholic hepatitis <b>livers</b> had significantly increased Tris-buffer-extractable GAG, but the amino acid composition of these GAG (proteoglycans) {{was no different}} from that of normal <b>livers.</b> The major fraction of these GAG had isoelectric pH (pI) ≤ 3. 1 in all <b>livers.</b> <b>Livers</b> with alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis had significantly increased nonextractable GAG.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} metabolisms of [14 C] 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(a) {{anthracene}} (DMBA) by post-mitochondrial supernates and microsomes from intact and regenerating rat <b>livers</b> were compared. Both cell fractions from regenerating <b>livers</b> at 48, 72, and 96 h after partial hepatectomy metabolized less [14 C]DMBA than similar fractions from intact <b>livers.</b> Prior in vivo treatment with DMBA enhanced metabolism by the cell fractions from both groups, but specific activities of cell fractions from regenerating <b>livers</b> were always about 60 % {{or less of}} those from intact <b>livers.</b> Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of metabolites formed in incubations using either cell fraction failed to reveal distinct differences between ether-soluble or water-soluble products of similar fractions from intact and regenerating <b>livers.</b> However, highly reproducible {{differences were found between}} chromatograms of water-soluble metabolites formed by microsomes and post-mitochondrial supernates in both intact and regenerating <b>livers.</b> Extrapolations from these studies indicate large differences in the metabolic capacity of intact and regenerating <b>livers</b> when expressed on a whole-liver basis, but it is suggested that there may be additional factors contributing to the increased retention of DMBA by regenerating <b>livers...</b>|$|R
5|$|Certain {{parasitic}} <b>liver</b> diseases may be {{risk factors}} as well. Colonization with the <b>liver</b> flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) {{has been associated}} with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic <b>liver</b> disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic <b>liver</b> disease, or cirrhosis of the <b>liver</b> due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis C infection) were responsible for the association.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma {{can affect}} any {{area of the}} bile ducts, either within or outside the <b>liver.</b> Tumors {{occurring}} in the bile ducts within the <b>liver</b> {{are referred to as}} intrahepatic, those occurring in the ducts outside the <b>liver</b> are extrahepatic, and tumors occurring at the site where the bile ducts exit the <b>liver</b> may be referred to as perihilar.

40|$|Background: Lack {{of oxygen}} and biomechanical {{stimulation}} during static cold storage (SCS) of donor <b>livers</b> compromises endothelial cell function. We investigated {{the effect of}} end-ischemic oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) on endothelial cell function of extended criteria donor (ECD) <b>livers.</b> Methods: Eighteen <b>livers,</b> declined for transplantation, were transported to our center using static cold storage (SCS). After SCS, 6 <b>livers</b> underwent two hours of HMP, and subsequent normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) to assess viability. Twelve control <b>livers</b> underwent NMP immediately after SCS. mRNA expression of transcription factor Kruppel-like-factor 2 (KLF 2), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and thrombomodulin (TM) was quantified by RT-PCR. Endothelial cell function and injury were assessed by nitric oxide (NO) production and release of TM into the perfusate. Results: In HMP <b>livers,</b> mRNA expression of KLF 2 (p = 0. 043), eNOS (p = 0. 028), and TM (p = 0. 028) increased significantly during NMP. In parallel, NO levels increased during NMP in HMP <b>livers</b> but not in controls. At the end of NMP cumulative TM release was significantly lower HMP <b>livers,</b> compared to controls (p = 0. 028). Conclusion: A short period of two hours oxygenated HMP restores endothelial cell viability after SCS and subsequent normothermic reoxygenation of ECD <b>livers...</b>|$|R
5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the <b>liver.</b> During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the <b>liver</b> in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to <b>liver</b> disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as <b>liver</b> failure, <b>liver</b> cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E
5|$|In a small {{proportion}} of cases, the encephalopathy is caused directly by <b>liver</b> failure; this is more likely in acute <b>liver</b> failure. More commonly, especially in chronic <b>liver</b> disease, hepatic encephalopathy is triggered by an additional cause, and identifying these triggers can be important to treat the episode effectively.|$|E
5|$|In acute <b>liver</b> failure, the {{development}} of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost {{as important as the}} nature of the underlying cause of the <b>liver</b> failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering <b>liver</b> transplantation, such as King's College Criteria, are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria. The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in people with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for a <b>liver</b> transplant.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Commercially {{processed}} broiler {{and turkey}} giblets (hearts, <b>livers,</b> and gizzards) were separated into four lots: unfrozen, or frozen for 4, 8, or 12 weeks at — 10 C, then thawed. Thawing was accomplished at 2 C for 64 hr, and {{the volume of}} fluid released due to freeze-thawing was mea-sured and analyzed for moisture and solids. All giblets were analyzed for percent moisture {{and the release of}} moisture and fat due to heating. Moisture content of the giblets was significantly related to species and whether giblets were unfrozen or frozen-thawed. Hearts showed the greatest loss in moisture due to freeze-thawing and also released more moisture and fat when heated than gizzards or <b>livers.</b> Frozen-thawed <b>livers</b> released significantly less moisture when heated than unfrozen <b>livers.</b> <b>Livers</b> lost practically no fat when heated. Frozen-thawed <b>livers</b> released significantly more fluid than did hearts, and hearts released more fluid than did gizzards. The fluid released from <b>livers</b> con-tained significandy more solids and less moisture than the fluid from hearts or gizzards.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo obtain {{information}} about the basic biliary anatomy of <b>livers</b> with right-sided ligamentum teres (RSLT). Summary of background dataRSLT is a relatively rare anomaly with a reported incidence of 0. 2 – 1. 2 %. Although the portal/hepatic venous and arterial anatomy of <b>livers</b> with RSLT has already been established, the biliary architecture of such <b>livers</b> remains unclear. MethodsRSLT was detected in 48 patients during 12, 071 consecutive image readings (0. 4 %). Of these patients, the cholangiograms of 46 patients were analyzed, and their intrahepatic biliary tree confluence patterns were classified. ResultsThe following four unique biliary confluence patterns were identified in <b>livers</b> with RSLT: the symmetrical type (23 / 46), independent right lateral type (13 / 46), total left type (6 / 46), and total right type (1 / 46). Analyses of the portal and arterial branching patterns of these <b>livers</b> showed {{that there were no}} correlations between their biliary confluence patterns and their portal or arterial ramification patterns. ConclusionThe basic biliary architecture of <b>livers</b> with RSLT was clarified. As the RSLT patients' anomalous biliary confluences differed from those seen in normal <b>livers</b> and were difficult to predict, preoperative cholangiography should be performed prior to complex hepatobiliary surgery involving <b>livers</b> with RSLT to ensure patient safety...|$|R

5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} hepatic encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future. Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of <b>liver</b> failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the <b>liver),</b> the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the <b>liver),</b> the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the <b>liver).</b> Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer <b>liver</b> transplantation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Liver</b> AVMs may be {{suspected}} {{because of}} abnormal <b>liver</b> function {{tests in the}} blood, because the symptoms of heart failure develop, or because of jaundice or other symptoms of <b>liver</b> dysfunction. The most reliable initial screening test is Doppler ultrasonography of the liver; this has a very high sensitivity for identifying vascular lesions in the <b>liver.</b> If necessary, contrast-enhanced CT {{may be used to}} further characterize AVMs. It is extremely common to find incidental nodules on <b>liver</b> scans, most commonly due to focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), as these are a hundredfold times more common in HHT compared to the general population. FNH is regarded as harmless. Generally, tumor markers and additional imaging modalities are used to differentiate between FNH and malignant tumors of the <b>liver.</b> <b>Liver</b> biopsy is discouraged in people with HHT as the risk of hemorrhage from <b>liver</b> AVMs may be significant. <b>Liver</b> scans may be useful if someone is suspected of HHT, but does not meet the criteria (see below) unless <b>liver</b> lesions can be demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Liver</b> {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. <b>Liver</b> cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the <b>liver</b> cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the <b>liver</b> cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} and spectrum of chromosomal aberrations, acrocentric chromosome associations among 264 long <b>livers</b> with arterial hypertension and osteoarthritis {{residing in the}} Carpathian region were analyzed. The obtained results were compared between patients with arterial hypertension and osteoarthritis, patients with arterial hypertension only, patients with osteoarthritis only and healthy individuals. The indices of the average frequency of chromosomal aberrations in all long <b>livers</b> was as follows: (2. 82 ± 0. 27) in long <b>livers</b> with arterial hypertension and osteoarthritis and (2. 17 ± 0. 47) in healthy individuals. In long <b>livers</b> with arterial hypertension and those with osteoarthritis, the frequency of chromosomal aberrations was 1. 38 times higher compared to the control group (healthy long <b>livers).</b> The frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in long <b>livers</b> with arterial hypertension and those with osteoarthritis was (2. 93 ± 0. 09) and (2. 64 ± 0. 37), respectively. At the same time, there was observed the individual variability in chromosomal aberration frequency from 0. 2 to 5 %. In the spectrum of chromosomal aberrations, unstable chromosomal aberrations (dicentrics, rings, fragments) predominated in all long <b>livers.</b> When studying the index of acrocentric chromosome associations there was revealed that {{the difference in the}} indices between studied groups was identical to that when studying the frequency of chromosomal aberrations. In long <b>livers</b> with arterial hypertension and osteoarthritis, the index of the average number of acrocentric chromosome associations per cell was 1. 07 times higher than that in long <b>livers</b> with arterial hypertension only, 1. 32 times higher compared to that in long <b>livers</b> with osteoarthritis only and 1. 75 times higher compared to healthy individuals (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{can only be}} made in the presence of confirmed <b>liver</b> disease (types A and C) or a portosystemic shunt (type B), as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other encephalopathies. To make the distinction, abnormal <b>liver</b> function tests and/or ultrasound suggesting <b>liver</b> disease are required, and ideally <b>liver</b> biopsy. The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy may also arise from other conditions, such as cerebral haemorrhage and seizures (both of which are more common in chronic <b>liver</b> disease). A CT scan of the brain may be required to exclude haemorrhage, and if seizure activity is suspected an electroencephalograph (EEG) study may be performed. Rarer mimics of encephalopathy are meningitis, encephalitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy and Wilson's disease; these may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed with investigations.|$|E

40|$|Few recent {{outbreaks}} in Europe and the US involving Campylobacter and Salmonella {{were linked}} to the consumption of chicken <b>livers.</b> Studies investigating Staphylococcus aureus in chicken <b>livers</b> and gizzards are very limited. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence of S. aureus and MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in retail chicken <b>livers</b> and gizzards in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In this study, 156 chicken <b>livers</b> and 39 chicken gizzards samples of two brands were collected. While one of the brands showed very low prevalence of 1 % (1 / 100) for S. aureus in chicken <b>livers</b> and gizzards, the second brand showed prevalence of 37 % (31 / 95). No MRSA was detected since none harbored the mecA or mecC gene. Eighty seven S. aureus isolates from <b>livers</b> and 28 from gizzards were screened for antimicrobial resistance to 16 antimicrobials and the possession of 18 toxin genes. Resistance to most of the antimicrobials screened including cefoxitin and oxacillin was higher in the chicken gizzards isolates. While the prevalence of enterotoxin genes seg and sei was higher in the gizzards isolates, the prevalence of hemolysin genes hla, hlb, and hld was higher in the <b>livers</b> ones. The lucocidin genes lukE-lukD was equally prevalent in chicken <b>livers</b> and gizzards isolates. Using spa typing, a subset of the recovered isolates showed that they are not known to be livestock associated and, hence, may be of a human origin. In conclusion, this study stresses the importance of thorough cooking of chicken <b>livers</b> and gizzards since it might contain multidrug resistant enterotoxigenic S. aureus. To our knowledge this is the first study to specifically investigate the prevalence of S. aureus in chicken <b>livers</b> and gizzards in the US...|$|R
40|$|The {{contents}} of adenine nucleotides {{as well as}} steady-state concentrations {{of a number of}} glycolytic, pentose phosphate-pathway and tricarboxylic acid-cycle intermediates were measured in extracts of <b>livers</b> from normal and phenobarbital-treated rats that were perfused with p-nitroanisole. Metabolites were measured in <b>livers</b> that were freeze-clamped during periods of maximal rates of drug metabolism. Treatment of rats with phenobarbital increased rates of p-nitroanisole O-demethylation approx. fivefold. The concentrations of lactate, xylulose 5 -phosphate and ribulose 5 -phosphate were increased by phenobarbital treatment, whereas that of fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate declined. Perfusion of <b>livers</b> with p-nitroanisole produced significant increases in 6 -phosphogluconate and ribulose 5 -phosphate in <b>livers</b> from phenobarbital-treated rats, but not in <b>livers</b> from control rats. Treatment of rats with phenobarbital caused [NADP+]/[NADPH] to change in the direction of more oxidation, as calculated from measured concentrations of 6 -phosphogluconate and ribulose 5 -phosphate; however, the [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio calculated from `malic' enzyme was not changed. Additions of p-nitroanisole produced a reduction of NADP+ as calculated from 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity, but did not alter the [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio calculated from substrates assumed to be in equilibrium with `malic' enzyme. Activities of both glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and `malic' enzyme were increased by phenobarbital treatment. NAD+ became more reduced as a result of phenobarbital treatment; however, perfusion of <b>livers</b> with p-nitroanisole did not cause a change in the oxidation–reduction state of this nucleotide. Concentrations of adenine nucleotides in <b>livers</b> were not altered significantly by treatment of rats with phenobarbital; however, a significant decline in the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio occurred during mixed-function oxidation of p-nitroanisole in <b>livers</b> from phenobarbital-treated rats, but not in <b>livers</b> from normal rats. Perfusion of <b>livers</b> with two other substrates for mixed-function oxidation, hexobarbital and aminopyrine, produced an increase in the [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio calculated from `malic' enzyme. In contrast with <b>livers</b> perfused with p-nitroanisole, there was no significant change in adenine nucleotides in <b>livers</b> exposed to hexobarbital or aminopyrine. Addition of 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (25 μm) to the perfusate containing aminopyrine decreased the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio and tended to prevent the oxidation of NADPH observed with aminopyrine alone. Thus in the presence of an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, NADPH generation may exceed its utilization via mixed-function oxidation...|$|R
