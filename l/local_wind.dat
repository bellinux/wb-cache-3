2500|$|Wind-generated {{power is}} a {{variable}} resource, {{and the amount of}} electricity produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds, air density, and turbine characteristics (among other factors).

40|$|The Gulf of Mexico Loop Current intruded {{upon the}} West Florida {{continental}} shelf in June 2000. In situ currents and hydrography along with satellite temperature and altimetry measurements {{are used to}} describe this event {{and its effects on}} the shelf. A strong southward current is observed to flow along the shelf slope seaward of the intruded water boundary. This current transported cold, nutrient-rich water from the north, thereby producing anomalous hydrographic features near the shelf break (80 -m isobath).
