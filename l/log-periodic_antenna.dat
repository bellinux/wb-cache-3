2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of antennas are linearly polarized. In fact it can be shown from considerations of symmetry that an antenna that lies entirely in a plane which also includes the observer, can only have its polarization {{in the direction of}} that plane. This applies to many cases, allowing one to easily infer such an antenna's polarization at an intended direction of propagation. So a typical rooftop Yagi or <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna</b> with horizontal conductors, as viewed from a second station toward the horizon, is necessarily horizontally polarized. But a vertical [...] "whip antenna" [...] or AM broadcast tower used as an antenna element (again, for observers horizontally displaced from it) will transmit in the vertical polarization. A turnstile antenna with its four arms in the horizontal plane, likewise transmits horizontally polarized radiation toward the horizon. However, when that same turnstile antenna is used in the [...] "axial mode" [...] (upwards, for the same horizontally-oriented structure) its radiation is circularly polarized. At intermediate elevations it is elliptically polarized.|$|E

Constant radiation characteristics over a decade bandwidth are required for some of wide band applications, for example, feeds for reflector antennas in radio telescope.

In the present paper, an analysis on condition for constant radiation characteristics over wide bandwidth for a <b>log-periodic</b> array <b>antenna</b> is presented.

50|$|Dual band antennas {{are not a}} new idea. For years many {{manufactures}} {{have combined}} multiple elements to create antennas that operate in two separate bands (do not get this confused with so-called frequency independent antennas such as a <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna).</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna</b> (LP), {{also known}} as a log-periodic array or log-periodic aerial, is a multi-element, directional, antenna {{designed}} to operate over a wide band of frequencies. It was invented by Dwight Isbell and Raymond DuHamel at the University of Illinois in 1958.|$|E

5000|$|It {{should be}} {{strictly}} {{noted that the}} log-periodic shape, according to the IEEE definition, does not provide with broadband property for antennas. The broadband property of <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antennas</b> comes from its self-complementarity. Y. Mushiake found, for what he termed [...] "the simplest self-complementary planar antenna," [...] a driving point impedance of η0/2=188.4 Ω at frequencies well within its bandwidth limits.|$|R
5000|$|The first fractal [...] "antennas" [...] were, in fact, fractal [...] "arrays", with fractal {{arrangements}} of antenna elements, and not recognized initially as having self-similarity as their attribute. <b>Log-periodic</b> <b>antennas</b> are arrays, {{around since the}} 1950s (invented by Isbell and DuHamel), that are such fractal arrays. They are a common form used in TV antennas, and are arrow-head in shape.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} form of <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna</b> is the log-periodic dipole array or LPDA, The LPDA {{consists}} of a number of half-wave dipole driven elements of gradually increasing length, each consisting of a pair of metal rods. The dipoles are mounted close together in a line, connected in parallel to the feedline with alternating phase. Electrically, it simulates a series of two or three-element Yagi antennas connected together, each set tuned to a different frequency.|$|E
50|$|For {{unambiguous}} results, the antennas {{should be}} spaced half a wavelength apart, or less. However, this {{can result in}} significant mutual coupling between elements, which means that each antenna's phase measurement will be corrupted by the other's. The approach assumes that the phase centres of the antennas are exactly known. With more complex antenna structures (such as the <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna)</b> the effects of mutual coupling can make the phase centre locations unknown. In this case, calibration or electromagnetic modeling may be required.|$|E

The dishes may exploit amplitude monopulse techniques for improved direction finding, whilst the angled spacing of the <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna</b> suggests that they may use phase interferometry to improve angle measurements. Various smaller antennas, presumably for inter-site communications are to the side and rear of the dish.|$|E

To obtain smaller antennas with {{nearly the same}} performance, square spiral Archimedean geometries are also widely used instead. In this study, novel square antennas are proposed, designed and examined. At first two similar but different approaches are employed to design new antennas by considering the design procedure used to obtain <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antennas.</b> Then, the performance of these antennas is improved by considering another property of <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antennas.</b> Simulations are performed by using two different numerical methods which are Finite Difference Time Domain Method (FDTD) and Method of Moments (MoM).

5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used shortwave antennas for international broadcasting are the HRS antenna (curtain array), which cover a 2 to 1 frequency range and the <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna</b> which cover up to 8 to 1 frequency range. Within that range, the SWR will vary, but is usually kept below 1.7 to 1 [...] - [...] {{within the range of}} SWR that can be tuned by antenna matching built-into many modern transmitters. Hence, when feeding these antennas, a modern transmitter will be able to tune itself as needed to match at any frequency.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to use multiple active elements and combine them together with transmission lines to produce a similar system where the phases add up to reinforce the output. The antenna array and very similar reflective array antenna consist of multiple elements, often half-wave dipoles, spaced out {{on a plane and}} wired together with transmission lines with specific phase lengths to produce a single in-phase signal at the output. The <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna</b> is a more complex design that uses multiple in-line elements similar in appearance to the Yagi-Uda but using transmission lines between the elements to produce the output.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna</b> is a modified, folded up, square self-complementary antenna with log-periodic shape, and the {{original}} structure before its modification has a typical self-complementary shape. The log-periodic shape does not provide the broadband property for antennas. This fact is experimentally proven. It is also evident from the IEEE definition of “Log-Periodic Antenna”. The [...] "Log-Periodic Dipole Array" [...] or [...] "Log-Periodic Dipole Antenna" [...] (LPDA), is a practically modified self-complementary antenna. LPDA has transposed excitation for the dipole array resulted from folding up [...] the antenna structure to obtain unidirectional radiation, that is inevitable outcome of the modification.|$|E

50|$|Although a {{resonant}} antenna has {{a purely}} resistive feed-point impedance {{at a particular}} frequency, many (if not most) applications require using an antenna over a range of frequencies. The frequency range or bandwidth over which an antenna functions well can be very wide (as in a <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna)</b> or narrow (in a resonant antenna); outside this range the antenna impedance becomes a poor match to the transmission line and transmitter (or receiver). Also {{in the case of}} the Yagi-Uda and other end-fire arrays, use of the antenna well away from its design frequency affects its radiation pattern, reducing its directive gain; the usable bandwidth is then limited regardless of impedance matching.|$|E
50|$|All {{practical}} antennas are {{at least}} somewhat directional, although usually only the direction in the plane parallel to the earth is considered, and practical antennas can easily be omnidirectional in one plane. The most common types are the Yagi antenna, the <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna,</b> and the corner reflector antenna, which are frequently combined and commercially sold as residential TV antennas. Cellular repeaters often make use of external directional antennas to give a far greater signal than can be obtained on a standard cell phone. Satellite Television receivers usually use parabolic antennas. For long and medium wavelength frequencies, tower arrays are used in most cases as directional antennas.|$|E

5000|$|An antenna {{may have}} more than one driven element, {{although}} the most common multielement antenna, the Yagi, usually has only one. For example, transmitting antennas for AM radio stations often consist of several mast radiators, each of which functions as a half-wave monopole driven element, to create a particular radiation pattern. A two-element array with the elements spaced a quarter wavelength apart has a distinct cardioid radiation pattern when the second element is driven with a source -90° out of phase relative to the first element. A <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antenna</b> (LPDA) consists of many dipole elements of decreasing length, all of which are driven. However because they are different lengths, only one of the many dipoles is resonant at a given frequency, so only one is driven at a time. The dipole that is driven depends on the frequency of the signal. Phased arrays may have hundreds of driven elements. Household multiband television antennas generally consist of a hybrid between a UHF Yagi with one driven dipole and a log-periodic for VHF behind that with alternating active elements. The driven elements between the UHF and VHF are then coupled and often matched for a 75 ohm coaxial downlead to the receiver.|$|E

50|$|Antennas for use {{over much}} broader {{frequency}} ranges are achieved using further techniques. Adjustment of a matching network can, in principle, allow for any antenna to be matched at any frequency. Thus the loop antenna built into most AM broadcast (medium wave) receivers {{has a very}} narrow bandwidth, but is tuned using a parallel capacitance which is adjusted according to the receiver tuning. On the other hand, <b>log-periodic</b> <b>antennas</b> are not resonant at any frequency but can be built to attain similar characteristics (including feedpoint impedance) over any frequency range. These are therefore commonly used (in the form of directional log-periodic dipole arrays) as television antennas.|$|R
