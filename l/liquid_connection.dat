Mixing of deep fluids (from more than 50  km depths) with meteoritic waters has been {{evidenced}} in hot spring. Evidence for fluid and fluid interactions with rocks may be inferred from geophysical properties such as seismic velocities and electrical conductivity, and from petrophysical modeling based on experimental data. At depths near ~ 20 – 40  km, non-volcanic tremors (Obara 2002) and other slow events occur near or above the plate interface (Dragert, et al. 2001; Rogers and Dragert 2003; Shelly, et al. 2006). These are associated with portions of the oceanic crust whose seismic properties suggest fluid overpressure (Audet, et al. 2009; Audet and Schwartz 2013). Deeper (> 30 {{and down to}} 60 – 90  km depths), the plate interface is decoupled and seismically silent (Wada, et al. 2008), and diffuse seismicity in the oceanic crust is linked to eclogitization reactions (Hacker, et al. 2003; Kita, et al. 2006).

40|$|During the {{sequestration}} of CO 2 into down-hole rock formations, salt precipitation {{may occur}} {{due to the}} drying of the formation brine if the injected CO 2 is dry. This can negatively affect the performance of injection wells and can even lead to well clogging, which is a serious risk for such operations. Further, the salt deposition can alter {{the flow of the}} CO 2 in the formation altering the storage capacity. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} explore the effect on CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) process of drying out and salt precipitation during CO 2 injection. This study is focused on CCS in fractured aquifers, which has received less attention than their un-fractured counterparts and particularly, the flow impairment associated with salt precipitation during the injection of dry CO 2. When CO 2 is injected into a conductive fracture network, the brine will rapidly be displaced from the fractures near the point of injection and the subsequent mass transfer between the matrix and the fracture; orthogonal to the flow direction in the fracture, is the major target of the project. The dry-out that occurs due to the evaporation of water from the brine filled region of the matrix into the under-saturated CO 2 filling the fracture can cause deposition of salt in the matrix or the fracture, locally reducing permeability. This thesis reports on an investigation of the evaporative drying kinetics and salt precipitation using a combination of gravimetric and X-ray µ-CT techniques to measure the water and brine saturation, salt precipitation and distribution of salt deposition in two rocks; a sandstone, Bentheimer and a carbonate, Ketton. Based on the experimental results for de-ionised water, two main regimes occur during the dry-out process: a capillarity driven regime which seems to be dominant for most of the dry-out process in the experiments, during which evaporation happens only at the surface of the fracture, followed by a diffusion limited regime after the liquid bridge to the surface breaks and pores near the surface become dry for the first time. In pure water, this results in an almost constant evaporation flux in the first regime followed by a mass loss that is linear when plotted against the square root of time. The experiments with brine were initially similar with an evaporative flux almost constant with time. However, a short time into the process the evaporative flux started to decrease approximately linearly with the square root of time, following the deposition of salt at the surface of the fracture. At the end of gravimetric dry-out tests, µ-CT images were obtained showing that salt was mainly precipitated at the surface of the sample; however, relatively small amount of salt was observed precipitated in the interior of the sample. The pore structure of the precipitated salt at the end of the dry-out tests maintained connectivity between the surface of the deposit and the rock matrix. Dynamic µ-CT imaging of Bentheimer during brine drying showed that during the early stage of evaporation, salt was continuously deposited at the surface of the matrix. During this stage in the evaporation of brine, advection dominates the transport of dissolved salt, indicated by a large Peclet number, and this resulted in an increased salt concentration very local to the site of evaporation. The ongoing formation of an efflorescence therefore, is evidence for the continuity of the liquid connections to the outside of the sample, despite the evaporation becoming linear against the square root of time. Unfortunately, the liquid bridges to the surface were too small to be seen directly in the µ-CT imaging. The volume of precipitated salt increased with time and this resulted in a change in the pore structure at the surface of the sample structure, consequently reducing the brine-drying rate. However, as the salt deposition and therefore the location of the evaporation continued to be at the exposed surface, vapour diffusion cannot account for the mass lost by evaporation becoming linear in the square root time as is usually stated. Some other mechanism must account for the observed behaviour and we speculate that the surface area for evaporation was reduced by the appearance of dry patched on the surface. At a very late stage of evaporation, it was observed that no further salt precipitated at the surface of the sample; and subsequently, salt precipitation progressed with time towards the interior of the sample core with small amount of salt. At this stage the <b>liquid</b> <b>connection</b> to the surface must finally have broken and a true diffusion controlled process occurred. In the limited sample size used in this study, this mechanism accounted for only a small fraction of the total salt deposited. From permeability measurements before and after the complete drying of the samples, it was demonstrated that the permeability of Bentheimer was reduced by 81...|$|E

40|$|Evaporation is an {{important}} process in water exchange between soil and atmosphere as well as applications in industry. Predictions of drying rates from porous media are very difficult due to its highly non-linear behavior with typically high and fairly constant drying rates in the beginning followed by a drop to low rates. The high drying rates at {{the first stage of}} drying are attributed to the presence of liquid patches retained in corners of the partially air filled pore space that are interconnected to form conductive pathways. Under increasingly dryer circumstances these <b>liquid</b> <b>connections</b> break leading to the diffusion dominated low drying rates of the second stage. The maximum extent of this corner flow region that determines the duration of the first stage is controlled by capillary forces opposed by gravity and viscous losses. To quantify these mechanisms, evaporation is studied from a single glass capillary with square cross section. Such geometry shows similar drying curve characteristics as macro-scale porous media with high rates as long as thick capillary sustained corner films extent between the receding meniscus and capillary surface. Increased flow resistance and gravity force as drying proceeds lead to film break-up at certain characteristic meniscus depth LC. LC was studied experimentally for drying of liquids ethanol and water from different capillary sizes under a range of evaporation rates and capillary inclination angles. This way the forces determining the extent of the corner films were changed systematically. Break-up of films as well as evolution of main meniscus depth were monitored to deduce LC and drying rates. For ethanol initial evaporation rates were in the order of 1000 mm/day and dropped abruptly when the corner films broke up. Increasing the evaporation rate led to a shortening of the films, whereas with decreasing gravity component the films became significantly longer. Maximum corner film extent for water was much shorter and mainly limited by corner geometry due to its high contact angle of 30 °. Model predictions on LC based on force balance and corner flow equations gave good results that were in accordance with the experimental data. The roundedness of the capillary corners had a large influence on maximum film length by limiting the curvature of the liquid interface at the capillary surface. This roundedness represents a critical pore size in real porous media that determines the maximum extent of the corner film region...|$|R

The analysis in numerical models of the inherent structure (IS) trajectories [...] the set of local minima visited by the liquid [...] offers the possibility of filtering out the vibrational component of {{the motion of the}} system on the potential energy surface and thereby resolving the slow structural component more efficiently. Here we report an analysis of an IS trajectory for a widely-studied water model, focusing on the changes in hydrogen bond connectivity that give rise to many IS separated by relatively small energy barriers. We find that while the system travels through these IS, the structure of the bond network continuously modifies, exchanging linear bonds for bifurcated bonds and usually reversing the exchange to return to nearly the same initial configuration. For the 216 molecule system we investigate, the time scale of these transitions is as small as the simulation time scale (≈ 1 fs). Hence for water, the transitions between each of these IS is relatively small and eventual relaxation of the system occurs only by many of these transitions. We find that during IS changes, the molecules with the greatest displacements move in small "clusters" of 1 - 10 molecules with displacements of ≈ 0. 02 - 0. 2 nm, not unlike simpler liquids. However, for water these clusters appear to be somewhat more branched than the linear "string-like" clusters formed in a supercooled Lennar d-Jones system found by Glotzer and her collaborators.
