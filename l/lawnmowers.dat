5|$|Some winter service vehicles, {{especially}} those {{designed for use}} on footpaths or pedestrian zones, are built on a far smaller chassis using small tractors or custom made vehicles. These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other equipment such as brushes, <b>lawnmowers</b> or cranes—as these operations are generally unable to run during heavy snowfalls, there is generally little overlap between the different uses, reducing {{the size of the}} fleet required by the agency or contractor.|$|E
5|$|Other {{factors of}} concern for the painted turtles include over-collection from the wild, {{released}} pets introducing diseases or reducing genetic variability, pollution, boating traffic, angler's hooks (the turtles are noteworthy bait-thieves), wanton shooting, and crushing by agricultural machines or golf course <b>lawnmowers</b> or all-terrain vehicles. Gervais and colleagues note that research itself impacts the populations and that much funded turtle trapping work has not been published. They advocate discriminating more on what studies are done, thereby putting fewer turtles into scientists' traps. Global warming represents an uncharacterized future threat.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{growth in}} the United States {{encouraged}} the suburbanization of American cities that required massive investments for the new infrastructure and homes. Consumer patterns were also shifting at this time, as purchasing power was becoming stronger and more accessible to {{a wider range of}} families.

During this time commercial shopping malls were being developed near suburbs to satisfy consumers' needs and their car–dependent lifestyle.|$|E

25|$|Muldoon {{initially}} opposed indirect consumer taxation on {{the basis}} that it would penalise poor people and increase inflation due to compensatory wage increases. However, in May 1979 he attempted to increase tax revenue by levying 10–20% taxes {{on a wide range of}} goods, including petrol, <b>lawnmowers,</b> caravans and boats. The taxes were criticised for being discriminatory, ineffective and a quick means of raising more revenue for the government without any accompanying fundamental reform of the taxation system – there were no income tax cuts to reflect the shift to indirect taxation. The immediate result of the boat and caravan levy, in particular, was the decimation of both industries as potential buyers could not afford to pay the 20% tax on top of the construction costs; the tax also had the additional effect of adding to the numbers of unemployed as boat and caravan builders could not pay their employees because of the order cancellations.|$|E
25|$|Plants vs. Zombies has {{received}} a positive reception from critics, garnering an aggregate score of 88/100 from Metacritic and an 89.5% from GameRankings. IGN editor Andy J Kolozsy commented that it featured a lot more content than other games in the genre, as well as praising its addictive nature. However, the DS version was criticised for its lower quality graphics and expensive price point. GameSpot editor Chris Watters praised {{the design of the}} plants and zombies, as well as the visuals and its overall value. However, he found fault in the learning curve. 1UP editor Alice Liang found the game enjoyable, commenting that the <b>lawnmowers</b> that protect {{the left side of the}} screen strikes a good balance between ease-of-use and in-depth game play. Edge's review praised PopCap Games for adding an imaginative touch to every little detail of the game. He also credited them for taking the tower defense genre and making it their own.|$|E

2500|$|The {{simplest}} form of {{spark ignition}} is that using a magneto. The engine spins a magnet inside a coil, or, {{in the earlier}} designs, a coil inside a fixed magnet, and also operates a contact breaker, interrupting the current and causing the voltage to be increased sufficiently to jump a small gap. The spark plugs are connected directly from the magneto output. Early magnetos had one coil, with the contact breaker (sparking plug) inside the combustion chamber. In about 1902, Bosch introduced a double-coil magneto, with a fixed sparking plug, and the contact breaker outside the cylinder. Magnetos are not used in modern cars, but because they generate their own electricity they are often found on small engines such as those found in mopeds, <b>lawnmowers,</b> snowblowers, chainsaws, etc. where a battery-based electrical system is not present for any combination of necessity, weight, cost, and reliability reasons. [...] They are also used on piston-engined aircraft engines. [...] Although an electrical supply is available, magneto systems are used mainly because of their higher reliability.|$|E
