25|$|Labial {{reduction}} can {{be performed}} under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> conscious sedation, or general anaesthesia, either as a discrete, single surgery, or in conjunction with another, gynecologic or cosmetic, surgery procedure. The resection proper is facilitated with the administration of an anaesthetic solution (lidocaine + epinephrine in saline solution) that is infiltrated to the labia minora to achieve the tumescence (swelling) of the tissues and the constriction of the pertinent labial circulatory system, the hemostasis that limits bleeding.|$|E

25|$|The paramedian {{forehead}} flap has two disadvantages, one operational and one aesthetic: Operationally, {{the reconstruction}} of a nose with a paramedian forehead flap is a two-stage surgical procedure, which might {{a problem for the}} patient whose health (surgical suitability) includes significant, secondary medical risks.

25|$|The patient being {{examined}} or treated is usually awake during catheterization, ideally with only <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> such as lidocaine and minimal general sedation, throughout the procedure. Performing the procedure {{with the patient}} awake is safer as the patient can immediately report any discomfort or problems and thereby facilitate rapid correction of any undesirable events. Medical monitors fail to give a comprehensive view of the patient's immediate well-being; how the patient feels is often a most reliable indicator of procedural safety.|$|E

40|$|Implication {{for health}} policy/practice/research/medical education: From {{this article we}} emphasise that {{internal}} urethrotomy under local urethral anasthesia and sedoanalgesia is safe and reliable. It prevents the possible complications of spinal anaesthesia and lets the patients more speedy recovery. Therefore we advice this method for selected patients. Background: Urethral stricture is a common condition, and direct vision internal ure-throtomy is prefered as the first treatment option by many urologists, for strictures shorter than 2 cm. This procedure is generally performed under general or spinal an-aesthesia. Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of adding <b>local</b> urethral <b>anaesthesia</b> to intrave-nous sedation and analgesia (sedoanalgesia) methods in patients undergoing internal urethrotomy. Patients and Methods: A total of 21 and 15 patients with anterior urethral strictures underwent internal urethrotomy under <b>local</b> urethral <b>anaesthesia,</b> with or without se-doanalgesia, respectively. Patient discomfort and pain levels were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS). Statistical analyses were calculated with a Mann-Whitney U tes...|$|R
30|$|Similarly, {{traditional}} opioid {{patient-controlled analgesia}} (PCA), which are extensively used concomitantly with peripheral nerve blocks and local anesthetics, are also less suitable {{in the setting}} of fast track recovery. Furthermore, in the case of <b>local</b> infiltration <b>anaesthesia</b> (LIA) –despite it being effective in controlling pain on the day of surgery– it is not effective in management of movement-evoked pain in the days following surgery.|$|R
50|$|Mild {{cases may}} need a {{sedation}} at most. <b>Local</b> and spinal <b>anaesthesia</b> find common use.

2500|$|Standing {{castration}} is {{a technique}} where a horse is sedated and <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is administered, without throwing the horse to the ground or putting him completely [...] "under." [...] It has the benefit that general anaesthesia (GA) is not required. [...] This method is advocated for simple procedures because the estimated mortality for GA in horses at a modern clinic is low, approximately one or two in 1000. Mortality in the field (where most horse castrations are performed) is probably higher, due to poorer facilities.|$|E
50|$|Ocular surgery may be {{performed}} under topical, local or general anesthesia. <b>Local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is more preferred {{because it is}} economical, easy to perform and the risk involved is less. <b>Local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> has a rapid onset of action and provides a dilated pupil with low intraocular pressure.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesComparison of sapheno-femoral {{ligation}} and stripping (SFL/S) versus endovenous {{laser ablation}} (EVLA, 980 -nm) {{in the treatment}} of great saphenous vein (GSV) insufficiency, using <b>local</b> tumescent <b>anaesthesia.</b> DesignRandomised, single centre trial. Materials and methodsPatients with GSV incompetence and varicose veins were randomised to either SFL/S or EVLA. At days 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14 post-treatment, patients completed questionnaires on pain and quality of life. Recurrent varicose veins were evaluated by Duplex ultrasound (DUS) performed at 1 and 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months. Results 130 legs in 121 patients were treated by SFL/S (n= 68) or EVLA (n= 62). Significantly more post-treatment pain was noted after EVLA at days 7, 10 and 14 (p< 0. 01; p< 0. 01; p= 0. 01), more hindrance in mobility at days 7 (p< 0. 01) and 10 (p= 0. 01), and in self care (p= 0. 03) and daily activities (p= 0. 01) at day 7 compared to SFL/S. DUS at 1 -year follow-up showed 9 % recurrences (5 / 56) after EVLA and 10 % (5 / 49) after SFL/S. ConclusionBoth SFL/S and EVLA, using <b>local</b> tumescent <b>anaesthesia,</b> were well tolerated, with no difference in short-term recurrence rate. In the second week after EVLA, patients experienced significantly more pain resulting in restricted mobility, self care and daily activity compared to SFL/S...|$|R

40|$|<b>Local</b> or {{regional}} <b>anaesthesia</b> {{has long been}} recognised as a useful anaesthetic option for thyroidectomy. A few authors have reported the successful use of <b>local</b> infiltration <b>anaesthesia</b> for thyroidectomy in our environment.

However, we are unaware of any report on the use of cervical plexus block for thyroidectomy in our environment. We used bilateral superficial cervical plexus block for thyroidectomy in a 20 -year old girl with a simple multinodular goitre. Surgery was performed with the patient in the classical thyroidectomy position. Though the patient was lightly sedated during the operation, the anaesthetist maintained communication with her throughout the procedure. Anaesthesia was generally effective, except for minor complaints of pressure symptoms during mobilization of the gland and postural aches. These, the patient described as tolerable. Surgery, which lasted 2 hours 45 minutes, was uneventful. The patient was allowed oral fluid intake within 2 hours postoperatively.

40|$|Venous Program: Sclerotherapy and Thermal Ablation: {{abstract}} no. VN 15 Purpose: Endovenous {{laser therapy}} (EVLT) {{has emerged as}} a popular treatment for great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux. We performed both sapheno-femoral ligation with stripping (L&S) and EVLT procedures using <b>local</b> tumescent <b>anaesthesia</b> in the treatment of GSV reflux and compared the outcomes. Methodology: One hundred and forty-two legs with GSV reflux received L&S (n= 79) or EVLT (940 nm) (n= 63) under <b>local</b> tumescent <b>anaesthesia</b> as day surgery procedures between November 2008 and June 2011. The safety and efficacy as well as the early results including postoperative pain and the time before resuming normal activities were compared. Venous clinical severity score (VCSS) assessment and Duplex scans were performed at one month and one year after operation. Results: The duration of operation was significantly shorter for EVLT (Median: 70 minutes vs. 90 minutes). The success rate as defined by the absence of GSV reflux at one month Duplex scan were 100 % in both groups. No major complications were recorded. Pain score was significantly higher in the EVLT group (Median: 2. 86 vs. 1. 71) although the numbers of analgesic required were comparable (Median: 3 tablets in EVLT vs. 2 tablets in L&S). The time before resuming normal activities was also similar (Median: 7 days in EVLT vs. 5 days in L&S). VCSS showed significant improvement at one year in both groups (Median: from 4 to 2 in EVLT; 5 to 1 in L&S). Recurrence of GSV reflux noted at one year was comparable (10 % in EVLT vs. 4 % in L&S). Conclusion: Both procedures were safe and effective in ablating GSV reflux with similar recurrence rate at one year. EVLT was associated with increased pain although the time before resuming normal activities was comparable to L&S...|$|R
