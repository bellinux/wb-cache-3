40|$|Abstract. Flexible {{transparent}} conducting (TC) {{film is a}} {{key element}} as the transparent electrode of the flexible electronics such as touch screen, solar cell, display or <b>lighting.</b> <b>Current</b> commercial flexible sputtered ITO films have shown some limitations; high sheet resistance (> 10 ohm/sq), deterioration of ITO film during repeatedly bending, indium scarce, and expensive fabrication process (sputtering). In this report, a new simple and cheap process to make such flexible TC film by using hot embossing and forming micro metal mesh underneath transparent conducting layer is proposed. This simple process has yielded a promising result with sheet resistance as low as 4 ohm/sq and the light transmission of 68 % (@ 550 nm). Future improvement on light transmission is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Human {{occupancy}} {{detection and}} localization {{are important in}} a variety of smart building applications including building security, assisted living monitors, and energy-efficient heating ventilation and air cooling and <b>lighting.</b> <b>Current</b> implementation of such systems is limited by motion-sensor technologies, e. g., passive infrared (PIR) and ultrasonic sensors, which substitute as occupancy detectors but ultimately suffer from an inability to detect stationary objects. Capacitive sensing can detect stationary objects, but the technology has almost exclusively been developed for short-range human detection and localization, e. g., touch-screen human interfacing of smart devices. This paper presents a transmitter-receiver platform for research and development of capacitive sensing for long-range human occupancy detection and localization. During testing, the system revealed a detection range of 3. 5 m, a typical room dimension in homes. Further, tests of a multitransmitter single-receiver system in a 3. 2 m × 3. 2 m space showed the system's potential for occupant localization. Ultimately, this system represents an alternative to PIR and ultrasonic motion sensors, and has the potential to increase smart building system implementation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: CISCuT (copper indium {{sulphide}} (CIS) on Cu tape) is a {{new technology}} for thin film solar cells. In a roll-to-roll process, indium is deposited on a copper tape, and subsequently sulphurised. It was shown previously that various Cu-In-S phases are formed. After deposition of a window layer such as e. g. Cu(O,S), the structure behaves as a photovoltaic p-n junction. Analysis of IV-measurements in dark and under illumination of cell structures with circular Cu(O,S) revealed some peculiarities. Large values of the <b>light</b> <b>current</b> density were observed and the IV-characteristics showed pronounced shunt behaviour. When illumination of the cell was restricted {{to the area of}} the contact dot, <b>light</b> <b>current</b> showed an acceptable value. This phenomenon could be explained by assuming an internal p-n junction inside the absorber layer where the p-layer near the surface has a non-negligible lateral conductance. This phenomenon was described quantitatively and simulated in a numerical program. These simulations could explain the additional <b>light</b> <b>current</b> and also the shunt behaviour of the cell quantitatively. Fitting of measured and simulated IV-curves allowed estimating the sheet resistance of the p-type layer. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} p-n junction is not at the Cu(O,S) interface, but that there is an internal p-n junction inside the CuInS 2 absorber...|$|R

40|$|Interior spaces, such as conference rooms, require {{multiple}} {{forms of}} lighting to meet different task needs. Linear fluorescent lamp fixtures commonly produce the general ambient light, and reflectorized halogen lamp fixtures produce the directional <b>lighting.</b> <b>Current</b> lighting practice uses multiple light source technologies and fixtures {{to achieve the}} required illumination for the various tasks. However, many light fixtures can create an unappealing architectural design, especially in a small space, and multiple light source technologies can cause maintenance difficulties. The ideal scenario would be to create one fixture with a single type of light source that could meet a variety of lighting needs. The size, potential energy savings, and reduced maintenance benefits of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) make them attractive for use in general illumination applications. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was to investigate whether a light fixture could be designed with white LEDs to provide different beam distributions. A commercially available ray tracing package was utilized to model, analyze, and optimize light fixture concepts created using LEDs and light guides. The fixtures were optimized for light output distribution and efficiency. While a rectangular-shaped light guide with simple diffused reflective surfaces provided the necessary cosine beam distribution, a more sophisticated surface treatment was required on the light extracting surface of the light guide to create the batwing beam distributions. The surface finish structures were in the form of micro-prism arrays. By switching LED arrays on and off to different light guides, variou...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} different {{investigations of}} lightning simulation of a combined 170 kV overhead line/cable connected GIS. This is interesting {{due to the}} increasing amount of underground cables and GIS in the Danish transmission system. This creates a different system with respect to lightning performance, compared to a system consisting solely of AIS connected through overhead lines. The main purpose is to investigate whether overvoltage protection is necessary at the GIS busbar. The analysis is conducted by implementing a simulation model in PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulations are conducted for both SF and BFO. Overvoltages are evaluated for varying front times of the lightning surge, different soil resistivities at the surge arrester grounding in the overhead line/cable transition point and a varying length of the connection cable between the transformer and the GIS busbar with a SA implemented. Simulations are conducted for different positions of the GIS bus section breaker. The <b>lighting</b> <b>current</b> required to cause inadmissible voltages at the GIS connected transformer is evaluated and the MTBF is found for different cases. With the GIS bus CB in closed position results indicate that SF does not cause inadmissible voltages to appear at the transformer. However, BFO caused by a lightning stroke of extremely high magnitude can cause inadmissible voltages to appear at the transformer. With the GIS bus CB in open position results indicate that both SF and BFO can cause inadmissible voltages to appear at the transformer. A risk assessment based on the simulation results and statistical data for lightning, yields the conclusion that implementation of a surge arrester at the GIS busbar is not necessary...|$|E
