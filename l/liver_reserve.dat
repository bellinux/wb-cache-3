40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> {{function in}} patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis using indocyanine green (ICG) clearance test, and to investigate the correlation of ICG clearance test with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score in evaluating liver function. Methods A total of 127 patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis who were hospitalized in The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University from January 2012 to January 2015 were enrolled. ICG clearance test was performed for all the patients, and the ICG plasma clearance (K value), effective liver blood flow (EHBF), and ICG retention at 15 minutes (ICG R 15) were calculated. CTP class and MELD score were also determined. An {{analysis of variance was}} used for comparison between groups, the least significant difference t-test was used for comparison between any two groups, Spearman rank correlation was performed for correlation analysis, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> function. Results Among all the patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis, 63 had CTP class A, 45 had CTP class B, and 19 had CTP class C hepatitis B cirrhosis. With the increasing CTP class, ICG R 15 gradually increased, while EHBF and K value gradually decreased (F= 146. 96 ， 91. 26 and 40. 94 ，P= 0. 001, 0. 003 and 0. 005). In the evaluation of liver function, ICG R 15 was positively correlated with MELD score and CTP class (r= 0. 525 and 0. 838, both P＜ 0. 01) and was negatively correlated with EHBF and K value (r=- 0. 703 and - 0. 901, both P＜ 0. 01). The area under the ROC curve was 0. 85 for ICG R 15 and 0. 65 for MELD score. Conclusion ICG test can accurately and dynamically reflect <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> function, and ICG R 15 can evaluate <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> function better than CTP class and MELD score...|$|E

Deterioration of liver capacity, with subsequent progression into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ultimately leads to a further decrease in the hepatic reserve. The Child–Turcotte–Pugh scoring system is the standard tool for assessing underlying <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity in routine practice and in clinical trials of CLD and HCC. In this review, we highlight the clinical significance of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and the growth hormone (GH) signaling pathway in HCC. IGF-I could be a marker for <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity in CLDs and HCC in clinical practice. This approach could improve the risk assessment and stratifications of patients {{on the basis of their}} underlying <b>liver</b> <b>reserve,</b> either before active treatment in routine practice or before they are enrolled in clinical trials.

40|$|AbstractEradicating vitamin A {{deficiency}} and its related sequelae {{are important}} to ensure global health. Various vitamin A status indicators are available, but {{the most commonly used}} are not sensitive to changes in body reserves of vitamin A, which concentrate in the liver. Serum retinol concentrations can be misleading in some groups of individuals because of lack of sensitivity to total <b>liver</b> <b>reserves.</b> In addition to vitamin A supplementation to preschool children, many countries add preformed vitamin A to a variety of foods in the process of fortification. Indirect indicators that work in the excessive to hypervitaminotic range of <b>liver</b> <b>reserves</b> are needed to monitor such programs. High liver stores have been determined in countries with on-going sugar fortification programs. The retinol isotope dilution test, using deuterium or 13 C, is the only current indirect indicator that works in the excessive range of <b>liver</b> <b>reserves.</b> Evaluating population vitamin A status needs to move beyond the measurement of serum retinol concentrations to ensure that we are not tipping the vitamin A scale too far in the wrong direction with the implementation of multiple interventions in the same population groups...|$|R

40|$|Background: Northeast Arctic cod, inhabiting {{the edge}} of the species area, {{experience}} variable environmental conditions and feeding resources, one of the main of them is capelin. Lipids are an important biochemical link between capelin and cod. Lipids constitute approximately 10 - 15 % of the total wet weight of capelin at the peak of their seasonal cycle in lipid accumulation (Jangaard 1974). In contrast, approximately 1 % of the wet weight of the muscle tissue of cod is composed of lipids (Lie et al. 1988). The liver is the primary site of stored lipid reserves in cod. These reserves are utilized during periods of food limitation and the annual cycle of gonad maturation.

The concentrations of retinol in the human milk of T infants were superior to concentrations in the milk of PT infants (1. 87 + 0. 81 > 1. 38 + 0. 67 mu mol/L, p 217. 65 + 105. 65 mu g, p < 0. 0001), but both were below the recommendation. VAD was 20. 0 % (T) and 27. 5 % (PT). Only 40. 0 % (T) and 22. 5 % (PT) of the mothers had retinol concentrations in milk above 2. 3 mmol/L. The milk of the nursing mothers studied did not have enough retinol to meet the daily needs and to form <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> in both groups, especially in PT newborns.

40|$|Various noninvasive <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> markers were {{proposed}} {{to indicate the}} severity of liver damage. However, the role and feasibility of these markers to predict the {{prognosis of patients with}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unknown. We aimed to identify the prognostic role of the 8 currently used hepatic reserve markers in patients with HCC undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Between 2002 and 2013, a total of 881 patients with HCC undergoing TACE were prospectively identified and retrospectively analyzed. The baseline characteristics, tumor status and noninvasive markers were collected. Homogeneity and corrected Akaike information criteria (AICc) were compared between these markers. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent predictors of survival. Significant differences in survival distribution were found for albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class, Lok index, fibrosis index based on 4 factors (FIB- 4), Göteborg University cirrhosis index (GUCI), cirrhosis discriminant index (CDI) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (all p values < 0. 05). Among these markers, the ALBI grade showed the highest homogeneity and lowest AICc value, indicating a better prognostic performance. Cox multivariate analysis confirmed that ALBI grade 2, ascites, serum alkaline phosphatase and α-fetoprotein level, tumor diameter, vascular invasion and performance status were significant independent prognostic predictors. The distribution of the ALBI score well correlated with baseline CTP and MLED scores. Our data suggest that among the currently used <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> markers, ALBI grade may serve as an objective and feasible surrogate to predict the prognosis of HCC patients undergoing TACE...|$|E

Women of childbearing age and children are documented as the most affected groups. Objective: The objective was to determine the length of time mothers are protected postpartum against vitamin A depletion after receiving either 400 000 IU vitamin A in 2 divided doses or 200 000 IU as a single dose plus a placebo 24 h apart. Design: Mothers (n = 3 D 168) were recruited by trained fieldworkers 79 ̆ 610 d after delivery. Modified-relative-dose-response (MRDR) tests were performed at baseline in 167 women, and vitamin A was administered within 6 wk after delivery.

Many authors believe that the probability of gathering randomised controlled trial (RCT) data is low. Our aim {{is to provide a}} consensus document making recommendations on the appropriate application of thermal ablation in patients with colorectal liver metastases. Methods: This consensus paper was discussed by an expert panel at The Interventional Oncology Sans Frontières 2013. A literature review was presented. Tumour characteristics, ablation technique and different clinical applications were considered and the level of consensus was documented. Results: Specific recommendations are made with regard to metastasis size, number, and location and ablation technique. Mean 31  % 5 -year survival post-ablation in selected patients has resulted in acceptance of this therapy for those with technically inoperable but limited liver disease and those with limited <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> or co-morbidities that render them inoperable. Conclusions: In the absence of RCT data, it is our aim that this consensus document will facilitate judicious selection of the patients most likely to benefit from thermal ablation and provide a unified interventional oncological perspective for the use of this technology. Key Points: • Best results require due consideration of tumour size, number, volume and location. • Ablation technology, imaging guidance and intra-procedural imaging assessment must be optimised. • Accepted applications include inoperable disease due to tumour distribution or inadequate <b>liver</b> <b>reserve.</b> • Other current indications include concurrent co-morbidity, patient choice and the test-of-time approach. • Future applications may include resectable disease, e. g. for small solitary tumours...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} improvement in recent results of hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients. Hospital mortality rates of less than 5 % are frequently reported. The improvement is largely a result of better techniques and performance of surgeons in hepatectomy, and reduction in blood loss and transfusion requirement. Better selection of patients is perhaps a more significant contributory factor. Careful identification of {{risk factors related to}} the medical condition of the patient, functional <b>reserve</b> of the <b>liver</b> and volume of the remnant liver is essential for the prevention of postoperative liver failure. Indocyanine green clearance test is the most accurate test for assessment of <b>liver</b> function <b>reserve.</b> An indocyanine green retention rate of 14 % at 15 minutes is the safety limit for major hepatectomy for cirrhotic patients. A maximum of 60 % of the nontumorous liver can be resected safely. Computed tomography is therefore an important assessment parameter. The <b>liver</b> function <b>reserve</b> also reveals the suitability for hepatectomy. Liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase can reflect the hepatic activity, which could be responsible for the impaired liver function. Steatosis is another factor that influences hepatic function reserve. Age is also an important risk factor in hepatectomy because elderly patients may harbor occult heart disease, reduced respiratory and <b>liver</b> function <b>reserves.</b> After recognizing the risk factors, surgeons should eliminate operative morbidity and mortality by making appropriate decisions based on the assessments.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the clinical values of indocyanine green (ICG) retention rate at 15 min (ICGR 15) and effective hepatic blood flow (EHBF) {{in evaluating the}} <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> function among patients with chronic hepatitis. MethodsEighty-two patients with chronic hepatitis {{were included in the}} study. ICGR 15 and EHBF were measured by pulse dye densitometry before treatment, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBil), albumin, prothrombin activity, and cholinesterase were also measured. ICGR 15 and EHBF were monitored among mild, moderate, and severe patients, patients with normal ALT and abnormal ALT, and patients with normal TBil and abnormal TBil. The predictive values of ICGR 15 and EHBF for patients′ conditions were analyzed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The continuous data were expressed as median±interquartile range. Comparison between more than two groups was made by Kruskal-Wallis H test; comparison between two groups was made by Mann-Whitney U test. ResultsICGR 15 and EHBF showed significant differences between mild and severe patients and between moderate and severe patients (H= 5. 0 and 12. 0, P＜ 0. 05 for both; H= 25. 0 and 29. 0, P＜ 0. 05 for both). There {{were no significant differences in}} ICGR 15 and EHBF between the patients with normal ALT and those with abnormal ALT (U= 135. 5, P= 0. 089; U= 146. 0, P= 0. 155). ICGR 15 and EHBF also showed significant differences between the patients with normal TBil and those with abnormal TBil (U= 68. 0, P＜ 0. 05; U= 84. 0, P＜ 0. 05). The areas under the ROC curve of ICGR 15, EHBF, ALT, and TBil were 0. 434, 0. 497, 0. 622, and 0. 521, respectively, in mild patients, 0. 969, 0. 075, 0. 900, and 1  000, respectively, in moderate patients, and 0. 861, 0. 161, 0. 759, and 0. 950, respectively, in severe patients. ConclusionsICG clearance test is an accurate method for quantitatively assessing the <b>liver</b> <b>reserve</b> function and is helpful for taking timely, effective intervention. This test is of great clinical significance...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to validate, with an independent prospective cohort of patients, our previous data indicating that the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-labeling index (PCNA-LI) reflects the <b>liver</b> functional <b>reserve</b> in human cirrhosis and might have prognostic significance for patient survival. We also examined how this proliferative index is related to the expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta 1) as a possible correlate of hepatocyte proliferative activity.

40|$|ABSTRACF A {{comprehensive}} {{survey was}} carried out to assess the vitamin A status of preschool children ofpoor migrant families in the periurban population ofRibeirao Preto, a typical agricUltural town in the sugarcane and coffee region ofthe State ofSao Paulo in Southern Brazil. The intake of vitamin A and carotenoids from the rice and bean based diet ofthese children is considered low and appears to influence blood concentrations and <b>liver</b> <b>reserves</b> ofthis vitamin. With respect to plasma vitamin A, 1. 8 % ofthe children had a deficient level (< 10 pg%), whereas 48. 8 % ofthe children had a low level (< 20 pg%). Most children with inadequate plasma vitamin A (< 20 ig%) responded positively to a massive dose of 200, 000 IU vitamin A, suggesting that these children {{may be at risk}} ofhaving low liver stores ofvitamin A. Rose Bengal staining test and rapid dark adaptation time did not indicate definite signs ofconjunctival xerosisand night blindnessamongthese children. No ocular evidence ofhypovitaminosis A was found in the children studied, but marginal or inadequate vitamin A status appears to be a common public health problem among young children in this region o...|$|R
40|$|The {{perioperative}} {{outcome of}} hepatic resection has improved remarkably {{in recent years}} with improved surgical techniques and perioperative care. As a result, the indications of hepatic resection have been extended to include patients with borderline liver function, especially those with associated cirrhosis. For such patients, proper preoperative assessment of <b>liver</b> function <b>reserve</b> is essential to ensure a low incidence of postoperative liver failure and mortality. In our center, routine preoperative assessment of hepatic function reserve in all patients includes clinical assessment, liver biochemistry, coagulation profile, platelet count, and Child-Pugh classification. The indocyanine green clearance test is routinely performed for patients with chronic liver disease. For patients with cirrhosis undergoing major hepatectomy, computed tomography volumetry and laparoscopy are helpful in evaluating whether the remnant liver volume is adequate. In selected patients with small remnant liver, preoperative portal vein embolization can be employed to induce hypertrophy of the remnant liver even {{in the presence of}} chronic hepatitis and mild cirrhosis. Careful assessment of comorbid conditions of patients and meticulous surgical techniques to reduce bleeding and hypoxic injury to the remnant liver are complementary to the selection of patients with adequate <b>liver</b> function <b>reserve,</b> to minimize operative mortality. © Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
