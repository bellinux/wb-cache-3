5|$|Scottish Terriers have {{a greater}} chance of {{developing}} some cancers than other purebreds. According to research by the Veterinary Medical Data Program (1986), six cancers that Scotties appeared to be more at risk for (when compared to other breeds) are: (in descending order) bladder cancer and other transitional cell carcinomas of the lower urinary tract; malignant melanoma; gastric carcinoma; squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; <b>lymphosarcoma</b> and nasal carcinoma. Other cancers that are known to commonly affect Scotties include mast cell sarcoma and hemangiosarcoma.|$|E

Polysomy of chromosome 13 (Polysomy 13) is significant in the development of prostate cancer and is often caused by centric fusions. Since canine chromosome 13 is similar to human chromosome 8q, research could provide insight to treatment for prostate cancer in humans.|$|E

25|$|Cancer, {{the most}} common being hemangiosarcoma, {{followed}} by <b>lymphosarcoma,</b> mast cell tumour, and osteosarcoma, {{was the cause of}} death for 61.4% of American Goldens according to a 1998 health study conducted by the Golden Retriever Club of America, making it the breed's biggest killer. A 2004 survey by the UK Kennel Club puts this number at 38.8%. Although most puppies are screened for the disorders before being sold (by reputable breeders), hip and elbow dysplasia afflict one-fifth of dogs.

40|$|A {{total of}} 243 {{neoplasms}} {{were recorded in}} a survey of all the feline neoplasms which are reported in the registration files of the Veterinary Research Institute, Onderstepoort, Republic of South Africa, covering a 40 -year period from 1935 to 1974. The tissues most commonly neoplastic were the skin, followed by the lymphoid tissue, the digestive tract and the genital system, which together accounted for 76, 6 % of the total tumours. Squamous cell carcinomas, the commonest type of tumour, accounted for 65 (26, 7 %) of the 243 neoplasms, followed by <b>lymphosarcomas</b> with 50 (20, 5 %). The majority of squamous cell carcinomas involved the skin, especially that of the ear and nose. A reasonably high proportion of these tumours also occurred on the tongue and eyelid. The commonest form of distribution for <b>lymphosarcomas</b> was the multicentric form, followed by the alimentary, the renal and thymic forms. Squamous cell carcinomas were the most frequent type of skin tumours, followed by basal cell tumours, mastocytomas and melanomas. The digestive tract accounted for 33 (13, 5 %) of the neoplasms, the 3 most commonly encountered being squamous cell carcinomas, <b>lymphosarcomas</b> and intestinal adenocarcinomas. The mammary gland tumours accounted for 23 (9, 5 %) of the total, 61 % of which were carcinomas.

40|$|The 5 -year {{study of}} cancer in black gold miners, 1964 - 68, {{previously}} reported (Robertson et al., 1971) has now been extended for a separate 8 -year period, 1972 - 79. This allows analyses of all cancers together and of 6 less common sites of cancer severally: <b>lymphosarcomas,</b> colon and rectum, leukaemia, stomach, pancreas and buccal cavity and also of those too rare to classify. The malignancies are considered by territory of origin of the gold miners. Lesotho miners have significantly fewer (P less than 0. 05) tumours of the lymphatic and haemopoietic tissues and Natal miners have the highest incidence rates for 5 of the 6 sites (excluding leukaemia). A simple grouping method is applied to determine which of the 11 sites {{of cancer in}} the miners have similar distributions in their 10 territories of origin. The aetiological implications of clusters over space of certain sites of cancer are discussed. Finally, temporal change over the years 1964 - 79 shows a significant decrease overall (P less than 0. 01) in cases of <b>lymphosarcomas</b> and colo-rectal cancers and an increase (P less than 0. 05) in stomach cancer.

Direct cytotoxic tests and absorption tests with a murine anti-G serum and a rat antiradiation leukemia virus (RadlY) serum, using 9 other Ur, NMU, Or DMBA-induced CS 7 Bl lymphomas, demonstrated the presence of common ceil-surFace, virus-related antigens on the virus-induced E if G 2 leukemia, the Radl Y lymphoma, and the chemically induced lymphomas. An antiserum raised in CS 7 Bl against Ur-induced C 3 HF or BAlB/c lymphomas exhibited a complement-dependent cytotoxic activity against 21 of 22 CS 7 Bl lymphomas induced by the 3 different carcinogens, against the El 4 leukemia but not against the virus-induced E if G 2 leukemia.

40|$|The {{presence}} {{and location of}} DNA sequences related to the U 3 and U 5 portions of the infectious exogenous feline leukemia virus (FeLV) long terminal repeat (LTR) in various cat DNAs have been determined by hybridization experiments. In uninfected cat DNAs, the U 5 LTR segment from the Gardner-Arnstein strain B virus is present at approximately 150 copies per cell. This level is approximately 10 -fold {{greater than that of}} endogenous internal FeLV sequences. The U 5 sequences differ in copy number and, to some extent, in location from one animal to another. For any one animal, the sequence organization of the U 5 segments is the same among different tissues, showing that the pattern is inherited through the germ line. Most importantly, the viral U 3 LTR probe hybridizes only very weakly with uninfected cat DNAs. Both the U 3 and the U 5 regions of the LTR from the Gardner-Arnstein strain of virus cross-hybridize with DNA derived from four other infectious FeLVs representing A, B, and C subtypes. Thus, the C 3 region may be used as a probe for studying the number and location of exogenously acquired FeLV proviruses in infected cat tissues. In some cases exogenously acquired proviruses are present in unique sites in the genome of virus-positive cat <b>lymphosarcomas,</b> indicating a monoclonal origin for the tumor. In other tumors, the proviral sequences are randomly distributed over many sites. <b>Lymphosarcomas</b> of virus-negative cats have no exogenous U 3 sequences despite epidemiological evidence of an association of virus-negative leukemia with exposure to FeLV...|$|R
