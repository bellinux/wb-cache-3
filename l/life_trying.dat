5|$|By 1846 Honoré de Balzac had {{achieved}} tremendous fame as a writer, but his finances and health were deteriorating rapidly. After writing {{a series of}} potboiler novels in the 1820s, he published his first book under his own name, Les Chouans ("The Chouans"), in 1829. He followed this with dozens of well-received novels and stories, including La Peau de chagrin ("The Magic Skin"), in 1831, Le Père Goriot ("Father Goriot") in 1835, and the two-volume Illusions perdues ("Lost Illusions"), in 1837 and 1839. Because of his lavish lifestyle and penchant for financial speculation, however, {{he spent most of}} his <b>life</b> <b>trying</b> to repay a variety of debts. He wrote tirelessly, driven as much by economic necessity as by the muse and black coffee. This regimen of constant work exhausted his body and brought reprimands from his doctor.|$|E
5|$|The French, led by Charles, {{similarly}} {{sought to}} expand their influence; Charles seized Sicily and Byzantine territory while marrying his daughters to the Latin claimants to Byzantium. To create his own claim to the throne of Jerusalem, Charles executed one rival and purchased {{the rights to the}} city from another. In 1270 Charles turned his brother King LouisIX's last Crusade, known as the Eighth Crusade, to his own advantage by persuading Louis to attack his rebel Arab vassals in Tunis. Louis' army was devastated by disease, and Louis himself died at Tunis on 25August. Louis' fleet returned to France, leaving only Prince Edward, the future king of England, and a small retinue to continue {{what is known as the}} Ninth Crusade. Edward survived an assassination attempt organised by Baibars, negotiated a ten-year truce, and then returned to manage his affairs in England. This ended the last significant crusading effort in the Eastern Mediterranean. The 1281 election of a French pope, MartinIV, brought the full power of the papacy into line behind Charles. He prepared to launch a crusade against Constantinople but, in what became known as the Sicilian Vespers, an uprising fomented by MichaelVIII Palaiologos deprived him of the resources of Sicily, and Peter III of Aragon was proclaimed king of Sicily. In response, Martin excommunicated Peter and called for an Aragonese Crusade, which was unsuccessful. In 1285 Charles died, having spent his <b>life</b> <b>trying</b> to amass a Mediterranean empire; he and Louis had viewed themselves as God's instruments to uphold the papacy.|$|E

25|$|The {{story of}} the three ciphertexts {{originates}} from an 1885 pamphlet detailing treasure being buried {{by a man named}} Thomas J. Beale in a secret location in Bedford County, Virginia, in the 1820s. Beale entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper named Robert Morriss and then disappeared, never to be seen again. According to the story, the innkeeper opened the box 23 years later, and then decades after that gave the three encrypted ciphertexts to a friend before he died. The friend then spent the next twenty years of his <b>life</b> <b>trying</b> to decode the messages, and was able to solve only one of them which gave details of the treasure buried and the general location of the treasure. The unnamed friend then published all three ciphertexts in a pamphlet which was advertised for sale in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|In Eclipse, Bella {{agrees to}} marry Edward on the {{condition}} he will make love to her while she is still human. Edward eventually relents and agrees, on the stipulation it will only occur after they are married. The plot {{is driven by the}} machinations of the vampire Victoria, who, seeking revenge for the death of her mate James, is hunting Bella and creating new vampires to build an army. A grudging truce is made between the Cullens and the Native-American werewolf pack led by Sam Uley and Jacob Black, a friend of Bella's who was there for her when Edward broke her heart. However, the truce is endangered when Bella realizes Jacob means more to her than she thought. Ultimately, Edward accepts that Bella cares for Jacob and successfully destroys Victoria, and Bella acknowledges that Edward is {{the most important person in}} her life. Edward tells Bella that they may attempt making love before they get married, as he realizes that she spends too much of her <b>life</b> <b>trying</b> to please other people. However, she refuses his offer and agrees to doing things the way Edward initially wanted: marriage, making love, and then becoming a vampire.|$|E
