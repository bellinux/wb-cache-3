40|$|A {{prototype}} of a <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> based on pulsed time-of-flight (TOF) method {{was developed for}} measuring liquid level accurately at distances from zero to 30 metres. The system consists of an optomechanical sensor head and electronics unit which are connected to each other by means of two optical fibres. The developed level gauge utilizes mirror-like reflection of the liquid surface and by proper design of the optics the received signal is constant in the whole measurement range. The losses in the optical path of the level gauge are relatively small, thus allowing {{the use of a}} 1 mW CW semiconductor diode laser as a light source. The pulsing frequency of the laser is 1. 5 MHz and the time interval between start and stop pulses is digitized by means of a simple and inherently linear synchronous digital counter. The correct orientation of the measurement head is achieved by using sensitive bearings and by allowing gravity to keep the correct orientation. An attenuation system based on e [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{cooldown}} of {{the inner}} vessel of the Central Calorimeter cryostat to 77 K was performed {{during the week of}} October 12 in order to 'cold shock' it, i. e., to check for insulating vacuum integrity with the inner vessel cold. The conclusion from our test results is that the vessel withstood the cold shock, and the insulating vacuum remained good. Cooldown was analyzed by J. D. Fuerst in D 0 note 3740. 000 -EN- 107, dated August 19. Warmup was analyzed by T. Peterson and B. Fitzpatrick in D 0 Engineering Note 3740. 214 -EN- 110, dated September 29. Both cooldown and warmup times were in accordance with predictions. An initial pumpdown of the insulating vacuum space was done with the vessel warm on October 9. The results of that pumpdown are shown in Figure 1 superimposed on a predicted pumpdown curve generated by Brian Fitzpatrick before the test began. After 24 hours the insulating vacuum was 7 microns. After 48 and 72 hours it was 2 - 3 microns. At this point (October 12) valving the pumps off resulted in a rise of 6 microns in 3 hours and 20 minutes, or 1. 8 microns per hour. Before beginning cooldown, the pumps were valved off and the insulating vacuum was 15 microns. Cooldown and fill began at 0900 on Tuesday, October 13. At 1650, about 8 hours later, LN{sub 2 } flow to the cryostat was shut off. A total of 2600 gallons was consumed during this period based on my readings of the trailer <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> and chart. An additional 500 gallons was used (according to the same <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> <b>gauge)</b> in the final blowdown of pressure in the trailer, bringing the total to 3100 gallons. Based on weight in and weight out, 21980 pounds of LN{sub 2 } was used, or 3273 gallons of liquid. This is good enough agreement with my readings of the gauge that I will use the 2600 gallon number as our usage in the cryostat; therefore, the average flow rate for 8 hours was 325 gallons per hour or 5. 42 gallons per minute. At the end we had 1600 gallons of stored liquid in the cryostat, so 1000 gallons were consumed in cooling it down. At this time with the pumps still valved off the insulating vacuum was 13 microns. The vacuum had improved slightly while the pumps had been valved out for the entire time; no cold leakage was observed. Over the next 64 hours while draining and warmup were completed the pumps remained valved out and the vacuum rose to 170 microns, a rate of 2. 5 microns per hour, not significantly different from the 1. 8 microns per hour before the cooldown test. Except for the period of time when the drain was plugged with ice, the rate of warmup agreed very well with predicted rate. Figure 2 shows the warmup of 4 resistors in the gas space and one on the top {{of the inner}} vessel in the vacuum space. The insulating vacuum remained good during the cold shock, and the rate of rise after cold shock was similar to that before. The rate of warmup was in good agreement with predictions, indicating that predicted heat transfer coefficents inside the vessel were reasonably accurate (within 50 % of actual) ...|$|E

The prototype gauge is specially made for ocean wave height measurement, but the underlined principle {{can be extended}} to level measurements in other situations. The gauge consists of a field unit anchored at the location where the ocean wave height is to be measured, and a base unit stationed in land [...] The base unit can be connected to a computer to download wave height data for analysis. The field unit (see Fig.) consists of (1) an air-filled torus-shaped fully submerged platform anchored to sea bed, (2) a level sensing column hinged to the platform, and (3) a control box with electronic circuits, a radio transmitter, and rechargeable batteries. The anchoring is done {{in such a way}} that the mean sea level is roughly at the centre of the level sensing column. The sensing columns should be longer than twice the amplitude of sea waves. The control circuits perform many tasks: it converts the variation of capacitance between the two vertical tubes in the sensing column to variable frequency radio signal; it determines the sampling periods and sampling rates; it also communicates with the base unit by radio signals. The field unit is designed to consume very little power and the rechargeable batteries alone can power the unit for 10 days. The base unit consists of a radio receiver, control circuits, and an interface. This unit can receive radio signals from the field unit which must be within 2 km.

50|$|A reflex gauge is {{more complex}} in {{construction}} but can give a clearer distinction between gas (steam) and liquid (water). Instead of containing the media in a glass tube, the gauge consists of a vertically oriented slotted metal body with a strong glass plate mounted on the open side of the slot facing the operator. The rear of the glass, {{in contact with the}} media, has grooves moulded into its surface, running vertically. The grooves form a zig-zag pattern with 90° angles. Incident light entering the glass is refracted at the rear surface in contact with the media. In the region that is contact with the gas, most of the light is reflected from the surface of one groove to the next and back towards the operator, appearing silvery white. In the region that is in contact with the liquid, most of the light is refracted into the liquid causing this region to appear almost black to the operator. Well-known makes of reflex gauge are IGEMA,TGI Ilmadur,Penberthy, Jerguson, Klinger, and Cesare-Bonetti. Due to the caustic nature of boiler anti-scaling treatments ("water softeners"), reflex gauges tend to become relatively rapidly etched by the water and lose their effectivess at displaying the <b>liquid</b> <b>level.</b> Therefore, bi-colour <b>gauges</b> are recommended for certain types of boiler, particularly those operating at pressure above 60 bar.|$|R

The <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> in the horizontal pipe is controlled {{in the middle}} of the pipe. The <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> is controlled by a <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> sensor in the horizontal pipe and a control valve in the gas run. As the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> rises in the horizontal pipe, the level sensor sends a signal to the control valve and which begins to pinch shut to create some slight back pressure to push the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> down. Conversely, as <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> goes goes down, the control valve beings to open to relieve pressure to allow the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> to rise. In essence, the control valve modulates to maintain the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> {{in the middle of}} the horizontal pipe. With a large gas/liquid interface area, thin gas-bearing emulsion layer and quiescent flow in the horizontal pipe, all contribute to the final removal of free gas bubbles from the liquid stream.

Shewhart control charts {{were used to assess}} the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> sensing capacity and reliability of the mobile CO 2 -laser engraved LPFG sensor. There were ten groups of different <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> experiment and each group underwent ten repeated wavelength shift measurements. The results showed that all measurands were within the control limits; thus, this mobile sensor was reliable and exhibited at least 100 -cm <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> measurement capacity. In addition, a reflective sensor consisting of five LPFGs in series with a reflective end has been developed to evaluate the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> and fluid-flow velocity. These five LPFGs were fabricated by the electrical arc discharge method and the reflective end was coated with silver by Tollen’s test. After each <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> experiment was performed five times, the average values of the resonance wavelength shifts for LPFG Nos. 1 – 5 were in the range of 1. 35 – 9. 14 nm. The experimental findings showed that the reflective sensor could be used to automatically monitor five fixed <b>liquid</b> <b>levels.</b> This reflective sensor also exhibited at least 100 -cm <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> measurement capacity. The mechanism of the fluid-flow velocity sensor was based on analyzing the relationship among the optical power, time, and the LPFG’s length. There were two types of fluid-flow velocity measurements: inflow and drainage processes.
