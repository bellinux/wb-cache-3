Optimizing the timing of defibrillation by predicting the possibility of successful electric shock can guide treatments between defibrillation and {{cardiopulmonary resuscitation}} and improve the rate of restoration of spontaneous circulation. Numerous methods have been proposed for predicting defibrillation success based on quantification of the ventricular fibrillation waveform during past decades.

Such information would be useful for "dosing" daily steps in clinical practice. This study aimed to quantify decrements in blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin (A 1 C) per 1, 000 daily <b>step</b> <b>increments.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two hundred and one subjects with type 2 diabetes underwent assessments of step counts (pedometer-measured), blood pressure, A 1 C and anthropometric parameters. Due to missing data, the final analysis was conducted on 83 women and 102 men, {{with a mean age}} of 60 years. Associations of daily steps with blood pressure and A 1 C were evaluated using sex-specific multivariate linear regression models (adjusted for age, ethnicity, and BMI). Potential sex differences were confirmed in a combined model (women and men) with interaction terms. Mean values for daily steps, blood pressure, A 1 C and BMI were 5, 357 steps/day; 137 / 80 mm Hg; 7. 7 % and 30. 4 kg/m(2) respectively. A 1, 000 daily <b>step</b> <b>increment</b> among women was associated with a - 2. 6 (95 % CI: - 4. 1 to - 1. 1) mm Hg change in systolic and a - 1. 4 (95 % CI: - 2. 2 to - 0. 6) mm Hg change in diastolic blood pressure.

Step counts and A 1 C did not demonstrate clinically important associations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A 1, 000 steps/day increment is associated with important blood pressure decrements among women with type 2 diabetes but the data were inconclusive among men. Targeted "dose increments" of 1, 000 steps/day in women may lead to measurable blood pressure reductions. This information may be of potential use in the titration or "dosing" of daily steps.

With the movement of abrasive grains, a long-range repulsive interaction is found between the outermost copper atoms and Si, C atoms (SiC). The copper atoms in the workpiece begin to get kinetic energy and move. When the silicon carbide particles contact the single crystal of copper, the atomic temperature of the contacting region increases which rises the atomic thermal motion. When the cutting is stable, the kinetic energy of the copper atoms in the material convey and transform in a dynamic equilibrium pattern, and the kinetic energy of the atoms fluctuates in a high range.|$|R
