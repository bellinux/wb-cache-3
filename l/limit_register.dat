50|$|Both the 1900 {{series and}} System/360 {{provided}} hardware support for multi-programming. On the 1900 all user memory addresses were modified by a datum (base address) register and checked against a <b>limit</b> <b>register,</b> preventing one program interfering with another. The System/360 gave each process and every 2048 byte block of memory a four-bit key, {{and if a}} process key did not match the memory block key an exception would result. The 1900 system required programs to occupy a contiguous area of memory but allowed processes to be relocated during execution, simplifying {{the work of the}} operating system. The 1900 also allowed any process direct access to the first 4096 words of its address space. (Both the 1900 and 360 had a 12-bit operand field, but on the 360 addresses were physical addresses so a program could directly access the first 4096 bytes of physical memory).|$|E
