40|$|A {{new draft}} {{standard}} (ISO/DIS 12567) {{for measuring the}} {{coefficient of thermal conductivity}} of windows (the U value) has been under discussion for several years, and is now approaching the stage of introduction and application. It will be voted on by ISO and CEN in parallel. Comparison tests between the results obtained by different hotbox arrangements can be arranged in order to obtain practical experience. The new method will include procedures for the following (and other) aspects: " the production of calibration panels " calibration of the hotbox " determination of surface thermal resistance in the hotbox " determination of the thermal resistance of windows. A round robin calibration within the Nordic countries has therefore been arranged, in order to obtain experience and knowledge of the various elements of ISO/DIS 12567. Using common instructions, the laboratories have each manufactured and determined the thermal resistance of two calibration panels, after which the various hotboxes have been calibrated. Two different types of windows were used as the test items: a basic double glazed wooden casement window with a U value of about 2. 5 W/(m²K), and a <b>linked</b> <b>casement</b> triple glazed window having two low emission coated surfaces, with a U value of about 1. 2 W/(m²K). All the participating laboratories were sent one window of each type. Before the windows were sent out, SP measured the U values of all of them, from which it could be ascertained that the differences between nominally identical windows were very small. The laboratories reported that they measured U values in the range 2. 4 2. 7 W/(m²K) for the Type A windows, and 1. 1 1. 2 W/(m²K) for the Type B windows. This indicates that the measured values are respectively 2. 55 ± 5 % and 1. 15 ± 5 %...|$|E
40|$|In 1907 {{some time}} after Roger Casement's {{conversion}} to Irish nationalism, he reflected on the shift in his allegiance, {{in a letter to}} Alice Stopford Green: I had accepted Imperialism - British rule was to be extended at all costs, because it was the best for everyone under the sun, and those who opposed that extension ought rightly to be "smashed" [...] . Well the [Boer] War gave me qualms at the end - the concentration camps bigger ones - and finally when up in those lonely Congo forests where I found Leopold I found also myself - the incorrigible Irishman!' In that statement, <b>Casement</b> <b>linked</b> his growing anti-imperialism to his Irishness. In this paper I wish to examine three themes which also show the interrelatedness of Casement's wider experiences with his Irishness and which I believe to be important in summing up key patterns of thinking and action in his life: land and agriculture, the defence of the underdog, and a critique of empire. Each theme has roots in his youth, draws on his later Irish experience, and was affected and developed by his experiences outside Ireland...|$|R
