50|$|There are wooded {{areas of}} {{broad-leaved}} and coniferous trees including mature beech. These areas support a woodland flora such as ivy broomrape, <b>white</b> <b>helleborine</b> and greater butterfly-orchid.|$|R
5000|$|It {{contains}} the largest population in Britain of Sword-leaved Helleborine (Cephalanthera longifolia), {{with more than}} 2000 plants, [...] {{as well as other}} orchids includes <b>White</b> <b>Helleborine,</b> Bird's-nest Orchid and Fly Orchid.|$|R
50|$|This former {{gravel pit}} has been {{partially}} filled in to become flower-rich chalk grassland. Plants include knotted hedge-parsley, common poppy and great pignut. Mature beech trees provide a habitat for the <b>white</b> <b>helleborine</b> orchid.|$|R
50|$|The wood is {{particularly}} {{known for its}} bluebells during April and May. Its flora also includes wood anemone, wood sorrel and several species of orchid, including bird's-nest orchids and <b>white</b> <b>helleborine.</b> It is home to tawny owls.|$|R
50|$|The site is mature beech woodland, {{planted in}} the nineteenth century, and ground flora {{includes}} many <b>white</b> <b>helleborine</b> orchids. It has deer and many species of birds. It was the Trust's first reserve, donated by Mr Fordham of Letchworth in 1964.|$|R
50|$|The <b>White</b> <b>Helleborine</b> (Cephalanthera damasonium) is {{a species}} of orchid. It is {{widespread}} across much of Europe and the Middle East from England and Sweden to Russia and Iran; also Bhutan, India, Myanmar and Yunnan. It is the type species of the genus Cephalanthera.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the ground}} flora largely {{consists}} of ivy (Hedera helix) and sanicle (Sanicula europaea), {{there are several}} other species present, including three scarce orchids: bird's-nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), <b>white</b> <b>helleborine</b> (Cephalanthera damasonium), fly orchid (Ophrys insectifera), greater butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and sword-leaved helleborine (Cephalanthera longifolia).|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers of}} this species hardly open, because they are autogamous (self-pollinating). Before anthesis, {{the opening of the}} flower, the anther opens and the pollinia {{directly}} sink onto the stigmatic surface. Then pollen tubes start growing. This pollination mode enables the <b>White</b> <b>helleborine</b> to grow in deep shade, where the pollinators are almost absent.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 80% of {{the tree}} canopy is beech and is managed for timber. Other trees present are ash and whitebeam. Holly, yew and hazel, and {{regenerating}} beech and ash, form the scrub layer. Bramble and sweet woodruff are present and rare plants such as <b>white</b> <b>helleborine,</b> broad-leaved helleborine, columbine and common wintergreen. Woodland flora also includes lesser periwinkle, bluebell, yellow archangel and early purple orchid.|$|R
5000|$|Several of the European {{species have}} common names {{including}} the word [...] "helleborine", but this name does {{not correspond to}} any modern taxon, and orchids in other genera are also called helleborines.

5000|$|Mainly beeches {{and silver}} firs {{grow in the}} deep and damp soil and form a dense canopy [...] For this reason, low {{shrubbery}} is almost entirely absent and only shade tolerant plants like enchanter's-nightshade, arum and woodruff grow there. The {{major part of the}} forest stands on dry and nutrient-poor soil. Durmast oak, field maple and whitebeam, as well as the non-local conifer scots pine are to be found here. In addition, pinnate coralroot, dog's mercury, as well as carex and various orchids, for example bird's-nest orchid and red and <b>white</b> <b>helleborine</b> grow here. Oak and hornbeam forests grow in some places. Ash-alder communities dominate the headwater regions.|$|R
50|$|Queendown has {{the usual}} plants of chalk grassland, and orchids are well represented, {{particularly}} the fragrant orchid, with scattered groups of early spider, bee and man orchids. Later {{in the year}} autumn lady's-tresses may be found. A good variety of chalk grassland butterflies {{can be seen in}} summer, including the Adonis Blue, re-introduced in 2002. At the bottom of the bank, there is a colony of rabbits which, together with grazing cattle, help to maintain the short sward, essential for the maintenance of many orchid populations. The West Bank has several patches of fly orchid and <b>white</b> <b>helleborine</b> in the scrub and woodland edges. Some particularly good examples of the many large beech trees on the reserve can be seen in this section.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the synanthropic flora located in the surroundings of the Brno Reservoir, which is situated on the northwestern outskirts of Brno. This thesis provides an insight into the findings of plants occurring in the studied area based on literature excerpts and data taken from major botanical databases. The thesis also includes a floristic survey, whose results will be added into the database of a project aimed at mapping of the Brno flora. The territory was defined by two squares of network mapping (6765 CAa, 6765 CAc). The total number of found plant species, whose occurrence has not been confirmed in this territory yet, was 306. The occurrence of Snowdrop Anemone (Anemone sylvestris), <b>White</b> <b>Helleborine</b> (Cephalanthera damasonium) and Burr Chervil (Anthriscus caucalis) can be counted {{among the most important}} findings. The results in the form of lists of found plants serve for better knowledge of the flora located at the Brno Reservoir...|$|R

40|$|Estrogen has an {{important}} function in swine reproduction and growth. A Pvu II restriction enzyme polymorphism has been proven to be {{an important}} genetic variation in the estrogen receptor gene (ESR) and may be considered as a candidate gene for use in pig production but there is no data regarding the prevalence of this polymorphism in the Brazilian pig population. We used DNA samples from the following three purebred pig breeds: <b>Large</b> <b>White</b> (336 females and 26 males), Landrace (304 females and 27 males) and Pietrain (125 females and 11 males). The ESR genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP.

In the <b>Large</b> <b>White</b> breed, but not the other breeds, the ESR genotype was significantly (p < 0. 05) associated to LS, DWG and BT. <b>Large</b> <b>Whites</b> genotyped as AA or AB had higher EPD values for the LS and BT traits compared to BB <b>Large</b> <b>Whites,</b> while AA <b>Large</b> <b>Whites</b> had higher DWG EPD values than BB <b>Large</b> <b>Whites.</b> Our results for the <b>Large</b> <b>White</b> population showed that the A allele has a beneficial effect on LS, DWG and BT expected progeny differences...|$|R
