5|$|During Resident Evil 5, Redfield {{discovers that}} Valentine {{is alive and}} goes in search of her. Wesker has {{attached}} a mind-control device to Valentine's chest, which makes her fight Redfield and his new partner, Sheva Alomar, a <b>local</b> <b>agent.</b> Valentine knows that she is doing this but is barely able to stop herself, although she has enough control to open her jumpsuit so that Alomar and Redfield can see the device. Alomar pulls it off and Valentine is freed from Wesker's control. She urges Alomar and Redfield to continue with their mission to stop Wesker. The DLC episode Desperate Escape describes Valentine's escape to safety {{with the help of}} another local BSAA agent, Josh Stone.|$|E

40|$|We {{formulate}} {{and analyze}} a multi-agent {{model for the}} evolution of individual and systemic risk in which the <b>local</b> <b>agents</b> interact with each other through a central agent who, in turn, is influenced by the mean field of the <b>local</b> <b>agents.</b> The central agent is stabilized by a bistable potential, the only stabilizing force in the system. The <b>local</b> <b>agents</b> derive their stability only from the central agent. In the mean field limit {{of a large number of}} <b>local</b> <b>agents</b> we show that the systemic risk decreases when the strength of the interaction of the <b>local</b> <b>agents</b> with the central agent increases. This means that the probability of transition from one of the two stable quasi-equilibria to the other one decreases. We also show that the systemic risk increases when the strength of the interaction of the central agent with the mean field of the <b>local</b> <b>agents</b> increases. Following the financial interpretation of such models and their behavior given in our previous paper (Garnier, Papanicolaou and Yang, SIAM J. Fin. Math. 4, 2013, 151 - 184), we may interpret the results of this paper in the following way. From the point of view of systemic risk, and while keeping the perceived risk of the <b>local</b> <b>agents</b> approximately constant, it is better to strengthen the interaction of the <b>local</b> <b>agents</b> with the central agent than the other way around...|$|R
30|$|The {{resource}} allocation algorithm proposed {{in this work}} relies on a market-based control technique [18]. This technique proposes the interaction of <b>local</b> <b>agents,</b> which we call NIRA (Network Interface Resource Allocation) agents, through which a coherent global behavior is achieved [19]. A simple trading mechanism is used between those <b>local</b> <b>agents,</b> {{in order to meet}} the required global objectives. In our case, the <b>local</b> <b>agents</b> are autonomous identical hardware distributed across the NIs of the PEs. The hardware agents exchange minimal data between NIs, to dynamically adjust the dataflow between PEs, in an effort to achieve better overall performance through load balancing.|$|R

It identi?es four broad contexts of language planning activity in which <b>local</b> <b>agents</b> work: the <b>local</b> implementation of macro-level policy, contestation of macro-level policy, addressing local needs {{in the absence of}} macro-level policy and opening new possibilities for developing multilingualism. These contexts provide a way of framing the contribution that micro language planning work and <b>local</b> <b>agents</b> can make to multilingual education. No Full Tex...|$|R

As with the body they had constructed for the Walker electric bus, their design for the trolley buses was influenced by their experience as tram builders, giving the vehicles a rather utilitarian appearance.

25|$|The {{struggle}} with the Bahamas began in earnest in 1766, when the King's representative in the Bahamas, Mr Symmer, on his own authority, wrote a constitution which legislated for and taxed the Bermudians on the Turks. The Secretary of State, Lord Hillsborough, for the Crown, issued orders that the Bermudian activities on the Turks should not be obstructed or restrained in any way. As {{a result of this}} order, Symmer's constitution was dissolved. The Bermudians on the Turks appointed commissioners to govern themselves, with the assent of the King's <b>local</b> <b>agent.</b> They drew up regulations for good government, but the Bahamian governor, William Shirley, drew up his own regulations for the Turks and ordered that no one might work at salt raking who had not signed assent to his regulations.|$|E
25|$|In Bend, Overturf found a {{job with}} of the Pilot Butte Development Company. This was the company that had laid out the town of Bend. Within a year, he became the company’s on-site manager and {{assistant}} corporate secretary. Overturf remained in that position until 1910 when the company was liquidated. On 25 October of that year, Overturf married Ruth Reid. She had arrived in Bend in 1903 and was the town’s first public school teacher. In 1911, he joined two partners to found the Overturf-Davis-Miller Company, a construction supply business. Overturf became the company president. Bend was growing quickly, so his building supply business was very successful. Overturf left the business in 1913 when he became the <b>local</b> <b>agent</b> for the Western Loan and Building Company, a real estate and mortgage business with its headquarters in Salt Lake City.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} recruit migrant {{domestic}} workers, Lebanese recruitment agencies collaborate with {{agencies in the}} migrant sending countries. Migrant domestic workers are required to pay a fee to the <b>local</b> <b>agent</b> in their home country, usually a large sum of money which causes them to incur a large debt. Once the fee transaction is complete the agency arranges the transportation. The employer is obliged to meet the migrant worker at the airport gate where a general security guard who holds the employee's passport will hand it over directly to the employer. A medical examination and the resulting report must be fulfilled before the work permit is issued and the insurance for the worker must be paid by the employer within three months. A standard unified contract is drawn up which is more in favour of the employer than the migrant worker.|$|E

25|$|On June 4, 1891 at Anadarko, the Agreement {{with the}} Wichita and Affiliated Bands (1891) ceded their surplus land, with Congress setting the price per acre. Allotments were , and {{limited to a}} total 1,060 allotments. Each allotments in excess of that amount was to reduce the total amount Congress {{approved}} for payment of the surplus land.

25|$|At {{the seat}} of {{government}} of the Sac and Fox Nation, the tribe signed the Agreement with the Sauk and Fox (1890) on June 12, 1890 to cede their land in return for $485,000 (slightly over $1 per acre). $300,000 of the total payment was {{to be placed in}} the United States Treasury, $5,000 to be paid to the local Indian agent to be expended {{under the direction of the}} National Council of the Sac and Fox, and the remaining $180,000 to be paid per capita within three months of Congressional ratification of the agreement. The allotments were to be selected by the individual tribal members within four months of allotting agents arriving to begin the process. If any member failed to make the selection within that time frame, the selection would be made for them by the <b>local</b> <b>agent.</b> The number of allotments was limited to 528, and any allotment over that limit would result in $200 per excess allotment being deducted from the $485,000.

2500|$|Storms third patrol was a {{so-called}} [...] "cloak-and-dagger" [...] operation, {{to land a}} <b>local</b> <b>agent</b> on an island off {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. This ended in failure when men in an inflatable dinghy sent out to retrieve the agent from the island heard him calling from the shore at night. His voice was coming from the wrong location, and sounded strained: the dinghy retreated and Japanese machine guns opened up. The dinghy occupants made it safely back to the submarine, but the fate of the agent was unknown. The fourth patrol was back to the Malacca Straits and a third victim was sunk by torpedo; this time a Japanese submarine-chaser. A subsequent patrol led to the taking of Japanese prisoners who were brought back to Trincomalee, the first such captures of the war.|$|E

The Colorado Territory campaign resulted in the Sand Creek Massacre, in which the hostile militia killed an estimated 70-163 friendly Cheyenne men, women and children, who had camped in an area suggested by the previous commander of Fort Lyon as a safe place and flying an American flag to show their peaceful intentions. Outraged by his association with the massacre, the Cheyenne banned Beckwourth from trading with them. [...] Well into his 60s by then, Beckwourth {{returned to}} trapping.
