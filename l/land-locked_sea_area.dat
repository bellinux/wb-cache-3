40|$|From the Oligocene onwards, {{the complex}} tectonic {{evolution}} of the Africa–Eurasia collision zone led to paleogeographic and biogeographic differentiation of the Mediterranean and Paratethys, two almost <b>land-locked</b> <b>seas,</b> in the <b>area</b> formerly occupied by the western Tethys Ocean. Episodic isolation of the basins triggered strong faunal endemism leading {{to the introduction of}} regional stratigraphic stages for the Paratethys. Chronostratigraphic control on the Paratethys stages remains rudimentary compared to the cyclostratigraphically constrained Mediterranean stages. This lack of chronostratigraphic control restricts the insight in the timing of geodynamic, climatic, and paleobiogeographic events and thereby hinders the identification of their causes and effects. In this paper, we here derive better age constraints on the Badenian, Sarmatian and Pannonian CentralParatethys regional stages through integrated 40 Ar/ 39 Ar, magnetostratigraphic, and biostratigraphic research in the TransylvanianBasin. The obtained results help to clarify the regions MiddleMiocene geodynamic and paleobiogeographic evolution. Six new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages were determined for tuffs intercalating with the generally deep marine basin infill. Together with data from previous studies, there is now a total of 9 radio-isotopically dated horizons in the basin. These were traced along seismic lines into a synthetic seismic stratigraphic column in the basin center and serve as first order tie-points to the astronomically tuned Neogene timescale (ATNTS). Paleomagnetically investigated sections were treated similarly and their polarity in general corroborates the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar results. The integrated radio-isotopic and magnetostratigraphic results provide an improved high-resolution time-frame for the sedimentary infill of the TransylvanianBasin. Early Badenian deep water sedimentation is characterized by accumulation of the Dej Tuff Complex in response to a period of intensive volcanism, the onset of which is constrained between the first occurrence (FO) of Orbulina suturalis at 14. 56 Ma and 14. 38 ± 0. 06 Ma. During the subsequent Badenian Salinity Crisis (BSC) up to 300 m of salt accumulate in the basin center. The faunal turnover that marks the Badenian–Sarmatian Boundary is dated at 12. 80 ± 0. 05 Ma. A second phase of intense volcanism occurs at 12. 4 Ma and leads to deposition of the middle Sarmatian tuff complex (Ghiriş, Hădăreni, Turda and Câmpia Turzii tuffs). Rates of sediment accumulation strongly diminish in the basin center {{at the onset of the}} Pannonian stage coincident with an approximately 20 ° CW tectonic rotation of the Tisza–Daciaplate. Concurrent enhanced uplift in the Eastern a'nd Southern Carpathians leads to the isolation of the CentralParatethys and triggers the transition from marine to freshwater conditions. An additional Pannonian to post-Pannonian 6 ° of CW rotation is related to the creation of antiform geometries in the Eastern Carpathians which are notably larger in the north than in the south. An 8. 4 Ma age is determined for the uppermost Pannonian sediments preserved in the central part of the TransylvanianBasin. Two sections belonging to middle Pannonian Zone D, and the lower part of Zone E (Subzone E 1) are found to cover the 10. 6 – 9. 9 Ma time-interva...|$|R
