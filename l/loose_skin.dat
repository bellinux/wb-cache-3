5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its <b>loose</b> <b>skin</b> and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|Menkes {{patients}} exhibit severe neurological abnormalities, apparently due to {{the lack}} of several copper-dependent enzymes required for brain development, including reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity. The brittle, kinky hypopigmented hair of steely appearance is due to a deficiency in an unidentified cuproenzyme. Reduced lysyl oxidase activity results in defective collagen and elastin polymerization and corresponding connective-tissue abnormalities including aortic aneurisms, <b>loose</b> <b>skin,</b> and fragile bones.|$|E
25|$|Due to the Scarlet Witch's depowering of 90% of Earth's mutants, the Blob {{is one of}} the {{thousands}} to lose their power, though his epidermis does not shrink to compensate for his loss of mass, leaving him with huge folds of <b>loose</b> <b>skin.</b> The depressed Blob attempts to commit suicide, but his skin folds prevent him from cutting through to any major blood vessels on his throat or wrists.|$|E
50|$|Mole-rats have {{cylindrical}} {{bodies with}} short limbs adapted to activities inside their tunnels. Their <b>loose</b> <b>skins</b> and dense fur assist in negotiating small spaces. They can practically somersault within their <b>loose</b> <b>skins.</b> Their hairy cheeks can close behind the incisors to keep dirt and soil from the throat while they dig. In digging they loosen soil with the incisors, then use their feet {{to pass the}} loosened soil back beneath the body. When the mole-rat has accumulated a suitable batch of loose earth, it reverses to push the soil out of the tunnel.|$|R
50|$|Chana dal is {{produced}} by removing the outer layer of black chickpeas and then splitting the kernel. Although machines can do this, {{it can be done}} at home by soaking the whole chickpeas and removing the <b>loose</b> <b>skins</b> by rubbing. In Karnataka it is called kadle bele. Other varieties of chickpea may be used, e.g., kabuli dal.|$|R

25|$|Mulesing is {{different}} from crutching. Crutching is the mechanical removal of wool around the tail, anus (and vulva in ewes) in breeds of sheep with woolly points where this is necessary. Mulesing is the removal of skin to provide permanent resistance to breech strike in Merino sheep. Other breeds tend to have less <b>loose</b> <b>skin,</b> and wool, {{so close to the}} tail and may have less dense wool.|$|E
25|$|The large, long pendent ears {{serve to}} prevent wind from {{scattering}} nearby skin cells while the dog's nose {{is on the}} ground; the folds of wrinkled flesh under the lips and neck—called the shawl—serve to catch stray scent particles in the air or on a nearby branch as the bloodhound is scenting, reinforcing the scent in the dog's memory and nose. However, not all agree that the long ears and <b>loose</b> <b>skin</b> are functional, some regarding them as a handicap.|$|E
25|$|Horse-coat (unusual but regaining ground), rough to the touch, {{extremely}} prickly and off-standing, soft in {{one direction}} and harsh in the other; Brush-coat, with longer hair and a smoother feel; and Bear-coat (rare, and not recognized by the AKC; Bearcoats are due to the addition of other breeds). Examples of the breed were owned by the peasant class, and were used for working dogs and fighting due to their <b>loose</b> <b>skin.</b> Shar pei can be seen in Chinese art throughout history, and are considered {{to be one of the}} oldest dog breeds on earth.|$|E

25|$|The AKC {{standard}} {{has hardly}} been altered {{from the original}} of 1896, the principal change being that the colours, 'black and tan', 'red and tan', and 'tawny', have been renamed as 'black and tan', 'liver and tan', and 'red', but the British KC has made considerable changes. Some of these were simply matters of presentation and did not affect content. However, responding {{to the view that}} the requirements of some breed standards were potentially detrimental to the health or well-being of the animal, changes have been made affecting the required eye shape and the <b>loose</b> <b>skin,</b> the most recent revision being 2008-9.|$|E
25|$|The Shar Pei's <b>loose</b> <b>skin</b> and {{extremely}} prickly coat were originally developed {{to help the}} dogs fend off wild boar, as {{they were used to}} hunt. Later, the breed was used for dog fighting; these enhanced traits made the Shar Pei difficult for its opponent to grab and hold on to, and so that if it did manage to hold on, the Shar Pei would still have room to maneuver and bite back; when grabbed by any loose wrinkle, a Shar Pei can actually twist in their skin and face in their opponent's direction. In fighting, they would twist in their skin to bite the assailant back.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} {{improvements}} and operation results of lower lid blepharoplasty for patients {{of different ages}} and eyelids. METHODS:Sixty-seven patients(67 eyes) received the lower lid blepharoplasty from May 2010 to May 2015 in our hospital were selected. The patients were classified according {{to the type of}} eyelids. They received the different improved operations: 12 eyes in group A with bulging fat adopted the trans-conjunctival approach; all the other patients adopted the trans-cutaneous approach. Nineteen eyes in group B with loosing orbicularis oculi muscle and/or <b>loosing</b> <b>skin</b> were required to remove the lower eyelid skin and orbicularis oculi muscle; 13 eyes in group C with <b>loosing</b> <b>skin</b> and bulging orbital fat and 23 eyes in group D with combined cases were both required to remove the orbital fat, skin and orbicularis oculi muscle. RESULTS:After 5 d of operation, the stitches were taken; the patients were visited for 3 - 6 mo after treatment. The excellent rates of surgery in the four groups were 100 %, 95 %, 100 % and 96 %(P > 0. 05). The appearance of lower eyelid was flat; the bulging orbital fat was disappeared; the skin incision had no scar; there was 1 eye with mild ectropion, 2 eyes with sunken inferior orbital margin and 4 eyes with poor aligned incision, which were all recovered after 2 mo of treatment. There were no serious complications like collapsed lower eyelid, strabismus, ambiopia, shrinks of lower eyelid, etc. The postoperative complication rates of the four groups were 8 %, 11 %, 8 % and 13 %, respectively(P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION:The improved lower lid blepharoplasty has a favorable effect for different types of eyelids...|$|R
50|$|De Barsy {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Symptoms include cutis laxa (<b>loose</b> hanging <b>skin)</b> {{as well as other}} eye, musculoskeletal, and neurological abnormalities. It is usually progressive, manifesting side effects that can include clouded corneas, cataracts, short stature, dystonia, or progeria (premature aging).|$|R
2500|$|Though much {{progress}} has been accomplished {{in the study of}} chronic wounds lately, advances in the study of their healing have lagged behind expectations. [...] This is partly because animal studies are difficult because animals do not get chronic wounds, since they usually have <b>loose</b> <b>skin</b> that quickly contracts, and they normally do not get old enough or have contributing diseases such as neuropathy or chronic debilitating illnesses. [...] Nonetheless, current researchers now understand some of the major factors that lead to chronic wounds, among which are ischemia, reperfusion injury, and bacterial colonization.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 January, the Kennel Club {{released}} the revised breed standards, which will [...] "not include {{anything that could}} in any way be interpreted as encouraging features that might prevent a dog from breathing, walking and seeing freely". [...] "This will help to prevent the practice of exaggeration, where features that {{are perceived to be}} desirable, such as a short muzzle or <b>loose</b> <b>skin,</b> are made more prominent by breeders, and which can have detrimental effects on a dog’s health." [...] Rules to ban close inbreeding (parent/child and sibling/sibling) would take effect 1 March 2009. Show rules have been changed to state [...] "more clearly than ever" [...] that judges should only [...] "reward those dogs that are healthy representatives of their breed". Judges will also have the authority to eject unhealthy dogs from competitions. A Club spokesman said that the changes would take [...] "several generations, to have an effect".|$|E
2500|$|Skin {{diseases}} are {{very common in}} dogs. [...] Atopy, a chronic allergic condition, is thought to affect up to 10 percent of dogs. [...] Other skin diseases related to allergies include hot spots and pyoderma, both characterized by secondary bacterial infections, food allergy, ear infections, and flea allergy dermatitis. [...] Canine follicular dysplasia is an inherited disorder of the hair follicles resulting in alopecia (baldness). [...] Mange is an infectious skin disease caused by mites. [...] Endocrine diseases such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome can also manifest as skin problems like alopecia or recurring bacterial infections. Another class of integumentary malady is hygromas, a swelling typically {{on or near the}} elbow joint. Nutrition may also play a role in skin disease, as deficiencies in certain nutrients may result in scaling, redness, oiling, balding, and/or itching of the skin. Some nutrients that are particularly important to maintain healthy levels of for skin benefits include: vitamin A and B, essential faty acids, zinc, and proteins. Physical elements of certain dog breeds also affect susceptibility of individuals to skin problems. For instance, skin-fold dermatitis is a skin infection commonly found in breeds such as the bulldog, due to their excess amounts of <b>loose</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E

50|$|Acrochordus javanicus is {{an ambush}} {{predator}} that likes to capture fishes and amphibians. It usually catch its preys by folding firmly its body around it.

The cloacal opening in both sexes has an usual ventrally deflected position and is surrounded by deep skin folds; the functional significance of this remains unknown.|$|R
2500|$|Follow {{through and}} {{overlapping}} {{action is a}} general heading for two closely related techniques which help to render movement more realistically, and help {{to give the impression}} that characters follow the laws of physics, including the principle of inertia. [...] "Follow through" [...] means that loosely tied parts of a body should continue moving after the character has stopped and the parts should keep moving beyond the point where the character stopped only to be subsequently [...] "pulled back" [...] towards the center of mass and/or exhibiting various degrees of oscillation damping. [...] "Overlapping action" [...] is the tendency for parts of the body to move at different rates (an arm will move on different timing of the head and so on). A third, related technique is [...] "drag", where a character starts to move and parts of him take a few frames to catch up. These parts can be inanimate objects like clothing or the antenna on a car, or parts of the body, such as arms or hair. On the human body, the torso is the core, with arms, legs, head and hair appendices that normally follow the torso's movement. Body parts with much tissue, such as large stomachs and breasts, or the <b>loose</b> <b>skin</b> on a dog, are more prone to independent movement than bonier body parts. Again, exaggerated use of the technique can produce a comical effect, while more realistic animation must time the actions exactly, to produce a convincing result.|$|E
