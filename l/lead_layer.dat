In order to assess the polychromy and the gilding areas a preliminary analysis for the identification of elemental chemical composition of pigment traces by using a non-invasive application of a portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer was carried out. In some areas ambiguous results were obtained and therefore a subsequent stratigraphic examination was necessary to avoid any misinterpreting about the pigment layer stratigraphy. For this reason a successive non-invasive sampling was carried out and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) observations of cross sections as well as infrared spectrophotometric measurements were made. The results obtained showed on the ground areas of the left part of the relief the presence of blue pigments azurite-based containing a protein binding medium partially transformed into calcium oxalate.

Materials such as lithium and lithium-lead eutectics have' been strong candidates as the breeder/coolant in current blanket designs. The {{concern over the}} chemical reactivity between liquid lithium-lead with water and air has triggered much research into lithium-lead interactions. The computer code, LITFIRE, was executed and found to reasonably predict that a quiescent pool of Li 7 Pb 8 : will not react with air. A study into the effects of agitated pool conditions revealed that without {{the formation of a}} protective <b>lead</b> <b>layer,</b> Li 1 7 Pb 3 will react with air. Varying the surface area to spill mass, AIM, ratio resulted in the prediction of a largest maximum Lil 7 Pb 83 pool temperature at approximately 30 (w'). With both increasing and decreasing values of AIM, the maximum pool temperature was found to decrease in magnitude. A model of liquid lithium-lead/water reactions was developed for an instan-taneous water coolant tube rupture into a lithium-lead breeder. Using the newly developed FLision Llthium Breeder interaction code, FULIB- 2, two different geometries were studied. Calculation of the Reaction Zone temperature and pressure in both systems showed that the lithium-lead/water interaction leads to lower temperatures than the pure Li reaction, but that the generated pressure pulse is higher than the lithium case.

Experimentally deformed physical rock models are used {{to examine the effects of}} changing mechanical stratigraphy and initial fault angle on the development of fault-propagation folds over a flat-ramp-flat thrust geometry. This study also investigates the scaling properties of the models to that of natural structures and processes. The model configurations used consist of a stratigraphic package that overlies a thrust fault that ramps upward from a basal detachment through a competent sandstone layer along a 20 or 30 degree precut ramp. Two different stratigraphic packages are used to show how the overlying stratigraphic sequence can affect the final geometry of the fault-propagation fold. One stratigraphic sequence contains a thick weak ductile layer that can undergo large thickness changes by shearing (lead is used to simulate a shale) and an overlying limestone layer that maintains constant thickness during deformation. The second stratigraphic sequence replaces the <b>lead</b> <b>layer</b> with a weak brittle layer that deforms by faulting and fracturing (dried pottery clay simulates an interbedded siliciclastic unit). The models were deformed in a triaxial deformation rig at confining pressure of 50 Mpa at room temperature. Each model formed a fault-propagation fold with an associated footwall syncline in the footwall of the fault and hanging wall anticline. The layers within the footwall syncline exhibit steeply dipping to overturned beds. The hanging wall anticline has an asymmetric geometry with a steeply dipping forelimb and a gently dipping backlimb. Although the preceding description applies to both the lead and clay models, the mechanical responses and resulting fault-propagation fold geometries between the two stratigraphies are strikingly different. In the lead models, the thick ductile lead unit absorbs a large amount of fault displacement and promotes folding in the overlying competent unit. In the clay models, the clay absorbs limited amounts of fault displacement and has a tendency to localize strain, which results in macroscopic faulting within the clay layer. The clay transmits the associated stresses and faulting to the overlying limestone unit, which develops a forelimb thrust. The models are then compared/contrasted to natural examples...|$|E
