5|$|The {{species was}} {{discovered}} in 2005 and formally described in 2008 {{by a team of}} herpetologists led by Joseph R. Mendelson III.

Despite the efforts of several conservation teams, captive breeding programs all failed. The <b>last</b> <b>known</b> female of the species died in 2009. It was survived by two other individuals, both males. On February 17, 2012, one of the two was euthanized at Zoo Atlanta in Georgia due to failing health.
