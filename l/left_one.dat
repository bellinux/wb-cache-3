5|$|According to Diodorus and Plutarch, Theramenes participated {{under the}} command of Alcibiades to the siege of Byzantium (408 BC), winning the battle against the peloponnesiac army that was {{appointed}} to defend that city: Alcibiades was in command of the right wing, while Theramenes {{was in charge of the}} <b>left</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bronze {{vessels are}} made and placed one above the other at {{different}} levels; they are filled with pure water. Each has at the bottom a small opening {{in the form of}} a 'jade dragon's neck'. The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the <b>left</b> <b>one</b> being for the night and the right one for the day. On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.|$|E

5|$|Larkin {{had asked}} {{on his deathbed}} that his diaries be destroyed. The request was granted by Jones, the main {{beneficiary}} of his will, and Betty Mackereth; the latter shredded the unread diaries page by page, then had them burned. His will {{was found to be}} contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors, who decided the material should not be destroyed. When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in turn, <b>left</b> <b>one</b> million pounds to St Paul's Cathedral, Hexham Abbey, and Durham Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Of the season's six {{tropical}} cyclones, five became tropical {{storms and}} four strengthened into hurricanes. Furthermore, {{none of these}} strengthened into a major hurricane—Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale—marking the seventh such occurrence since 1900. The strongest hurricane of the season peaked as only as a strong Category2 with winds of 110mph (175 km/h). The second hurricane caused one death and $1.45million (1920USD) in damage in Louisiana, the third <b>left</b> <b>one</b> fatality in North Carolina, and the fifth storm indirectly killed one person in Florida.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Arlene and its {{remnants}} produced {{hours of}} prolonged rainfall {{over much of}} northeastern and south-central Mexico. Widespread floods and landslides impacted multiple states, prompting evacuations and causing copious damage to property and infrastructure. At {{the height of the}} storm, about 285,000households lost power throughout Mexico, though service was quickly restored to 210,000homes. Schools remained closed in the morning throughout Hidalgo, as well as in parts of San Luis Potosí, Guerrero, Puebla, and Oaxaca. Throughout the country, Arlene resulted in 22 confirmed fatalities and <b>left</b> <b>one</b> person missing.|$|E

The game officials are a Probate Judge (dressed as a British judge, with wig), a Field Representative (in a Scottish kilt), a Head Cockswain (in long overcoat), and a Baggage Smasher (dressed as a male beachgoer in pre-World War I years).

2500|$|... {{devices are}} the lamps and reflectors {{that make a}} vehicle {{conspicuous}} and visible with respect to its presence, position, direction of travel, change in direction or deceleration. Such lamps may burn steadily, blink, or flash, depending on their intended and regulated function. Most must be fitted in pairs—one <b>left</b> and <b>one</b> right—though some vehicles have multiple pairs (such as two left and two right stop lamps) and/or redundant light sources (such as <b>one</b> <b>left</b> and <b>one</b> right stop lamp, each containing two bulbs).|$|R
5|$|Under each foreleg, the {{sea otter}} has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the <b>left</b> <b>one),</b> the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish.|$|E
5|$|In the men's tournament, Fiji secured {{their first}} Olympic medal with {{emphatic}} 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with big win over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau <b>left</b> <b>one</b> {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch and touch the ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood to show any compassion racking up a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players {{together for the first time}} on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series, where their results veered between the disappointing and disastrous, this season.|$|E
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also <b>left</b> <b>one</b> player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E

5|$|The 2009–10 season started poorly, {{with the}} club failing to pay bonuses to former players, as well as £250k owed to Bristol City for the {{transfer}} of Australian international Nick Carle twelve months before. The Football League placed a transfer embargo on the Eagles in early August, which was lifted {{near the end of}} that month. However, it was only another three weeks before a second embargo was put into effect, this time due to an unpaid portion of a transfer fee owed to Ipswich Town for Alan Lee. The financial problems came to a head at the end of January when the club was placed into administration by creditor Agilo Finance, and Brendan Guilfoyle took over the running of the club. Victor Moses departed for Wigan Athletic days later, and Neil Warnock <b>left</b> <b>one</b> month later to take over at Queens Park Rangers. Paul Hart was brought in on a temporary basis to keep the Eagles up, with Dougie Freedman and John Pemberton both returning to the club they played for as assistant and coach respectively. Before administration, the Eagles appeared to be building towards a run for the play-offs, but the ten-point deduction for going into administration turned the season into a battle against relegation. Survival was only achieved on the final day, with a memorable 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday, who went down to League One instead of Palace. Following the end of the season, Freedman took over as caretaker manager and the club emerged from administration owned by a consortium of wealthy fans, CPFC 2010.|$|E
