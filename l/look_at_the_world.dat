That is why stories of racism really disturb me. [...] Because in truth I believe ALL men are created equal, I was taught that and will always believe it. I just can’t conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance. Naked we come into the world and naked we shall go out. And a very good thing too, for it reminds me that I am naked under my shirt, whatever its color." ...|$|E
500|$|Stroheim favored [...] "Soviet-style" [...] montage editing. Greed often uses {{dramatic}} close-ups {{and cuts}} instead of long takes. One {{exception to this}} is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Stroheim also used symbolic cross-cutting for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss. In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called Stroheim a montage director, stating that [...] "each observation would be captured in a 'close-up' and at leisure, he would assemble his 'shots' in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact." [...] In the 1950s film critic André Bazin praised Stroheim's use of mise en scène and noted his [...] "one simple rule for directing. Take a close <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> keep on doing so {{and in the end}} it will lay bare for you all its cruelty and ugliness." ...|$|E

500|$|Anglin {{asserts that}} the purpose of The Daily Stormer is to provide [...] "a means to propagandize people … to get them to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in a certain way". Headlines include [...] "All Intelligent People in History Disliked Jews", and [...] "Adolf Hitler: The Most Lied About Man of All Time". The site bills itself as [...] "America's #1 Most-Trusted Republican News Source". According to The Jewish Chronicle, The Daily Stormer [...] "posts {{hundreds}} of racist articles targeting black people, Arabs and Jews". The website offers pro-separatist coverage of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, which Anglin considers [...] "the correct moral position". The SPLC described the site as [...] "the newest up and comer in the heated competition to rule the hate web", which [...] "has {{in the last six months}} [...] often topped the oldest and largest hate site on the web, Stormfront, in terms of reach and page views, based on Alexa data". Anglin claimed in May 2016 that the website's traffic had doubled over the last six months, peaking at 120,000 daily visitors. The website is part of the alt-right movement, and it calls itself [...] "The World’s Most Visited Alt-Right Website". As the movement made headlines in mid-2016, [...] "bolstered in part by the unexpected rise of Donald Trump and Britain's decision to leave the European Union", Anglin declared: [...] "We won the meme war; now we've taken over the GOP, and we did this very, very quickly." [...] Unlike other figures such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Anglin does not play down the extremist elements in the alt-right, stating that: [...] "The goal is to ethnically cleanse White nations of non-Whites and establish an authoritarian government. Many people also believe that the Jews should be exterminated".|$|E
500|$|While Yankovic's {{previous}} albums usually generated {{only one}} or two official music videos, Straight Outta Lynwood spawned nine, and the DualDisc release of the album included videos for all six original songs. Yankovic's record label had suggested he release a DualDisc, and he was in favor of the idea once he realized that he could hire animators to create videos for the original songs, {{in order to make the}} release more rewarding for fans who purchased it. At first, Yankovic was unsure who he would be able to hire, because of the budget, but to his surprise, many notable artists signed on. Bill Plympton animated a video for [...] "Don't Download This Song", which preceded the release of the album, and Thomas Lee, best known for his Flash music video [...] "Star Wars Gangsta Rap", animated a video for [...] "I'll Sue Ya". A music video for [...] "Virus Alert" [...] was helmed by David Lovelace, creator of Retarded Animal Babies; Yankovic admitted to exercising more creative control over this video than the others present on the DVD, citing concern with Lovelace's previous content. John Kricfalusi and Katie Rice animated a video for [...] "Close but No Cigar". Yankovic had long been a fan of Kricfalusi, who is perhaps best known as the creator of the cartoon series Ren & Stimpy. The video [...] "takes an irreverent <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of dating as seen thru [...] the eyes of Cigarettes the cat."

2500|$|Roxy Miéville appears {{with the}} couple, {{as well as}} with the unseen Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville at the end of the film. Godard and his {{long-term}} professional and romantic partner Miéville co-own Roxy, but no longer live together. During the film's production Godard would often talk about Miéville. Olivier Séguret of Libération observed that most of the film was shot in places Godard shared with Miéville in their personal life and that the dialogue between the two couples could be based on conversations between them. When interviewed by NPR, Bordwell interpreted the shots of Roxy as Godard [...] "trying to get people to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in a kind of an unspoiled way... There are hints throughout the film that animal consciousness is kind of closer to the world than we are, that language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there. And although the film is full of language, talk, printed text and so on, nevertheless I think there's a sense he wants the viewer to scrape away a lot of the ordinary conceptions we have about how we communicate and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> afresh." [...] Godard said that it was partially true that he sees the world through Roxy's eyes and that Roxy [...] "restores balance" [...] to the couple when they are in conflict and represent [...] "the commoners" [...] while the couple represents [...] "nobility" [...] or [...] "the clergy." [...] MacCabe wrote that Roxy [...] "offer an image of acceptable sociality" [...] in the film. In a scene with Roxy, a narrator talks about the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, which Brody calls [...] "Godard's one rare glimmer of historical optimism. It's as if Roxy were the agent of reconciliation—not of one merely lover to another but of Godard to the present day, to the rising generation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the album's critiques, [...] "Boys Keep Swinging", {{the first}} single, {{was seen by}} NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray partly as a witty riposte to the Village People but also, {{combined}} with its cross-dressing video clip, a comment on ideas of masculinity; musically it was notable for guitarist Carlos Alomar and drummer Dennis Davis in the unfamiliar roles of drummer and bass player, respectively. According to Tony Visconti, the song featured the [...] "exact same chord changes and structure, even the same key" [...] as [...] "Fantastic Voyage", Bowie's take {{on the possibility of}} nuclear war. The second single, [...] "DJ", took a sardonic <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of the disc jockey. [...] "Repetition", Bowie's exploration of the mind of an abusive partner, was sung in a deliberately unemotional tone that highlighted the lyric and the unnatural slur of the bass guitar.
