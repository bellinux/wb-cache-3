25|$|When {{the parties}} have not used express words, their {{intention}} may be inferred from the terms {{and nature of the}} contract, and from the general circumstances of the case. For example, a term granting the courts of a particular state exclusive jurisdiction over the contract would imply that the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> is to be the proper law (see forum selection clause).|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} law {{applicable}} to the dispute. If all other factors weigh in favor of keeping {{the case in the}} jurisdiction where it was filed, then the court may choose between application of local law (<b>lex</b> <b>fori)</b> or relevant foreign law. Thus, the mere fact that foreign law may apply to the event, circumstances, accident, or occurrence is not a strong reason to dismiss the case on FNC grounds.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lex</b> <b>fori,</b> or proper {{jurisdiction}} to adjudicate legal disputes, will usually be {{the state where}} the spouses have sought to make their matrimonial home. This state will usually have a clear and direct interest in the applications of its policies to regulate the nature of relationships permitted to confer the status of husband and wife within their territorial boundaries. It may also attempt to regulate {{the behavior of those}} who wish to cohabit within their territory although this may contravene privacy rights.|$|E
25|$|In divorce cases, when a {{court is}} {{attempting}} to distribute marital property, if the divorcing couple is local and the property is local, then the court applies its domestic law <b>lex</b> <b>fori.</b> The case becomes more complicated if foreign elements are thrown into the mix, such as when the place of marriage {{is different from the}} territory where divorce was filed; when the parties' nationalities and residences do not match; when there is property in a foreign jurisdiction; or when the parties have changed residence several times during the marriage.|$|E
25|$|A country, state, {{or other}} {{jurisdiction}} enacts laws which are interpreted and applied through {{a system of}} courts. The laws applied by a particular system of courts or legal system are termed the <b>lex</b> <b>fori,</b> or law of the forum. As a matter of civil procedure, courts must decide whether and in what circumstances they will accept jurisdiction over parties and subject matter when a lawsuit begins. This decision will be routine, or not raised at all, if the relevant elements of the case are within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. If {{one or more of}} the parties resides outside the territorial jurisdiction or there are other factors which might make another forum more appropriate, the question of jurisdiction must be settled.|$|E
25|$|In many states, {{fundamental}} mistakes, misrepresentations {{and similar}} defects {{may make a}} contract void ab initio, i.e. the defect is so serious that it prevents an agreement from ever coming into being. If this happens, every term in the contract including the express selection of the proper law, would be unenforceable. This {{raises the question of}} whether the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> should operate a policy of saving the validity of contracts wherever possible. Suppose that a contract would be valid under many potentially relevant laws but not under the putative proper law, and that, until problems arose, the parties have acted in good faith on the assumption that they will be bound by the agreement, some courts might be tempted to ignore the apparent proper law and choose another that would give effect to the parties general contractual intentions.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, the {{conflict}} {{rules of the}} <b>lex</b> <b>fori,</b> the domestic law of the court dealing with the case, are usually applied even if, in extreme cases, the application of only the substantive provisions of the foreign law by the forum court could produce a judgment that neither the lex causae nor the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> would normally have produced. Nevertheless, in Macmillan Inc. v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc [...] 1 ALL E R 585, the most recent English case, Auld LJ. accepted that [...] "the proper approach is {{to look beyond the}} formulation of the claim and to identify according to the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> the true issue or issues thrown up by the claim and the defence".|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there is}} no single test for this nexus at an {{international}} level. Some states use the concept of domicile, others nationality, and the remainder citizenship; also, definitions of domicile vary from state to state. That methodology has thus never been accepted outside the US. Also, if the litigants are from different states, relying on one personal law rather than another may be arbitrary. To cope with that difficulty, Currie advocated that the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> should be applied whenever his method produced what he called a [...] "true conflict".|$|E
2500|$|The proper {{law of the}} {{contract}} is the main system of law applied to decide the validity of most aspects to {{the contract}} including its formation, [...] validity, interpretation, and performance. This does not deny {{the power of the}} parties to agree that different aspects of the contract shall be governed by different systems of law. But, in the absence of such express terms, the court will not divide the proper law unless there are unusually compelling circumstances. And note the general rule of the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> which applies the provisions of the proper law as it is when the contract is to be performed and not as it was when the contract was made.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lex</b> <b>fori</b> (Latin for {{the laws}} of a forum) is a legal term used in the {{conflict}} of laws to refer to {{the laws of}} the jurisdiction in which a legal action is brought. When a court decides that it should, by reason of the principles of conflict of law, resolve a given legal dispute by reference to the laws of another jurisdiction, the lex causae, the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> still govern procedural matters.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the court}} will apply {{the law of the}} forum (<b>lex</b> <b>fori)</b> to all {{procedural}} matters (including, self-evidently, the choice of law rules); and ...|$|E
50|$|In all {{lawsuits}} involving {{conflict of}} laws, questions of procedure {{as opposed to}} substance are always determined by the <b>lex</b> <b>fori,</b> i.e. {{the law of the}} state in which the case is being litigated.|$|E
50|$|Until formal {{guidance}} {{is given}} {{on the circumstances}} in which either exception will operate, there will either be considerable forum shopping to select the states with the most favourable interpretation, or courts will resolve the uncertainty by applying the <b>lex</b> <b>fori.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{the parties}} and the causes of action are local, the court will apply the <b>lex</b> <b>fori,</b> the {{prevailing}} municipal law. If there are foreign elements to the case, the forum court, under conflict of laws, will consider which law will apply.|$|E
50|$|Prior to this case, {{the leading}} {{case on the}} matter was McLean v Pettigrew, 1945 S.C.R. 62 which stated that the proper law to apply would always be the <b>lex</b> <b>fori,</b> the local law of the court, {{irrespective}} of the connection with the jurisdiction.|$|E
5000|$|Characterising by {{reference}} to the lex causae (the law identified {{in the choice of}} law stage of the conflict process as the one to be applied to determine the case) would be problematic. Although it may appear logical to allow the whole of the lex causae, including its characterisation rules, to apply, it actually produces a circular argument, i.e. the lex causae is to apply to the process of characterisation before the process of characterisation has led to the choice of the relevant lex causae. So the conflict rules of the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> (the domestic law of the court dealing with the case) are usually applied even though, in extreme cases, the application of only the substantive provisions of the foreign law by the forum court could produce a judgment that neither the lex causae nor the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> would normally have produced. Nevertheless, in Macmillan Inc. v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc 1996 1 ALL E R 585, the most recent English case, Auld LJ. accepted that, [...] "[...] [...]the proper approach is to look beyond the formulation of the claim and to identify according to the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> the true issue or issues thrown up by the claim and the defence".|$|E
5000|$|At {{either the}} {{characterisation}} or {{the choice of}} law stage, the most usual manipulation involves {{the way in which}} the connecting factors are pleaded as between the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> and the lex loci so that inconvenient local laws are evaded in favour of a [...] "foreign" [...] law.|$|E
5000|$|The Convention {{limits the}} {{defenses}} against {{return of a}} wrongfully removed or retained child. To defend against {{the return of the}} child, the defendant must establish to the degree required by the applicable standard of proof (generally determined by the <b>lex</b> <b>fori,</b> i.e. the law of the state where the court is located): ...|$|E
50|$|All {{questions}} {{of evidence to}} determine the admissibility and probative value of evidence and whether a witness is competent, are dealt with under the <b>lex</b> <b>fori,</b> except that presumptions, both rebuttable and irrebuttable, are usually rules of substance. In some cases, {{the application of the}} <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> makes sense—after all, if the forum rules require legal documents to be printed in a twelve-point font, and the choice of law state requires the same documents to be printed in a fourteen-point font, it makes little sense to require the court to determine which font size should be used in a choice of law dispute. However, many contentious cases have centred on findings that issues such as the burdens of proof, the admissibility of evidence, and statutes of limitations are procedural rather than substantive, because these rules can change the outcome of a case.|$|E
50|$|Article 6 {{specifies}} the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> {{for actions}} {{arising out of}} breach of privacy or defamation, a rule that may {{increase the risk of}} forum shopping. Whether the plaintiff has any right of reply in a defamation case will be determined under the law of the state where the broadcaster or publisher is established.|$|E
50|$|This {{exception}} was furthered in Red Sea Insurance v Bouygues SA 1995 1 AC 190 which provided that this exception can displace either {{the law of}} the forum or {{the law of the}} tort such that a tort may be actionable even though it is not actionable under the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> or lex loci delicti.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> {{determines whether}} a foreign {{judgment}} can be recognised and, if so, {{how it will}} be enforced, e.g. what property belonging to the defendant may be taken to satisfy the judgment (see enforcement of foreign judgments).

50|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to establish a}} coherent choice of law rule for tort cases involving a foreign law element varied between favouring the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> (i.e. {{the law of the}} court) and the lex loci delicti commissi (i.e. the law of the place where the tort was committed). The public policy of territorial sovereignty was always the principal consideration. Hence, the forum courts claimed their right to apply their laws to determine whether any lawsuit initiated in their jurisdiction allowed a remedy. Equally, it is the commission of a tort that vests a right of action in a claimant and therefore, it should always be for the law of the place where that right was created {{to determine the extent of}} any remedy flowing from it. In the end, a compromise emerged where the lex loci delicti was the first point of reference but courts retained a discretion to substitute the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> if the foreign law was deemed unfair and other practical considerations pointed to the application of forum law.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{approved}} {{statements in}} Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc (No 3) 1996 WLR 387 that [...] "...to strive for comity between competing legal systems, classification {{should not be}} constrained by particular notions or distinctions of the domestic law of the <b>lex</b> <b>fori,</b> or that of the competing system of law, which may have no counterpart in the other's system. Nor should the issue be defined too narrowly so that it attracts a particular domestic rule under the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> {{which may not be}} applicable under the other system..." [...] In other words, the Court would take a broad view as to whether the Kommune's had the necessary capacity, rather than getting tied up in the detail of English legal distinctions between capacity and powers. Under section 50 of the Norwegian Local Government Act 1992 local authorities were restricted in their ability to borrow loans; the Court was satisfied that under Norwegian law the swaps would have been treated as loans, and that the Kommunes lacked substantive power to enter into those transactions. [...] Accordingly the transactions were void.|$|E
50|$|The Proper Law of an Arbitration Agreement Arbitration, the Journal of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators 76(4): 661 (2010) Argues that {{conventional}} {{doctrines of}} dépeçage {{in the law}} of international arbitration are confused. The “proper law of an arbitration agreement” by which an arbitration clause’s validity is judged should generally follow the <b>lex</b> <b>fori,</b> irrespective of the lex causae; but capacity to arbitrate should be assessed by the lex domicilii, even for public entities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{public policy}} {{underpinning}} the <b>lex</b> <b>fori</b> (the {{law of the}} forum court) will allow the court to ignore foreign limitations on the right to marry which are considered offensive, e.g. those based on differences of race or ethnic origin, or which allow persons of the same biological sex the capacity to marry. However, some states go further, e.g. in the United States, section 283 Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws provides: ...|$|E
