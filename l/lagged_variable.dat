40|$|<b>Lagged</b> <b>variables</b> play an {{important}} role in cross-sectional models in geography and regional sciences. This paper starts with an overview of the situations in which they may be required. <b>Lagged</b> <b>variables</b> also pose serious problems from a statistical point of view: multicollinearity and the determination of the length of the lag. Some common approaches to these two problems are discussed and evaluated. As an alternative a linear structural equation approach is presented, where the <b>lagged</b> <b>variables</b> are compressed to latent variables in a measurement model. The relationship between the <b>lagged</b> <b>variables,</b> thus compressed, and the dependent variable is expressed in the structural model. Both the measurement model and the structural model are estimated simultaneously. The paper ends with an application.

One of the anonymisation procedures used for the generation of SUF is multiplicative stochastic noise.

This is done by constructing a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The study specifies a business cycle model with the business cycle coincident indicator (BC) regressed against, the All Share Price Index (ALSI), Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), Money Supply (M 1), Inflation (CPIX) and the Prime Overdraft Rate (POR). The ALSI represents stock market performance whilst {{the rest of the}} variables are to enhance model specification. The study found a positive relationship between stock market performance and business cycles in South Africa. The results also indicated that business cycles are positively related to the <b>lagged</b> <b>variable</b> of the coincident indicator and money supply.

We compare BTS to other known methods, also in conjunction with regularization techniques used for the estimation of model parameters, namely principal components, partial least squares and ridge regression estimation. The predictive efficiency of the different models is assessed by means of Monte Carlo simulations for different settings of feedback and multi-collinearity. The results show that BTS has consistently good prediction performance while other popular methods have varying and often inferior performance. The prediction performance of BTS was also found the best when tested on human electroencephalograms of an epileptic seizure, and to the prediction of returns of indices of world financial markets.

40|$|In the {{specification}} of linear regression models {{it is common}} to indicate a list of candidate variables from which a subset enters the model with nonzero coefficients. In some cases any combination of variables may enter, but in others certain necessary conditions must be satisfied: e. g., in time series applications {{it is common to}} allow a <b>lagged</b> <b>variable</b> only if all shorter lags for the same variable also enter. This paper interprets this specification as a mixed continuous-discrete prior distribution for coefficient values. It then utilizes a Gibbs sampler to construct posterior moments. It is shown how this method can incorporate sign constraints and provide posterior probabilities for all possible subsets of regressors. The methods are illustrated using some standard data sets.

To help answer this question, this paper provides new empirical evidence of the association between World Bank policy lending and measures {{of the quality of}} borrower countries’ social policies and institutions that such lending supports. Results from estimating a two-stage least squares model indicate that the World Bank’s policy lending has a significantly positive effect on the quality of social policies and institutions. The analysis also finds tentative evidence that loan conditions related to social protection and environmental sustainability are more effective in influencing social policies and institutions than those related to equity of public resource use and health and education. In general, the findings are confirmed when estimating a model with a <b>lagged</b> <b>variable</b> of interest.

40|$|In most democracies, {{at least}} two out of any three {{individuals}} vote for the same party in sequential elections. This paper presents a model in which vote-persistence {{is partly due to}} the dependence of the utility on the previous voting decision. This dependence is termed ‘habit formation’. The model and its implications are supported by individual-level panel data on the presidential elections in the USA in 1972 and 1976. For example, it is found that the voting probability {{is a function of the}} lagged choice variable, even when the endogeneity of the <b>lagged</b> <b>variable</b> is accounted for, and that the tendency to vote for different parties in sequential elections decreased with the age of the voter. Furthermore, using structural estimation the effect of habit is estimated, while allowing unobserved differences among respondents. The structural habit parameter implies that the effect of previous votes on the current decision is quite strong. The habit model fits the data better than the traditional ‘party identification ’ model. Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 1...|$|E
40|$|Literature reviews {{show that}} the most {{commonly}} studied fuzzy time series models {{for the purpose of}} forecasting is first order. In such approaches, only the first <b>lagged</b> <b>variable</b> is used when constructing the first order fuzzy time series model. Therefore, such approaches fail to analyze accurately trend and seasonal time series which is an important class in time series models. In this paper, a weighted fuzzy integrated time series is proposed in order to analyze trend and seasonal data and data are taken from tourist arrivals series. The proposed approach is based on differencing concept as data preprocessing method and weighted fuzzy time series. The order of this model is determined by utilizing graphical order fuzzy relationship. Four data sets about the monthly number of tourist arrivals to Indonesia via four main gates are selected to illustrate the proposed method and compare the forecasting accuracy with classical time series models.

Our aim was to describe the relationship between influenza and climatic parameters with severe hemoptysis that required bronchial artery embolization (BAE). METHODS: All consecutive subjects with at least one episode of hemoptysis that required BAE during a 5 -y period were included. We applied a general multivariable additive seemingly causal model corresponding to a <b>lagged</b> <b>variable</b> autoregressive model with the exogenous variables as monthly mean temperature, lagged monthly mean temperature (1), and monthly mean influenza activity, and the number of embolizations as the endogenous variable. RESULTS: We found a significant association between severe hemoptysis requiring BAE and low monthly mean temperature and influenza activity. Other climatic factors, such as atmospheric pressure, rainfall, relative humidity, or wind speed, failed to show significant association with the occurrence of life-threatening hemoptysis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong long running relationship be-tween severe hemoptysis and low monthly mean temperature. A weaker association of hemoptysis with influenza activity was also found.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} importance of globalization, {{the nature of}} globalization has also been changing {{over the last several}} decades, with deepening forms of economic integration. One of the forms of globalization, international capital flows in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) has risen rapidly relative to world growth. The increase of FDI inflows into developing countries has also triggered the debate of the impact of FDI on host countries. It is argued that FDI benefits the host countries by bringing in capital and advanced technology, which are believed to help to increase economic growth. At the same time however, some rapidly growing host countries have also been experiencing a widening income gap. As the largest recipient of FDI among all developing countries, China has been suffering from a widening income gap in the last decade. The goal of this thesis is to explore the relationship between FDI and income inequality in China, particularly the income gap between urban and rural areas across provinces. The study examines data on 31 provinces across China during the time period of 1995 - 2009. Our results show that FDI stocks are correlated with higher real incomes in both urban and rural areas, while the <b>lagged</b> <b>variable</b> of FDI stocks over two time periods lowers the urban-rural income gap...|$|E
