60|$|The {{boat was}} {{provided}} with a <b>light</b> <b>mast,</b> which could be stepped or unstepped at pleasure, {{and there were two}} stays of twisted leather, one fastening to each side of the boat. An iron ring with a cord travelled up and down the mast, the halliard running through a small block, as Luka had been able to obtain a sheave at Turukhansk. The sail was a lug made of sheeting, oiled, and the boat carried beside a triangular sail of very much smaller dimensions and stouter cloth for heavy weather. She also carried a small mizzen mast and sail. In rough weather the cockpit could be completely covered with a light apron with openings where the rowers sat, with a sort of collar, which could be lashed tightly round their waists. The edges of this apron could be lashed down over the gunwale round the cockpit. When completed the canoe itself, with its mast and sails, weighed but sixty pounds, and could be carried with ease by one person on his shoulder.|$|E

40|$|High Mast Light {{gives the}} several cost {{effective}} advantages and cost {{is a major}} issue for rural area general services. This project illustrates the theoretical basis and the analytical development of the high mast lighting poles. In the late 1960 "s, studies were conducted to investigate the impact that high-mast lighting gives on traffic performance, driver visibility, and illumination costs. It was found that increasing {{the height of the}} lighting offered a noticeable advantage in that it provided drivers with increased uniformity of illumination and brightness while minimizing discomfort and disability glare. In this turn, it`s led to a reduced number of visibility related accidents. Also, lighting is a major requirement when we deal with working at the opencast mining. In opencast mining, the efficient lighting system is required while working during dark hours.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{reports a}} case study of wind induced vortex {{shedding}} vibrations of a steel <b>light</b> <b>mast.</b> The vibrations are examined, full scale observations reported and the coun-termeasures devised to reduce the motions are described. The across wind motion of the mast was observed in windy weather shortly after its installation. The amplitude of deflection {{at the tip of the}} mast was estimated to be few centimetres and considered unsatisfactory by the owner. A measurement program was initiated to map the vibrations of the mast and to corre-late them with wind data. The recorded data showed that the initiation of the intense vibra-tions as well as the amplitude of the vibrations was in fair agreement with predictions based on theory of bluff body aerodynamics. To reduce the vibrations cylindrical wind flaps were added to the <b>light</b> <b>mast</b> to counteract the formation of vortexes. Comparison of recorded vi-bration data before and after the installation of the wind flaps show that the flaps signifi-cantly reduced the vibration...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} drivers of demand Naval {{architecture}} changed gradually in the eighteenth century. Of five classes of seventeenth-century vessels, only ship continued to be built after the early 1700s. The others were replaced by four new types: sloop, schooner, brigantine, and snow. Given the constant emigration of shipwrights from England and the limited advances in technology, {{it is not surprising}} that eighteenth-century Americans were usually familiar with trends abroad. Sloop and schooner were more manageable and could operate with fewer men. Smaller sails meant <b>lighter</b> <b>masts</b> and rigging, which in turn reduced expenses for the owners.|$|R

Throughout history, man has devised methods of contacting others who were out of voice range or {{who could not be}} heard because of excess noise. The Indians were skilled at using smoke signals or by imitating some form of wildlife such as the owl or coyote. The early explorers used other signs to guide them. The slashing of bark on trees or sticks pointed in a certain direction were keys for keeping the persons from getting lost or for others to follow. The railroad used a system of lantern signals to make contact between the trainman and the engineer. The Navy used semaphore or a system of flags to communicate between ships at sea.

Vim is considered a benchmark design which was continually refined over her racing career. In 1939 Vim came to the UK and won 19 races out of 28.

40|$|Slender {{structures}} representing civil, {{mechanical and}} aerospace {{systems such as}} long-span bridges, high-rise buildings, stay cables, power-line cables, high <b>light</b> <b>mast</b> poles, crane-booms and aircraft wings could experience vortex-induced and buffeting excitations below their design wind speeds and divergent self-excited oscillations (flutter) beyond a critical wind speed because these are flexible. Traditional linear aerodynamic theories that are routinely applied for their response prediction are not valid in the galloping, or near-flutter regime, where large-amplitude vibrations could occur and during non-stationary and transient wind excitations that occur, for example, during hurricanes, thunderstorms and gust fronts. The linear aerodynamic load formulation for lift, drag and moment are {{expressed in terms of}} aerodynamic functions in frequency domain that are valid for straight-line winds which are stationary or weakly-stationary. Application of the frequency domain formulation is restricted from use in the nonlinear and transient domain because these are valid for linear models and stationary wind. The time-domain aerodynamic force formulations are suitable for finite element modeling, feedback-dependent structural control mechanism, fatigue-life prediction, and above all modeling of transient structural behavior during non-stationary wind phenomena. This has motivated the developing of time-domain models of aerodynamic loads that are in parallel to the existing frequency-dependent models. Parameters defining these time-domain models can be now extracted from wind tunnel tests, for example, the Rational Function Coefficients defining the self-excited wind loads can be extracted using section model tests using the free vibration technique. However, the free vibration method has some limitations because it is difficult to apply at high wind speeds, in turbulent wind environment, or on unstable cross sections with negative aerodynamic damping. In the current research, new algorithms were developed based on forced vibration technique for direct extraction of the Rational Functions. The first of the two algorithms developed uses the two angular phase lag values between the measured vertical or torsional displacement and the measured aerodynamic lift and moment produced on the section model subject to forced vibration to identify the Rational Functions. This algorithm uses two separate one-degree-of-freedom tests (vertical or torsional) to identify all the four Rational Functions or corresponding Rational Function Coefficients for a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) vertical-torsional vibration model. It was applied to a streamlined section model and the results compared well with those obtained from earlier free vibration experiment. The second algorithm that was developed is based on direct least squares method. It uses all the data points of displacements and aerodynamic lift and moment instead of phase lag values for more accurate estimates. This algorithm can be used for one-, two- and three-degree-of-freedom motions. A two-degree-of-freedom forced vibration system was developed and the algorithm was shown to work well for both streamlined and bluff section models. The uniqueness of the second algorithms {{lies in the fact that}} it requires testing the model at only two wind speeds for extraction of all four Rational Functions. The Rational Function Coefficients that were extracted for a streamlined section model using the two-DOF Least Squares algorithm were validated in a separate wind tunnel by testing a larger scaled model subject to straight-line, gusty and boundary-layer wind...|$|E
