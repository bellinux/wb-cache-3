Although GaN-based <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> are commercially available, it is still difficult to manufacture highly efficient GaN-based <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> due to the high dislocation density and the low light extraction efficiency. Patterned sapphire substrates for GaN-based light-emitting diodes have attracted much interest in recent years because it can not only reduce the threading dislocation density of epitaxial GaN films, but also improve the light extraction efficiency of GaN-based light-emitting diodes. A comprehensive review is presented on the mechanisms responding for performance enhancement of GaN-based <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> on patterned sapphire substrates, methods of preparing patterned sapphire substrates and pattern-size of patterned sapphire substrates. What is more, improved performance of GaN-based light-emitting diodes on patterned sapphire substrates prepared by different methods and pattern-size are further discussed in detail. In view of the existing problems, the prospects for future development of patterned sapphire substrates are also proposed...|$|R

40|$|The {{results for}} {{external}} quantum efficiency degradation of two types of <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> based on III-nitrides: blue and ultraviolet ones are presented. Existing mechanisms proposed for the degradation are considered briefly. Applying several techniques for studying the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> at various stages of the aging test gives the possibility to reveal a new mechanism of defects formations with a help of multi-phonon recombination of carriers in an extended defects system and in local regions of random alloy fluctuations. These techniques include analysis of current voltage characteristics evolution at V< 2 V, the low frequency noise methods, and infrared microscopy. The multi-phonon recombination of carriers is accomplished by generation of native defects, in particular, In- or Ga-atoms and their migration. These processes lead to modification of the extended defects system properties and local composition of InGaN alloys in several regions that result in decreasing of the carriers participating in a radiative recombination and degradation of the {{external quantum efficiency}}. It was demonstrated that this mechanism of the defects formation can {{be responsible for the}} degradation of the blue and ultraviolet <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes.</b> The mechanism can explain non monotonic dependence of the degradation process during the aging test, catastrophic failures of the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> and low lifetime of the ultraviolet <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) lamps {{are used}} for both general and {{special-purpose}} lighting. Compared to fluorescent bulbs, their advantages are that they contain no mercury, they turn on instantly at any temperature, their extremely long lifetime is unaffected by cycling on and off, they have no glass to break, and they don't emit UV rays that fade colored materials. LED lamps radiate almost no heat, and can be either multi-directional or unidirectional, {{eliminating the need for}} a mirrored reflector in the bulb or fixture. LED lamps can emit saturated colored light. Disadvantages include spectrum limitations due to discrete emission colors, and higher up-front cost than incandescent bulbs.|$|E
25|$|Flood beam CRTs {{are small}} tubes that are {{arranged}} as pixels for large screens like Jumbotrons. The first screen using this technology {{was introduced by}} Mitsubishi Electric for the 1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It differs from a normal CRT in that the electron gun within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb. Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, {{to make up the}} color sub-pixels. This technology has largely been replaced with <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> displays. Unfocused and undeflected CRTs were used as grid-controlled stroboscope lamps since 1958.|$|E

SRI International and Xerox PARC in Silicon Valley helped give birth to the personal computer industry, while ARPA and NASA funded the development of the ARPANET and the Internet. Companies like IBM and Apple Computer developed personal computers while Microsoft created operating systems and office productivity software to run on them. With the growth of information on the World Wide Web, search companies like Yahoo! and Google developed technologies to sort and rank web pages based on relevance. The web also has become a site for computer-mediated social interactions and web services like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter are used by millions to communicate. Miniaturization of computing technology and the increasing pervasiveness and speed of wireless networks had led to substantial adoption of mobile phones and increasingly powerful smartphones based on software platforms like Apple's iOS and Google's Android.|$|E

It is natural to extend the available emissions to ultraviolet region. Polysilanes are candidate materials for emission in ultraviolet and near-ultraviolet. The goal of our research is to develop polysilane based organic <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> for their possible application in large area electronics: a) flat panel displays, by converting ultraviolet (UV) emission from polysilanes to visible emission, b) conversion of ultra violet emission of polysilanes to white light for home lighting.

2500|$|White LEDs have {{advanced}} to the stage where they are a good substitute for the compact fluorescent lamp. The latest types are exhibiting superior efficacies (mostly because no power is wasted on powering heated cathodes) and a choice of 'colour temperature'. The most common type consists of a blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> with a coating of cerium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet which produces yellow light when the blue light from the diode lands on it. The combination of the yellow and blue light produces white light. [...] LED bulbs have a long life of around 25,000 hours.
