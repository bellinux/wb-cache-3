5000|$|In {{his initial}} {{appearance}} Paragon faced and defeated the Justice League of America by duplicating their unique abilities, but {{was defeated by}} the Red Tornado, an inorganic android, and Green <b>Lantern</b> (<b>armed</b> with his power ring), whose artificial powers Paragon could not duplicate. In his earliest appearance Cochin's stated goal was the eradication of all those he considered [...] "inferior"â€”more than three-quarters of the human race.|$|R
60|$|Linda's black figure {{detached}} itself {{upright on}} {{the light of the}} <b>lantern</b> with her <b>arms</b> raised above her head as though she were going to throw herself over.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} home to St Peters Primary School {{and a number of}} other {{amenities}} including a shop, a doctor's surgery, and several pubs such as The <b>Lantern</b> and King's <b>Arms.</b> The Plough Inn hosts a jazz evening on the first Sunday of every month. Pilning Cricket Club was established in 1883.|$|R
60|$|At Worcester, {{where the}} train {{has made the}} usual stop, THE PORTER, with his <b>lantern</b> on his <b>arm,</b> enters the car, {{preceding}} a gentleman somewhat anxiously smiling; his nervous speech contrasts painfully with the business-like impassiveness of THE PORTER, who refuses, {{with an air of}} incredulity, to enter into the confidences which the gentleman seems reluctant to bestow.|$|R
50|$|All Blue <b>Lanterns</b> are <b>armed</b> {{with a blue}} power ring, {{fueled by}} the emotion hope. While hope is the most {{powerful}} of the seven emotions, Blue Lanterns must be near an active Green Lantern's power ring to tap into their own rings' full power. Otherwise, the rings are only capable of the default abilities of flight and a protective aura. This is because the power of hope is nothing without the willpower to enact it. The Blue Lantern's protective aura allows them to survive in space and other hostile environments and can be manipulated to a limited degree even without a Green Lantern present, using it to augment their strength and extending it to form a larger shield, but this ability is almost exclusively defensive. Blue rings must be activated by true hope before they will operate at their user's command.|$|R
50|$|The Manhunters are an android race, {{originally}} {{created by}} the Guardians of the Universe {{to serve as the}} first interstellar police force. The Manhunters became more obsessed with administering punishment than serving justice, forcing the Guardians to dissolve their ranks. The few Manhunters that survived fled into exile and the Guardians founded a new elite police force called the Green <b>Lantern</b> Corps and <b>armed</b> its members with specially crafted power rings. Now the Manhunters are back and out for revenge, readying their forces for a war against the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps. Faced with destruction, the Corps is looking to gifted but cocky test pilot Hal Jordan as the newest recruit, to protect peace and preserve justice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] the {{stranger}} said. [...] "But {{this time they}} were all wide awake to receive him, or fast asleep, and dreaming their roles. He came along with the wire of his <b>lantern</b> over his <b>arm,</b> the way the old-time conductors did, and calling out, 'Tickets!' just {{as if it was}} broad day, and he believed every man was trying to beat his way to New York. The oddest thing about it was that the sleep-walkers all stopped their pulling and hauling a moment, and each man reached down to the little slot alongside of his berth and handed over his ticket. Then they took hold and began pulling and hauling again. I suppose the conductor asked what the matter was; but I couldn't hear him, and I couldn't make out exactly what he did say. But the passengers understood, and they all shouted 'Burglars!' and that girl in the stateroom gave a shriek that you could have heard {{from one end of the}} train to the other, and hammered on the door, and wanted to be let out.|$|R
6000|$|The spot {{chosen by}} the ill-fated Stuart and his gallant remnant for their last desperate {{enterprise}} was eminently fitted for their purpose. Being round the corner from Thrums, it was commanded by no fortified place save the farm of Nether Drumgley, and on a recent goustie night nearly all the trees had been blown down, making a hundred hiding-places for bold climbers, and transforming the Den into a scene of wild and mournful grandeur. In no bay more suitable than the flooded field called the Silent Pool could the hunted prince have cast anchor, for the Pool is not only sheltered from observation, but so little troubled by gales that it had only one drawback: at some seasons of the year it was not there. This, however, did not vex Stroke, as it is cannier to call him, for he burned his boats on the night he landed (and a dagont, tedious job it was too), and pointed out to his followers that the drouth which kept him in must also keep the enemy out. Part {{of the way to}} the lair they usually traversed in the burn, because water leaves no trace, and though they carried turnip <b>lanterns</b> and were <b>armed</b> to the teeth, this was often a perilous journey owing to the lovers close at hand on the pink path, from which the trees had been cleared, for lads and lasses must walk whate'er betide. Ronny-On's Jean and Peter Scrymgeour, little Lisbeth Doak and long Sam'l from Pyotdykes were pairing that year, and never knew how near they were to being dirked by Corp of Corp, who, lurking in the burn till there were no tibbits in his toes, muttered fiercely, [...] "Cheep one single cheep, and it will be thy hinmost, methinks!" [...] under the impression that Methinks was a Jacobite oath.|$|R
60|$|He {{started down}} to his hotel on a late {{afternoon}} train that would bring him to the station after dusk, and before he reached it the lamps had been lighted in his car. Alford sat in a sparsely peopled smoker, where {{he had found a}} place away from the crowd in the other coaches, and looked out of the window into the reflected interior of his car, which now and then thinned away and let him see the weeds and gravel of the railroad banks, with the bushes that topped them and the woods that backed them. The train at one point stopped rather suddenly and then went on, for no reason that he ever cared to inquire; but as it slowly moved forward again he was reminded of something he had seen one night in going to New York just before the train drew into Springfield. It had then made such another apparently reasonless stop; but before it resumed its course Alford saw from his window a group of trainmen, and his own Pullman conductor with his <b>lantern</b> on his <b>arm,</b> bending over the figure of a man defined in his dark clothing against the snow of the bank where he lay propped. His face was waxen white, and Alford noted how particularly black the mustache looked traversing the pallid visage. He never knew whether the man was killed or merely stunned; you learn nothing with certainty of such things on trains; but now, as he thought of the incident, its eidolon showed itself outside of his mind, and followed him in every detail, even to a snowy stretch of the embankment, until the increasing speed of the train seemed to sweep it back out of sight.|$|R
6000|$|When {{he had his}} cry out he felt {{a little}} better, and {{he got up and}} went to the pond in the hollow, and washed his hands and face, and wiped them on the {{handkerchief}} his mother had ironed for him to use at the minister's; it was still in the folds she had given it. As he shook it out, rising up, he saw that people were asleep on all the benches round the pond; he looked hopelessly at them to see if any of them were those fellows, but he could not find them. He seemed to be the only person awake on the Common, and wandered out of it and down through the empty streets, filled at times with the moony light of the waning electrics, and at times merely with the grey dawn. A man came along putting out the gas, and some milk-carts rattled over the pavement. By and by a market-wagon, with the leaves and roots of cabbages sticking out from the edges of the canvas that covered it, came by, and Lemuel followed it; he did not know what else to do, and it went so slow that he could keep up, though the famine that gnawed within him was so sharp sometimes that he felt as if he must fall down. He was going to drop into a doorway and rest, but when he came to it he found on an upper step a man folded forward like a limp bundle, snoring in a fetid, sodden sleep, and, shocked into new strength, he hurried on. At last the wagon came to a place that he saw was a market. There were no buyers yet, but men were flitting round under the long arcades of the market-houses, with <b>lanterns</b> under their <b>arms,</b> among boxes and barrels of melons, apples, potatoes, onions, beans, carrots, and other vegetables, which the country carts as they arrived continually unloaded. The smell of peaches and cantaloupes filled the air, and made Lemuel giddy as he stood and looked at the abundance. The men were not saying much; now and then one of them priced something, the owner pretended to figure on it, and then they fell into a playful scuffle, but all silently. A black cat lay luxuriously asleep on the canvas top of a barrel of melons, and the man who priced the melons asked if the owner would throw the cat in. There was a butcher's cart laden with carcasses of sheep, and one of the men asked the butcher if he called that stuff mutton. [...] "No; imitation," [...] said the butcher. They all seemed to be very good-natured. Lemuel thought he would ask for an apple; but he could not.|$|R
