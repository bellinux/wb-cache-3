Practices, based on authentic assessment and sub-sequent individual intervention decisions, resulted in full participation of {{students with special needs}} in daily classroom instruction. Individualized in-struction by incorporating student choice of mate-rials, feedback from teacher-designed rubrics, and application of student-constructed reading logs of-fers students with disabilities the opportunity to maintain growth and appropriate development in general education classrooms. nowing how and what to teach when instructing ~j ~ children with learning disabilities {{is one of the most}} challenging aspects of inclusive education. Instructional decision making is confounded by variability in teaching philosophy and reading interven-tions from one instructor to another. One fundamental in all effective teaching, however, is the use of an assessment strategy, formal and informal, to determine the most appropriate instruction. Striking a balance among the var-ious intervention approaches is also important in the pro-vision of an appropriate, individual education. The focus of this article deals with the question &dquo;How do teachers maximize inclusion of students with special needs in a general education classroom. ’-&dquo; Our discussion of rubrics, miscue analysis, and reading logs for students who have learning disabilities in reading and who are served in gen-eral education classrooms may answer this question. Step 1 : Design a Rubric A rubric, a set of criteria outlining the expectations for work, can serve as an effective basis for assessment (Erick-son, 1995) and consequent instructional decisions. Rub-rics require the design of a Likert-ri-pe scale to quantify decisions about performance; the decision is then made more obvious to the learner by the semantic scale, which describes different levels of learning for a particular ac-tivity. A second feature of the rubric is the identification of performance competencies, which serve to separate student performance among a number of interrelated in-structional concerns. Accurately developing the rubric will <b>link</b> <b>instruction</b> and learning through assessment...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we study the actual {{requirements}} of a multimedia chat system for helpdesks by quantifying the verbal imagery communication in 115 real transcripts. The data shows that in chats which use verbal imagery, it corresponds to about 25 % of the total time, most of it (75 %) coming from the agent. These results clearly show that multimedia support for contact center chat systems is called for. But unlike in personal chat systems, the existing 3 rd party chat services for helpdesk centers are text-based only. To circumvent this issue, an innovative, practical SOA-based chat system architecture is proposed in this paper that creates multimedia chat services by decomposition and re-composition of the services from an existing 3 rd party text-based helpdesk chat product. Our SOA architecture implements uniquely a session-based interactive mashup mechanism and bundles it to the previous operations in the same chat session.

40|$|This MA study {{combines}} a descriptive analysis of 32 videotaped English lessons taught by seven teachers in seven classrooms at different lower secondary schools (Year 9), with interviews {{with two of}} these teachers. The data were collected {{as part of the}} <b>Linking</b> <b>Instruction</b> and Student Experiences (LISE) project, led by Professor Kirsti Klette and with Associate Professor Lisbeth M. Brevik as coordinator. The data were analyzed to identify grammar instruction in the English classroom, to characterize the students’ oral grammar mistakes in the observed classrooms and the teacher’s correction of these. Studying natural instruction (i. e., not interventions) in English classrooms is valuable in identifying grammar instruction practices on the one hand, and students’ grammar proficiency on the other. Integrating these analyses with teacher interviews provides an opportunity to examine English grammar instruction from different perspectives. I found that the students in the observed lessons seldom made oral grammar mistakes and that the teachers’ corrections of these were rare. The students’ oral grammar mistakes constituted a total of 374 mistakes (27 %) out of 1382 clear student utterances in English, with the majority relating to verbs and determiners. When the infrequent correction of these grammar mistakes did occur, they were implicit and focused {{on the development of the}} students’ communicative competence, rather than correctness. This is in line with the notion that the English teachers’ error correction occurs to help students avoid being misunderstood. Moreover, while explicit grammar teaching occurred in two of the classrooms only, in these instructions, the teachers taught grammar rules based on students’ needs drawing upon a deductive teaching model. However, the teachers taught grammar out of context, rather than <b>linking</b> grammar <b>instruction</b> to either student texts or their oral communication. The teacher interviews suggest that as the LK 06 / 13 English subject curriculum is vague when it comes to defining what areas of grammar to teach and how to teach it, teachers are left to decide how to approach grammar. Therefore, grammar instruction is often neglected. Nevertheless, the students’ infrequent grammar mistakes indicate that developing their ability to communicate successfully instead of focusing on producing grammatically correct utterances may be more important with regard to avoiding misunderstandings. These findings suggest that an integration of grammar instruction in the English instruction may be warranted, instead of teaching grammar out of context; bearing the students’ strengths and needs in mind to develop their communicative competence...|$|R

The Adventure of <b>Links</b> <b>instruction</b> booklet describes <b>Link</b> setting off [...] "with a magical sword in his left hand and a magical shield in his right". In A Link to the Past, he alternates hands; although this is due to sprite mirroring, {{the reason for this is}} explained in the official Nintendo Player's guide as a Hylian superstition that requires the shield to always face Death Mountain (located to the North) to protect oneself from the evil powers originating within the mountain. [...] Starting with Link's Awakening, Link holds his sword in his left hand and his shield in his right, no matter what direction he is facing. In The Minish Cap, however, Link returns to alternately holding his weapon in the right or the left hand, depending on his orientation. At the beginning of the Four Swords Plus (Four Swords Adventures) manga, Link is referred to as the [...] "left-handed hero" [...] after defeating pirates that were raiding a Hylian town. In addition, Link's figurine description in The Wind Waker lists his [...] "manual preference" [...] as left. However, in the animated TV series and the Wii version of Twilight Princess, Link is right-handed, but the latter was done to better mirror the game's control scheme. In the game's official artwork he is shown holding his sword in his left hand. In the GameCube version, Link remains left-handed, as the game uses a traditional control scheme. Thus, Skyward Sword is the first game in the series to feature a definite right-handed Link, with even the concept art reflecting the fact. This was done again for Breath of the Wild, in which Link is canonicly right-handed; this was done to mirror what side the buttons on the controller were used for Link's attacks.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the areas of teaching methods, teacher-student relationships, school structure, school-community partnerships or school leadership were significantly embedded in practice and acted as a change agent among school systems that achieve higher than expected results on their state standardized testing while controlling for their socio-economic status. Another area of insight gained from the comparison of the specific practices at the building level that were found in high-achieving schools and may not be present in schools identified as low-achieving. Individual characteristics of students impact the learning environment for all children. Educators can make informed decisions by examining what teaching methods, a school‟s structure, teacher-student relationships, school to community partnerships, and what school leadership aspects are common among schools identified as high-achieving. If the identification within these five areas showed a significant relationship for improved student performance for high-achieving schools, the classroom teacher and building administration may use the results as a guide for student improvement. The study used a 50 -question survey divided into five constructs. The data showed significant differences in implementation between the high-achieving and low-achieving schools in four of the five constructs. The four constructs that were significantly higher in level of implementation as compared to low-achieving schools were teaching methods, teacher-student relationships, school-community partnerships and school leadership. Of the four constructs showing significance, teacher-student relationships showed the highest amount of variance for high-achieving schools as compared to low-achieving schools. School structure did not show statistically significant differences in variance for high-achieving schools. Interesting findings of differences between high-achieving schools and low-achieving schools were noted in the instructional methods construct for ensuring proficiency in reading and math, frequently assessing reading levels for all students, <b>linking</b> <b>instruction</b> to learning benchmarks, and implementing flexible skill grouping. Differences were also noted for high-achieving schools for facilitating two-way home/school communication, creating partnerships with parents and families and offering career exploration as part of the curriculum.
