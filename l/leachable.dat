This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a <b>leachable</b> form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E

These contaminants may either have a direct safety impact on the patients or act indirectly through the alteration of the physicochemical properties of the product. In the case of biotherapeutics, trace amounts of metal contaminants can arise from various sources, but mainly from contact with stainless steel (ss). The effect of the various factors, buffer species, solution fill volume per unit contact surface area, metal chelators, and pH, on metal <b>leachables</b> from contact with ss over time were investigated individually. Three major metal <b>leachables,</b> iron, chromium, and nickel, were monitored by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry {{because they are the}} major components of 316 L ss. Iron was primarily used to evaluate the effect of each factor since it is the most abundant. It was observed that each studied factor exhibited its own effect on metal <b>leachables</b> from contact with ss. The effect of buffer species and pH exhibited temperature dependence over the studied temperature range. The metal <b>leachables</b> decreased with the increased fill volume (mL) per unit contact ss surface area (cm 2) but a plateau was achieved at approximately 3  mL/cm 2.

These <b>leachables</b> were recently discovered to be leaching from an ink that is applied during labelling to a plastic vial containing the sample, {{a process known as}} tampoprinting. Due to the volatile nature of these <b>leachables</b> the best technique of tracking them is by gas chromatography (GC). This analytical separation technique utilises a system that vaporises liquid samples containing organic compounds of interest. The sample travels through a column where the sample components are separated and then detected producing a quantitative measurement of each component. In chapter 2, a direct injection gas chromatography method was developed for Product Z to track the three <b>leachables</b> of interest. The method was then fully validated in accordance with the current United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Category II for <b>leachables</b> and in line with all requirements under International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Q 2 (R 1). In chapter 3, direct injection gas chromatography could not be utilised for Product X due to the different nature of its sample matrix to Product Z. Instead, a method to track the Tampoprint <b>leachables</b> was developed using headspace GC, a slightly different technique whereby volatile compounds from the sample are evaporated from the liquid before being injected onto the GC column.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the container closure system on the stability of an atropine sulfate solution was studied. Therefore a model-solution was filled into different container closure systems {{similar to those used}} by the German armed forces as autoinjectors against nerve agent poisoning. These containers were stored at 40, 50 and 60 °C for up to twelve months. Samples were removed from the stock and analysed after 1, 3, 5, and 12 months. Data obtained were used to calculate the maximum shelf life of atropine solution stored at ambient temperature in the three reviewed container closures. For the analysis of assay and degradation products a new rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC) method was established. So the analysis time could be shortened to a fifth, from 45 to ten minutes, which makes it a time and solvent saving method. Differences concerning stability of atropine solutions stored in glass, plastic or steel were found. Regarding the shelf life of storing at ambient temperature atropine proofed to be more stable in metal- then in glass- or plastic-cartridges. By testing siliconized as well as not siliconized metal-cartridges, it could be demonstrated that the silicone film also improved drug stability. No {{influence of}} the intermediate packaging material could be detected concerning formation of degradation products. There is no evidence of formation of other degradation products than tropic acid and apoatropine. Great differences were noticed concerning the <b>leachables</b> found in the atropine solution. For example the migration of phenol from the rubber stoppers of the metal-cartridge is much more distinct than from the rubber stopper of the glass-cartridge. The stoppers of the plastic-cartridge, in contrary, do not release phenol. In addition, different amounts of the preservatives from the silicone emulsion used for passivation of the cartridges can be detected in the atropine solutions. But in general there can be found only traces of them. By storing the components of the container closure systems in a citrate buffer which is like that used for the atropine solution it was confirmed that those parts that had been heated after siliconization do not release constituents of the silicone emulsion to the buffer solution. Besides those <b>leachables,</b> other signals can be detected in the HPLC chromatograms of the tested solutions that could not be identified yet. Their presence depends on the duration of storage, the storage temperature and on the container closure.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the inhibitory effect of selenocystamine coated intraocularlenses (IOLs) on the formation of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) in an ex vivo canine lens capsularbag assay. Selenocystamine was covalently bound to the surface of poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly(HEMA)) discs. Three groups of canine lens capsules (6 coated IOLs (SeIOLs), 7 non-coated control IOLs and 8 empty capsules) were cultured for 10 days. During the culture period PCO was scored basedon visual inspection of the capsules using phase contrast microscopy. On day 10 all the capsules were prepared for light microscopic examination and lens epithelial cells (LECs) were quantified. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and cleaved caspase- 3 were examined by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, cell viability assays were performed on LECs cultured in tissue culture medium pre-incubated with either a SeIOL or control IOL. The viability assays demonstrated that no detectable cytotoxic <b>leachables</b> were associated with the functionalized IOLs. The central posterior capsule was free of cells underneath all SeIOLs, although large numbers of LECs populated the capsular periphery. Apoptotic cells were observed underneath the periphery of some SeIOLs. Both the PCO scores and LEC counts of SeIOL containing capsules were significantly lower than those of control group capsules (p < 0. 01 and p ¼ 0. 0004, respectively). The use of selenium functionalized IOLs resulted in a significant reduction of PCO in this ex vivo model. Binding of selenocystamine to a foldable IOL may provide an effective method to prevent population of the central posterior capsule with LECs...|$|R
40|$|Intervertebral disc (IVD) {{degeneration}} is {{a challenging}} clinical problem that urgently demands viable nucleus pulposus (NP) implant materials. The best suited biomaterial for NP regeneration {{has yet to}} be identified, but it is believed that biodegradable hydrogel-based materials are promising candidates. In this work, we have developed ionic- and photo-crosslinked methacrylated gellan gum (GG–MA) hydrogels to be used in acellular and cellular tissue-engineering strategies for the regeneration of IVDs. The physicochemical properties of the developed hydrogels were investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance and differential scanning calorimetry. The swelling ability and degradation rate of hydrogels were also analysed in phosphate-buffered saline solution at physiological pH for a period of 30 days. Additionally, the morphology and mechanical properties of the hydrogels were assessed under a scanning electron microscope and dynamic compression, respectively. An in vitro study was carried out to screen possible cytotoxicity of the gellan gum-based hydrogels by culturing rat lung fibroblasts (L 929 cells) with hydrogel <b>leachables</b> up to 7 days. The results demonstrated that gellan gum was successfully methacrylated. We observed that the produced GG–MA hydrogels possess improved mechanical properties and lower water uptake ability and degradation rate as compared to gellan gum. This work also revealed that GG–MA hydrogels are non-cytotoxic in vitro, thus being promising biomaterials to be used in IVD tissue-engineering strategies.
