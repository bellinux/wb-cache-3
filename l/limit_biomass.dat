In order to be termed sustainable, the use of an energy source should be technically feasible, economically affordable and environmentally and socially viable, considering society as a whole.

The EROI (Energy Return on Investment) of biofuels reaches a few units, while the EROI of fossil fuels is 20 – 30 or higher and has a power density (W/m 2) thousands of times higher than the best biofuels, such as sugarcane in Brazil. When metabolic approaches are used it becomes clear that biomass cannot represent an energy carrier able to meet the metabolism of industrialized societies. For our industrial society to rely on “sustainable biofuels” for an important fraction of its energy, most of the agricultural and non-agricultural land would need to be used for crops, {{and at the same time}} a radical cut to our pattern of energy consumption would need to be implemented, whilst also achieving a significant population reduction...|$|E

To address these issues, a high throughput screening (HTS) method was devised to identify chemical inducers {{of growth and}} lipid accumulation. Optimization was performed to determine the most effective cell density, DMSO and Nile Red (NR) concentrations to monitor growth and lipid accumulation. The method was tested using 1717 compounds from National Cancer Institute (NCI) Diversity Set III and Natural Products Set II in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Cells were inoculated at low density and 10 μM of the test compound was added. After 72 h, cell density was measured at OD 550 and lipid accumulation assessed using NR fluorescence. Primary screening identified 8 compounds with a hit rate of 0. 47 % and a robust Z′ discrimination factor (0. 68 ± 0. 1).

40|$|The {{decline of}} the Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) stock from highest to lowest stock levels on record {{throughout}} the 1980 s and early 1990 s {{was caused by a}} combination of recruitment failure and increasing fishing pressure at declining stock sizes.

This includes doubts about the adequacy of the biological reference points presently used to advise on the stock status, and the need of their revision given that environmental changes have affected stock productivity. Long-term projections suggest that under adverse environmental conditions for reproduction, harvesting at fishing mortality determined as precautionary may not lead to a recovery of the stock to a biomass level considered precautionary. Thus, a revision of either the limit fishing mortality or the <b>limit</b> <b>biomass</b> reference point is indicated.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringExcessive water {{usage and}} CO 2 {{emissions}} resulting from industrial {{systems and processes}} have significantly raised environmental concerns. The primary sources of CO 2 emissions are production and transportation, while the biofuel industry itself consumes {{a considerable amount of}} water in the U. S. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) capacitated lot-sizing model for analyzing the economic and environmental feasibility of ethanol production using multiple biomass sources is developed. The model minimizes the cost of ethanol production while considering its possible adverse environmental impacts such as CO 2 emissions and excessive water usage during ethanol production. The overall cost of ethanol production includes production, setup, and inventory holding costs with penalties for environmental impacts, along with income from ethanol tax credits and electricity generated from waste heat. A sensitivity analysis is performed and results are analyzed in order to improve an understanding of the economic viability of ethanol production and associated environmental effects. Results show that switchgrass is the most profitable and preferred biomass type when there is an unlimited supply of all biomass sources, while wheat and corn become more preferable {{in the case of a}} <b>limited</b> <b>biomass</b> supply. Compared to low- and medium-demand cases, when there is high demand, total costs increase significantly due to multiple production setup costs, excessive water usage, and CO 2 emissions under <b>limited</b> <b>biomass</b> supply. The solution of the proposed model also indicates that if ongoing technology investments in the conversion rate succeed, the total cost of ethanol production can decrease by 21 percent.

We collected vegetation and soil sam-ples in these three vegetation forms and submitted the obtained data to multiple linear regression. We found out that aluminum and pH were the best predictors of species density, the former positively related to species density and the latter negatively related. Since the predictable variation in species density is important in determining areas of conser-vation, we can postulate that these two soil factors are indicators of high species density areas in tropical grasslands, which could be used in selecting priority sites for conservation...|$|E

Field studies have been extensively synthesized to assess global patterns of N impacts on terrestrial ecosystem processes. However, to our knowledge, no synthesis has been done so far to reveal global patterns of P impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, especially under different nitrogen (N) levels. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of impacts of P addition, either alone or with N addition, on aboveground (AGB) and belowground biomass production (BGB), plant and soil P concentrations, and N:P ratio in terrestrial ecosystems. Overall, our meta-analysis quantitatively confirmed existing notions: (i) colimitation of N and P on biomass production and (ii) more P limitation in tropical forest than other ecosystems. More importantly, our analysis revealed new findings: (i) P limitation on biomass production was aggravated by N enrichment and (ii) plant P concentration was a better indicator of P limitation than soil P availability. Specifically, P addition increased AGB and BGB by 34 % and 13 %, respectively. The effect size of P addition on biomass production was larger in tropical forest than grassland, wetland, and tundra and varied with P fertilizer forms, P addition rates, or experimental durations. The P-induced increase in biomass production and plant P concentration was larger under elevated than ambient N.

Higher herbivore functional diversity increased overall impact on plant biomass due to feeding niche complementarity.

30|$|Although {{nitrogen}} {{starvation and}} other stresses trigger neutral lipid accumulation in eukaryotic microalgae this is generally {{associated with a}} reduction in growth rate (Illman et al. 2000).

This trade off is therefore an important consideration when selecting microalgae for a particular production regime. Interestingly, although the cyanobacteria examined in this work accumulated a lower diversity of FAMEs than the eukaryotic algae, these species produced high levels of neutral lipids that were converted into FAME (up to 45 wt%) under nitrogen-rich conditions (Figure 5). The fact that cyanobacteria can accumulate lipids in the thylakoid membrane under conditions promoting photosynthesis and high growth rates may explain this behaviour (Karatay and Dönmez 2011).|$|R

We present a study of phosphorus (P) dynamics in the southern Yucatán, highlighting the possibility of abrupt shifts in biogeochemical cycling resulting from positive feedbacks between vegetation and its limiting resources. After three cultivation–fallow cycles, available soil P declines by 44 %, and one-time P inputs from biomass burning decline by 76 % from mature forest levels. Interception of dust-borne P (“canopy trapping”) declines with lower plant biomass and leaf area, limiting deposition in secondary forest. Potential leaching losses are greater in secondary than in mature forest, but the difference is very small compared with the difference in P inputs. The decline in new P from atmospheric deposition creates a long-term negative ecosystem balance for phosphorus. The reduction in soil P availability will feed back to further <b>limit</b> <b>biomass</b> recovery and may induce a shift to sparser vegetation. Degradation induced by hydrological and biogeochemical feedbacks on P cycling under shifting cultivation will affect farmers in the near future.

Interactions of N and K fertilizer rates and harvest system were evaluated on a site that had low soil test K (134 kg/ha). In the N and P rate experiments, biomass yields during establishment were unaffected by treatments, averaging 2145 kg/ha in 2007.

Empirical data show some support for this but also sometimes indicate a trade-off in which survival of breeding seabirds may be reduced by food shortage. The sensitivity of seabird adult survival rates may be {{a feature of the}} detailed ecology of particular species and may be affected by ecological conditions such as the possibilities for prey switching. Fishery managers may set a lower <b>limit</b> <b>biomass</b> to protect fish stock recruitment, often at about 20 % of predicted unfished stock biomass. It is unclear whether this threshold would also protect the needs of seabirds dependent on the fish stock. Time series of seabird breeding success and fish stock biomass may indicate minimum densities of food required. These are orders of magnitude more than the consumption by seabird populations. The critical prey density may also vary tremendously among seabird species and is clearly a function of the detailed ecology of each species. It is possible to predict which species will be most sensitive to reduced food supply. Sensitive species may be sentinels of the "health'' of the marine ecosystem. For example, in Shetland and elsewhere in the North Sea, breeding success of kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla is particularly sensitive to abundance and quality of sandeels Ammodytes spp. However, seabird communities may be affected by a variety of interactions prompted by changes in fisheries; maintaining food fish levels may not alone be sufficient where communities have altered in composition over decades of fishing, as in the North Sea, and where predator-prey impacts induced by changes in fishery management may disrupt seabird communitie...|$|E
40|$|Long-range {{transport}} of aerosol from lower latitudes {{to the high}} Arctic may be a significant contributor to climate forcing in the Arctic. To identify the sources of key contaminants entering the Canadian high Arctic an intensive campaign of snow sampling was completed at Alert, Nunavut, from September 2014 to June 2015. Fresh snow samples collected every few days were analysed for black carbon, major ions, and metals, and this rich data provided {{an opportunity for a}} temporally-refined source apportionment of snow composition via Positive Matrix Factorization in conjunction with FLEXPART potential emission sensitivity analysis. Seven source factors were identified: sea salt, regional dust, Eurasian fossil fuel combustion, mixed carboxylic acid sources, nitrate processing, Eurasian industrial activities, and regional volcanic and marine biogenic activity. The majority (73  %) of the black carbon in snow, a light-absorbing compound critical to the Arctic radiative balance, was found to be the product of fossil fuel burning with <b>limited</b> <b>biomass</b> burning influence...|$|R
40|$|This project {{responds}} to the mismatch between {{on the one hand}} a growing demand for biomass on the Dutch and EU energy markets with a <b>limited</b> <b>biomass</b> potential {{and on the other hand}} large amounts of biomass and biomass potential currently underutilised in Ukraine. Ukraine itself is seen as a very promising location for sustainable biomass production but is also plagued by economic depression, land degradation, depopulation and high cost for natural gas. The Ukrainian company Phytofuel and the Belgian company Tuzetka recognized the opportunity. Together with Wageningen UR in The Netherlands they started the first experiments with switchgrass and also initiated pelletisation of straw and assessed the opportunity to use available reed stands in the Poltava region. The project aimed to: develop a sustainable business model for pelletizing biomass residues and biomass crops in Ukraine for domestic and NL energy markets; test sustainability of underutilized biomass use and energy crop production on marginal land while avoiding indirect Land Use Changes (iLUC) ...|$|R
5000|$|Trophic {{dynamics}} can strongly influence {{rates of}} decomposition and nutrient cycling {{in time and}} in space. For example, herbivory can increase litter decomposition and nutrient cycling via direct changes in litter quality and altered dominant vegetation. Insect herbivory {{has been shown to}} increase rates of decomposition and nutrient turnover due to changes in litter quality and increased frass inputs. [...] However, insect outbreak does not always increase nutrient cycling. Stadler showed that C rich honeydew produced during aphid outbreak can result in increased N immobilization by soil microbes thus slowing down nutrient cycling and potentially <b>limiting</b> <b>biomass</b> production. North atlantic marine ecosystems have been greatly altered by overfishing of cod. Cod stocks crashed in the 1990s which resulted in increases in their prey such as shrimp and snow crab Human intervention in ecosystems has resulted in dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function. These changes are occurring rapidly and have unknown consequences for economic security and human well-being.|$|R
