40|$|The left atrial {{posterior}} wall (<b>LAPW)</b> plays {{a critical}} role in atrial fibrillation, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we sought to characterize the histological features of the <b>LAPW.</b> Different atrial regions were dissected from hearts of normal Sprague-Dawley rats and humans. Haematoxylin/ eosin and van Gieson staining were used to analyse atrial cardiomyocyte arrangement and collagen distribution, respectively. Intercellular junctions were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. In contrast with other atrial regions, the <b>LAPW</b> exhibited more disorganized cardiomyocytes, larger intercellular spaces and variable myocardial fibre arrangement. The proportion of collagen was significantly higher in the <b>LAPW</b> than in other atrial regions. Interestingly, desmosomes were sparse along with intercellular gaps in the <b>LAPW.</b> In summary, distinct disarrangement of cardiomyocytes and an abundance of collagen exist in the <b>LAPW.</b> The sparsity of desmosomes in the <b>LAPW</b> {{may be related to the}} heterogeneous distribution and separation of atrial myocytes...|$|R
40|$|The left atrial {{posterior}} wall (<b>LAPW)</b> {{is potentially}} an important {{area for the}} development and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. We assessed whether there are regional electrical differences throughout the murine left atrial myocardium that could underlie regional differences in arrhythmia susceptibility. We used high-resolution optical mapping and sharp microelectrode recordings to quantify regional differences in electrical activation and repolarisation within the intact, superfused murine left atrium and quantified regional ion channel mRNA expression by Taqman Low Density Array. We also performed selected cellular electrophysiology experiments to validate regional differences in ion channel function. Spontaneous ectopic activity was observed during sustained 1 Hz pacing in 10 / 19 intact LA and this was abolished following resection of <b>LAPW</b> (0 / 19 resected LA, P< 0. 001). The source of the ectopic activity was the <b>LAPW</b> myocardium, distinct from the pulmonary vein sleeve and LAA, determined by optical mapping. Overall, <b>LAPW</b> action potentials (APs) were ca. 40 % longer than the LAA and this region displayed more APD heterogeneity. mRNA expression of Kcna 4, Kcnj 3 and Kcnj 5 was lower in the <b>LAPW</b> myocardium than in the LAA. Cardiomyocytes isolated from the <b>LAPW</b> had decreased Ito and a reduced IKACh current density at {{both positive and negative}} test potentials. The murine <b>LAPW</b> myocardium has a different electrical phenotype and ion channel mRNA expression profile compared with other regions of the LA, and this is associated with increased ectopic activity. If similar regional electrical differences are present in the human LA, then the <b>LAPW</b> may be a potential future target for treatment of atrial fibrillation...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} {{the accuracy of the}} linearized augmented plane wave method (<b>LAPW)</b> we present a new approach where the plane wave basis function is augmented by two different atomic radial components constructed at two different linearization energies corresponding to two different electron bands (or energy windows). We demonstrate that this case can be reduced to the standard treatment within the <b>LAPW</b> paradigm where the usual basis set is enriched by the basis functions of the tight binding type, which go to zero with zero derivative at the sphere boundary. We show that the task is closely related with the problem of extended core states which is currently solved by applying the <b>LAPW</b> method with local orbitals (LAPW+LO). In comparison with LAPW+LO, the number of supplemented basis functions in our approach is doubled, which opens up a new channel for the extension of the <b>LAPW</b> and LAPW+LO basis sets. The appearance of new supplemented basis functions absent in the LAPW+LO treatment is closely related with the existence of the u̇_l-component in the canonical <b>LAPW</b> method. We discuss properties of additional tight binding basis functions and apply the extended basis set for computation of electron energy bands of lanthanum (face and body centered structures) and hexagonal close packed lattice of cadmium. We demonstrate that the new treatment gives lower total energies in comparison with both canonical <b>LAPW</b> and LAPW+LO, with the energy difference more pronounced for intermediate and poor <b>LAPW</b> basis sets.

Further explorations {{of the role of the}} individual atomic orbitals in explaining various aspects of research in these materials, including experimental work, would benefit from the availability of a tight-binding(TB) Hamiltonian that reproduces accurately the first-principles band structure results. In this work we have used the NRL-TB method to construct a TB Hamiltonian from Linearized Augmented Plane Wave(LAPW) results. Our TB model includes the Fe d-orbitals, and the p-orbitals from both As and O for the prototype material LaOFeAs.

5|$|Although {{the tree}} sparrow has been {{expanding}} its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe, populations have been declining {{in much of}} western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark, corn bunting and northern <b>lapwing.</b> From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations {{seems to have been}} particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000–1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.|$|E

We find a first-order transition at a pressure of about 105 GPa for the cubic lattice, consistent with earlier <b>LAPW</b> results, but much lower than obtained with the LMTO.

The ab-initio calculations were performed by the linear augmented plane wave (<b>LAPW)</b> method within the density functional theory to obtain the equations of state for a number of crystal structures of the Ti-Al system. Some of the calculated <b>LAPW</b> energies were used for fitting the potentials while others for examining their quality. The potentials correctly predict the equilibrium crystal structures of the phases and accurately reproduce their basic lattice properties. The potentials are applied to calculate the energies of point defects, surfaces, planar faults in the equilibrium structures. Unlike earlier EAM potentials for the Ti-Al system, the proposed potentials provide reasonable description of the lattice thermal expansion, demonstrating their usefulness in the molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo studies at high temperatures. The energy along the tetragonal deformation path (Bain transformation) in gamma-TiAl calculated with the EAM potential is in a fairly good agreement with <b>LAPW</b> calculations. Equilibrium point defect concentrations in gamma-TiAl are studied using the EAM potential. It is found that antisite defects strongly dominate over vacancies at all compositions around stoichiometry, indicating that gamm-TiAl is an antisite disorder compound in agreement with experimental data.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether the heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) marker of oxidative stress was more expressed in left atrial sites with stronger structural remodeling in patients affected by chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF) and mitral valve disease (MD). Myocardial samples were taken from the left atrial posterior wall (<b>LAPW)</b> and left atrial appendage (LAA) of 24 patients with CAF-MD in addition to 10 autopsy controls. The levels of HO- 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and HO- 1 protein in each pathologic <b>LAPW</b> and LAA were quantified using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, light microscopy was used to morphometrically evaluate the differential myocyte and interstitial changes in the same CAF-MD LAPWand LAA samples. In controls, HO- 1 protein was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Unlike controls, patients with CAF-MD had higher levels of HO- 1 mRNA and its protein product, expressed as LAPW/LAA ratios, in the <b>LAPW</b> (2. 18 ± 1. 18, P<. 0001, and 1. 55 ± 0. 67, P b. 005), and their <b>LAPW</b> also showed greater histologic changes in myocytolytic myocytes (15. 1 % ± 3. 1 % versus 6. 9 % ± 3. 3 %, P<. 0001), interstitial fibrosis (8. 2 % ± 2. 2 % versus 2. 8 % ± 1. 2 %, P<. 0001), and capillary density (816 ± 120 number/mm 2 versus 1114 ± 188 number/mm 2; P<. 05). In addition, markers of oxidative stress were immunohistochemically studied with antinitrotyrosine and anti-iNOS antibodies. In patients with CAF-MD, the inducible enzyme HO- 1 is more expressed in the left atrial areas that show greater structural remodeling.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{extended}} {{the applicability of}} the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method, one of the most precise, versatile and generally applicable electronic structure methods for solids working within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), to orbital-dependent functionals for the exchange-correlation (xc) energy. In contrast to the commonly applied local-density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the xc energy, orbital-dependent functionals depend directly on the Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals and only indirectly on the density. Two different schemes that deal with orbital-dependent functionals, the KS and the generalized Kohn-Sham (gKS) formalism, have been realized. While the KS scheme requires a local multiplicative xc potential, the gKS scheme allows for a non-local potential in the one-particle Schrödinger equations. Hybrid functionals, combining some amount of the orbital-dependent exact exchange energy with local or semi-local functionals of the density, are implemented within the gKS scheme. We work in particular with the PBE 0 hybrid of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof. Our implementation relies on a representation of the non-local exact exchange potential – its calculation constitutes the most time consuming step in a practical calculation – by an auxiliary mixed product basis (MPB). In this way, the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian corresponding to the non-local potential become a Brillouin-zone (BZ) sum over vector-matrix-vector products. Several techniques are developed and explored to further accelerate our numerical scheme. We show PBE 0 results for a variety of semiconductors and insulators. In comparison with experiment, the PBE 0 functional leads to improved band gaps and an improved description of localized states. Even for the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO with localized 4 f electrons, the electronic and magnetic properties are correctly described by the PBE 0 functional. Subsequently, we discuss the construction of the local, multiplicative exact exchange (EXX) potential from the non-local, orbital-dependent exact exchange energy. For this purpose we employ the optimized effective potential (OEP) method. Central ingredients of the OEP equation are the KS wave-function response and the single-particle density response function. A formulation in terms of a slightly modified MPB enables to solve the OEP integral equation for the local potential without any shape approximations for the potential. We show that a balance between the <b>LAPW</b> and mixed product basis is mandatory for a smooth and physical local EXX potential. The <b>LAPW</b> basis must be converged to an accuracy which is far beyond that for LDA or GGA calculations. We demonstrate that this is necessary to lend the <b>LAPW</b> basis and thus the KS wave functions and density sufficient flexibility to react adequately to the changes of the effective potential, which are described in our formalism by the MPB. If both basis sets are properly balanced, our results for C, Si, SiC, Ge, GaAs as well as solid Ne and Ar are in favorable agreement with plane-wave pseudopotential results. Because of the exceedingly large <b>LAPW</b> basis sets the EXX-OEP approach is computationally expensive. We propose a correction, the finite basis-set correction (FBC), for the density and wave-function response, which explicitly considers the dependence of the <b>LAPW</b> basis on the effective potential and which vanishes in the limit of an infinite, complete basis. For the example of ScN, we demonstrate that the FBC leads to converged potentials at much smaller <b>LAPW</b> basis sets and thus turns the EXX-OEP approach into a practical method. Finally, we discuss a generalization of the formalism to metals and report results for the cubic perovskites CaTiO 3, SrTiO 3, and BaTiO 3, the transition-metal oxides MnO, FeO, and CoO as well as the metals Al, Na, and Cu...|$|R
