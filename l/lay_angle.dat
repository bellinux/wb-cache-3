In {{order to improve}} the mechanical strength of LVL, metal net was inserted into the LVL (metal net-LVL composite) made of fast-growing poplar. In this study, the effects of compression ratio and <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> of metal net (which is <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> for short in this paper) on the mechanical properties of the metal net-LVL composite was investigated in a comparative way. In order {{to find out the}} optimum compression ratio and <b>lay</b> <b>angle,</b> the modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE) and horizontal shear strength of the metal net-LVL composite were tested. The results showed that the effects of the compression ratio on MOR, MOE and horizontal shear strength were significant, with increasing of compression ratio, the values of MOR and MOE showed an earlier raised and later decreased state, and had the maximum values at 31 %. The effects of <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> on MOR and MOE were significant, the values of MOR and MOE increased first and then decreased with <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> increasing, and the maximum values were obtained at 20 °, though there were no significant effects on horizontal shear strength, there were the maximum values at 20 °. Therefore, when the compression ratio was 31 % and the <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> was 20 °, the metal net-LVL composite could obtain the optimal overall mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{was carried}} out during the spring {{semester}} of 2014 at Department of Marine Technology in Norwegian University of Science and Technology. It was a continuous work of the master project during autumn semester 2013. The tasks of this thesis were given by Aker Solutions Umbilicals. The background of this thesis is that the dynamic IPC umbilical was delivered by Aker Solutions in Africa. In this thesis the central concerns were to perform bending fatigue analyses of the umbilical cross section and to propose strategies to calculate the fatigue life given the histogram of curvatures with corresponding frequencies of occurrence. Furthermore, parameter studies including meant tension, tension frequency, bending frequency and <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> were carried out to find the critical parameter {{with respect to the}} fatigue life of the umbilical. This topic is important within the field of oil and gas because umbilicals are always exposed to dynamic(cyclic) loading, and inspection after installation is impossible. Finite element software USAP was utilized to perform bending fatigue analyses. The developed model in USAP was applied in order to obtain the force-time relationship and moment-force relationship. Then, the strategy of fatigue life calculation was proposed based on the results from finite element analyses and Miner's rule. The necessary input data were from Aker Solutions Umbilicals. The overall conclusion is that the model made in USAP is capable of performing bending fatigue analysis taking friction between PVC profile and the other components into account for simple cases. Mean tension and <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> are critical parameters for the fatigue performance of copper conductors in the umbilical cross section. The results achieved were in agreement with the accepted knowledge. However, more studies are needed in the future on parameter study of <b>lay</b> <b>angle,</b> because there exists some monotonous relation between the <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> and the stress in a certain small interval of the <b>lay</b> <b>angle,</b> but non monotonous relation in large interval. The sequence of loadings is also required to be studied in the future. Further, the validity of these findings should be verified through full scale tests. </p...|$|E
40|$|Brush seals are {{comprised}} of fine diameter fibers densely packed between retaining and backing plates. To achieve seal compliance bristles {{are arranged to}} contact rotor with some <b>lay</b> <b>angle.</b> When axial pressure load is applied, bristles interlock and get stuck at the backing plate, and seal stiffness varies under operating conditions. Operating stiffness is critical to determine seal-rotor contact pressure and wear life. Typically, seal stiffness is measured by pressing a curved shoe to brush bore as reported in open literature. Due to the complex nature of pressure-stiffness bristle behavior, static and unpressurized measurements cannot represent actual working seal stiffness. This work presents a brush seal stiffness measurement system {{that is capable of}} measuring seal stiffness under working pressure and speed conditions. Rotor speed is achieved by an integrated spindle drive, while contact forces are measured via sensitive load cells. Rotor excursions are applied through lateral motions of the seal housing that is actuated by a motorized linear slide. Stiffness testing methodology and calibration procedure are discussed. Comparative experimental data are presented for both static pressurized and dynamic-pressurized stiffness tests...|$|E

40|$|Guided {{waves are}} {{commonly}} used to control large components such as plates and tubes since they have the advantage to spread over long distances with little loss of energy. Because of the dispersive and multimodal behaviour of guided waves, simulation becomes a very helpful tool for a proper analysis of these tests. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to numerically investigate the effect of axial preload on the propagation of elastic waves in helical waveguides. Typical applications are springs and multi-wire strands. The study of wave propagation in prestressed helical structures requires the development of the equation of dynamics in a helical coordinate system. The three dimensional equilibrium equations of prestressed dynamics are rewritten in the helical covariant and contravariant bases. The problem then becomes translationnally invariant along the waveguide axis and can be solved with a semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) technique. The problem is hereby reduced to the two-dimensions of the cross-section. The SAFE eigenproblem can be solved by setting the wavenumber and finding the angular frequency or inversely. This numerical model is validated by an analytical model of wave propagation in a helical Timoshenko beam under axial preload. Dispersion curves for single straight and helical wires are computed to quantify the effect of prestress. For small <b>lay</b> <b>angles,</b> the dispersion curves for wavenumbers as well as energy velocities present small differences with the infinite straight cylinder. The effect of prestress is significant for lower frequencies. Some results are also obtained for helix with larger <b>lay</b> <b>angles...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the RS- 68 turbopumps {{requires}} that the hydrogen seals separating the pump from the turbine must have extremely low levels of leakage and be contained in small packages. Conventional seal technologies {{are not able to}} reasonably satisfy such design requirements. A review of experimental measurements and analysis publications suggests that brush seals are well suited for the design requirements. Brush seals are shown to have less leakage than conventional labyrinth and damper seals and have no adverse effects on the rotordynamics of the machine. The bulk-flow analysis presented by Hendricks et al. is used as a guideline to create a spreadsheet that provides mass flow through the seal and heat generated by the rubbing contact of the bristles on the shaft. The analysis is anchored to published data for LN 2 and LH 2 leakage tests. Finally, the analysis is used to design seals for both applications. It is observed that the most important analysis parameter is the thickness of the bristle pack and its relationship to seal clearance, <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> and pressure drop...|$|E
40|$|When single {{armoured}} cables {{are under}} tension they {{will start to}} twist in direction depending on the <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> of the armour wires on the cable. The cables start to twist due to the induced torque that appear within the cable and this induced torque can in the worst-case cause loops and kinks on the cable. These negative consequences are the subject to exploration by implementing a known analytical solution developed by Lanteigne (1985), into an external function in OrcaFlex which is a finite element software program capable of solving 3 D non-linear arbitrarily deflections. It is specifically designed {{to be used for}} doing static and dynamic analysis on marine and offshore structures. Different cable installation scenarios cases have been created and some of these are validated through experimental testing at the testing facility at ABB, Karlskrona. The results from the different cases shows a good representation of the real twist and rotation of the cable. However, results also conclude that the induced torque that appear within the cable was not possible to be correctly represented by applying external torque from an external function.

At the same time, the dynamicload from wave and current will force the pipe to bend cyclically which will cause thetransverse buckling within the tensile layers. The end of pipe will rotate due to the transversebuckling mechanism during each cycle, resulting in a serious end rotation to make the pipe collapse. This thesis will study transverse buckling behaviour under different loading conditionsand performthe sensitivity analysis to study the influence of the relevant characteristic parameters. This section will briefly summarize the main contents and conclusions in the thesis. &# 149; INTRODUCTIONChapter 1 is the introduction of the master thesis, including the study motivation, previous literatureoverview about this topic, the main contributions of this thesis and the structure of therest thesis. &# 149; LITERATURE STUDYChapter 2 and Chapter 3 are the literature study, focusing on the flexible pipe technology, failuremodes and design criteria. Chapter 2 includes an introduction to the flexible pipe applicationsin the offshore industry, flexible pipe structure and termination of riser. Chapter 3 is a briefintroduction of failure modes and design criteria. &# 149; THEORY AND METHODChapter 4 is an introduction to the linear finite element methods and non-linear finite elementmethods and the relevant non-linear code used in FEM software, Bflex 2010 andMarc. The theorybackground of the finite element model established in Bflex 2010 and the analytical methodsfor stress and buckling analysis in tensile armour are also shown in this chapter. The physicalinterpretation of the lateral buckling failure mode is shown as well. &# 149; MODEL ESTABLISHMENTChapter 5 is an introduction of the model establishment, including the simplified model(onetendon without friction) and the full model(all the layers including anti-buckling tape). Thedetermination of loading conditions, boundary conditions and relevant important parametersare also introduced. &# 149; BUCKLING PERFORMANCE STUDY OF SIMPLIFIED MODELChapter 6 is the lateral buckling study of the simplified model, including the influence of layangle, start angle and imperfection. Three sensitivity studies for the time interval, axisymmetricinteraction and start procedure in Bflex 2010 are also carried out. <b>Lay</b> <b>angle</b> will have a big influence on the buckling occurring positions during the processof loading, {{but it is hard to}} predict. However, the buckling load capacity will be increased dueto the decrease of <b>lay</b> <b>angle,</b> which is testified by the analytical solution and tests in Bflex 2010. The start angle will have no influence on the buckling load capacity except the buckling occurringpositions. The imperfection will lead to a sudden axial force increase in the tendon whichis shown as a snap in the realistic physical issues. This phenomenon will be presented and explainedin the thesis. For the sensitivity study, the following conclusions can be obtained: 1) The length of timeinterval will decide the accuracy of the test in Bflex 2010. The smaller time interval will capturethe buckling behavior at the beginning of the process. 2) The axisymmetric interaction and startprocedure will not have a significant influence on the test results. &# 149; BUCKLING PERFORMANCE STUDY OF FULLMODELChapter 7 is the lateral buckling study of the full model, including the comparison with the simplifiedmodel under the same load conditions, the detail study of the lateral buckling of tendonsand the end rotation of riser caused by lateral buckling due to the cyclic bending. The results of full model are also close to the analytical solution and a little more conservativethan the simplified model. The end rotation behaviour due to transverse buckling is studiedby full model, which can simulate the failure modes in a right way and the results will be closeto the experimental results if the additional axial stiffness of pipes in experiments is provided. The sensitivity study is performed to study the effect of anti-buckling tape. The results showthat the anti-buckling tape has a large effect to prevent the transverse buckling and the <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> direction of the anti-buckling tapewill also affect the transverse buckling behaviour and preventthe buckling process to a great extent. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{new model}} for calculating the {{response}} of electrical cables to bending has been developed accounting for multi-order helical structure and frictional effects. Stresses occurring in wires {{and the number of}} slipping wires were suggested as key properties in terms of expectation of cable life time. The model was applied to chosen cables and the magnitudes of the mentioned key properties were calculated. Parametric study was also done to investigate how these values are affected by changing the properties of the cable. It has been shown that increasing the pressure from jacket or insulation material causes larger stress while it prevents the slippage of wires. Applying a tensile force to the cable produces the same result, whereas using larger <b>lay</b> <b>angles</b> for both conductors and wires decreases internal stress and prevents the slippage...|$|R
40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design [© IMechE].

The final closed-form formulations can handle both the no-slip and/or the traditionally used full-slip coupled extensional/torsional constitutive equations for helically wound cables, and describe the various characteristics of the resulting pairs of axial or torsional waves at any location along the cable with one end fixed against movement and the other end subjected to impact loading. By using extensive numerical results, which cover {{the full range of}} current manufacturing limits for the <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> (with this being the sole controlling geometrical parameter as far as the axial/torsional stiffnesses are concerned), it is shown that significant differences exist between a number of axial/torsional wave characteristics, depending on whether the no-slip or the full-slip version of the constitutive relations is used in the analysis. It is demonstrated that modest increases in the magnitudes of the lay angles can lead to significant increases in the differences between the no-slip and the full-slip wave propagation characteristics. The present findings may have significant practical implications in relation to the currently adopted techniques used by industry for calibrating the electronic boxes, which are subsequently used as permanently installed devices, for the in situ detection of individual wire fractures under, say, fatigue loading associated with cable-supported structures...|$|E
40|$|Brush seals {{have proven}} to be an {{attractive}} alternative to labyrinth seals for turbomachinery applications. This advanced seal technology utilizes both the high temperature capability of special-alloy wire and flexure adaptability of fibers to accommodate a wide range of operating situations. Because the bristles slide against the rotor surface, contact forces generated at the interface of the rotor and fiber tips can lead to eventual bristle fatigue and wear of the seal/rotor system. Therefore, it is important to develop reliable modeling techniques that can help identify complex relationships among brush seal design parameters, in-service load and contact forces that arise during operation of turbomachinery. The first portion of the current research is concerned with modeling and evaluating bristle deformation, bending stress and bristle/rotor contact forces that are generated at the interface of the fiber and rotor surface due to interference between the bristle/rotor and radial fluid flow, which is derived from aerodynamic forces termed 2 ̆ 2 blow-down 2 ̆ 2. In plane large displacement mechanics analysis was applied. Contact forces are obtained for a range of brush seal design parameters including fiber <b>lay</b> <b>angle,</b> flexural rigidity and length. The second portion of this research examines hysteresis, which is a major phenomenon that affects brush seal leakage and wear performance. Two mechanics models were developed to examine the hysteresis, namely, the role of distributed inter bristle friction force on hysteresis phenomenon and the bristle/back plate interaction model for assessing the hysteresis phenomenon. Nonlinear beam theory (2 D) and general beam theory (3 D) are applied for solving bristle deformation in the above two mechanics models, respectively. Hysteresis is quantified as the differential work done by friction force during a load cycle, and the consequence of hysteresis [...] 2 ̆ 2 gapping 2 ̆ 2 is explored as well. This systematic analysis of brush seal system is expected to provide valuable information for the development of new brush seals that exhibit improved performance, including reduced bristle/shaft wear, low hysteresis, and reduced leakage between successive stages of the turbine...|$|E
40|$|Elastic guided {{waves are}} of {{interest}} for the non destructive evaluation of cables. Such structures are usually helical, multi-wired and highly prestressed, which greatly complicates the understanding of wave propagation from a theoretical point of view. A remarkable feature is the occurence of a missing frequency band in experimental time-frequency diagrams, {{sometimes referred to as}} notch frequency in the literature. The central frequency of this band increases under tensile loads. Recently, a numerical model has been proposed to compute the dispersion curves of prestressed helical seven-wire waveguides. Results have shown that the notch frequency indeed corresponds to a curve veering phenomenon between two longitudinal-like modes and that the increase of the notch under tensile loads is mainly due to interwire contact mechanisms. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} highlight the origin of this curve veering phenomenon, which is still unexplained up to the author's knowledge. This paper also provides further results which allow to clarify the accuracy of numerical solutions as well as the influence of contact assumptions. First, the static part of the model, necessary to compute the prestress state including contact effects, is checked from reference analytical solutions. Owing to the importance of contact, the accuracy of results is discussed both in statics and in dynamics. The influence of slip contact conditions is outlined. Then, some numerical tests are conducted by varying the Poisson coefficient and the helix <b>lay</b> <b>angle.</b> These tests allows to find out that the radial displacement constraint imposed on peripheral wires by the central one in the contact regions constitutes the main source of curve veering. More precisely, it is shown that a similar curve veering does occur for an uncoupled single peripheral wire when constrained by a radially blocked motion localised in its contact zone. Indeed, such a localised boundary condition completely breaks the circular symmetry of the wire cross-section, yielding coupling between longitudinal, flexural and torsional motion together with curve veering phenomena...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this paper}} is to {{theoretically}} investigate the propagation of elastic waves in helical waveguides. In the context of non-destructive evaluation for structural health monitoring, this study is motivated by the need for inspecting helical structures such as cables or springs.

The proposed method relies on a non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system that is translationally invariant along the helix centreline, so that a Fourier transform is explicitly performed and the problem is reduced to two dimensions. Some useful expressions are also derived for the averaged energy and flux in order to directly compute the energy velocity. The convergence and accuracy of the proposed method are then assessed by comparing finite element results with reference solutions. A dispersion analysis inside a 7. 5 ° helical wire, typically encountered in civil engineering cables, is realised including attenuation due to material damping.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Extensive parametric studies have been carried out, using the orthotropic sheet theoretical model of Hobbs and Raoof, {{on a wide range}} of spiral strand constructions, with outside diameters, d, and lay angles, a, in the practical ranges, 16. 4 mm ≤ d ≤ 184 mm, and 11 ≤ α ≤ 24, respectively. The effects of an external hydrostatic pressure on certain structural characteristics of sealed spiral strands, used in deep water applications, have also been studied in some detail, for water depths ranging from 0 m to 2000 m. The results, based on such theoretical parametric studies, have, for example, been used to refute claims by Jolicoeur that, by a simple modification, a significant improvement to the original orthotropic sheet model of Hobbs and Raoof, had been found. In addition, using such studies, axial fatigue life design S-N curves have been developed, which cater for the effects of an externally applied hydrostatic pressure on sheathed spiral strands. Simple (hand-based) formulations have also been developed for estimating the maximum frictional axial and torsional hysteresis along with,the associated axial load range/mean axial load, and range of twist/ 2, respectively, at which they occur, relating to both, the in-air conditions and also when a sheathed spiral strand is subjected to an external hydrostatic pressure. The previously reported work of Raoof and his associates, in connection with the response of helical cables (spiral strands and/or wire ropes) to impact loading, has been extended to include the development of closed-form solutions for predicting the extensional-torsional wave speeds and displacements, in axially preloaded helical cables, experiencing a half-sine type of impact loading at one end, with the other end fixed.

40|$|A {{flexible}} riser {{operating in}} deep water will experience large environmental forces. Due {{to the length of}} the riser, dynamic tension from drag forces will be substantial. The tensile force is transferred directly into the end fitting, and fatigue damage may be critical at this point. In addition, the large hydrostatic pressure at the ocean floor may induce compressive stresses in the tensile armor, something this component is not designed for. In connection with these challenges, this thesis deals with two different phenomenons relevant for deep water risers: Local stresses in tensile armor wires at the end fitting due to contraint effects. Radial and lateral buckling of tensile armor wires. The first part of this report, section 2 and 3, {{is the result of a}} literature study regarding flexible pipe technology, failure modes and design criteria with special focus on those relevant for deep water applications. In section 4, theory important to the thesis work is presented. This includes analytical methods for stress analysis of flexible pipes, theory of thin curved beams, basic theory of restrained warping and finite element methods. In the last part of section 4, a new curved beam element for the nonlinear finite element program Aflex is presented. A central part of the thesis work has been to implement this new element into the original Aflex code. The element has rotational degrees of freedom about the bi-normal direction in addition to the degrees of freedom included in the original Aflex code. Hence, the element is capable of investigating both radial and lateral buckling modes. The element has also been implemented in a special version of the Bflex 2010 computer program. Section 5 is dedicated to analyses of stresses in tensile armor wires at the end fitting. The load case considered is axial straining of the pipe, which leads to a small change in <b>lay</b> <b>angle.</b> As the wires are restrained at the end fitting, a change in <b>lay</b> <b>angle</b> will not be allowed, and this constraint will induce local stresses. First, analytical calculations neglecting friction between the armor wire and supporting layer are performed for different wire dimensions. Next, the new curved beam element is used for numerical analyses of the same cases, and the transverse bending stress at the end fixation is studied for varying friction coeffcients. Both analytical and numerical results show that the relative magnitude of the local transverse bending stress increases as the axial straining of the pipe increase. As an example, the bending stress is found to exceed 16 % of the nominal axial stress when the axial stress is 400 MPa, for a flexible pipe including two tensile armor layers and a friction coeffcient of 0. 15. Section 6 deals with different buckling modes for tensile armor wires. Three different modes are presented, namely radial failure due to anti buckling tape rupture, radial elastic buckling and lateral buckling. Analytical formulas for predicting the capacity with respect to all three modes are established, and governing physical effects are discussed. Numerical analyses with the new curved beam element are performed, and the results are compared to the analytical solutions. It is found that the first radial failure mode is determined primarily by the strength of the anti buckling tape, while the elasticity of the tape is critical to the second radial mode. Comparison between the analytical solutions and finite element results indicate that the radial failure modes are accurately predicted by both methods. The lateral buckling capacity is more diffcult to predict, as the behaviour is dominated by friction forces, and the stick-slip transition. However, analytical and numerical results all indicate a strong dependence upon friction coeffcient and pipe curvature. The finite element model reports the lowest capacity, and these results are also believed to be the most accurate due to the more realistic modelling of friction. A smaller investigation of the lateral buckling capacity under cyclic curvature is done with the FE model, and it is found that buckling of tensile armor wires may occur after a number of curvature cycles even if the combination of stress and curvature is significantly lower than critical in static curvature conditions. The results from these analyses are unfortunately somewhat unclear, as they were found to be slightly influenced by the numerical parameters defining the friction springs. Nevertheless it is concluded that lateral buckling may occur as a result of gradual transverse slip under cyclic curvature conditions, and that this may happen for curvatures in the vicinity of 0. 1 m − 1 combined with a compressive stress in the armor wire equal to 300 MPa, given a friction coefficient of 0. 15.  </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{measurements of}} power loss and leakage in a hybrid brush seal (HBS) for increasing pressure differentials {{and over a}} range of rotor speeds. The test HBS, Haynes- 25 bristle pack [~ 850 bristles/cm] and 45 o <b>lay</b> <b>angle,</b> is 166. 4 mm in diameter and integrates 20 -arcuate pads connected with thin EDM-webs to the seal casing. The measured drag power at low rotor speeds (< 11 m/s at 1, 300 rpm) decreases as the pressure differential across the seal increases. At a fixed rotor speed, a significant drop in drag torque (and drag power) ensues as the supply pressure increases, thus demonstrating a gas film separates the rotor from the seal pads. A constant operating temperature (~ 24 oC) at the rotor/seal interface during tests with shaft rotation also indicates the absence of intermittent contact between the seal pads and rotor. Flow rate measurements at room temperature (25 oC) show an improved sealing ability with a leakage reduction of about 36 %, when compared to a 1 st generation shoedbrush seal. The HBS predicted effective clearance (~ 50 ?m) is {{a small fraction of}} that in an equivalent one-tooth labyrinth seal. Identified HBS direct stiffness coefficients decrease (~ 15 %) as function of rotor speed for an increasing supply pressure condition (Pr = 1. 7 and 2. 4). The identified cross-coupled stiffness is at least one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the direct stiffness coefficient. The cross-coupled mass is negligible for all tested rotor speeds and supply pressures. The HBS energy dissipation mechanism is characterized in terms of a loss factor (?) and dry friction coefficient (?). The direct HBS viscous damping coefficient is strongly dependent on the excitation frequency, while showing minimal dependence on rotor speed or supply pressure. The HBS novel configuration incorporates pads contacting on assembly the shaft; and which under rotor spinning; lift off due to the generation of a hydrodynamic pressure. Experimental results obtained show that hybrid brush seals (HBS) are a viable alternative to overcoming the major drawbacks of labyrinth seals; namely excessive leakage and potential for rotordynamic instability. Additionally, during operation a gas film in HBS eliminates rotor and bristle wear, as well as thermal distortions; which are commonly known limitations of conventional brush seals...|$|E

By comparing the measured data in three load directions, it is found that the differences of platform motions are mainly derived from the wave loads and larger pitch motion can always be observed in one of the directions. To make certain the mechanism underlying the observed phenomena, a coupled multi-body dynamic model of the floating wind turbine is established and validated. The numerical results demonstrate that the second-order hydrodynamic forces contribute greatly to the directionality distinctions for surge and pitch, and the first-order hydrodynamic forces determine the variations of tower base bending moments and nacelle accelerations. These findings indicate the directionality effects should be predetermined comprehensively before installation at sea, which is important for the operation and maintenance of the Y-shape floating wind turbines...|$|R

50|$|John Bland, an {{architecture}} professor at McGill University, developed the town's first master plan in 1944. Bland located the town between the existing Highway 17 and the Ottawa River. He designed {{a system of}} streets which generally followed {{the contours of the}} area's topography. Residential neighborhoods stretched out from a commercial and service-sector core. Straight and broad avenues ran along contour lines, while narrower and winding streets <b>lay</b> at right <b>angles,</b> discouraging non-local traffic from entering neighborhoods. Parks and schools were scattered strategically throughout the town. The streets were named after local flora, Canadian politicians and famous scientists such as Rutherford and Darwin.|$|R
2500|$|The three mummies with painted portraits {{lay at the}} bottom; {{they were}} those of the woman Aline and of two female children. The two masked mummies <b>lay</b> at right <b>angles</b> on top of them; they were those {{of a man and}} of a {{somewhat}} older girl. The two undecorated mummies, in turn, lay on top, again at right angles. On the mummies of the man, the woman and the three girls, the wrapping had been additionally secured with clay sealings, using different sealstones. One depicted Heracles fighting the Nemean lion, the others heads. Not all sealings are preserved. The gravegoods included a clay pot with a spray of flowers, as is typical for such graves. There was also a roughly hewn stele bearing the following Greek inscription: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1720, Adams {{purchased}} {{a farm in}} what is now Quincy, Massachusetts (then called the [...] "north precinct" [...] of Braintree, Massachusetts). The location of his farm, and where his children were born, is now part of Adams National Historical Park. This saltbox house, a simple and common dwelling characterized by its sloping roof, is operated by the National Park Service as the John Adams Birthplace, and is open to the public. On December 19, 1960, the birthplace was designated a National Historic Landmark. [...] The future President lived here with his parents on the farm until 1764, when he married Abigail Smith. It is {{a few feet from the}} John Quincy Adams Birthplace. Oddly, his house <b>lay</b> at an <b>angle</b> to the road.|$|R
5000|$|Some early reviews {{criticized the}} One Max for its CPU {{specifications}} (specifically, using the older Snapdragon 600 processor {{instead of a}} newer 800 model), its use of the same camera as the HTC One, and the awkward placement of the fingerprint scanner. Vlad Savov of The Verge particularly felt that the sensor, which requires users to vertically swipe it when scanning, was positioned {{too close to the}} camera, and required an [...] "uncomfortable" [...] hand position to use properly because a user's fingers would naturally <b>lay</b> at an <b>angle</b> on the rear of the device in normal use. The 5.9" [...] display, dual front-facing speakers, removable back cover with expandable storage, the power button placement, and the ability to customize or remove BlinkFeed were praised.|$|R

40|$|By n-nonylamine (NA) {{intercalation}} into PbI_ 2, NA/PbI_ 2 {{composite materials}} were synthesized with the molar ratio, n, of NA for PbI_ 2 of 0 ～ 4. The energy gap {{was found to}} change from 2. 43 eV to 3. 20 eV by NA intercalation from the transmittance spectra. In particular, it increased rapidly at n = 0 ～ 1. It was also found from the X-ray diffraction measurement that NA 2 ̆ 7 s in the van der Waals gaps formed 2 -layers for n≧ 1, and <b>lay</b> tilted at <b>angles</b> of 53. 8 ° or 30. 1 ° to the c-axis direction.

5|$|When the Prussians broke camp, {{they left}} {{a handful of}} light troops to {{demonstrate}} before the French advance post commanded by the Comte de Saint Germain. These light troops constituted the flank guard on the Schartau hill, which <b>lay</b> at right <b>angles</b> to the Janus and Pölzen. Frederick {{had no intention of}} either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit twice as fast as the Allies' army. If, at the moment of contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.|$|R
50|$|She {{suffered}} {{engine failure}} at 1200 in stormy conditions and, although able to restart her main engine, {{she was not}} able to generate enough power to prevent the gale force winds from blowing her towards shore. Her anchor took hold 1.7 miles off the coast but its chain broke at 1900 and attempts by the V/s Ægir of the Icelandic Coast Guard to attach a towing line were unsuccessful in the heavy seas. The Vikartindur ran aground at 2100 at 63 degrees 43.9 minutes north, 20 degrees 52.4 minutes west at 2100 and the crew of 19 were rescued by a helicopter of the Icelandic Coast Guard. Once stranded the ship <b>lay</b> at an <b>angle</b> of 40 degrees and soon broke her back, precluding any attempt to refloat her. The ship was carrying 2,900 tons of cargo in containers.|$|R
