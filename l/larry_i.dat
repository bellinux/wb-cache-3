25|$|In February 1972, Cunningham married Beatrice Nannery, {{who worked}} for him {{managing}} a supermarket which he owned. They had four children and two grandchildren. He died on 28 September 2012, following {{a long period of}} illness. Among those to pay tribute were U.S. country singer Robert Mizzell who said: “I am so saddened to hear of the passing of country legend <b>Larry.</b> <b>I</b> admired his talent and quick humour. My thoughts are with his family, friends, and the fans who loved the big deep voice that rattled the radio waves”.|$|E
500|$|Although Lennon would lament {{this period}} publicly, {{he did not}} in private. Journalist Larry Kane, who befriended Lennon in 1964, wrote a {{comprehensive}} biography of Lennon which detailed the [...] "Lost Weekend" [...] period. In the interview with Kane, Lennon explained his feelings about his time with Pang: [...] "You know <b>Larry,</b> <b>I</b> {{may have been the}} happiest I've ever been... I loved this woman (Pang), I made some beautiful music and I got so fucked up with booze and shit and whatever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{spent his}} early years in various rock bands {{including}} Pharroh and Michigan-based band Toby Redd. Pharroh's percussionist Larry Fratangelo, who also worked with Parliament-Funkadelic, introduced Smith to R and funk music and {{taught him how to}} play funk. Smith said, [...] "I think up until then, I was a drummer. Once I studied with <b>Larry,</b> <b>I</b> turned into a musician." [...] Funk drummers like David Garibaldi, Jabo Starks, Clyde Stubblefield, and Greg Errico caught his attention and influenced his style a lot. Later, Smith decided to move to California to pursue his musical aspirations.|$|E

60|$|<b>LARRY.</b> Then <b>I</b> {{carried it}} on my back down the street, round a corner, to an archway.|$|R
60|$|<b>LARRY.</b> No: <b>I</b> haven't {{exhausted}} {{the interest}} of strolling about the old places and remembering and romancing about them.|$|R

60|$|BROADBENT. No, <b>Larry,</b> <b>I</b> was drunk, I {{am sorry}} to say. I had two {{tumblers}} of punch. She had to lead me home. You must have noticed it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{series was}} often {{described}} as [...] "a show about nothing". However, Seinfeld in 2014 stated [...] "the pitch for the show, the real pitch, when <b>Larry</b> and <b>I</b> went to NBC in 1988, was {{we want to show}} how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and <b>Larry</b> and <b>I</b> to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that." ...|$|R
