40|$|International audienceA stratigraphic {{section in}} the basal Fort Union Formation (Paleocene) in southwestern North Dakota was used to study in detail the post-crisis {{recovery}} {{as well as to}} reconstruct the local environment and its evolution using sedimentology, palynology, fossil floras and vertebrate data. This report will focus on the flora from this site, corresponding to the first appearance data for Paleocene floral recovery, just above the Cretaceous­Tertiary (K/T) Boundary. The studied flora consist of an assemblage of tightly stacked leaves preserved as carbon imprints (also called leaf mats), a preservation condition that makes the extraction of each individual leaf difficult to achieve directly on site. As a result, a new technique was tested, allowing the study of every leaf preserved, their sedimentological context as well as their position relative to each other. A large block of matrix including the leaf mat was jacketed in plaster and was taken to the museum laboratory for analysis under controlled conditions. Preparation consisted of removing sediments at a millimeter scale and recording of placement and orientation of all fossil materials for three-dimensional reconstructions. Using this technique, a description and census of more than 300 leaf specimens was possible within an area of only 0. 5 m 2. The general sedimentological context indicates that the leaves were deposited in a near-stream environment associated with short-term flood events. Detailed information on depositional environment was gathered both by cutting a stratigraphic column from the Hell Creek/Fort Union formational contact up through the basal 4 m of the Fort Union Formation and by studying sediments and leaf preservation mode in detail within the leaf mat. Significant changes in taxonomic abundances correlated with different lithologies was observed, and a leaf species new to the study area was reported. The new methodology proves to be an efficient way to recover additional taphonomic and paleoenvironmental information from leaf mats necessary to understand the depositional dynamics of a fossiliferous <b>leaf</b> <b>site,</b> as well as to improve the record of taxonomic census. In a biostratigraphical prospective, the specimens recovered represent a low-diversity Fort Union flora composed exclusively of dicots that do not exist in the Hell Creek Formation. Preliminary palynological analysis reveal a Cretaceous age for the entire stratigraphic section, implying that the studied leaf mat is part of the FU 0 megafloral zone (as defined by the occurrence of a Fort Union flora with Cretaceous palynomorphs). However, this Cretaceous age attribution for the entire section is questioned due to the occurrence of Paranymphaea crassifolia (part of the Paleocene FUI megafloral zone) within another leaf mat located 266 cm above the base of the coal representing the formational contact, and the occurrence of Paleocene PU 1 mammals, reported from sediment within the leaf block interval...|$|E

Our content-link clustering algorithm {{is based on the}} semantic information embedded in hyperlink structures and document contents. HyPursuit admits multiple, coexisting cluster hierarchies based on different principles for grouping documents, such as the Library of Congress catalog scheme and automatically created hypertext clusters. HyPursuit's abstraction functions summarize cluster contents to support scalable query processing. The abstraction functions satisfy system resource limitations with controlled information loss. The result of query processing operations on a cluster summary approximates the result of performing the operations on the entire information space. We constructed a prototype system comprising 100 leaf World Wide Web sites and a hierarchy of 42 servers that route queries to the <b>leaf</b> <b>sites.</b> Experience with our system suggests that abstraction functions based on hypertext clustering can be used to construct meaningful and scalable cluster hierarchies. We are also encouraged by preliminary results on clustering based on both document contents and hyperlink structures...|$|R
40|$|Plants employ various defences {{killing the}} insect {{attacker}} {{in an early}} stage. Oviposition by cabbage white butterflies (Pieris spp.) on brassicaceous plants, including Brassica nigra, induces a hypersensitive response (HR) - like leaf necrosis promoting desiccation of eggs. To gain a deeper insight into the arms race between butterflies and plants, we conducted field and greenhouse experiments using different B. nigra genotypes. We investigated variation in HR and consequent survival of P. brassicae egg clusters. Impact of egg density, distribution type and humidity on HR formation and egg survival was tested. HR differed among plant genotypes as well as plant individuals. Egg density per plant did not affect HR formation. Remarkably, egg survival did {{not depend on the}} formation of HR, unless butterflies were forced to lay single eggs. Larval hatching success from single eggs was lower on plants expressing HR. This may be due to increased vulnerability of single eggs to low humidity conditions at necrotic <b>leaf</b> <b>sites.</b> We conclude that effectiveness of HR-like necrosis in B. nigra varies with plant genotype, plant individual and the type of egg laying behaviour (singly or clustered). By clustering eggs, cabbage white butterflies can escape the egg-killing, direct plant defence trait...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{trend of}} rapid {{increase}} in routing table sizes at routers comprising the Internet's core is posing a serious challenge to the current Internet's scalability, availability, and stability. Multihoming is a prime contributor to this table size explosion. This paper argues {{that it is possible}} to a) scale the Internet's routing table sub-linearly with degree of multihoming, and b) improve routing convergence times even under pervasive multihoming using simple and incrementally deployable extensions to today's routing protocols. We present an addressing and routing protocol called SIMPLER (Scalable IP Multihoming Protocol LEveraging Routing), which is designed to minimize and contain the propagation in space and time of non-aggregatable routes. SIMPLER's prefix containment property results in lower lookup and route processing costs (promotes scalability), and faster convergence time (helps network availability and stability). SIMPLER vastly diminishes the number of non-aggregatable prefixes appearing in the Internet core due to multihoming (to zero in the absence of network faults, and O(number of faults) otherwise), and always leaks fewer non-aggregatable prefixes than today's dominant multihoming strategy of "hole punching". Additionally, SIMPLER provides Transport-Layer Survivability (TLS) and better routing policy management, while offering the same routing robustness as today's multihoming. The main cost of SIMPLER is the increased use of address space (O(log(network size)) in the average case). SIMPLER is carefully designed to be useful to both multihomed transit providers and multihomed <b>leaf</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

We also demonstrate that regulated auxin gradients control leaf shape in a KNOX-independent fashion and that inappropriate KNOX activity in leaves perturbs these gradients, hence altering leaf shape. We propose that regulatory interactions between auxin, AS 1 and KNOX activities may both direct leaf initiation and sculpt leaf form...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{dealing with}} changes in the plant {{internal}} nutrient cycling in response to natural, long-term P-fertility gradients are scarce. In this short report, we show some evidence on how leaf P dynamics can be drastically altered when plants typical from nutrient-poor sites grow in long-term P-enriched soils. The {{study was conducted in}} two natural populations of the Mediterranean evergreen shrub Pistacia lentiscus L. : one in a P-poor site and the other in a P-rich site. Soil texture and N, P, and organic matter contents were measured at each <b>site.</b> <b>Leaf</b> N and P concentrations were also measured in current-year, 1 -year-old, and 2 -year-old leaves, and in the senesced leaves. In the P-poor <b>site,</b> <b>leaf</b> P and N decreased as the leaves aged. This occurs because of nutrient reabsorption to other plant organs and/or dilution of nutrients by carbon compounds. In contrast, the leaves from the P-rich site acummulated P (but not N) during leaf lifespan. Consequently, P concentration in senesced leaves was very high in the P-rich site. These results show that, in long-lived perennials living in the field, long-term P enrichment can switch the normal process of P resorption during leaf aging to P accretion in the leaf. P accumulation in the leaves, which are periodically shed, might constitute a simple P excretion mechanism for plants typical from P-poor soils...|$|R

40|$|Land {{plants have}} {{developed}} a cuticle preventing uncontrolled water loss. Here we report that an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily G (ABCG) full transporter is required for leaf water conservation in both wild barley and rice. A spontaneous mutation, eibi 1. b, in wild barley has a low capacity to retain leaf water, a phenotype associated with reduced cutin deposition and a thin cuticle. Map-based cloning revealed that Eibi 1 encodes an HvABCG 31 full transporter. The gene was highly expressed in the elongation zone of a growing <b>leaf</b> (the <b>site</b> of cutin synthesis), and its gene product also was localized in developing, but not in mature tissue.

In the case of B. glumae, necrosis occurred with toxoflavin producing strains. No necrotic lesions developed with toxoflavin non-producing strains. All strains of B. gladioli induced necrosis with water soaking lesions in tobacco leaf. Infiltration of toxoflavin producing strains of B. glumae and B. gladioli to rice leaf caused necrosis or a chlorotic spot on the leaf.

40|$|Background and Aims Vulnerability of {{the leaf}} {{hydraulic}} pathway to water-stress-induced dysfunction is {{a key component of}} drought tolerance in plants and may be important in defining species' climatic range. However, the generality of the association between leaf hydraulic vulnerability and climate across species and sites remains to be tested. Methods Leaf hydraulic vulnerability to drought (P 50 leaf, thewater potential inducing 50 %loss in hydraulic function) was measured in a diverse group of 92 woody, mostly evergreen angiosperms from sites across a wide range of habitats. These new data together with some previously published were tested against key climate indices related to water availability. Differences in within-site variability in P 50 <b>leaf</b> between <b>sites</b> were also examined. Key Results Values of hydraulic vulnerability to drought in leaves decreased strongly (i. e. became more negative) with decreasing annual rainfall and increasing aridity across sites. The standard deviation in P 50 leaf values recorded within each site was positively correlated with increasing aridity. P 50 leaf was also a good indicator of the climatic envelope across each species' distributional range as well as their dry-end distributional limits within Australia, although this relationship was not consistently detectable within sites. Conclusions The findings indicate that species sorting processes have influenced distributional patterns of P 50 leaf across the rainfall spectrum, but alternative strategies for dealing with water deficit exist within sites. The strong link to aridity suggests leaf hydraulic vulnerability may influence plant distributions under future climates. 6 page(s...|$|R
