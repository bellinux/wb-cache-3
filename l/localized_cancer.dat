40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Prostate {{cancer was}} the most common cancer in men in France in 2005, and the second cause of male death from cancer. In this study, we {{analyzed}} clinical characteristics of patients with prostate cancer diagnosed in France in 2001 with a focus on therapeutic management of <b>localized</b> prostate <b>cancers.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2181 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 2001 from 11 French counties covered by a cancer registry were analyzed. A descriptive study of the clinical characteristics of patients was performed. Parameters studied included age, county, TNM stage, PSA value, Gleason score, D'Amico prognostic group, Charlson's comorbidity index and initial treatment modalities. For <b>localized</b> <b>cancers,</b> multivariate logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with radical prostatectomy. RESULTS: The proportion of <b>localized</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> (T 1 or T 2) was 86. 6 %. The use of invasive curative treatment (radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy) was 58. 4 % for <b>localized</b> <b>cancers.</b> Significant differences in therapeutic management were found between counties. Radical prostatectomy was associated with age at diagnosis, D'Amico prognostic group and the presence of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Most of prostate cancers diagnosed in France in 2001 were clinically localized and were treated by invasive therapy. The consequences of these practices remain to be determined given the limited evolution of many prostate cancers and the frequency of adverse events related to invasive treatments...|$|R

The current {{modality}} of diagnosis, the measurement of serum PSA, not only suffers from lack of specificity, but does not distinguish clinical cases in which current treatment measures would be most successful, i. e. aggressive, life-threatening tumors. A multiplexed MS methodology, selected reaction monitoring-MS/MS coupled with stable isotope dilution (SID), was developed and tested in both cells lines and clinical tissue samples. Standard curves were generated for two peptides representing PSA and one peptide from each of two additional orthogonally validated biomarkers, AMACR and EZH 2. The standard curves show high reproducibility, sensitivity, and good linearity.

30|$|The dilemma between {{definitive}} {{treatment and}} observation/watchful waiting for <b>localized</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> {{is an important}} question without standard answer. In the PIVOT study, radical prostatectomy did not significantly reduce all-cause or prostate-cancer specific mortality, as compared with observation during at least 12  years of follow-up (Wilt et al. 2012). In contrast, the SPCG- 4 study reported that radical prostatectomy significantly reduced all cause mortality by 12.7 % (P <  0.001) and prostate-cancer specific mortality by 11.0 % (P =  0.001) compared to watchful waiting during 23.2  years of follow-up (Bill-Axelson et al. 2014). Besides, surgical treatment for <b>localized</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> will inevitably result in complications and functional impairments.

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} accuracy of simultaneous transrectal ultrasonogra-phy (TRUS) -guided prostate biopsy and transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), patients with acute urinary retention (AUR) who underwent simul-taneous prostate biopsy and TURP were compared with those treated by TURP alone. Methods: From July 2000 to Jun 2004, 21 patients older than 70 years with AUR were included in each group. Patients with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels (> 4 ng/ml) underwent TURP and TRUS-guided biopsy simul-taneously (group I), while those with normal PSA levels (< 4 ng/ml) received TURP alone (group II). The average ages of group I and group II patients were 72. 4 and 72. 5 years. Results: In group I, 4 patients (19 %) were diagnosed with prostate cancer; 2 had metastasis and received hormone therapy; and 1 had <b>localized</b> <b>cancer</b> and was treated with brachytherapy. An 82 -year-old patient with <b>localized</b> <b>cancer</b> opted for watchful waiting.

Methods: The analysis included 3, 300 patients from seven states, diagnosed with clinically <b>localized</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> in 1997. We examined the association of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with four treatment options: radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and watchful waiting.

DNA ploidy was determined by flow cytometry in archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor tissue obtained at diagnosis in 120 patients with clinically <b>localized</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> with a nearly complete follow-up.

Tumor DNA ploidy (diploid versus nondiploid) significantly associ-ated with histopathological grade (P = 0. 002) and disease-specific survival (P = 0. 011), while there was no association with tumor stage (P = 0. 054). In a multivariate Cox analysis, histo-pathological grade (P = 0. 005) was the only significant predictor of disease-specific death, while analyzing the 96 low-grade tumors separately, DNA ploidy became significant (P = 0. 024).
