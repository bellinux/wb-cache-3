40|$|Calmodulin, a {{multifunctional}} calcium-modulated protein, {{has been}} isolated from <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> tissue and from <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> messenger RNA translation products. The translation protein and the <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> protein have been partially characterized and compared to vertebrate calmodulins. <b>Spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> calmodulin will quantitatively activate bovine brain phosphodiesterase and will undergo a calcium-dependent shift in electrophoretic mobility {{similar to that}} of bovine brain calmodulin. In the presence of Ca 2 + the spinach and brain proteins comigrate, but in the presence of chelators they do not. A polyadenylylated RNA fraction has been isolated from <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> tissue and translated in a wheat germ cell-free translation system. The calmodulin synthesized in vitro has been isolated by using calcium-dependent affinity chromatography on phenothiazine-Sepharose conjugates. The translation protein comigrates with spinach calmodulin during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis whether in the presence or the absence of Ca 2 +. The translation protein also undergoes a calcium-dependent mobility shift identical to that of spinach calmodulin. Amino acid analysis of the translation calmodulin indicates that it does not contain Nε-trimethyllysine, an amino acid residue that is characteristic of all calmodulins previously examined. These studies suggest that Nε-trimethyllysine is not required for the calcium-dependent interaction of calmodulin with phenothiazines and indicate the potential utility of phenothiazine-Sepharose conjugates as affinity-based adsorbents in biological and biochemical investigations...|$|R

40|$|This {{communication}} {{demonstrates that}} all de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> cells requires {{acyl carrier protein}} (ACP) and occurs specifically in the chloroplasts. Antibodies raised to purified spinach ACP inhibited at least 98 % of malonyl CoA-dependent fatty acid synthesis by <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> homogenates. Therefore, the presence of ACP in a compartment of the <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> cell {{would serve as a}} marker for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. A radioimmunoassay capable of detecting 10 (15) mol (10 (- 11) g) of spinach ACP was developed to measure the levels of ACP in leaf cell components isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation of a gentle lysate of <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> protoplasts. All of the ACP of the leaf cell could be attributed to the chloroplast. Less than 1 % of the ACP associated with chloroplasts resulted from binding of free ACP to chloroplasts. Of interest, ACP from Escherichia coli, soybean, and sunflower showed only partial crossreactivity with spinach ACP by the radioimmunoassay. These results strongly suggest that, in the leaf cell, chloroplasts are the sole site for the de novo synthesis of C 16 and C 18 fatty acids. These fatty acids are then transported into the cytoplasm for further modification and are either inserted into extrachloroplastic membrane lipids or returned to the chloroplast for insertion into lamellar membrane lipids...|$|R
40|$|Starch {{debranching}} enzyme was purified from intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv Vital) chloroplasts {{and from a}} <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> extract using affinity chromatography on Sepharose 6 B-bound cycloheptaamylose (Schardinger β-dextrin). The enzyme from both sources was homogeneous upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. <b>Spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> {{debranching enzyme}} appears to consist of a single polypeptide chain, since the molecular weight of the native protein (110, 000 daltons) was not changed by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Only one <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> debranching enzyme band could be detected after electrophoresis of a leaf extract on amylopectin-containing polyacrylamide gel, the retardation factor of which coincided {{with that of the}} single band seen with the chloroplast enzyme. The purified enzyme exhibited strong pullulanase activity, the specific activity being 69 units per milligram protein with pullulan and 22 units per milligram protein with amylopectin. Cycloheptaamylose is a potent competitive inhibitor of <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> debranching enzyme. The pH optimum of the enzyme was found to be 5. 5. The purified enzyme is rather unstable at both 20 ° and 0 °C. Part of the activity lost under storage or at a suboptimal pH could immediately be restored by the addition of thiols. The reactivatable protein, being of the same molecular weight as the native enzyme, exhibited a somewhat altered electrophoretic mobility resulting in one or two minor bands on a zymogram...|$|R
40|$|ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADP-Glc PPase) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells was {{purified}} over 2000 -fold to {{a specific}} activity of 81 units/mg protein, and its kinetic and regulatory properties were characterized. Inorganic orthophosphate and 3 -phosphoglycerate were the most potent inhibitor and activator, respectively. Rabbit antiserum raised against the <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> ADP-Glc PPase (but not the one raised against the enzyme from Escherichia coli) inhibited {{the activity of the}} purified algal enzyme, which migrated as a single protein band in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two-dimensional and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicate that the enzyme from C. reinhardtii is composed of two subunits with molecular masses of 50 and 53 kD, respectively. The molecular mass of the native enzyme is estimated to be 210 kD. Antisera raised against the <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> holoenzyme and against the 51 -kD spinach subunit cross-reacted with both subunits of the algal ADP-Glc PPase in immunoblot hybridization, but the cross-reaction was stronger for the 50 -kD algal subunit than for the 53 -kD subunit. No cross-reaction was observed when antiserum raised against the <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> pyrophosphorylase 54 -kD subunit was used. These results suggest that the ADP-Glc PPase from C. reinhardtii is a heterotetrameric protein, since the enzyme from higher plants and its two subunits are structurally more related to the small subunit of the <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> enzyme than to its large subunit.

40|$|ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase {{has been}} {{extensively}} purified from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber tissue to study its structure. By employing a modified published procedure (JR Sowokinos, J Preiss [1982] Plant Physiol 69 : 1459 - 1466) together with Mono Q chromatography, a near homogeneous enzyme preparation was obtained with substantial improvement in enzyme yield and specific activity. In single dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, the enzyme migrated as a single polypeptide band with a mobility of about 50, 000 daltons. Analysis by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, however, revealed the presence of two types of subunits which could be distinguished by their slight differences in net charge and molecular weight. The smaller potato tuber subunit was recognized by antiserum prepared against the smaller <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> 51 kilodalton ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase subunit. In contrast, the anti- 54 kilodalton raised against the <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> subunit did not significantly react to the tuber enzyme subunits.

Five millimolar NH 4 Cl stimulated <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> slice CO 2 fixation by 43 % under stress (0. 67 molar sorbitol) conditions, and had little effect on fixation under isotonic (0. 33 molar sorbitol) conditions. Chlamydomonas cells were found to be more sensitive to reduced ψπ than <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> slices. CO 2 fixation in the cells of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardii was 99 and 17 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll per hour, respectively, at 0. 1 molar mannitol and 0. 28 molar mannitol. Five millimolar NH 4 Cl stimulated CO 2 fixation of Chlamydomonas cells by 147 % under stress (0. 28 molar mannitol) conditions. Aphanocapsa 6308 cells (blue-green alga) were also found to be sensitive to reduced ψπ, and inhibitions in photosynthesis were partially reversed by NH 4 Cl.

DNA gel blots indicated that PM 28 A {{is the product of}} a single gene, and RNA gel blots showed that pm 28 a is ubiquitously expressed in the plant. In vivo phosphorylation of the 28 -kD polypeptide(s), corresponding to PM 28 A and PM 28 B, was dependent on apoplastic water potential, suggesting a role in regulation of cell turgor for these putative aquaporins. In vitro, only one of the homologs, PM 28 A, was phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of PM 28 A occurred on Ser- 274, seven amino acids from the C terminus of the protein, within a consensus phosphorylation site (Ser-X-Arg) for vertebrate protein kinase C. In vitro phosphorylation of PM 28 A was due to a plasma membrane-associated protein kinase and was strictly dependent on submicromolar concentrations of Ca 2 +...|$|R
40|$|Uniform {{electroporation}} of the heterogeneous {{structure of}} <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> cross section is a technological challenge that is {{addressed in this}} investigation. Three dimensional models were created with cells arranged in specific tissue types, considering a leaf with its air fraction and a leaf where the air fraction {{was replaced by a}} solution of known properties using vacuum impregnation. The models were validated before electroporation, in the frequency domain, where alternating voltage and current signal at frequencies from 20 Hz to I MHz were used to measure conductivity of the tissue. They were also validated through measurements of current during electroporation when a single 250 mu s rectangular pulse with amplitudes ranging from 50 to 500 V was applied. Model validations show that both the frequency dependent conductivity and electroporation are well predicted. The importance of the wax layer and stomata in the model is thoroughly discussed. Industrial relevance: Our aim was to investigate electroporation of the <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> by developing a model which would enable us to meet the technological challenge of achieving uniform electroporation in a highly heterogeneous structure {{in the context of a}} process aimed at improving freezing stability of plant foods. Pulsed electric field treatment may be used to introduce the cryoprotectant molecules into the cells, and hence improve the structure and properties of frozen food plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
