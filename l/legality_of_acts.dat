Among the roles of the office is to ensure that the Constitution and laws are followed; to help fulfil the Government's programme; to help maintain social peace; to cooperate with local authorities in order to set development priorities; to verify the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> done by the county or local councils and mayors; to ensure emergency preparedness; to promote integration into the European Union; to decide with which similar institutions in Romania or abroad to cooperate; to ensure that national minorities are able to communicate with Government institutions in localities where minorities make up over 20% of the population.

The Interior Ministry is the principal allocator of prefectures' budgets, while their activity is coordinated by the Prime Minister and they are subordinate to the Government.|$|E

40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of the preliminary rulings rendered by the Court of Justice for the judicial body that made the reference and for other bodies dealing with similar cases, for the member states, for the European Union’ s institutions and for EU legal order. Starting from the binding effect of the preliminary judgment for national judicial bodies, which requires them to follow the ruling or make a new reference, to the lack of precedent doctrine in EU law, continuing with the possibility to indirectly verify the compatibility of national law of the member states with EU law and ending with the administrative or legislative measures that can or must be taken by the member states, the study intends to highlight the limits, nuances and consequences of the binding effect. It mentions the contribution of the national courts and of the Court of Justice of the European Union to the development of EU law, such as clarifying autonomous notions and it emphasizes the preliminary procedure's attributes of being a form of judicial protection of individual rights, as well as a means to review the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> of EU institutions. The paper is meant to be a useful instrument for practitioners. Therefor, it also deals with the possibility and limits of asking new questions, in order to obtain reconsideration or a refinement of the legal issue and with the problem of judicial control over the interpretation and application of the preliminary ruling by the lower court...|$|E

40|$|The study {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} comprehensive analysis {{of the role of}} the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN). It considers the contributions of the ICJ towards the UN system and concludes that, although the ICJ's contribution has been significant, many practical and theoretical issues regarding its role remain unsettled. The study proceeds as follows. The first chapter sets out the history of international adjudication and the relationship between international adjudicatory mechanisms and political international organisations. It also includes a review of the legal basis and extent of the relationship between the ICJ and the UN. The second and third chapters aim to throw light upon the advisory role of the ICJ and the manner in which the Court, through this jurisdiction, plays a role in interpreting and developing the institutional law of the UN. The fourth chapter addresses the Court's role in facilitating the realisation of the purposes and principles of the UN through its contentious jurisdiction. This chapter discusses the basis of the contentious jurisdiction of the Court, then examines the practice of the Court in achieving these purposes and principles. The fifth chapter examines the role of the ICJ as a "constitutional court" in the UN framework and its competence to review the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>acts</b> of the UN organs. The sixth chapter evaluates the Court's role as a court of appeal in respect of the judgments of administrative tribunals established within the framework of the UN and its specialised agencies, particularly in the light of General Assembly Resolution 50 / 54 (1995). By way of conclusion, the Court's role within the UN system is evaluated and a number of recommendations are made with a view to enhancing the role of the Court to enable it to address new challenges...|$|E

If the United States would implement data retention, the nature of the data to be retained would be detailed in the act, the retention period would be average (which is 12 months in Europe), access would be restricted by means of a court order and the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>act</b> would be questioned on different levels of the government.
