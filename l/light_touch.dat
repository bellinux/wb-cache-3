Tangible evidence of touch sensitivity is the almost instantaneous collapse of leaflets of Mimosa pudica, the insect traps of Venus flytrap and bladderworts, and the pollinia of orchids.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1918 Holst {{had asked}} Joseph to provide a {{libretto}} for his opera The Perfect Fool, feeling that she might possess the required <b>light</b> <b>touch</b> that he thought his own writing lacked. It {{is not clear whether}} she declined, or whether Holst changed his mind, but he eventually wrote the text himself. Joseph did, however, write the story for a ballet based on Holst's music The Sneezing Charm; the ballet, entitled A Magic Hour, was performed at Morley in October 1920. Meantime, Joseph's works were being performed at SWM concerts: two songs, probably from her Mirage cycle, in January 1920, and some of her settings of Walter de la Mare poems in December.|$|E

25|$|Children with fragile X {{have very}} short {{attention}} spans, are hyperactive, and show hypersensitivity to visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory stimuli. These children have difficulty in large crowds {{due to the}} loud noises and {{this can lead to}} tantrums due to hyperarousal. Children with FXS pull away from <b>light</b> <b>touch</b> and can find textures of materials to be irritating. Transitions from one location to another can be difficult for children with FXS. Behavioral therapy can be used to decrease the child’s sensitivity in some cases.|$|E
25|$|Referred {{pain can}} be {{indicative}} of nerve damage. A case study done on a 63-year-old man with a sustained injury during his childhood developed referred pain symptoms after his face or back was touched. After even a <b>light</b> <b>touch,</b> there was shooting pain in his arm. The study concluded {{that the reason for}} this man's pain was possibly due to a neural reorganization which sensitized regions of his face and back after the nerve damage occurred. It is mentioned that this case is very similar to what phantom limb syndrome patients suffer. This conclusion was based on experimental evidence gathered by V. Ramachandran in 1993, with the difference being that the arm that is in pain is still attached to the body.|$|E

25|$|Nociceptor neuron {{sensitivity}} is modulated {{by a large}} {{variety of}} mediators in the extracellular space. Peripheral sensitization represents a form of functional plasticity of the nociceptor. The nociceptor can change from being simply a noxious stimulus detector to a detector of non-noxious stimuli. The result is that low intensity stimuli from regular activity, initiates a painful sensation. This {{is commonly known as}} hyperalgesia. Inflammation is one common cause that results in the sensitization of nociceptors. Normally hyperalgesia ceases when inflammation goes down, however, sometimes genetic defects and/or repeated injury can result in allodynia: a completely non-noxious stimulus like <b>light</b> <b>touch</b> causes extreme pain. Allodynia can also be caused when a nociceptor is damaged in the peripheral nerves. This can result in deafferentation, which means the development of different central processes from the surviving afferent nerve. With this situation, surviving dorsal root axons of the nociceptors can make contact with the spinal cord, thus changing the normal input.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{symptom of}} copper {{deficiency}} is peripheral neuropathy, which is numbness or tingling that can {{start in the}} extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso. In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience & Rehabilitation (ACNR) published case report, a 69-year-old patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms. These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, sensation to <b>light</b> <b>touch</b> and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation {{was lost in the}} sternum, and markedly reduced proprioception or sensation about the self’s orientation. Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient. This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral neuropathy can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.|$|E
500|$|In late 1913, Barrymore {{made his}} first {{confirmed}} feature film, the romantic comedy An American Citizen, with Adolph Zukor's Famous Players Film Company. When the film was released in January 1914, Barrymore [...] "delighted movie audiences with an inimitable <b>light</b> <b>touch</b> that made a conventional romance 'joyous'," [...] writes Peters. A reviewer for The Oregon Daily Journal thought that Barrymore gave a [...] "portrayal of unusual quality". The success of the picture led to further film work, including The Man from Mexico (1914), Are You a Mason?, The Dictator and The Incorrigible Dukane (all 1915). Except for The Incorrigible Dukane, all of these early films are presumed lost.|$|E

40|$|After {{comparing}} {{the means of}} concussion prevention used in educational boxing with similar means used in other sports practiced by children and adolescents, we noted that the exclusive use of <b>light</b> <b>touches</b> instead of blows in competitions of educational boxing is an original means of preventing concussion, acting on the direct cause {{rather than on the}} possible victim of concussion. We have then predicted that educational boxing is possibly the concussion-free form of competition boxing and that it is possibly chronic damage-free. If our predictions are fulfilled, educational boxing may serve as a template for building up concussion prevention means in all sports. Moreover, we would better go on popularizing the practice of educational boxing which is less likely to induce concussion than amateur and professional boxing; which has had more license owners than the two latter the 2004 - 2005, 2005 - 2006 and 2006 - 2007 boxing seasons in France; and which is practiced almost exclusively by children and adolescents in France. Despite the fact that <b>light</b> <b>touches</b> force of impact is sub-concussive, we need research work be undertaken in order to know whether <b>light</b> <b>touches</b> are harmless in educational boxers having had many fights and to know the occurrence frequency of unexpected concussions from <b>light</b> <b>touches</b> that turn to unintentional counter- punches. </p...|$|R

Instead, these long epics become somewhat tedious {{and there is}} a strong whiff of egoism and self-indulgence.…At over 70 minutes, the album feels rather bloated. Quite a few of the songs are too long, or too empty of ideas, or too willing to repeat themselves, or too willing to play to type".

[...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} almost universally praised by critics. [...] Abby West of Entertainment Weekly complimented {{the writing of}} B.J.

[...] IGN's Brian Zoromski rated it 10 out of 10, making it only one of two third-season episodes he deemed a [...] "masterpiece". He stated that [...] "Another truly brilliant episode of The Office aired this week, with more humor packed into the half-hour than you get in many feature-length comedies."

500|$|Central cord syndrome, {{almost always}} {{resulting}} from {{damage to the}} cervical spinal cord, is characterized by weakness in the arms with relative sparing of the legs, and spared sensation in regions served by the sacral segments. There is loss of sensation of pain, temperature, <b>light</b> <b>touch,</b> and pressure {{below the level of}} injury. [...] The spinal tracts that serve the arms are more affected due to their central location in the spinal cord, while the corticospinal fibers destined for the legs are spared due to their more external location. The most common of the incomplete SCI syndromes, central cord syndrome usually results from neck hyperextension in older people with spinal stenosis. [...] In younger people, it most commonly results from neck flexion. [...] The most common causes are falls and vehicle accidents; however other possible causes include spinal stenosis and impingement on the spinal cord by a tumor or vertebral disk.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} Disney, Pixar, and the Hidden Messages of Children's Films, M.

In this case the rainforest is located near Mount Warning, on the eastern coast of Australia, but the theme is global and the specific location is not particularly emphasized". Despite the environmental theme Booker stated the film was [...] "somewhat vague in its explanation of the dire consequences of rainforest destruction and it addresses the economic impetus behind this destruction hardly at all"; the fact that the rainforest was saved {{at the end of the}} film [...] "diminishes the urgency of its environmentalist message" [...] and that the character of Hexxus [...] "displaces the real blame for environmental destruction from its real perpetrators onto nonexistent supernatural perpetrators, further diluting the political message."

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman, who praised {{both the}} {{previous}} Jurassic Park films, awarded the third film only a C grade, writing [...] "Jurassic Park III has no pretensions {{to be anything}} more than a goose-bumpy fantasy theme-park ride for kids, but it's such a routine ride. Spielberg's wizardry is gone, and his balletic <b>light</b> <b>touch</b> as well, and that gives too much of this 90-minute movie over to the duller-than-dull characters." [...] Derek Elley of Variety Reviews felt likewise, calling the film [...] "an all-action, helter-skelter, don't-forget-to-buy-the-computer-game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking". Ben Varkontine of PopMatters called it [...] "not as good a ride as the first", but [...] "better than the second." [...] Much of the criticism was leveled at the plot as simply a chase movie with no character development; Apollo Movie Guide panned the film as being [...] "almost the same as the first movie" [...] with [...] "no need for new ideas or even a script". Empire magazine gave the film 3 stars out of 5, commenting that it was [...] "Short, scrappy and intermittently scary" [...] and that the film ultimately [...] "skews young".|$|E

The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly <b>light</b> <b>touch</b> against an epic backdrop." [...] The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film [...] "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the film [...] "reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney's America." ...|$|E
500|$|The body's {{physical}} arousal response (vaginal lubrication and engorgement of the clitoris {{in women}} and erection in men) occurs due to two separate pathways which normally work together: [...] and reflex. Arousal due to fantasies, visual input, or other mental stimulation is a psychogenic sexual experience, and arousal resulting from physical contact to the genital area is reflexogenic. In psychogenic arousal, messages travel {{from the brain}} via the spinal cord to the nerves in the genital area. The psychogenic pathway is served by the spinal cord at levels T11–L2. [...] Thus people injured above {{the level of the}} T11 vertebra do not usually experience psychogenic erection or vaginal lubrication, but those with an injury below T12 can. Even without these physical responses, people with SCI often feel aroused, just as uninjured people do. The ability to feel the sensation of a pinprick and <b>light</b> <b>touch</b> in the dermatomes for T11–L2 predicts how well the ability to have psychogenic arousal is preserved in both sexes. Input from the psychogenic pathway is sympathetic, {{and most of the time}} it sends inhibitory signals that prevent the physical arousal response; in response to sexual stimulation, excitatory signals are increased and inhibition is reduced. Removing the inhibition that is normally present allows the spinal reflexes that trigger the arousal response to take effect.|$|E
