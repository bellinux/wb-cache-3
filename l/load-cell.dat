40|$|Abstract − Large {{quantities}} of commodities in different sizes transported on belt conveyors should often be mea-sured automatically {{by two or}} three conveyor belt scales. Continuous measurement can be dynamically performed by multi-stage conveyor belt scales, so that the masses of discrete objects on belt conveyors can be determined in sequence according to the different lengths. Belt conveyor scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 130 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minutes and more. The output signals from the multi-stage conveyor belt scales are always contaminated with noises due to vibrations of the conveyor and the object to be measured in motion. This measuring system consists of the three-stage conveyor belt scales with <b>load-cells,</b> and the photo-electro switches which detect the measuring lengths of the objects and distance between each object in sequence. The experimental results on the multi-stage conveyor belt scales suggest that the algorithms proposed in this paper are effective enough to practical applications...|$|R

40|$|Modelling {{the forming}} process of {{engineering}} fabrics and textile composites using a mechanical approach, such as FEM, requires characterisation of material behaviour. Using Picture Frame (PF) tests, several {{previous studies have}} reported a coupling between in-plane tension and fabric shear compliance. However, characterising this behaviour accurately has proven problematic due to {{the sensitivity of the}} PF test to small fabric misalignments in the test rig, prompting innovative solutions {{such as the use of}} <b>load-cells</b> mounted on the side bars of the PF rig to measure in-plane tension during testing. This paper focuses on an alternative testing technique, the Biaxial Bias Extension test, as a means to investigate this coupling. The approach has several benefits including simple equipment requirements, the ability to vary sample dimensions and boundary conditions. The main difficulty lies in extracting the material contribution to the recorded signal. To do this, an experimental method is demonstrated using two very different textiles; glass fabric and self-reinforced polypropylene both plain weaves.

40|$|Strain gauges {{load cells}} are {{transducers}} devices capable of converting changes in applied mechanical load into an electrical analog signal. Those devices {{have a large}} spectrum of applications ranging from domestic to industrial or even medical appliances {{just to name a}} few. In this work, they are used in the electronic instrumentation of a force platform that will be used to carry out the analysis and characterization of human biomechanical walking. In this platform, four load cells are installed, each one capable of measuring forces along two different axis. A total of eight strain-gauges per load cell are employed. Hence, analog signal transmission, besides requiring a large number of connection wires, is prone to interference and noise. Moreover, with this solution, scalability requires severe changes in the connection topology. In order to circumvent those problems, an alternative in-situ signal conditioning and digital data transmission system was devised.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Measurements of {{full-scale}} avalanches {{are expensive}} and time con-suming, but are indispensable to gain in-depth {{understanding of the}} flow behavior of avalanches. They are needed to crosscheck the scaling used in small-scale experi-ments and also {{form the basis for}} developing and calibrating numerical models. The recent partial upgrade of NGI’s Ryggfonn test-site is focused on the processes occurring during interaction between avalanches and a catching dam in the runout zone. These processes are crucial for the efficiency of this type of avalanche mitigation measure, which {{has been the focus of}} several small-scale experiments in recent years. But qualitatively and quantitatively good observations from real avalanches for a cross-comparison are rare. Therefore, two new masts were constructed at Ryggfonn. One is located about 10 m upstream of the foot of a catching dam and has a height of 15 m. The other stands on the crown of the dam and is 6 m high. In this way, we also hope to complement the SLF full-scale tests at the Vallée de la Sionne test-site. Instrumentation on the new masts consists of <b>load-cells</b> and LED-velocity sensors, each type with a vertical spacing of 0. 5 m. In addition, flow-height switches are placed with 0. 25 m vertical spacing. Thus, the instrumentation is quite similar to the instrumen-tation used in Vallée de la Sionne, which will hopefully allow better cross-comparison of measurements.

However in experimental designs that evaluate the effect of altered muscle forces on foot motion this is more complex; the effect of the altered muscle activity on the loading and kinematics cannot be taken into consideration. Therefore, we investigated the use of a new technique to simulate such cases with realistic loading conditions. Methods Our gait simulator simulates the activation of nine muscles (grouped in six groups), based on electromyography measurements. The forces are applied with pneumatic actuators and are measured by <b>load-cells</b> located between the tendons and the actuators. The set-up is able to simulate knee motion, using a motor for the horizontal and a platform under the foot for the vertical direction. The stance phase is simulated in 0. 8 seconds. The GRF in human gait is the sum of a static (human weight) and a dynamic part (acceleration of human mass). By applying a constant force on the platform (equal to the assumed weight of the subject), the measured GRF is the sum of the constant force and the force generated from the acceleration of the platform. This way, the kinetics are governed exclusively by the muscle activation. Results Four freshly frozen cadaveric specimens were used, for five measurements each. The in-vitro measured GRF was compared to in-vivo measurements (figure 1) and followed the normal pattern with an RMS error of 22 %. Conclusions Using this method, physiological GRF were reconstructed for normal gait, by reconstructing the mechanism that generates GRF. It could be, therefore, used for pathologic gait simulations, since the mechanism is identical. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{measurements}} of muscular forces usually require a substantial rearrangement of the biomechanical system. To circumvent this problem, various indirect techniques {{have been used}} in the past. We introduce a novel direct method, using a lightweight (~ 0. 5 g) miniature (3 x 3 x 7 mm) in-line <b>load-cell</b> to measure tension in the tibialis anterior tendon of rats. A linear motor was used to produce force-profiles to assess linearity, step-response, hysteresis and frequency behavior under controlled conditions. Sensor responses to a series of rectangular force-pulses correlated linearly (R 2 = 0. 999) within the range of 0 - 20 N. The maximal relative error at full scale (20 N) was 0. 07 % of the average measured signal. The standard deviation of the mean response to repeated 20 N force pulses was ± 0. 04 % of the mean response. The step-response of the <b>load-cell</b> showed the behavior of a PD 2 T 2 -element in control-engineering terminology. The maximal hysteretic error was 5. 4 % of the full-scale signal. Sinusoidal signals were attenuated maximally (- 4 dB) at 200 Hz, within a measured range of 0. 01 - 200 Hz. When measuring muscular forces this should be of minor concern as the fusion-frequency of muscles is generally much lower. The newly developed <b>load-cell</b> measured tensile forces of up to 20 N, without inelastic deformation of the sensor.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of fixed}} offshore platforms supported by pile foundations has encouraged {{the development of more}} rational methods of analysis of piles subjected combined axial and lateral loading. The combination of large lateral loads resulting from the action of wind, waves and currents in conjunction with vertical loads has created the need to analyze systems exposed to large inclined loads. [...] The scope of this thesis is to study the pile-soil interaction of a vertical flexible pile under inclined loadings in dense sand. To study the interaction, model flexible piles of 25 mm, 42 mm and 60 mm diameters were jacked into sand with controlled density. These model piles were instrumented with <b>load-cells</b> and strain-gauge bridges to measure the bending moment distributions. The piles were tested under vertical, horizontal and inclined loads using a computerized data acquisition system. A suitable soil container and laboratory test frame were assembled to conduct the tests. [...] The vertical load test results indicated that the value of the bearing capacity factor Nq was constant with depth and consistently smaller than that predicted by various existing theories. The results also indicated that the piles had a critical depth where the point resistance became constant with depth, at a pile diameter/depth ratio of about 20. [...] Experimental p-y curves were compared with those proposed by Reese et al (1974), Matlock et al (1980), Scott (1980) and Parker (1970). The test data indicate that the semi-empirical methods underestimate the ultimate resistance near the pile head and overestimate it at depth. Computed response of piles under test conditions showed good agreement with the measured response. [...] The ultimate load capacity under inclined load decreases with load inclination, with a rapid reduction for load inclinations between 45 and 90 degrees. Compared to a pile subjected to only lateral load, the vertical load on the pile increases the lateral deflections by about 4 to 15 %, and the maximum moment in the pile section by about 8 to 16 % for load inclinations from 60 to 30 degrees...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 As lumber {{producers}} {{are faced with}} a diminished and increasingly expensive raw material, the need to maximize resource recovery will increase. Trim-ends (particularly from waned boards) often contain some of the highest quality wood in any given log and lack functionality only in length. This waste, traditionally chipped for pulp, can be finger-jointed into lumber if the material can be dried properly for gluing. This research explores how different length submerchantable pieces dry relative to each other and merchantable lumber when subjected to typical commercial drying schedules as well as how trim-ends in two different charge configurations perform in a conventional dry kiln. Sixteen -foot long, Douglas-fir boards in nominal four, six and eight inch widths were used to produce simulated trim-ends in 0. 5 -, 1. 0 -, 1. 5 -, 2. 0 -, 2. 5 - and 3. 5 -foot lengths. Eight-foot-long boards were also dried as a comparison to the simulated trimends. One course of each width was stacked tight while a second was stacked with a 0. 375 inch space between the ends of the blocks. Four charges were dried using United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommended schedules for high and low grade Douglas-fir. Eight by four foot, self stickered aluminum racks with slots corresponding to each of the sampled widths and a wire-mesh box (random piled), loaded with actual trim-ends and subjected to the USDA low-grade Douglas-fir schedule, were compared. Although it was demonstrated that length affects the final moisture content of pieces with similar anatomy and initial moisture content, it is not a significant factor in determining the mean final moisture content of the average charge of short blocks. Using the methods in this experiment, sorting by length would not be necessary. Current commercial kiln schedules are likely in appropriate for drying short pieces. An applicable schedule should be developed using real time moisture content monitoring in the kiln (i. e. <b>load-cells).</b> Providing a space between blocks can significantly accelerate the drying rate of fresh lumber and may have a greater effect when combined with an appropriate kiln schedule. The aluminum racks and the wire-mesh box exhibited comparable final moisture content deviation when used to dry trim-ends. The space efficiency of the wire-mesh box was it primary disadvantage and was approximately 63 percent that of the aluminum racks...|$|R
40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that bone loss experienced by astronauts in zero gravity conditions may be curtailed by appropriate exercise. According to Wolf's law, bone regenerates when muscles produce stresses by {{pulling on the}} bone during daily activity and/or exercise on Earth. To use this theory to prevent or decrease bone loss, one needs to quantify musculoskeletal loads and relate them to bone density changes. In {{the context of the}} space program, it is desirable to determine musculoskeletal loads during exercise so that one may make similar measurements on Earth and in space. In this manner, load measurements on Earth may be used as reference to generate similar loads during exercise in space. A research project to investigate the effects of high-resistive exercise to decrease bone density loss underzero-gravity conditions is being carried out in Life Sciences Research Laboratories at NASA JSC. The project consists of a bed-rest study whereby subjects remain in horizontal position for seventeen weeks. During the study, a subset of those subjects executes a regime of resistive exercises in the horizontal exercise machine (HEM). The HEM was designed so that subjects remain horizontal while exercising to minimize gravity loading even during exercise. Bone density of each subject is measured throughout the duration of their participation. The objective of the study is to determine if the resistive exercises are effective in diminishing or eliminating bone loss. My participation in this project relates to instrumentation, measurement, and processing of signals from displacement sensors (optical encoders) and <b>load-cells.</b> Measurement of displacements will be used to determine the motion of the body during exercise, and load measurements will be used (along with displacement data) to determine forces and torques exerted on each section of the body during exercise.

It also includes examples of measurements taken in the HEM.

40|$|In today’s {{fast moving}} world, {{automobiles}} are facing challenges {{in terms of}} having to survive road accidents, increasing traffic, bad road-conditions and high/express ways. Brake systems {{play a vital role}} in controlling the vehicle speed while avoiding road accidents. The conventional brake systems consist of basically an actuator, transmission and frictional parts. This system is difficult for manipulated control by the driver during emergency and panic braking situations. In particular road and environmental conditions, it requires certain skill to have safe and effective brake control, which is always not possible from all drivers. Wheel locking is a predominant phenomenon during panic braking and this will cause vehicle skidding resulting in injuries and road accidents. In the case of a two-wheeler, being a single-track vehicle, skidding is one of the major causes for fatal road accidents due to loss in lateral balance. As the road safety regulations are becoming more stringent, the anti-lock brake systems (ABS) will replace the conventional brake systems in all road vehicles to avoid accidents and to improve vehicle safety. Early ABS systems, developed in the last 100 -years, use intermittent and cyclic brake pressure control by sensing the wheel speed or wheel-slip as one of the major control inputs. Regulating the brake pressure with a preset threshold value is another method. These ABS systems have used electronics, or hydraulics or pure mechanical control. However, such ABS are not widely used in two-wheelers and other low cost vehicles till now, because of several limitations identified as follows: High cost, power supply needed for its operation in the case of intermittent and cyclic brake control, susceptibility to failure in the electronics system, interference from RF signals (from cell-phones for example), uneasiness to drivers from pedal pulsations with pedal noise, heavier weight, increased vehicle vibrations and failure modes of wheels due to torsional vibrations. The present research work is carried out to develop a new mechanical ABS concept, which will address most of the above problems. During braking, the change in rider-input force will change wheel reactions. This change is made proportional to the change in rider input force only upto wheel locking. Such a principle is used to develop the new mechanical ABS. The new concept regulates the output force from the ABS, by sensing the dynamic wheel reactions with increase in rider-response. The ABS output force is regulated by one of the following ways: (a) Slipping-down the lever-ratio or (b) preventing the excessive brake input force. Based on the parameters like less number of parts, least weight, simplicity, reliability, efficiency, durability, time-response, etc., the second method (of preventing the excessive brake input force) has been chosen. Further a new concept of ABS interconnecting system is proposed for usage between the front and rear wheels of the vehicle. This interconnecting system will ensure that the two mechanical ABS systems function at any kind of braking-balance between the front and rear applications. An analytical vehicle model has been developed with several input parameters like mass, geometry, inertia, aerodynamic properties, frictions of road and bearing-supports, road gradients, etc. From this analytical model, the dynamic wheel reactions and limiting adhesion of each tyre for various braking conditions are determined and the results are used to design the mechanical ABS. The same analytical model is used to predict the brake performance like stopping distance, vehicle deceleration and the vehicle speed variation for ideal braking conditions. The new ABS is modelled in Pro-E using the inputs from the analytical model. To evaluate the concept, a functional proto-type is built and fitted on a motorcycle. The ABS is evaluated for its functionality and performance at different road (level surface, up-gradients and down gradients) and environmental conditions (dry and wet road conditions). Using the VBOX II, proximate sensors and <b>load-cells</b> fitted on the vehicle, the vehicle stopping distance, wheel slip and pedal force are measured. The results show that wheel locking does not occur under panic driving conditions, which is the primary objective. In addition, the results show a good agreement with the predicted stopping distance and vehicle deceleration from the analytical model. As there is good scope for this new mechanical ABS for use in two-wheelers and other low cost vehicles, further research is needed to make this system work in curvilinear motion & banked surfaces...|$|R

At the ‘Vrije Universiteit Brussel’ different EPACs (Electric Power Assisted Cycles) are put at the public’s disposal for testing. To quantify the performances of these electrical bicycles we want to link the subjective experienced driving comfort to some measurable objective parameters. For this purpose we converted a treadmill into a test bench for two-wheelers. Extra effort has been made to achieve a good approximation of the road conditions. The front and rear wheel are both rolling on a flat treadmill, driven by an AC-drive. A crowbar can adjust the slope of the bench.

The kinetic energy stored in the wedge bar helps ensure a near constant loading rate over the duration of the experiment. The yield stress is captured at above 80 of the average strain rate for the experiment for most of the materials investigated. The design work focuses primarily around the design of the new load-frame, <b>load-cell,</b> loading platforms and wedge bar displacement sensor. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to investigate the dynamic response of the IST and modify the design of components where necessary. The modifications made the load-frame and <b>load-cell</b> result in a significant improvement in the quality of the measured signals. The wedge bar displacement sensor performed well. The back pressure driven loading concept shows potential but needs more development before it is suitable for routine testing. A range of common engineering materials was tested at quasi static, intermediate and high strain rates and compared to the results found in the literature. The results match well, however, friction effects dominate the large strain response of the metal specimens. In its current configuration the IST is used effective for testing polymers up to large strains as well as yield stress and small strain measurement of metals. For materials for which specimen friction effects are a problem, interrupted tests can be used to extend the maximum strain achievable...|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for describing the Amputee Independent Prosthesis Properties (AIPP) of complete assemblies of trans-tibial prosthetic components distal to the socket. This new AIPP model includes features of both lumped parameter and roll-over models and describes prosthesis properties {{that are of}} importance in stance phase, including prosthetic foot geometry, normal stiffness, shear stiffness, and damping (energy dissipation). Methods are described for measuring {{the parameters of the}} AIPP model using a custom test-rig, commercial <b>load-cell,</b> and a motion capture system. Example data are presented for five pylon angles reflecting the shank angles seen in normal gait. Through the inclusion of measured AIPP in future in-vivo studies comparing different prostheses more generic information, as opposed to product specific claims, will become more widely available to inform future designs, prescription, and alignment procedures...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA novel {{technique}} is proposed and investigated for {{the estimation of}} the body force field resulting from the operation of a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuator. The technique relies on the measurement of the spatio-temporal evolution of the induced velocity field using high speed particle image velocimetry (PIV). the technique {{has the advantage of}} providing spatial distribution of the body force vector field. A full Navier-Stokes term decomposition is applied on the evolving field along with additional closure norms in order to decouple the pressure gradient and body force terms. Results are compared with <b>load-cell</b> measurements of the direct reaction force and also momentum balance calculations based on the PIV field. Agreement between the different methods is observed. The data can easily be incorporated in computational flow solvers and also be used for validation and calibration of numerical plasma models...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for measuring friction drag in turbulent gas and gas/particle flows over flat plates is presented, and preliminary results are reported. A 0. 25 -in. -thick 72 x 6 -in. Al plate is suspended by six horizontal support air bearings and four vertical alignment air bearings between fixed dummy plates and leading-edge and trailing-edge fairings in the 32 -in. -high 48 -in. -wide 11 -ft-long test {{section of a}} closed-circuit atmospheric wind tunnel operating at 50 - 150 ft/sec. Particles of Fe and Al oxides of diameter 20 - 150 microns and density up to 0. 3 lb particles per lb air are injected via a 6 x 0. 167 -in. nozzle; turbulence is induced by a roughened section of the leading-edge fairing; and friction drag is measured using a <b>load-cell</b> pressure transducer. Sample results are shown in a graph, demonstrating good agreement with theoretical drag calculations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{spatial and temporal}} variation in sediment dynamics and potential microbial respiration rates within parafluvial sediments of a point bar, Upper San Pedro River, Arizona. An innovative technique using seven colocated scour chains and real-time liquid-filled, <b>load-cell</b> scour sensors characterized sediment dynamics at the point bar during the monsoon season of July to September 2002. Stream/bar margins had the greatest scour while vegetated areas had the most deposition. Results from the 2002 monsoon season suggest that variation in sediment load is the dominant mechanism for scour and back fill sequences in the point bar setting for events < 1 year-flood. The vegetated site 52 m from the interface had higher respiration potentials from April through August than the stream-bar interface. Results illustrate that rates of microbial metabolism, comparable to those measured in the upper 20 cm below the water, extend to at least 85 cm below the water table...|$|E
