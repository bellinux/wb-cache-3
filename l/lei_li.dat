With the exception of the slip measurements, these projects were those proposed in the grant application. Instead of slip flow, the original grant proposed imaging electro-osmotic flows. However, shortly after the grant was issued, the PI became aware of work on electro-osmotic flows by the group of Saville in Princeton that was similar to that proposed, and we therefore elected to carry out work on imaging slip flows rather than electro-osmotic flows...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether a}} change in the accounting rule for research and development (R&D) cost is associated with changes in the innovation process. Specifically, I examine whether R&D expenditure, the number of patents per R&D dollar, and the number of citations per R&D dollar differ for firms that capitalize their R&D (capitalizers) relative to those that expense their R&D (expensers) after the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 86, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. I find that relative to expensers, capitalizers increase their R&D expenditure post-SFAS 86. In addition, I find that the quality of innovation declines: post- SFAS 86, the total number of patent citations per R&D dollar decreases more for capitalizers than it does for expensers. This decline is consistent with managers of capitalizing firms taking advantage of SFAS 86 by over-investing in poor quality projects. Overall, the paper provides evidence that financial reporting can impact investments in innovation. by <b>Lei</b> <b>Li.</b> Thesis (Ph. D.)

In addition, BMI 1, as a cancer stem-cell marker, participates in tumorigenesis through various pathways. Rewardingly, recent studies have also revealed a relationship between BMI 1 expression and the clinical grade/stage, therapy response, and survival outcome in a majority of human malignancies, including epithelial ovarian cancer. Therefore, BMI 1 might serve as a potential stratification factor and treatment target for epithelial ovarian cancer, pending evidence from further investigations.

However, the in vivo roles of REGγ mediated-degradation of p 21 Waf/Cip 1, p 16 INK 4 a and p 14 ARF remain unclear. In this study, we showed enhanced expression of p 21 Waf/Cip 1, p 16 INK 4 a and p 19 ARF in multiple tissues from REG–/ – mice compared to REG+/+ mice. Furthermore, we examined the expression of p 21 Waf/Cip 1, p 16 INK 4 a and p 14 ARF in different cancer tissues and observed that the REGγ protein levels were highly expressed in different human cancers while the level of p 21 Waf/Cip 1, p 16 INK 4 a and p 14 ARF appears to be inversely corre-lated.

However, little is known about its role and molecular mechanism involved in NSCLC development and progression. Here, we report the effect of miR- 32 on NSCLC cell proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis. Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression level of miR- 32 in primary NSCLC cases and cell lines. miR- 32 -overexpressing H 1299 and A 549 cells were constructed by lipofection transfection. MTT, transwell chamber, and Western blot assays were used to assess the effect of miR- 32 on proliferation, EMT, and metastasis of NSCLC cells, respectively. Target prediction and luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate the targets of miR- 32. Tumor formation assay in vivo was performed to investigate the antitumor effect of miR- 32. Results: An inverse correlation existed between miR- 32 expression level and NSCLC cell proliferation, EMT, and metastasis, and upregulation of miR- 32 repressed NSCLC cell proliferation, EMT, and metastasis. Moreover, we identified and validated that TWIST 1 was a direct target of miR- 32, and miR- 32 regulated NSCLC cell proliferation, EMT, and metastasis, at least in part via modulation of TWIST 1. The animal experiments showed that overexpression of miR- 32 inhibited the growth of NSCLC tumors in vivo. Keywords: non-small-cell lung cancer, miR- 32, TWIST 1, proliferation, EMT, nude mic...|$|E
40|$|GENERATING USER-CENTRIC DYNAMIC AND ADAPTABLE KNOWLEDGE MODELS FOR WORLD WIDE WEB By <b>LEI</b> <b>LI</b> JUNE, 2007 Committee Chair: Dr. Vijay Vaishnavi Major Department: Computer Information Systems In {{the current}} Internet age, {{more and more}} people, organizations, and {{businesses}} access the web to share and search for information. A web-based resource is often organized and presented based on its knowledge models (categorization structures). The static and inflexible knowledge models of web-based resources have become a major challenge for web users to successfully use and understand {{the information on the}} web. In this dissertation, I propose a research approach to generate user-centric dynamic and adaptable knowledge models for web-based resources. The user-centric feature means that a knowledge model is created based on a web user specified perspective for a web resource and that the user can provide feedback on the model building process. The dynamic feature means the knowledge models are built on the fly. The adaptable feature means the web user can have control of the user adaptation process by specifying his or her perspective for the web resource of interest. In this study, I apply a design science paradigm and follow the General Design Cycle (Vaishnavi and Kuechler 2004) during the course of research. A research prototype, Semantic Facilitator TM SM V 2. 0, has been implemented based on the proposed approach. A simulation-based experimentation is used to evaluate the research prototype. The experimental results show that the proposed research approach can effectively and efficiently create knowledge models on the fly based on a web user preferred perspective for the web resource. I found that incorporating user feedback into the modeling building process can greatly improve the quality of the knowledge models. At the end of the dissertation, I discuss the limitations and future directions of this research...|$|E

Plasma ADM level increases in pregnant women and pregnant rats. Methods: The gene expression levels of Adm and its receptor components- Crlr, Ramp 1, Ramp 2 and Ramp 3, the ADM peptide concentration and localization in the rat female reproductive system during gestation were studied by real-time RT-PCR, EIA and immunohistochemical techniques. Results: The mRNAs of Adm and its receptor component and ADM were differentially distributed between implantation sites and inter-implantation sites of the pregnant uterus. The day on which vaginal sperm were found was taken to be pregnancy day 1. The Adm mRNA levels in the implantation sites of the uteri in mid- (day 12) and late pregnancy (day 17) were more than 10 -fold higher than those in nonpregnancy, pre-implantation (day 3) or early (day 7) pregnancy. ADM was localized in the endometrial stroma with increased immunoreactivity from nonpregnancy to pregnancy. The ADM level and the mRNA levels of Adm, Crlr, Ramp 2 and Ramp 3 in the corpus luteum all increased in late pregnancy compared with early pregnancy. The gene expression of Adm and it receptor components and intense immunostaining of ADM were {{also found in the}} oviduct during pregnancy. Conclusions: The gene expressions levels of Adm and its receptor components- Crlr, Ramp 1, Ramp 2 and Ramp 3, and ADM peptide concentration exhibited a spatio-temporal pattern in the rat female reproductive system during gestation and this suggests that ADM may play important roles in gestation...|$|E

To decrease the cutaneous photosensitivity induced by PDT, many {{attempts have been made}} to search for a targeting photosensitizer; however, few reports describe the molecular mechanism of PDT mediated by this type of targeting photosensitizer. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of PDT induced by a new targeting photosensitizer (PS I), reported previously by us, on HeLa cells. Apoptosis is the primary mode of HeLa cell death in our system, and apoptosis occurs in a manner dependent on concentration, irradiation dose, and drug–light intervals. After endocytosis mediated by the folate receptor, PS I was primarily localized to the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of HeLa cells. PS I PDT resulted in rapid increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Ca 2 + concentration, both of which reached a peak nearly simultaneously at 15  minutes, followed by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential at 30  minutes, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, downregulation of Bcl- 2 expression, and upregulation of Bax expression. Meanwhile, activation of caspase- 3, - 9, and - 12, as well as induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein (GRP 78), in HeLa cells after PS I PDT was also detected. These results suggest that apoptosis of HeLa cells induced by PS I PDT is not only triggered by ROS but is also regulated by Ca 2 + overload. Mitochondria and the ER serve as the subcellular targets of PS I PDT, the effective activation of which is responsible for PS I PDT-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells.
