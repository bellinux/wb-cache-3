5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{is defined}} {{in the absence of}} gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global inertial frames. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.|$|E

5|$|Enumerative {{problems}} in mathematics often concern {{a class of}} geometric objects called algebraic varieties which are defined by the vanishing of polynomials. For example, the Clebsch cubic (see the illustration) is defined using a certain polynomial of degree three in four variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians Arthur Cayley and George Salmon states that there are exactly 27 straight <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> lie entirely on such a surface.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae B is {{a massive}} {{luminous}} hot star, about which little else is known. From certain high excitation spectral <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> {{ought not to be}} produced by the primary, Eta Carinae B is thought to be a young O-type star. Most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a Wolf–Rayet star cannot be ruled out.|$|E

5|$|Frost at Midnight {{was written}} in February 1798. It is based on Coleridge's {{childhood}} {{as well as his}} friendship with Wordsworth, who first exposed Coleridge to the wild beauty of the Lake District. The poem was published in a small work containing his France: An Ode and Fears in Solitude. It was rewritten many times; seven versions have been printed. Of these, the 1798 edition contains six concluding <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> were removed from later editions.|$|E
