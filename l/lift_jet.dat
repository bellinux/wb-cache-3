2500|$|The HS.141 {{design was}} a jet {{airliner}} of all-metal construction with a T-tail and a low-mounted swept wing with a quarter-chord sweepback of 28degrees. The design featured two wing-mounted [...] "cruise" [...] engines and 16 lift fan engines mounted in sponsons {{either side of}} the fuselage (eight per side). The engines under main consideration were the Rolls-Royce RB.220 turbofan for forward propulsion and the Rolls-Royce RB.202, a high bypass ratio lift fan engine using technology developed for the Rolls-Royce RB.162 <b>lift</b> <b>jet.</b> Both engines were themselves design studies by Rolls-Royce and it was feared that there would be delays in their development due to the company's problems at the time.

40|$|The {{transition}} {{flight performance}} of a representative Short Take-Off or Vertical Landing (STOVL) model is investigated using side-by-side experimental and numerical simulations. The model consists of a 60 deg cropped delta wing planform; a simple fuselage shape blended to the wing; and tandem, circular, high-pressure-air <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> that exit perpendicular to the flat lower surface. The configuration was chosen to minimize the geometric modeling complexity while retaining the important flow physics of the lift-jet/aerodynamic surface interaction. Three-dimensional, turbulent Navier-Stokes computations are made using a multiple, overset grid scheme. Results are presented and compared with the measured forces and pressures for the model at a freestream Mach number of 0. 14 and a 10 deg angle-of-attack without <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> operating.

50|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> is a {{jet engine}} angled {{to provide an}} {{aircraft}} with aerostatic (i.e. not requiring the movement of air over an airfoil) lift like a humming bird, instead of (or in addition to) thrust.

50|$|Of a squat {{and compact}} design for {{mounting}} vertically, the RB.108 differed from conventional turbojet engines in having its bearings and oil system designed for prolonged {{operation in the}} vertical attitude. First bench-tested in 1955 by Alan A. Griffith, who had conceived {{the idea of a}} specialised <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> in 1941, thrust was 2,130 lbf (966.15 kg) from a weight of 269 lb (122 kg), giving a thrust/weight ratio of 8:1.|$|E
50|$|Like the Yak-141, the Yak-43 {{would have}} had only a single main engine, {{as well as two}} {{dedicated}} vertical-lift engines. The main engine would have been based on the Samara NK-321 three-shaft augmented turbofan with a takeoff rating of 24,980 kg (55,077 lb). This same engine is used to power the Tupolev Tu-160 Blackjack bomber. The engine {{would have had}} a large air bleed leading to an auxiliary combustion chamber located in the nose, though a separate <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> would have been retained.|$|E
50|$|The {{success of}} the VTOL Harrier {{motivated}} the USSR to introduce a counterpart {{using a combination of}} exhaust thrust vectoring and additional forward <b>lift</b> <b>jets,</b> the Yakovlev Yak-36 flew in 1971, later evolving into the operational Yakovlev Yak-38. Entering service in 1978, the Yak-38 was limited in both payload capability and hot-and-high performance, and saw only limited deployment.|$|R
50|$|Yakovlev studied both {{turboprop}} and jet-powered {{designs to}} meet the requirement, including Vertical Take-Off and Landing designs with <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> in the fuselage or in wing-mounted pods, but eventually they settled on a straight-winged tri-jet carrying 20 to 25 passengers.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe XFV- 12 A {{is a high}} performance, VTOL, fighter/attack aircraft which incorporates ejectors in the wings and canards for thrust augmentation. During transition from VTOL to normal flight, the interaction between downflow of the <b>lifting</b> <b>jets</b> and relative flow from forward flight generates vortices distinct from airfoil circulation. These vortices {{are associated with the}} bending of the <b>lifting</b> <b>jets</b> resulting in induced velocities at the aircraft; the magnitude and influence of the vortices are unknown. The object of this thesis was to prepare a suitable one-tenth scale semi-span model of the XFV- 12 A for a smoke tunnel flow visualization study to explore vortex development. Performance testing was conducted on the canard augmentor, which resulted in a gross augmentation ratio of 1. 34 and mass flow ratio of 6. 84.

5000|$|The first option, for an {{aircraft}} fitted with lift jets, {{resulted in the}} [...] "23-01", {{also known as the}} MiG-23PD ( [...] - <b>lift</b> <b>jet),</b> was a tailed delta of similar layout to the smaller MiG-21 but with two lift jets in the fuselage. This first flew on 3 April 1967, but it soon became apparent that this configuration was unsatisfactory, as the lift jets became useless dead weight once airborne. Work on the second strand of development was carried out in parallel by a team led by A.A Andreyev, with MiG directed to build a variable-geometry prototype, the [...] "23-11" [...] in 1965.|$|E
5000|$|The A-57 was {{equipped}} with a <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> (similar to VTOL aircraft today) facing downward to assist its take-off {{from the surface of}} the ocean. It was intended to refuel from submarines out at sea. The bomber had a long, slender delta wing called the Bartini Wing. It was tested in wind tunnels, but the project was scrapped in 1957 before actual production could begin. Possibly because the Soviet Government after the launch of Sputnik 1 believed that the new R-7 ICBM made bombers less required and decided the Tu-95 would do and that the A-57 project was too expensive and that such an aircraft was not needed ...|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s the British MoD and the US DoD both {{conducted}} studies into <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> solutions. The US studies {{eventually led}} to the F-35 Lightning II. In 1988 the Tornado-sized P.125 design was intended to meet the requirements for a supersonic stealthy STOVL interdictor. There were to be non-STOVL and STOVL variants of the P.125. Both had a single reheated (afterburning) turbofan with a vectorable rear nozzle. The STOVL variant would have maintained vertical flight using three jet lift nozzles. The pilot of the P.125 would have sat highly reclined and would not have had direct sight of the outside world. In the 1990s the UK government decided to join the JSF (now F-35) programme rather than continue the P.125.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The authors examine three {{different}} types of plasma discharges {{in their ability to}} stabilize a <b>lifted</b> <b>jet</b> diffusion flame in coflow. The three discharges include a single-electrode corona discharge, an asymmetric dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD), and a repetitive ultrashort-pulsed discharge. The degree of nonequi-librium of this pulsed discharge is found to be higher than that for the DBD. Furthermore, this pulsed discharge causes the most significant improvement in the flame stability. The optimal place-ment of the discharge electrodes is investigated, and it is found that there is a close relation between this placement and the emis-sion spectra, suggesting use of the emission spectra as a possible indicator of fuel/air mixture fraction. The optimal placement is mapped into mixture-fraction space by use of a fully premixed flame experiment of known mixture fraction. The result shows that the mixture fraction, which corresponds to the optimal placement, is much leaner than that of a conventional <b>lifted</b> <b>jet</b> flame.

50|$|To use <b>jet</b> {{power for}} <b>lift,</b> the impracticality of tail-sitting meant it was {{necessary}} for the aircraft to take off and land vertically while still in a horizontal attitude. Solutions tried included lifting fans (typically buried in the wings), swivelling engine pods similar in concept to the convertiplane, dedicated lightweight <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> or turbofans, thrust-vectoring by deflecting the jet exhaust as needed, and various combinations of these.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{take-off}} lift {{was obtained}} by exhausting the engine flow downward through multiple nozzles. The nozzle thrust was augmented by a secondary flow of cold air. Unfortunately, its performance was far below the estimates, with only 1.04 thrust-to-weight ratio in practice; while the prototype crashed on 10 June 1964, killing the pilot. The second aircraft was converted to <b>lift</b> <b>jets</b> instead, also crashing after several tests.|$|R

50|$|A novel {{alternative}} to the <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> for auxiliary vertical thrust is to be employed by the VTOL Lockheed F-35B version of the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter program. This {{does not have a}} jet lift engine, but a central lift fan that is powered by the main engine via a driveshaft. When not needed, it is declutched from the engine so that it does not consume power (analogous to the transfer case of a four-wheel drive vehicle). The operational viability of this system remains to be seen, and all of the above drawbacks still apply: it is dead weight in flight, and together with the aircraft's internal weapons bays it takes up a great deal of internal space, reducing fuel and avionics load and requiring a bulkier and wider fuselage cross-section (which passes on to the A and C versions, even though they don't have a fan or V/STOL capability). It has, however, in pre-operational testing proven the ability to take off vertically and go supersonic in level flight in the same mission, a first for a combat aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{conventional}} flight, using 48-2, {{took place}} at Zhukovskii on 9 March 1987, with chief test pilot Sinitsyn at the controls. He made the first hovering flight on 29 December 1989 flying 48-3, and used the same aircraft {{to make the first}} complete transition from vertical to high-speed flight and vertical landing on 13 June 1990. From April 1991, various kinds of rolling take-off and run-on landings were performed on normal runways and also [...] "ski-jump" [...] ramps at the <b>lift</b> <b>jet</b> center at Saky.

Chief test pilot Sinitsyn went on to set twelve new world class records, but as the Yak-41 designation was classified, the records were submitted under the fictitious name [...] "Yak-141". As a result, the previously unknown aircraft came to be known in the west as the [...] "Yak-141".
