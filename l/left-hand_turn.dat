5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{his usual}} tactic, the British crew {{approached}} {{from behind and}} below. Suddenly the Heinkel lurched into a tight <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> allowing the gunners to fire a broad-side. The bomber disappeared into the mist. Cunningham asked GCI for help. They tracked the Heinkel flying north near Shaftesbury. Engaging again the German pilot managed {{to turn into a}} head-on position and dive past almost upside down. He continually evaded Cunningham by turning in underneath him at near-impossible angles. Cunningham and Rawnsley came to understand they were not dealing with a novice. Soon a turning match began and then the German attempted to escape by twisting and diving. Cunningham forced him down to 900 feet but Rawnsley and GCI lost contact when the ground clutter hid the Heinkel's signal. Cunningham returned to base. News soon came through the He 111 had crashed onto the slopes on Cranborne Chase. Apparently, the Heinkel had broken through the clouds at only a hundred feet and dived vertically into the ground near the isolated village of Alvediston at 17:05. Intelligence later determined that the machine was a He 111H-6, Werknummer 4627, code 6N+FR, from 7./KGr 100. The bomber disintegrated upon impact. The pilot, Staffelkapitän ("squadron leader") Hauptmann Siegried Langer was killed along with his crew; Oberfeldwebel G. Schmidt, Feldwebel D. Hoffmann, P. Gaidies and Gefreiter W. Worring. It was a unique victory for Cunningham. He had not fired his guns in the 150-minute chase.|$|E
25|$|The plane made {{radio contact}} with {{approach}} control at Prestwick shortly before 11:00p.m. At {{this point the}} cross-wind over the main runway had, unknown to Parmentier, dropped to 14knots which made it within limits to attempt a landing on the main runway. Instead, he decided to attempt an overshoot of the main runway guided by the ground radar controller, followed by a <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> that would bring the plane downwind of the alternate runway. He would then overfly the runway before looping round for his final approach. While it might sound complicated, Parmentier {{expected to be in}} visual contact with the ground which would make such an attempt relatively easy.|$|E

25|$|The {{section of}} the M4 in South Wales has to thread its way through mountainous terrain and {{built-up}} areas, {{so there are some}} unusual junction layouts. Junction 27 (High Cross) is a normal grade-separated roundabout junction, but subject to severe space constraints: traffic joining the motorway must initially travel in the opposite direction to the intended direction of travel, before making a sharp <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> from the slip road onto the motorway. Junctions 30–31 (East Cardiff) were set aside for intermediate additional interchanges at the time of construction. Junction 30 (Cardiff Gate) has since been added but there are no current plans to construct Junction 31 (A469 road). Junction 39 can only be used to access the motorway from a single slip road onto the westbound carriageway from the A48 at Junction 38. There is no exit from the motorway at this junction.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June 2005 it was {{announced}} that an inquest into the crash would be held at the Guildhall in Windsor, Berkshire. The inquest was expected to last 12 days, starting on 17 October 2005. A delay ensued over whether {{the families of the victims}} should be granted legal aid. The inquest finally began in October 2007. A policeman who had witnessed the crash, PC Brazier, testified at the inquest. He told the jury that he believed the crash was caused by a suicide attempt. The Forensic Accident Investigator, David Price, told the inquest that he had been able to determine that the car had been parked on the level crossing with its engine switched off, the handbrake fully applied, the vehicle's lights switched off, the steering on a partial <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> (which was not consistent with driving across the crossing), and that its fuel tank still contained at least 8 litres (about 2 gallons) of petrol.|$|E
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Antonio Giovinazzi set the fastest time for Carlin in the opening practice session with a lap of two minutes and 13.829 seconds, nearly eight-tenths of a second faster than anyone else on the track. His closest challenger was Felix Rosenqvist who fought Giovinazzi for the top spot. Markus Pommer was third-fastest, ahead of the Japanese trio of Kenta Yamashita, Sekiguchi and Kanamaru. Cassidy, Lance Stroll, Mitsunori Takaboshi and Alexander Albon rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was red flagged twice: firstly for Jake Dennis twenty minutes into the session by crashing into the right-hand wall at the Solitude Esses after sustaining a puncture, and secondly for Callum Ilott when he impacted the barrier at the <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> before Faraway corner with nine minutes left. Two other drivers, Sims and Zhi Cong Li, crashed at Lisboa turn but no stoppage was necessitated as both cars were retrieved from the track without difficulty.|$|E
50|$|The M.39 had {{features}} specializing it for Schneider Trophy competition. The course circuit required left turns, so {{the left}} wingtip was slightly {{farther from the}} fuselage than the right wingtip {{to allow it to}} make tighter <b>left-hand</b> <b>turns.</b> To counteract propeller torque reaction, the floats had unequal buoyancy.|$|R
5000|$|A similar concept {{involves}} a [...] "Parclo" [...] A4 partial cloverleaf interchange, since {{that type of}} junction involves turning traffic off the freeway turning left onto the arterial, though the arterial itself exits with loop ramps eliminating <b>left-hand</b> <b>turns</b> onto the freeway, {{as well as to}} not invoke at-grade crossings for left turns onto the freeway.|$|R
50|$|The Bridge Street stop will {{be located}} on George Street, near the intersections with Bridge Street and Grosvenor Street. The stop {{was known as}} Grosvenor Street during development. The design {{includes}} an island platform. The design originally included two side platforms but was switched to an island platform to retain the existing dedicated <b>left-hand</b> <b>turning</b> lane from George Street into Grosvenor Street.|$|R
500|$|The prologue was a [...] {{individual}} {{time trial}} in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. It {{began on the}} bank of the Seine with a [...] straight road. There was then a sharp <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> as the road turned away from the river; there were then several more corners and two roundabouts before the end of the stage. The riders set off at one-minute intervals with Porte, the defending champion, the last to set off.|$|E
500|$|The [...] ride stands [...] {{tall and}} {{features}} four inversions and heavily banked <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn.</b> On the one-minute twenty-five second ride, riders experience speeds {{of up to}} [...] and 4.5 times the force of gravity. A marketing campaign for the ride began 11 months before The Swarm was opened to the public. The ride has generally been well received, ranking highly amongst other roller coasters of its type.|$|E
500|$|The final climb of the {{day came}} with [...] remaining. This was the Côte de Saint-Nicolas ( [...] at 8.6%). Cycling Weekly {{described}} it as [...] "a succession of steep corners with nothing between". After the descent from the climb, the riders entered Ans, the finishing town. There was a long, straight road that started [...] from the finish line. After [...] of flat, the road climbed towards the finish at around 5%. With around [...] to go, there was a <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> that took the riders to the finish line.|$|E
25|$|The circuit {{was one of}} only {{a handful}} on the Formula One 2012 {{calendar}} to be run counter-clockwise, the others being Marina Bay, the Korea International Circuit, Yas Marina, and Interlagos. Because of this, the circuit contains more <b>left-hand</b> <b>turns</b> than right-hand ones, placing greater physical demands on the drivers whose bodies, particularly their necks, are more adapted to the lateral g-forces of clockwise circuits.|$|R
50|$|The Parclo A4 {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular designs, as all {{movements}} from the arterial road to the entrance ramps are made by right-hand turns, providing for a safer entrance to the freeway by eliminating <b>left-hand</b> <b>turns</b> into opposing traffic (which require queues waiting to make such turns). This also makes logical sense since freeways have a higher capacity than arterials and right-turn ramps serve effectively to absorb capacity and reduce traffic on the arterial.|$|R
2500|$|In the United Kingdom, which drives on the left, {{left turn}} on red is prohibited, {{but at some}} {{junctions}} there is a separate left arrow-shaped green [...] "filter" [...] light which, when lit, allows <b>left-hand</b> <b>turns</b> but conflicting traffic will always have a red signal. Other non conflicting traffic movements may have their own left or right arrow-shaped green light. Sometimes there are specific lanes without signals for turning left, separated from the through traffic signalled traffic by traffic islands, but give way signs are installed.|$|R
500|$|After {{loading the}} train, riders left the station making a [...] {{left-hand}} drop {{into a series}} of short hops before turning into the [...] lift hill. At the crest of the lift hill, the track made a <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> over to the first drop, where it dropped [...] to the ground followed by a 70-degree banked turn to the right. Riders then descended [...] down a second drop into a left-hand double helix. Coming out of the helix, the train passed through a mid-course brake run dropping into a straight section of track (where the vertical loop was prior to 2006), before entering another helix, riding a series of short hills. and ending at the final brake run. One cycle of the ride lasted about 2 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
500|$|NY36 {{begins at}} the Pennsylvania state line in Troupsburg, where it {{continues}} south into Pennsylvania as PA249. Heading north from the state line in Steuben County, the route follows Troups Creek northward through rural Troupsburg {{on its way to}} the equally isolated town of Jasper, where it meets NY417 at a junction [...] west of the small hamlet of Jasper. NY36 joins NY417 here, following the east–west route to the western fringe of the community. At a T-intersection just outside the hamlet, the two routes split, with NY417 turning to the right (eastward) toward Corning and NY36 making a <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> to continue northward toward the town of Canisteo. Across the town line, NY36 turns toward the northwest and serves the hamlet of South Canisteo, which marks the southern end of both Colonel Hills Creek and a valley formed by the waterway.|$|E
500|$|On January 11, 2016, the DRR {{temporarily}} {{closed to}} accommodate the construction of [...] The original DRR roundhouse building, which became a maintenance facility for ride vehicles of other Disneyland attractions, was demolished around April 2016. The DRR reopened on July 29, 2017, with a new route along {{the northern edge of}} the Rivers of America named Columbia Gorge, which features rock formations, waterfalls, a trestle bridge, and the line's only <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn.</b> The DRR's dioramas were also given new special effects. During a media preview for the attraction's reopening the previous day, John Lasseter brought his Marie E. locomotive and drove it along the DRR's new route. Pulled behind the Marie E. were an inoperable locomotive and train car, which were both previously owned by Ward Kimball and run on his former Grizzly Flats Railroad. The inoperable locomotive, named Chloe, and the train car are now owned by the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, California, which {{was in the process of}} restoring the Chloe to operating condition at the time of the DRR's media preview.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, {{construction}} {{began on}} a $5.5million project {{to improve the}} intersection between Clover Street (NY65) and Jefferson Road (NY252) {{in the town of}} Pittsford. The project, which had been in development for a decade, involved the widening of Jefferson Road from two to four lanes {{in the vicinity of the}} intersection, the addition of green arrow signal lights for all <b>left-hand</b> <b>turns,</b> and the installation of sidewalks alongside both Clover Street and Jefferson Road. Work on the project was temporarily halted during the winter months; however, it resumed on April1, 2009. The project was completed in late 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Most fly cutters {{simply have}} a {{cylindrical}} center body that holds one tool bit. It {{is usually a}} standard <b>left-hand</b> <b>turning</b> tool that is held at an angle of 30 to 60 degrees. Fly cutters with two tool bits have no [...] "official" [...] name but are often called double fly cutters, double-end fly cutters, or fly bars. The latter name reflects that they often {{take the form of}} a bar of steel with a tool bit fastened on each end. Often these bits will be mounted at right angles to the bar's main axis, and the cutting geometry is supplied by using a standard right-hand turning tool.|$|R
500|$|The fifth road stage {{followed}} a [...] route from Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux to Salon-de-Provence in Bouches-du-Rhône. The stage included five climbs, {{the most significant}} {{of which was the}} partial climb of Mont Ventoux. This was a first-category climb, taking the riders [...] at an average gradient of 9.3%.

500|$|The ride {{begins with}} a <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> {{out of the station}} to the lift hill that ascends [...] Riders are pulled up by a 9,000lbf (40kN) chain lift. At the top, the train dips {{slightly}} into the pre-drop before turning 90 degrees to the left as it drops [...] down the first hill. From the bottom the train immediately enters a [...] vertical loop. The train then enters a zero-g roll followed by the cobra roll which inverts riders twice. The cobra roll was a first for inverted roller coasters. After the cobra roll, the train climbs through an upward spiral and enters the mid-course brake run. Next, the train dives down to the right transitioning into a brief straight section of track. Riders then enter the first of two corkscrews which rotates the train 360 degrees to the left. The track straightens briefly again before turning to the right and entering a short dip before taking riders into the second corkscrew. The ride finishes with a 1.5 revolution flat helix where riders encounter strong positive G-forces before making one last left turn into the final brake run. One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes and 16 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's last certain {{victories}} of {{the year}} were achieved on 21 September 1941. Escorting Bristol Blenheims to Gosnay, the top cover wings failed to rendezvous with the bombers. Near Le Touquet at 15:15 and around 20,000 feet, Johnson's section was bounced by 30 Bf 109s. Johnson broke and turned in and behind a Bf 109F. Approaching from a quarter astern and slightly below, Johnson fired closing from 200 to 70 yards. Pilot Officer Smith of Johnson's section observed the pilot bail out. Pursued by several enemy aircraft, Johnson dived to ground level. About 10 miles off Le Touquet, other Bf 109s attacked. Allowing the Germans to close within range, Johnson turned into a steep <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn.</b> It took him onto {{the tail of a}} Bf 109. Johnson fired and broke away at 50 yards. The Bf 109 was hit, stalled and crashed into the sea. Johnson was pursued until 10 miles south of Dover. The two victories made Johnson's total to six destroyed, which now meant he was an official flying ace. In winter 1941, Johnson and 616 Squadron moved to training duties. The odd convoy patrol was flown but it was an idle period for the Squadron which had now concluded its [...] "Tangmere tour".|$|E
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{begins in the}} station, which is built {{to look like a}} {{partially}} destroyed church, and climbs up a [...] chain lift hill. Upon reaching the top of the lift hill, the track twists 180 degrees anticlockwise, so that riders are upside down, before plunging down the world's first dive drop element. The train then proceeds to dive under the wing of a wrecked plane and into a zero-g roll [...] above the ground before passing through a billboard, immediately following which the on-ride photo is taken. It then enters an inclined loop [...] in height. It then enters a turnaround with a wrecked helicopter with slow-spinning rotor blades in the centre. This is followed by a corkscrew, which passes through the inclined loop. Upon leaving the corkscrew, the train curves past a crashed fire engine with water and fire effects and proceeds through a keyhole: a partly destroyed church tower. The ride then flies over the station and enters into a last inline twist before a mid-course brake run. Following this, the train makes a banked <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> into the final brakes. The train then goes back into the station. The ride previously featured an on-ride video camera, filming riders and allowing the purchase of a DVD afterwards; this was removed sometime in 2016.|$|E
50|$|The fifth road stage {{followed}} a 198 km route from Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux to Salon-de-Provence in Bouches-du-Rhône. The stage included five climbs, {{the most significant}} {{of which was the}} partial climb of Mont Ventoux. This was a first-category climb, taking the riders 9.5 km at an average gradient of 9.3%. Rather than riding {{all the way to the}} summit, the riders descended after Chalet Reynard. This climb came with more than 125 km remaining in the stage. Before Mont Ventoux was a third-category climb; afterwards there were three second-category climbs. The last of these came with 38.5 km to the finish line; this last section was mostly flat, although there were two sharp <b>left-hand</b> <b>turns</b> in the final 1000 m.|$|R

The Col des Echarmeaux was a long, but rolling climb of 3% over , with a steady descent towards the intermediate sprint point, coming [...] before the finish, in the commune of Cublize. The route descended a little further, before the Col des Sauvages, a third-category climb at an average gradient over [...] of 5.5%. The summit of the climb came [...] before the finish into Tarare; the finish was technical, with two tight <b>left-hand</b> <b>turns</b> in the final kilometre.|$|R
2500|$|In Royal Navy service, {{because of}} the limited hangar deck height in several classes of British carrier, many Corsairs had their outer wings [...] "clipped" [...] by [...] to clear the deckhead. The change in span brought about {{the added benefit of}} {{improving}} the sink rate, reducing the F4U's propensity to [...] "float" [...] {{in the final stages of}} landing. Despite the clipped wings and the shorter decks of British carriers, Royal Navy aviators found landing accidents less of a problem than they had been to U.S. Navy aviators, thanks to the curved approach they used: British units solved the landing visibility problem by approaching the carrier in a medium <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn,</b> which allowed the pilot to keep the carrier's deck in view over the anhedral in the left wing root. This technique was later adopted by U.S. Navy and Marine fliers for carrier use of the Corsair.|$|E
2500|$|The group toured Australia {{to promote}} the album and its singles and were [...] "road testing songs". In October they headlined the World's Biggest Barbie in Canberra with Weddings Parties Anything as their support act.

2500|$|In {{the days}} {{preceding}} the incident Soviet military aircraft had been buzzing American and British passenger aircraft while {{they passed through}} the western zones of the city. The Viking was on a scheduled commercial flight from London via Hamburg to RAF Gatow in the British Zone of Berlin. At approximately 2:30pm while the Viking was in the airport's safety area levelling off to land, a Soviet Yak-3 approached from behind. Eyewitnesses testified that as the Viking made a <b>left-hand</b> <b>turn</b> prior to its approach to land, the fighter dived beneath it, climbed sharply, and clipped the port wing of the airliner with its starboard wing. The impact ripped off both colliding wings and the Viking crashed inside the Soviet Sector, at Hahneberg, Staaken, just outside the British Sector (about [...] northwest of Gatow), and exploded. The Yak-3 crashed near a farmhouse on Heerstrasse just inside the British sector. All the occupants of both aircraft died on impact.|$|E
50|$|Traffic {{patterns}} can {{be defined}} as left-hand or right-hand, according to which way the turns in the pattern are performed. They are usually <b>left-hand</b> <b>turns</b> because most small airplanes are piloted from the left seat (or the senior pilot or pilot-in-command sits in the left seat), and so the pilot has better visibility out the left window. Right-hand patterns will be set up for parallel runways, for noise abatement or because of ground features (such as terrain, towers, etc.). In the USA, the non-standard (i.e. right-hand) patterns are noted in the Airport/Facilities Directory or on a sectional chart; in other countries they may be indicated in that nation's similar document, e.g. Canada Flight Supplement. Unless explicitly indicated otherwise, all traffic patterns at non-towered airports are to the left.|$|R
