5|$|Because of the {{geographic}} isolation of their homeland, the Hupa had few interactions with early European explorers, although they <b>later</b> <b>came</b> {{in conflict with}} miners looking for gold. Even after California became a US state in 1850, the Hupa continued to live on their traditional lands and were eventually granted a reservation here in 1876. They are the only Native American group in California to retain most of their original territory; today, the Hoopa Valley Reservation is {{the largest and most}} populous in the state.|$|E
5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what <b>later</b> <b>came</b> {{to be known as the}} continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} the other main island chains of Scotland {{many of the more}} remote islands were {{abandoned}} during the 19th and 20th centuries, in some cases after continuous habitation since prehistoric times.

5|$|After {{being kept}} in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning, on 3 March 1661 the emperor's corpse was transported in a lavish {{procession}} to Jingshan 景山 (a hillock {{just north of the}} Forbidden City), after which a large amount of precious goods were burned as funeral offerings. Only two years later, in 1653, was the body transported to its final resting place. Contrary to Manchu customs at the time, which usually dictated that a deceased person should be cremated, the Shunzhi Emperor was buried. He was interred in what <b>later</b> <b>came</b> {{to be known as the}} Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Beijing, one of two Qing imperial cemeteries. His tomb is part of the Xiaoling (孝陵) mausoleum complex (known in Manchu as the Hiyoošungga Munggan), which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{regarded}} by swimming analysts as a medal chance, {{but were not}} seen as the main threatsSweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the most heavily fancied teams. The hosts had the silver medallists in the 100m backstroke and breaststroke, Viktor Kuznetsov and Arsens Miskarovs respectively, and their butterflyer Yevgeny Seredin had come fifth in his 100m event. Their freestyler Sergey Koplyakov <b>later</b> <b>came</b> fourth in the corresponding 100m event. The British boasted Duncan Goodhew, the 100m breaststroke gold medallist, and Gary Abraham, who had placed fifth in the 100m backstroke. Sweden's butterflyer Pär Arvidsson and backstroker Bengt Baron had won their respective 100m events and their freestyle swimmer Per Holmertz would win silver in the 100m a few days later. Their weakest swimmer was the breaststroker Peter Berggren, who came ninth in the 100m. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. Brooks <b>later</b> <b>came</b> seventh in his 100m freestyle semifinal and 14th overall after having an asthma attack, and Evans was Australia's only medallist in the corresponding individual event, winning bronze in the breaststroke. Kerry had been eliminated in the 100m backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was the Australian champion in the 100m freestyle and backstroke but was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer; the nation {{did not have an}} entrant in the 100m butterfly. Adding to the pressure was Australia's failure to win any gold medals in any sport at the 1976 Olympics. This meant that the public were still awaiting their first gold since the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Coming into the Olympics, Australia was ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries.|$|E

5|$|Brettingham's {{additional}} work in London included two more houses in St. James's Square: No. 5 for the 2nd Earl of Strafford and No. 13 for the 1st Lord Ravensworth. Lord Egremont, for whom Brettingham {{was working in}} the country at Petworth, gave Brettingham another opportunity to design a grandiose London mansion—the Egremont family's town house. Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, known at the time as Egremont House, or more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, {{is one of the few}} great London town houses still standing. It <b>later</b> <b>came</b> to be known as Cambridge House and was the home of Lord Palmerston, and then of the Naval & Military Club; as of October 2007, it is in the process of conversion into a luxury hotel.|$|E
5|$|Catherine was the {{daughter}} of Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, {{one of the most powerful}} figures amongst Bosnian nobility, Grand Duke of Bosnia and the ruler of Zachlumia and Travunia. His domain <b>later</b> <b>came</b> to be known as Herzegovina, after the German title of herzog he adopted in relation to the Duchy of St. Sava. Catherine's mother was Jelena, daughter of Zeta's lord Balša III and the first of Stjepan's three wives. Catherine was the couple's first child but the precise date of her birth is not known; both 1424 and late August 1425 have been suggested by her biographers. It can be surmised that the place of her birth was either the Sokol Fortress, an old seat of the House of Kosača, or the feudal town of Blagaj, Stjepan's favourite residence.|$|E
5|$|Given {{both teams}} {{were in the}} highest tier of English football, the Premier League, they entered the {{competition}} in the third round.

Liverpool by contrast made hard work of overcoming lower-league opponents Tranmere Rovers and Wycombe Wanderers in the latter rounds of the competition.
