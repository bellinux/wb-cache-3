All rats were subcutaneous inoculated once with 108 cfu/ml of Pasteurella multocida strain PMB 202. In addition, Group 1 animals also received intra-muscular injection of dexamethasone (1. 6 mg/animal/day) once daily for 9 days. Blood was collected from all animals before and after inoculation once daily for 9 days, for total and differential <b>leucocytes</b> <b>count.</b> Rats were scarified at day 9 for swabs culture and histological sections of liver, spleen and lung. In dexamethasone-treated animals (Group 1), total <b>leucocytes</b> <b>count</b> decreased after 24 hours (day 1) post-infection and then leucocytosis at day 4 (96 h), then leucopenia at day 8 and 9. Differential <b>leucocytes</b> <b>count</b> revealed gradual neutrophilia and lymphopenia at 120 h post infection (maximum), then neutropenia and lymphocytosis at day 7 and 9. Swab cultured from liver, spleen, and lung revealed positive for P. multocida and Staphylococcus aureus. Histological sections of such organs showed abscess formation surrounded by neutrophils. In Pasteurella multocida inoculated animals (Group 2), total <b>leucocytes</b> <b>count</b> started to increase gradually at day 1 and 2, then decreased to normal level at day 3 and leucocytosis at day 4 (maximum) and then gradual decreased to reach the normal level at day 9.

MethodsSixty adult male Wister albino rats were divided equally into 6 groups (A–F). Rats in groups A–E were experimentally infected with T.  evansi and those in group F were uninfected. The groups were treated respectively as follows: group A-with 3. 5  mg/kg DA; group B- with 1000  mg/kg meth A.  fragrantissima; group C- 3. 5  mg/kg DA plus 500  mg/kg meth A.  fragrantissima; group D- 3. 5  mg/kg DA plus 1000  mg/kg meth A.  fragrantissima. Group E was left untreated. Parasitemia, survivability, packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, total <b>leucocytes</b> <b>count,</b> lymphocyte count, and serum malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were estimated. Phytochemical screening of meth A.  fragrantissima was also performed. ResultsThe phytochemical analysis of the meth A.  fragrantissima indicated a higher content from polyphenolic tannins and non tannins and flavonoids. The efficacy percentage against trypanosomiasis in groups A – E was respectively as follows 80, 40, 90, 100, 0. The administration of meth-A.  fragrantissima (1000  mg/kg b. wt.) produced a moderate efficacy against trypanosomiasis. Untreated rats in group E died between 25 and 30  d post infection. The rats given DA and meth A.  fragrantissima combinations (C and D) showed faster and higher recovery rates than the uninfected control and groups A and B. The initial reduction in packed cell volume, hemoglobin, total <b>leucocytes</b> <b>count,</b> increases in serum malondialdehyde and decreases in GSH levels were reversed by the treatments.

The aim of the present work was to study the role of <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements on admission to hospital in assessing the severity {{of an attack}} of acute pancreatitis. In particular, patients with a life-threatening attack of acute pancreatitis but a normal <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> and CRP level were sought. Material and Methods: A total of 1050 attacks of acute pancreatitis were treated at Turku University Central Hospital during the years 1995 – 1999. <b>Leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> and C-reactive protein (CRP) value were determined on admission to hospital. There were 58 life-threatening attacks of acute pancreatitis (group A). Fifty-eight consecutive mild attacks served as controls (group B). The number of patients with both values normal, only <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> raised, only CRP level raised and both values raised were calculat-ed in the groups A and B. Results: Both <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> and CRP level were significantly (P < 0. 001 in both com-parisons) higher on admission to hospital in patients with a life-threatening disease (group A) than in those with a mild disease (group B).

40|$|Aim: We {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the levels of <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count,</b> erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and high sensitive C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), and to investigate the relation of these biomarkers with the ratio of parenchymal infiltration (RPI) in patients with Chlamydia pneumoniae pneumonia (CPP). Material and Methods: The diagnosis of CPP was based on serologic testing. Patients with CPP were analyzed the blood <b>leucocyte</b> <b>counts,</b> ESR and hsCRP levels. The parenchymal&nbsp; infiltration ratio, given as percent, was calculated from the high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) images using the following formula: Pulmonary infiltration ratio = number of images showing infiltration in HRCT x 100 / number of all images x 2. The relation {{of the extent of}} the infiltrated lung parenchyma, shown by HRCT, with the <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count,</b> ESR and sCRP was investigated. Results: Thirty two patients with CPP were included this study. Increasing levels of blood <b>leucocyte</b> <b>counts</b> in 14 (43. 7 %), ESR in 27 (84. 3 %) and hsCRP in 26 (81. 2 %) patients were observed. High sensitive CRP was moderately but significantly correlated with RPI (r = 0. 476, p = 0. 006). However, RPI was not significantly correlated with blood <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> and ESR (r = 0, 011, p = 0, 952 ve r =&nbsp;, 102, p = 0, 580, respectively). Conclusions: Although both ESR and hsCRP were useful to detect infection, only hsCRP was correlated with the extent of parenchymal infiltration. Therefore, as a parameter sCRP can be used to evaluate the severity of CPP but larger series are needed to confirm this finding...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} modulatory effect of Rosmarinus officinalis leaves extract on radiation-induced {{hematological}} and biochemical changes in Swiss albino mice. The dose reduction factor for the Rosemary extract against gamma rays was calculated 1. 53 from LD 50 / 30 values. The Rosemary extract was administered orally for 5 consecutive days prior to radiation exposure. The hematological and biochemical parameters were assessed from day 1 to 30 post-irradiation intervals. The total erythrocyte count, total <b>leucocytes</b> <b>count,</b> hemoglobin, and hematocrit values in the experimental group were found to be elevated as compared to the control group of mice. Furthermore, the Rosemary extract treatment enhanced reduced glutathione content in the liver and blood against radiation-induced depletion. Treatment with the plant extract brought a significant fall in the lipid peroxidation level, suggesting rosemary's role in protection against radiation-induced membrane and cellular damage. The results from the present study suggest a radio-protective effect of the Rosemary extract against radiation-induced hematological and biochemical alterations in mice...|$|E
40|$|Background: Aplastic anemia (AA) is {{a serious}} and rare {{disorder}} characterized by a hypocellular bone marrow. Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a variant of aplastic anemia in which aplastic anemia follows an acute attack of hepatitis. Several reports have noted an association between HGV and hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia besides other hepatitis causing viruses. Case presentation: A female girl of age 11 year {{with a history of}} loose motion for one month, vomiting for last 15 days and poor oral intake for last few days is reported here. The physical examination presents fever, pallor whereas bleeding, hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and bruising were absent, abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the absence of hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and lymphodenopathy. The laboratory investigation parameters were: haemoglobin 6. 2 g/L, total <b>leucocytes</b> <b>count</b> 1. 51, neutrophils 0. 47 %, absolute reticulocyte count 0. 5 %, Monocytes 0. 16 %, red cell count 3. 2 mil/uL, Picked cell volume (PCV) 30. 13 %, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) 78 fL, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) 26. 3 pg.

40|$|Correlation of polarographical {{reaction}} with hemogram, sedimentation rate, fever, {{serum protein}} level and liver function {{are discussed in}} the present report. The outline is given as follows : 1) Scarcely any correlation can be detected between anemia and polarographical reaction. 2) Correlation to a certain degree can be conjectured between sedimentation rate and polarographical reaction. 3) <b>Leucocytes</b> <b>count,</b> as well as fever, is not found to be correlated with polarographical reaction. But several interesting observations are noted on the percentages of the leucocytes. 4) The decrease of serum protein level and of A/G ratio was observed to be seemingly correlated with polarographical reaction. On the other hand, polarographical reaction was observed to be scarcely correlated with impaired hepatic function due to cancer. 5) Accelerated sedimentation rates and variated serum protein levels are both non-specific phenomena, akin to polarographical reaction. But cancer reaction by means of polarography is far more specific and far more sensitive, and its reacting rate is far higher than other tests. It may be considered {{to be one of the}} best diagnostic means...|$|E
40|$|Studies the {{haematological}} {{parameters of}} clinically healthy goats and sheep in Ibadan, west state of Nigeria. Eighty-five goats from West African Dwarf goat, the Sokoto, Kano Brown goat and their crosses; and 295 sheep from the West African Dwarf sheep of ages ranging from 2 weeks to 7 years were investigated. Most {{values in the}} goats {{were similar to those}} reported for temperate breeds of goats although the haemoglobin concentration and the MCHC were lower. The haematocrit, haemoglobin concentrations and red cell counts of West African Dwarf sheep were lower while the MCV were higher than those for sheep in the temperate climate. RBC values decreased with age in both Nigerian goats and sheep. Although sex and pregnancy appeared to have little or no influence on the erythrocytic values, pregnant ewes had higher haematocrit and haemoglobin values. The low erythrocytic values were attributed to a low but constant parasitic burden which affected the flock. Total <b>leucocyte</b> <b>counts</b> were considerably higher in the Nigerian goat and sheep than those of temperate breeds of animals. Young goats had higher total <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> while pregnant goats had reduced <b>leucocyte</b> <b>counts.</b> The leucocytic values were not affected by age and sex. Pregnant ewes also had higher <b>leucocyte</b> <b>counts</b> than non-pregnant ewes and rams...|$|R
40|$|An {{abnormal}} filterability {{of whole}} blood through micropore membranes in vitro {{has been reported}} in peripheral vascular disease and has been thought to indicate abnormal red cell deformability. Blood from 68 patients with symptomatic peripheral vascular disease of varying severity and from 32 age-matched controls without a history of peripheral vascular disease was studied by the technique of whole blood filtration. In agreement with earlier findings, whole blood filterability was significantly reduced in patients with symptoms of vascular disease, but also their total <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> was significantly higher than that of the controls. Variation in <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> was found to affect significantly whole blood filterability, and the abnormal filterability in peripheral vascular disease could be entirely ascribed to this factor and not to an alteration in red cell deformability. The raised <b>leucocyte</b> <b>count</b> was not due to smoking but its cause could not be explained...|$|R
