40|$|Per- and polyfluoroalkylated {{substances}} (PFASs) are a {{large group}} of organic chemicals that have gained an increased attention during recent years. Many of the compounds have shown to be persistent, toxic and bioaccumulating and they are found in water, soils, sediments, biota, animals and humans across the globe. The effects of PFASs to humans and animals are still being debated. It is suspected that the compounds can be carcinogenic, disrupt different hormone systems and have other severe effects. The main transport pathways of PFASs to soil are applied PFAS based firefighting foam, soil improvers and waste from industries producing PFASs or PFAS based products. Once the PFASs find their way to the soil the risk for leaching to drinking water supplies and aquatic ecosystems becomes some of the issues of great concern. In {{order to be able to}} evaluate the potential leakage of PFASs from different contaminated soils it is important to know how the PFASs interact with the soil matrix and what parameters that affects these interactions. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of organic carbon (OC), Ca 2 + ions and active carbon (AC) on the n of PFCAs and PFSAs to soil. The PFCAs examined were PFHxA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFOcDA, PFHxDA and PFOcDA and the PFSAs examined were PFBS, PFHxS, PFOS and PFDS. Batch experiments were performed on soils with varying concentrations of TOC, Ca 2 + and AC. The samples were spiked with PFAS native standard solution containing the 12 target PFASs. All studied parameters showed a positive influence on the sorption of PFASs to soil. The AC was found to have the highest influence on the sorption. The OC was however found to be the most important soil parameter influencing the sorption of PFASs to soil. In order to investigate the influence of aging on the sorption of PFASs, batch experiments were also conducted on soils from four different PFAS contaminated sites. The results showed that the aging positively influenced the strength of the interactions between PFASs and soil. The organic carbon normalized distribution coefficients (Koc) showed a positive correlation with the carbon chain length of the PFAS molecules and also with the substitution of a carboxylic group with a sulfonic group. The <b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> values calculated in this study decreased in the following order PFDS (<b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> 3. 8 0. 3) > PFOS > (<b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> 2. 8 0. 3) > PFUnDA (<b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> 3. 2 0. 2) > PFDA (<b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> 2. 7 0. 1) > PFNA (<b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> 2. 0 0. 1) > PFHxS (<b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> 1. 9 0. 1) > PFOA (<b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> 1. 8 0. 3) > PFHxA (<b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> 1. 6 0. 3) > PFBS (<b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> 1. 5 0. 2).

30|$|To {{gauge the}} {{hydrophilic}} nature of PSOA, EPI Suite software [KOWWIN Program (v 1.68)] {{was used to}} estimate the Log Kow values {{for two of the}} primary components of PSOA, 10 -hydroxy- 9 -sulfooctadecaneperoxoic acid and 10 -hydroxy- 9 -sulfooctadecanoic acid [16]. Based on this work, a representative Log Kow of 3.12 was identified. The adsorption coefficient (<b>Log</b> <b>Koc)</b> can be used to estimate PSOA’s ability to bind to suspended sediment in water. Testing conducted in accordance with OECD Test Guidelines 121 identified Koc values ranging from 0 to 190, 546 (<b>Log</b> <b>Koc</b> of un-retained to 5.28) [1]. To identify a representative value in this range, a Koc weighted average based on the percent peak area of the test solutions was calculated to be 1.06, resulting in a <b>Log</b> <b>Koc</b> estimate of 0.024. This representative value indicates a relatively low sediment binding potential overall for the PSOA mixture; however, select minor fractions of the PSOA mixture may readily bind sediment.|$|E

The sorption isotherms (Kf and KOC) for Isoproturon were determined for three different soils having various organic carbon and clay content. EC 50 for Lemna was determined both with and without soil. Both the Freundlich adsorption coefficient (Kf) and normalized sorption coefficient (KOC) values varied with different types of soil. There was moderate correlation between the log Kf and <b>log</b> <b>KOC</b> existed. The regression study revealed a strong relationship between <b>log</b> <b>KOC</b> and organic carbon and between <b>log</b> <b>KOC</b> and soil clay content. There EC 50 value for Lemna grown with soil was higher than that grown without soil. However, the difference was statistically insignificant.

The molecular properties were calculated using MOPAC-MNDO molecular orbital methods.

40|$|Organic carbon {{normalized}} sediment-water distribution coefficients (KOC) of {{a series}} of in situ and (mass-labeled) added chlorobenzenes, PCBs, and PAHs were determined in an aged and a more recently deposited sediment layer from Lake Ketelmeer, The Netherlands, using the cosolvent method. The resulting <b>log</b> <b>KOC's</b> for both in situ and added compounds are rather high compared to literature data (up to 9. 3 for benzo[ghi]perylene), with the ones in the recently deposited layer being generally higher than those in the aged layer (up to 1. 6 log units). The results do not show the well-established effects due to increased contact time of contaminants with sediments (i. e. "aging" or "slow sorption") and indicate that after only short equilibrium times (11 days) KOC's can even be higher than after several decades of contact time in the field. In addition, distribution coefficients show a remarkable dependence on sorbate planarity, manifested by significantly different log KOC-log KOW relationships for planar (chlorobenzenes, PAHs, and mono-ortho-substituted PCBs) and nonplanar (multiple-ortho-substituted PCBs) contaminants in both sediment layers. The confirmed presence of sootlike material for which planar aromatic compounds probably have strong affinity is brought up to explain these observations. Differences in KOC's between both layers are discussed in relation to contact time and analyzed soot fractions...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{balances}} are an instructive {{means for}} investigating {{the fate of}} chemicals during wastewater treatment. In addition to the aqueous-phase removal efficiency (Φ), they can inform on chemical partitioning, transformation, and persistence, {{as well as on}} the chemical loading to streams and soils receiving, respectively, treated effluent and digested sewage sludge (biosolids). Release rates computed on a per-capita basis can serve to extrapolate findings to a larger scale. This review examines over a dozen mass balances conducted for various organic wastewater contaminants, including prescription drugs, estrogens, fragrances, antimicrobials, and surfactants of differing sorption potential (hydrophobicity), here expressed as the 1 -octanol−water partition coefficient (KOW) and the organic carbon normalized sorption coefficient (KOC). Major challenges to mass balances are the collection of representative samples and accurate quantification of chemicals in sludge. A meta-analysis of peer-reviewed data identified sorption potential as the principal determinant governing chemical persistence in biosolids. Occurrence data for organic wastewater compounds detected in digested sludge followed a simple nonlinear model that required only KOW or KOC as the input and yielded a correlation coefficient of 0. 9 in both instances. The model predicted persistence in biosolids for the majority (> 50 %) of the input load of organic wastewater compounds featuring a log 10 KOW value of greater than 5. 2 (<b>log</b> 10 <b>KOC</b> > 4. 4). In contrast, hydrophobicity had no or only limited value for estimating, respectively, Φ and the overall persistence of a chemical during conventional wastewater treatment...|$|R

Theenvironmental fate of these chemicals depends on their physico-chemical properties. In theabsence of experimental values for these physico-chemical properties, one can use predictedvalues computed with quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR). As analternative to correlations to molecular structure we have studied the super-structure of areaction network, thereby developing three new QSSPR models (poset-average, cluster-expansion, and splinoid poset) that can be applied to chemical compounds which can behierarchically ordered into a reaction network. In the present work we illustrate these posetQSSPR models for the correlation of the octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow) and thesoil sorption coefficient (<b>log</b> <b>KOC)</b> of chlorophenols. Excellent results are obtained for allQSSPR poset models to yield: log Kow, r = 0. 991, s = 0. 107, with the cluster-expansionQSSPR; and <b>log</b> <b>KOC,</b> r = 0. 938, s = 0. 259, with the spline QSSPR.

Octanol-water partition coefficients, log KOW, and organic matter-water partition coefficients, <b>log</b> <b>KOC,</b> of these s-triazines were measured by reversed-phase HPLC and a triphasic SPME equilibrium model, respectively. The average log KOW (±SD) of the four s-triazine species were: 4. 39 ± 0. 07 (M 3); 3. 38 ± 0. 12 (Irgarol- 1051); 2. 92 ± 0. 12 (M 2) and 2. 54 ± 0. 11 (M 1), while mean <b>log</b> <b>KOC</b> (±SD) of these species were: 2. 47 ± 0. 03 (M 3); 2. 16 ± 0. 03 (Irgarol- 1051); 1. 97 ± 0. 03 (M 2) and 1. 79 ± 0. 04 (M 1).

40|$|Sediment {{screening}} criteria for many munition constituents (MC) {{are not available}} in sources typically used in regulatory-driven ecological risk assessments for contaminated sediment sites. Preliminary sediment quality benchmarks (SQBs) for MC were developed for screening potential risks to marine benthic invertebrates at a munitions contaminated sediment site in Puget Sound, WA, USA. SQBs were developed for 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 13 breakdown products; six other explosive nitroaromatic compounds and nitramines (e. g., RDX, HMX); and five propellants, plasticizers, and stabilizers. The SQBs were developed using freshwater and limited marine aquatic toxicity values (and hence are considered preliminary) and equilibrium partitioning theory to relate water concentrations of the compounds to sediment concentrations. The SQBs are derived from the lowest available aquatic toxicity values for aquatic invertebrates from published reviews, original studies, and database sources; ranges of <b>log</b> Kow and <b>Koc</b> values from published reviews and database sources, and some Koc values calculated from log Kow. SQBs are presented for 25 MC as organic carbon-normalized values and as ranges of dry weight values for various levels of organic carbon content of sediments.

For external validation we applied self organizing maps (SOM) to split the original data set: the best four-dimensional model, developed on a reduced training set of 93 chemicals, has a predictivity of 78 % when applied on 550 validation chemicals (prediction set). The selected molecular descriptors, which could be interpreted through their mechanistic meaning, were compared with the more common physico-chemical descriptors log Kow and log Sw.

Samples of municipal {{wastewater treatment plant}} (WWTP) influent were analyzed for TBBPA. Levels ranged from 1 to 41 ng L− 1, with an average of 20 ± 14 ng L− 1. Matrix effects were shown to be 30 ± 17 % in the influent and- 30 ± 11 % in membrane permeate. The method limit of quantitation was 0. 1 ng L− 1 TBBPA. Sorption of TBBPA to fresh mixed-liquor suspended solids (MLSS) from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) were studied.

Topsoil {{samples were}} collected from lysimeters which were incubated with different residual crops. A physical soil fractionation based on sedimentation and centrifugation steps was performed after water extraction. Four soil phases were obtained designated sediment (SED) phase (> 20 microm), microaggregate (MA) phase (2 microm- 20 microm), colloid (COL) phase (< 2 microm) and electrolyte (EL) phase. The distribution of (14) C-benzo(a) pyrene, (14) C-benazolin and organic carbon between the soil phases was established. Enrichment factors for the two chemicals and organic carbon are higher in the COL and MA phases than in the SED phase. The distribution constant K(d) of chemicals for Merzenhausen topsoil was calculated according to two-phase or three-phase partitioning models.

40|$|The {{transport}} and fate of pharmaceuticals and {{personal care products}} (PPCPs) in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems has become an area of concern in the environmental science community. Due to advances in analytical technology, PPCPs have been detected in surface and groundwater at ng to [micro]g L- 1 concentrations. Chronic exposure to PPCPs at these concentrations may have adverse effects on humans and aquatic organisms. The environmental fate of PPCPs is strongly influenced by their partitioning to soils, which is dependent on soil properties such as texture and organic matter content. However, {{few studies have examined}} the sorption of PPCPs to sandy, Coastal Plain soils containing low organic matter. Rapid subsurface PPCP transport may occur in Coastal Plain regions due to their characteristic permeable soils and seasonally high water tables. Laboratory batch studies were conducted in this study to evaluate the sorption of ibuprofen, a commonly used analgesic, to soils with varying physiochemical properties collected from discrete locations within North Carolina's Coastal Plain region. Sorption distribution coefficients (Kd values) were influenced by soil organic carbon content and ranged from 0. 63 - 1. 26 L kg- 1.

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{in water and}} sediment, the sources/sinks {{and the risk of}} perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in Lake Taihu, China were investigated. The total PFCs concentration was 164 to 299 ng L− 1 in water and 5. 8 to 35 ng g− 1 (dw) in sediment. The highest concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) in water were 29. 2 ng L− 1 and 136 ng L− 1. PFOS was largely associated with sediment, whereas short chain PFCs predominated in water. The partition coefficient (Kd) was positively correlated with the organic carbon fraction (ƒoc) for PFOS but not for the other PFCs. The organic carbon normalized partition coefficient (Koc) increased by 0. 51 log units for each additional CF 2 moiety from perfluoro-butanesulfonate (PFBS) to PFOS. For the same chain length but different functional groups, the <b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> of PFOS was 1. 35 units higher than PFOA. PFOS exhibited the highest affinity for sediment through the partition mechanism, and ƒoc affected the sediment as a sink of PFOS. Although there was no immediate health impact by the intake of the water alone, the consumption of aquatic products may cause potential health risks for animals/humans on the time scale of months to years.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{membrane}} fouling by natural organic matter (NOM) {{on the behavior}} of micropollutants during ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated. Batch experiments with radioactively labeled estradiol and ibuprofen in the presence of NOM model compounds (alginate, Nordic aquatic and Aldrich humic acid) were performed using a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic membrane. The results indicate that the impact of the NOM fractions studied on micropollutant retention correlated with the fouling mechanism of the individual NOM fractions. NOM substances of high molecular weight such as alginate and Aldrich HA that foul the membrane by pore blocking and cake/gel formation had a greater impact than the Nordic aquatic humic acid of lower molecular weight. The effect of cake formation was attributed partly to micropollutant-NOM partitioning and subsequent NOM retention and partly to the effect of the fouling layer itself acting as a kind of second membrane. Fouling by NOM cake/gel formation led to a significantly increased retention of estradiol, whereas the impact of fouling on ibuprofen retention was negligible due to significantly lower <b>Log</b> <b>Koc</b> values of ibuprofen compared to estradiol. Moreover, NOM adsorption on the membrane can lower the adsorption of hydrophobic micropollutants. Membrane adsorption of estradiol was in the order of mg/m 2 and was largely reversible with caustic solutions.

The LFER for OCs sorption on CTMA-Mont, <b>log</b> <b>K(oc)</b> = (1. 45 +/- 0. 20) E - (0. 37 +/- 0. 15) S + (0. 56 +/- 0. 15) A - (1. 75 +/- 0. 25) B + (2. 50 +/- 0. 45) V + (0. 19 +/- 0. 35), was obtained by a multiple linear regression of the sorption coefficients of the OCs against their solvation descriptors. In comparison to water, CTMA-Mont is more polarizable, less polar and cohesive, and has stronger H-bond acceptor and weaker H-bond donor capacities. Using the above equation we calculated that vV and eE were the dominant solvation terms contributing to the sorption for all the OCs. MD simulations provided atomic-level insight into the interlayer structure of CTMA Mont. Phenol molecules were shown to be sorbed into the nanosized aggregates formed by CTMA alkyl chains. The hydrophobic environment within the aggregates {{is responsible for the}} sorbent's more polarizable, less polar and cohesive characteristics. CTMA Mont has strong H-bond acceptor and weak H-bond donor capacities as oxygen atoms on the siloxane surface act as H-bond acceptors for both water and OC molecules.

To investigate the level of potential risk posed by surface contaminated soils, vertical soil column experiments were conducted to assess the mobility, when leached with simulated rainwater, of six selected PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo(e) pyrene and benzo(ghi) perylene) with contrasting hydrophobic characteristics and molecular weights/sizes. The only PAH found in the leachate within the experimental period of 26 days was naphthalene. The lack of migration of the other applied PAHs were consistent with their low mobilities within the soil columns which generally parallelled their <b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> values. Thus only 2. 3 % of fluoranthene, 1. 8 % of pyrene, 0. 2 % of benzo(e) pyrene and 0. 4 % of benzo(ghi) perylene were translocated below the surface layer. The PAH distributions in the soil columns followed decreasing power relationships with 90 % reductions in the starting levels being shown to occur within a maximum average depth of 0. 94 cm compared to an average starting depth of 0. 5 cm. A simple predictive model identifies the extensive time periods, in excess of 10 years, required to mobilise 50 % of the benzo(e) pyrene and benzo(ghi) perylene from the surface soil layer. Although this reduces to between 2 and 7 years for fluoranthene and pyrene, it is concluded that the possibility of surface applied PAHs reaching and contaminating a groundwater aquifer is unlikely...|$|E

Furthermore, for perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), a 30 year time series was measured for three locations using historical eel samples. These historical samples revealed concentrations increasing {{by a factor}} of 2 - 4 until the mid- 1990 s, followed by a return to the initial levels. In the samples described here, PFOS dominated aqueous concentrations, ranging from 4. 7 to 32 ng/L in water, from 0. 5 to 8. 7 ng/g in sediment, and from 7 to 58 ng/g in eel filet. Field-based sediment water distribution coefficients (KD) were calculated and corrected for organic carbon content (KOC), which reduced variability among samples. <b>Log</b> <b>KOC</b> ranges were 2. 6 - 3. 7 for the C 7 -C 9 carboxylic acids and 2. 2 - 3. 2 for the C 4 -C 8 sulfonates. Bioaccumulation factors (log BAFs) for eel ranged from 1. 09 - 3. 26 for the C 7 -C 9 carboxylic acids to 1. 4 - 3. 3 for the C 4 -C 8 sulfonates. Perfluoroalkyl chain length correlated well with both sorption and bioaccumulation factors. Magnitudes and trends in KD or BAF appeared to agree well with previously published laboratory data.

The synthesized NP particles had polarity characteristics similar to those of nonionic surfactant micelles and were largely in the size range of 55 - 155 nm. This work aimed to determine the optimal conditions for leaching of OC contaminated soil with NPs and also to investigate the role and influence of soil properties on this leaching. An investigation of the concentrations of aqueous dispersions of these particles found that a concentration of 10 g L- 1. was found most effective in leaching the OCs from a column of spiked soil. The optimal contact time that allowed a NP dispersion and spiked soil to reach equilibrium was 48 h. The results indicated influencing factors for OC removal and soil remediation were properties both of the soil and the compounds themselves. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content and soil texture played an important role on the sorption as well as compound hydrophobicity expressed as log KOW values. The removal efficiency was found to be in the range of 85. 2 - 92. 8 % for all soil samples and in the order of DDT < aldrin < heptachlor < dieldrin < endrin < lindane regardless of soil type. This order is inversely related to the <b>log</b> <b>KOC</b> values of these compounds. For OC compounds with a similar molecular structure, removal efficiency was related to molecular weight (MW).

40|$|The Mekong is an {{essential}} source of water and protein for the denizens of Thai Laos countries. It is hypothesized that pollution may be adversely affecting the water and sediment quality, which threatens the short and long-term use of this major river system. This directly impacts on the health and population of the aquatic life and ultimately {{human health and the}} economy for both countries is affected. The quality of the river can be assessed from various chemical and physical parameters, such as PAHs and metals content of both the water and the sediment. The introduction of Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) allows comparison of the values obtained with the guidelines. Furthermore the modelling program EPISUITE was used to determine the environmental partitioning of pollutants within the different environmental compartments. Using the data produced for PAHs and metals the experimental model was compared to the default model. This involved experimentally measuring the <b>log</b> <b>Koc</b> forMekong sediments and from this determining the log Kow. High availability in sediment of pollutants may lead to greater biomagnification in bethnic fish, which may then be hazardous for human consumption even if it is safe for the species that is accumulating pollutants. The potential for this is shown by the calculated accumulation in biota Cbio values exceeding both the Chronic value (ChrV) and Lethal Concentration 50 (LC 50) for fish in the Mekong River. When compared to the EQS guidelines the amount of some PAHs, cadmium and lead in sediment were above the lowest effect level but below the severe effect level...|$|E
40|$|Goal, Scope and Background. Distribution of {{hydrophobic}} organic {{contaminants in}} abiotic compartments {{is essential for}} describing their transfer and fate in aquatic ecosystems. Taihu Lake is the third largest freshwater lake in China. Water quality of Taihu Lake has deteriorated greatly during the last decades and has threatened the water supply. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the partitioning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among overlying water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), sediments, and pore water in Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake and to provide useful information for the ecological engineering in this area. Materials and Methods. Overlying water and surface sediment were sampled from six sites in Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake, China, Within 72 h of sampling, sediments were centrifuged to obtain the pore water. Overlying water samples were filtered to separate dissolved and SPM samples. After extraction, samples were purified following a clean-up procedure. PAH fraction was obtained by elution with a mixture of hexane: DCM (7 : 3, V/V) and analyzed by GC/MS. Results. PAHs concentrations in overlying water varied from 37. 5 ng/L to 183. 5 ng/L. Concentrations of PAHs in pore water were higher than those in overlying water. The total concentrations of 16 priority PAHs in sediments ranged from 2091. 8 ng/ g-dw to 4094. 4 ng/g-dw. PAHs concentrations on SPM were decreased with suspended solid concentrations (SSC). Total PAHs concentrations on SPM varied in the range of 3369. 6 ng/g-dw to 7531. 1 ng/g-dw. The partition coefficients between sediment and overlying water (log K-oc) for PAHs with log K-ow < 5 were positively correlated with their octanol-water partition coefficients (log K-ow) (n= 39, r= 0. 79, p < 0. 0001). Partition coefficients between sediment and pore water (log K-oc') for all PAHs were also significantly correlated with their log K-ow values (n= 48, r= 0. 82, p < 0. 0001). Discussion. In general, PAHs derived from combustion sources tend to bind strongly to soot particles in natural sediment. Consequentially, K., values observed in the natural environment could be orders of magnitude higher than those predicted by linear correlation relationships under laboratory conditions. In the present study, the ratio of log K-oc values to log K-ow values falls consistently above 1, indicating that the sediment soot carbon in the bay was more attractive for PAHs than n-octanol. The log K-oc' was also higher than that predicted under laboratory conditions, suggesting that the measured pore water PAH concentrations were lower than those predicted. That is to say, not all the sediment PAHs can be available to partition rapidly into sediment pore waters. A variation in soot content is a possible reason. Furthermore, concentrations of PAHs on SPM were higher than those in sediments. The compositions of PAHs on SPM and in sediments were similar, indicating the importance of re-suspension process of sediments in the partitioning process of the shallow lake. Conclusions. The results indicated the equilibrium partitioning model could be used to predict PAHs distribution in various phases of a shallow lake in the stagnation period, but re-suspension processes should be considered to modify the relationship between <b>log</b> <b>K(oc)</b> s and log K(ow) s. Recommendations and Perspectives. Concentration, particle size and composition of resuspended particles could affect the relationship between <b>log</b> <b>K(oc)</b> s and log K(ow) s. Further work should be done under field conditions, especially where a steady thermodynamic equilibrium state could be assumed...|$|E
40|$|The {{fate and}} {{transport}} of insoluble, hydrophobic organic pollutants in the aquatic environment constitutes a prominent area of concern. It {{is thought that}} pollutants of this nature may exist in association with organic carbon, which is predominantly aquatic humus. This type of association could significantly affect the kinetics of such transformation processes as volatilization or chemical and biological degradation of the pollutant. While dissolved organic matter (DOM) comprises the bulk of organic carbon (or aquatic humus) in natural waters, the interaction between naturally occurring DOM and insoluble organic pollutants has not been quantified. The work presented in this dissertation {{is an effort to}} quantify the effect of dissolved organic matter on the solubility in water and, hence, the transport of hydrophobic organic compounds (specifically, DDT) in the environment. Saturated aqueous solutions of DDT were generated by a method that is different from those used by other workers. Within a closed system, an excess of solid DDT was allowed to vaporize and enter an aqueous solution through the gas phase. The concentration of DDT in solution increased with time, leveling off when equilibrium and a saturated solution was established. The solubility of p,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT in distilled water was determined to be 1. 87 (+OR-). 01 ppb. The solubility of the o,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT isomer in distilled water was determined to be 4. 88 (+OR-). 03 ppb. The concentrations of p,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT and o,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT in distilled water solutions containing dissolved organic matter were definitely higher than the aqueous solubilities of these compounds. A minimum value for the DDT/DOM partition coefficient (K(,p)) in water was determined. This partition coefficient, when normalized to organic carbon, is referred to as K(,oc) (K(,oc) = K(,p) /fraction organic carbon). A minimum <b>log</b> <b>K(,oc)</b> for both p,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT and o,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT was determined to be 4. 7 (+OR-). 2 log units. Under environmental conditions, this partition coefficient indicates that the majority of DDT present in aqueous systems will be associated with dissolved organic matter...|$|E
40|$|International audienceParis {{conurbation}} is {{a heavily}} urbanized but weakly industrialized catchment. Recently, {{it has been}} shown at the scale of Paris that alkylphenols (AP) and phthalates (PAE) are not rejected by the industry, but they originate from domestic wastewater at more than 95 %. However, the contribution of the different types of greywater to the pollution by alkylphenols and phthalates was not addressed. This work aims at providing new insights on this particular point. Hence, the concentration of four phthalates (diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), and di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)) and two alkylphenols (octylphenols (OP) and isomers of nonylphenol (NP)) were followed in greywater. For each sample, analyses were carried out on both the dissolved and particulate phases. Moreover, water quality parameters were also monitored, in order to find out whether or not any correlation exists between the concentration of the investigated contaminants and the quality of water. Water quality parameters studied are pH, total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved and particular organic carbon (DOC and POC), chemical and biochemical oxygen demands (COD and BOD 5), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and anionic detergents (methylene blue active substance or MBAS). This paper presents the methodology used to monitor two greywater with the most important volumes: showers and washing machines. These greywater showed high variability with regard to water quality parameters. Moreover, AP and PAE concentrations are given for the first time for these two types of greywater. All compounds except OP were observed in almost all samples in {{at least one of the}} two monitored phases. The concentrations varied between limit of quantification for OP and 102 μg/l for DEHP. The levels measured in washing machines were higher than those for showers for all compounds. For instance, median NP concentration in washing machines was 3. 59 μg/l against 1. 09 μg/l in showers, DEHP was observed at 102 μg/l in washing machines against 16. 6 μg/l in showers. Variability of the results was explained by habits of individuals (shower time, number of products used…) but also by differences in product composition. However, each type of water exhibited the same distribution. NP was the most abundant AP (about 85 % of the total amount) while DEHP represented the two thirds of the PAE compounds. The partition coefficients (Kd in l/kg) were evaluated. The results showed that log Kd ranged between 2. 1 (DEP) and 4. 8 (DEHP). <b>Log</b> <b>Koc</b> presented similar trends lying in the 2. 4 (DEP) - 5. 0 (DEHP) range. Finally, with regard to greywater quality, the application for greywater reuse is discussed...|$|E

Much research on the environmental fate of hormones has focused on the structural isomers most biologically active in mammals, e. g., the 17 beta-isomers of the estrogen estradiol (E 2) and the synthetic androgen trenbolone (TB). However, recent work has shown that the alpha- and beta-isomers of E 2 and TB can cause comparable effects on certain aquatic species. To improve our understanding and ability to predict isomer-specific interactions with environmental sorbents, we measured the association (K-DOC) of the alpha- and beta-isomers of E 2 and TB as well as their primary metabolites (estrone and trendione) with two commercial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources by measuring both free and DOC-bound hormone concentrations. We also measured solvent-water partition coefficients partitioning (K-SW) for the same hormones using hexane, toluene, and octanol. Log K-DOC log. K-OC (OC-normalized sorption by soils), and K-OW values are all greater for the beta-isomer except between the E 2 isomers. Theoretical descriptors reflecting electronic character and solute-solvent interactions were calculated to elucidate isomer-specific behavior. Trends for log K-OW and log K-DOC among hormones as well as between isomers are explained reasonably well by computed electrostatic potential and H-bonding parameters.
