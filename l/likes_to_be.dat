Despite {{the end of their}} relationship, however, they can't seem to get away from each other, in part because Sophie's mother is constantly plotting to reunite them. His continued presence in Sophie's life also complicates her efforts to find a new boyfriend: in one episode, he accidentally sees Melissa giving Sophie's current love interest a few pointers on how Sophie <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flirted with, mistakes him for someone Melissa is seeing behind his back, and later punches him in the face at a gallery show. In the first season finale, he almost asked Melissa to marry him, but when that failed he saw Sophie crying over being rejected by André and as they were about to go get a drink, he sees André walking towards the two.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a certain kind of}} creature from that of there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an F is recommended...|$|R

500|$|Saint-Saëns {{composed}} {{more than}} sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He {{was proud of his}} connection with British choirs, commenting, [...] "One <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio." [...] He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it.|$|E

After the trade, Lofton stated, [...] "It's been very tough. I'm the kind of guy that <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> settled down. It's been very tough the last three or four years.

30|$|So the {{creative}} imagination of bhāvana {{is used in}} conjunction with meditative practices prescribed by earlier yogic traditions and complements them. With bhāvana one appropriates into one’s sense of self a kind of feeling-being state that imagines what it’s <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free of bondage. In some sense this recalls Nagel’s “what it’s <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bat”, but in this case, rather than bat or wasp, one uses this embodied imagination to tap into what it’s <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a liberated puruṣa, someone free of karma. This feeling into “what it’s <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> x” also entails that this imaginative practice, carries a capacity to mold and transform the body, first the subtle body and then following on this, the physical body. In this respect this is more than mere empathy, feeling what it’s <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another, bat or person. It entails also an embodied habitus, a whole identity as being in the world which bhāvana addresses and attempts to transform and direct. Just as Nagel’s formulation entails an assumed embodiment, so also does bhāvana, and bhāvana in this case proposes the possibility of transforming this embodiment.|$|R
