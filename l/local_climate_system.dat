Dust could reach Mediterranean and South European countries because of the local meteorology, the source points are often in the Sahara desert. Using Satellites Spectroradiometry we could detect and visualise dust over land and oceans. We used three Modis combination bands into the multispectral data analysis toolkit HYDRA (HYperspectral data viewer for Development in Research Application) : a simple algorithm is showed {{with the help of}} HYDRA software, which help scientists to see dust easily without any other processed data.

Further analysis indicates that this warming trend mainly results from the nighttime warming. The Single-Column Atmosphere Model (SCAM) version 3. 1 developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research is used to investigate the role of land use change in the TP <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> and isolate the contribution of land use change to the warming. Two sets of SCAM simulations were performed at the Xinghai station that is located {{near the center of the}} TP Sanjiang (three rivers) Nature Reserve where the downward LAI trend is largest. These simulations were forced with the high and low LAIs. The modeling results indicate that, when the LAI changes from high to low, the daytime temperature has a slight decrease, while the nighttime temperature increases significantly, which is consistent with the observations. The modeling results further show that the lower surface roughness length plays a significant role in affecting the nighttime temperature increase...|$|E
40|$|Many climate impact {{applications}} {{are sensitive to}} local differentials in the climate system. This study investigates how eco-geographic factors influence the local climate and propagate eco-climatic complexes that vary spatio-temporally. Local geography data including elevation, slope, aspect, rainfall, temperature, vegetation, population density, and soil potential for agriculture were integrated and analyzed using geographic information system and principal component analysis. The result was profiled for local climate drivers and associated spatial structures in present and future climate (2046 - 2065) scenarios. The results suggest a <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> driven by the coupling between terrain, rainfall and temperature in all seasons. In the present climate, this coupling creates eco-climatic complexes that extend from the southeast to northwest corridor in all seasons except June-July-August (JJA) when it is shifted to the northeast axis. This pattern is projected {{to continue in the}} future climate scenario, but its spatial influence and intensity would weaken around the northwest axis and rainfall will become less significant in the system in JJA. The clustering of rural settlements these complexes suggests the climate-positives produced by the system significantly support rural livelihoods. Thus, these eco-climatic complexes represent climate sensitive natural resource systems that should be targeted as a fulcrum for climate change mitigation and adaptation in the wooded savannah...|$|E
40|$|Like urban heat islands (UHI), human-induced land {{degradation}} (HLD) {{is a phenomenon}} attributed to human activities, but this phenomenon occurs in non-urban areas. Although {{a large body of}} work has demonstrated that land-cover change influences <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> <b>systems,</b> little work has been done on separating the impact of HLD from naturally-occurring fluctuations in very high-altitude areas. We developed an innovative NDVI-difference method in order to evaluate HLD effects upon the <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> in the central Tibet Plateau. The results show that the minimum temperature increased at a significantly faster pace than the maximum temperature in the growing season at HLD meteorological stations, but this was reversed at stations with natural forces only. Further analysis revealed that abrupt changes of minimum temperature occurred five years earlier and amplitudes of these changes were 1. 4 times larger than at stations with natural forces only. Therefore, our results complement other evidence that points to the fact that local effects from UHI contribute to climatic asymmetry observed between minimum and maximum temperature trends. Accordingly, we stress the need for consideration of non-urban factors from anthropogenic activities, such as human-induced {{land degradation}}, in understanding these asymmetric diurnal changes...|$|R

40|$|Urbanization is {{a global}} problem with {{demographic}} trends. The urban heat island plays a dominant role in <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> <b>systems.</b> Despite existing efforts to understand the impacts of multiple urbanization factors on the urban heat island globally, very {{little is known about}} the attribution of urban heat island magnitude to urbanization in different locations or developmental phases. In this study, based on global land surface temperature data, urban spatial domain data, gross domestic product (GDP), and population data, we analyzed the influence of multiple urbanization factors on global surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII). We also tentatively compared the abovementioned factors between different regions across the globe, especially between China and the USA, the largest countries that are experiencing or have experienced rapid urbanization in recent decades. The results showed that global SUHII had remarkable spatial heterogeneity due to the geographical and socioeconomic variation between cities. There was a significant correlation between SUHII and population as well as GDP in global cities. Moreover, this study suggested that the impacts of population on SUHII might be stronger in the early stages of urbanization, and the GDP factor would become a critical factor at a certain development level. The urban area also had non-ignorable impacts on SUHII, while the correlation between SUHII and urban shape was relatively weak. All these may imply that the best approach to slow down SUHII is to find other solutions, e. g., optimize the spatial configuration of urban internal landscapes, when the urbanization reaches a high level...|$|R
40|$|Through {{collaborative}} {{and individual}} projects in two upper level courses, undergraduate students established a new surface environmental observation station (Austin College Weather Station). In addition to standard meteorological observations, the Austin College Weather Station detects radiation and soil measurements. These additional measurements {{are used to}} calculate the local surface energy balance, an important indicator of <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> interactions. The weather station projects provided excellent opportunities for students to participate actively in the scientific process. The first phase involved establishment of the weather station. In this semester-long collaborative project, students engaged in all aspects of scientific field research, including planning, testing, implementation, data collection, analysis, and evaluation. They became experts on two weather station instruments. The second phase involved calibration and validation of the Austin College Weather Station. These 7 -week individual projects required student research proposals, research papers, and peer review. Student learning outcomes included both scientific content and scientific process. Many innovative assessment tools were utilized, including proposal writing, peer review, group meetings, research presentations, research papers, and a faculty review panel. These courses both received strong marks from students for promoting critical thinking and teaching effectiveness. Perhaps most importantly, students had fun participating in these research projects with real-world applications...|$|E
40|$|A {{hydrological}} modelling framework was {{assembled to}} simulate the daily discharge of the Mandovi River on the Indian west coast. Approximately 90 % of the west-coast rainfall, and therefore discharge, occurs during the summer monsoon (June-September), with a peak during July-August. The modelling framework consisted of a digital elevation model (DEM) called GLOBE, a hydrological routing algorithm, the Terrestrial Hydrological Model with Biogeochemistry (THMB), an algorithm to map the rainfall recorded by sparse rain-gauges to the model grid, and a modified Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. A series of discharge simulations (with and without the SCS method) was carried out. The best simulation was obtained after incorporating spatio-temporal variability in the SCS parameters, which was achieved by an objective division of the season into five regimes: the lean season, monsoon onset, peak monsoon, end-monsoon, and post-monsoon. A novel {{attempt was made to}} incorporate objectively the different regimes encountered before, during and after the Indian monsoon, into a hydrological modelling framework. The strength of our method lies in the low demand it makes on hydrological data. Apart from information on the average soil type in a region, the entire parameterization is built {{on the basis of the}} rainfall that is used to force the model. That the model does not need to be calibrated separately for each river is important, because most of the Indian west-coast basins are ungauged. Hence, even though the model has been validated only for the Mandovi basin, its potential region of application is considerable. In the context of the Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB) framework, the potential of the proposed approach is significant, because the discharge of these (ungauged) rivers into the eastern Arabian Sea is not small, making them an important element of the <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Natural Sources of pollutants, such as Sahara desert dust {{outbreaks}} or ashes from vulcanoes, in many cases, {{could grow}} the bad air quality forecast and PM limits values measured could exeed the European Law recomendations, {{in that case}} the country {{have to pay to}} the Community if an evidence of that is a Natural Pollutant is not brought to the European Court. The goal to control air quality could be reached studying the pollution sources, the dispersion with atmospheric model, the chemical reactions occurring and also the study of air depositions. Exeedences of air quality limit value represent breaches of Community law which can have significant legal consequences for the European Member States. For some existing limit values, such as those in the directive 1999 / 30 /EC (first daughter Directive), an exeedence which is caused by particular natural sources can be ignored for the purpose of ensuring compliance with Community law; article 2. 15 of the first daughter directive defines “natural events” as volcanic eruptions, seismic activities, geothermal activities, wild-land fires, high wind events or the atmospheric resuspension or transport of natural particles from dry regions. The next air quality directive will likely extend this principle to natural (i. e. Non anthropogenic) sources of pollution generally so long as the “natural contribution” can be quantified and documented. Particle Matters (PM) emissions sources are sea-spray, soil moved by wind, biogenic aerosols, volcanic emissions, forest fires, and anthropogenic sources. The EU legislation give limits for mobile emission, there are many like the Euro X limitation for private cars (gasoline and diesel). To control the road transport emissions there is a common trend of modification of the engines technology, the reduction of traffic in big city centre, the use of Pb and S free fuel, the promotion of the use of renewable energy and the use of alternative fuel. A cure strategy is post combustion treatment. The aim of this PhD work is to present a new way to approach radiative tranfer on air when dust episodes occurs, and to start a study/work group able to inform, with quality and quantity data, on natural sources of air pollution, capable to discuss with other governative and regional organizations such as ARPAS (with monitoring in site stations or mobile devices), and POLARIS 's entrerprises, which main topic is dealing with Environmental Science and Air quality.

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of the annual mean urban heat island (UHI) intensity pattern was analysed for the medium-sized city Novi Sad, Serbia, located on the low and flat Great Hungarian Plain. The UHI pattern was determined by an empirical modelling method developed by (Balázs et al. 2009). This method was based on datasets from urban areas of Szeged and Debrecen (Hungary). The urban study area in Novi Sad (60 km 2) was established as a grid network of 240 cells (0. 5 [*]km[*]× 0. 5 [*]km). A Landsat satellite image (from June 2006) was used in order to evaluate normalized difference vegetation index and built-up ratio by cells.

40|$|Abstract - In {{this study}} the time series of monthly averages of temperature, {{cloudiness}} and solar radiation are analyzed {{to investigate the}} chaotic properties of the <b>local</b> <b>climate,</b> {{and the possibility of}} the estimation of an minimum number of independent variables necessary to model the time evolution of the underlying <b>climate</b> <b>system.</b> The analysis of observations is based on a statistical procedure, called "correlation algorithm", leading to the measures of dimensionality or degrees of freedom which control the underlying dynamics. The results show that there is no indication of the existence of a lowdimensional attractor of the Zagreb-Grič time series. Within a <b>climate</b> <b>system,</b> it is possible to isolate a three-variable subsystem, controlling the large amplitudes of the <b>local</b> <b>climate.</b> These are: temperature, cloudiness and solar radiation. The existence of autocorrelation in the time series, due to solar radiation, has enabled the detection of a low-dimensional attractor. When the seasonal cycle has been theoretically filtered out of the series, the correlation disapped, as well as the low-dimensional climate subsystem...|$|R
40|$|The method Passive Cooling Load Ratio (PCLR) is an {{innovative}} simplified method which calculates the monthly cooling energy {{needs of a}} thermal zone where passive cooling systems are installed using the variables: cooling energy load and passive cooling potential. This new method {{is based on the}} Solar Load Ratio (SLR) that was previously developed for solar heating systems. Although, PCLR was theoretically developed for any passive cooling system, here it is applied to passive cooling based on ventilation strategies. In addition, this paper presents its application to an office room ventilation using: i) forced cooled air from an earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHE) and ii) natural induced air by a solar chimney from the EAHE. Correlations were obtained for those systems, using the parameters that describe the <b>local</b> <b>climate,</b> the <b>system</b> type and its dimensions. The numerical model used to obtain the correlation functions when one of the systems is installed, associates previously developed numerical models with 5 R 1 C model of ISO 13790. However, the PCLR method can be used to accurately estimate the cooling energy needs without using complex models for simulation. The error for all systems does not overcomes 5. 2 %, which is an acceptable variation for a simplifed method...|$|R

Both <b>climate</b> <b>systems</b> have been demonstrated to considerably influence ecological processes. Several other large-scale climate patterns also exist. Although less well known outside the field of climatology, these patterns {{are also likely to}} be of ecological interest. We provide an overview of these climate patterns {{within the context of the}} ecological effects of climate variability. The application of climate indices by definition reduces complex space and time variability into simple measures, 'packages of weather'.

40|$|One {{important}} climate {{factor for}} tropical area is rainfall. Changes in rainfall pattern will cause numerous problems especially in agricultural activities {{and it could}} also lead to either flood or drought; problems which will not only affect agricultural activities but also socio-economic situation of broad community. Therefore, study of <b>local</b> <b>climate</b> variability focusing on rainfall related to the global warming is important. Time series analysis (correlogram and periodogram) of daily rainfall was chosen to investigate the phenomena of global warming in local scale. Data (1974 - 2004) was collected from Sumberjaya, Air Hitam and Fajar Bulan; three stations located {{inside one of the}} important watershed in Lampung Province. From the correlogram, in general daily rainfall in this upland and forest area shows independency up to the year of 1990.

40|$|Manipulating {{the urban}} fabric is {{fundamental}} to mitigate and adapt to the warming trend in the growing high-density tropical cities. However, excessive data needs, weak analytical methods and the un-coordinated planning regimes pose barriers to achieving this aim. The main {{aim of the research}} is to bridge the gap in urban design-climate links, being translated into guidelines for real-world applicability in a background climate affected by global warming. The study is limited to the warm humid tropical climate of Colombo, Sri Lanka, as the experimental context for the research. The main research questions are related to; the microclimatic background condition under current and future warming scenario; sensitivity of the key urban morphology variables that will define and drive the decision making process; and the planning and policy implications that link climate and urban design. The study employs the <b>Local</b> <b>Climate</b> Zone (LCZ) <b>system</b> as a method of contextual analysis, together with LCZ-based morphology simulations (ENVI-met), utilising Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) as the key dependent variable. Statistical analyses (SPSS) of the results test the applicability and sensitivity of urban morphological variables to help mitigate / adapt to local and global warming.
