5|$|Players can utilize Kinect to {{look into}} a corner using a new head {{tracking}} feature. This allows them to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{changes were}} made to give the {{ceremony}} a sleek, interactive look while shortening {{the length of the}} ceremony. Cates announced that in certain categories, all five nominees would be up onstage prior to the announcement of the award. In other instances, the actor or actress would present the award in the audience. In addition, production designer Roy Christopher designed an technologically ambitious stage for the telecast that both saluted the past while <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> future. The set prominently featured 26 high-definition video monitors floating over the first twelve rows of the audience and a 40-foot LED screen situated beneath a layer of plexiglass on the stage floor. Both screens were used display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters took the stage or random film clips during several commercial breaks. A gold rod featuring 23 different life-sized Oscar statuettes spiraling upward was placed at center stage.|$|E
25|$|Some Jewish historians {{suggest a}} {{different}} {{explanation for the}} rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism. First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome’s grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, like the AD 135 experience.|$|E

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{noted that}} the North Central crew {{would have had to}} <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sun to see the {{approaching}} Air Wisconsin plane and concluded that they took no evasive action. Some eyewitnesses believed that the Air Wisconsin Twin Otter began a turn seconds before the collision, but the NTSB did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that the Air Wisconsin crew took evasive action. The rate of closure during the final five seconds before the collision was 688 feet (210 m) per second, i.e., 469mph (755km/hr).|$|E
25|$|Traditional cycle lanes {{increase}} vehicle/bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist {{must look}} ahead to avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a crosswalk. As the intersection curves away from the exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To {{give way to a}} cyclist on the outside, requires the exiting motorist to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 study found that the risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. Cycle lanes were installed at St. John's roundabout in Newbury, Berkshire, England and at Museum Road, Portsmouth, England. The cycle lanes at Museum Road were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing, while the St. John's roundabout retains perimeter cycle lanes.|$|E

But if you look toward God, you will love them and be kind to them, for the world of God is the world of perfection and complete mercy. Therefore, do not look at the shortcomings of anybody; see with the sight of forgiveness." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the March 8, 2014 disappearance, information regarding JORN's status was not released. This led to months of speculation. On March 18, 2014, sources cited by The Australian said that JORN was not tasked to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean on the night of the disappearance of MH370 as there was no reason for it to be searching there at that time. On March 20, 2014, it was reported that Malaysian Defence Minister (also Acting Transport Minister) Hishammuddin Hussein requested the US to give any information from the Pine Gap base near Alice Springs, possibly alluding to JORN as well. On March 19, 2014, it was reported that an Australian Defence Department spokesman said it [...] "won't be providing comment" [...] regarding specific information on tracking MH370 by JORN. However, several days prior to this, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Australian Parliament, [...] "All our defence intelligence relating to Flight 370 has been, and will continue to be, passed on to Malaysian authorities..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second tale, {{related by}} the travel writer Will R. Bird, occurs {{at a time}} when men from the north shore of the Minas Basin used to cross the water to buy horses from farmers in the Annapolis Valley. During his summer travels in the late 1950s, Bird {{encountered}} an oldtimer on a farm near the Parrsboro golf course across the harbour from Partridge Island. [...] "You ever hear of our sea horse?" [...] the oldtimer asked. [...] "There ain't nothing to match it in Nova Scotia." [...] The story begins when Tom Smith crosses over to buy a mare from a man in Canning. The mare then had a black foal that [...] "was one of the finest ever seen on this shore." [...] After about seven years, the farmer from Canning showed up at Smith's farm and, obviously regretting that he had sold the mare, he offered Smith [...] "more'n twice the going price" [...] for his fast, black horse. [...] "Tom was a man who watched the dollars and he just couldn't resist," [...] the oldtimer said. The farmer from Canning took the boat back while Smith drove the horse around the Basin to deliver it. [...] "He was no more'n back home," [...] the old man said, [...] "when he happened to <b>look</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pasture and there was the black horse. Tom couldn't believe his eyes." [...] When he went down to the beach, he saw hoof marks showing where the animal had come ashore. Apparently, the horse had known to wait for low tide before attempting the crossing, but, it [...] "made a mighty long swim just the same." [...] The story ends with Smith returning to Canning to give the money back. [...] "He told the man he couldn't sell a horse that wanted to be with him that much, and the stranger agreed." ...|$|E
