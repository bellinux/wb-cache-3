6000|$|To {{the left}} of him, in the {{whitewashed}} wall {{of the house that}} formed the back of the verandah, there was a closed door. Black letters were painted on it proclaiming the fact that behind that door there was the office of Lingard & Co. The interior had been furnished by Lingard when he had built the house for his adopted daughter and her husband, and it had been furnished with reckless prodigality. There was an office desk, a revolving chair, bookshelves, a safe: all to humour the weakness of Almayer, who thought all those paraphernalia necessary to successful trading. Lingard had laughed, but had taken immense trouble to get the things. It pleased him to make his protege, his adopted son-in-law, happy. It had been the sensation of Sambir some five years ago. While the things were being landed, the whole settlement literally lived on the river bank in front of the Rajah Laut's house, to look, to wonder, to admire. [...] . What a big meza, with many boxes fitted all over it and under it! What did the white man do with such a table? And look, <b>look,</b> <b>O</b> Brothers! There is a green square box, with a gold plate on it, a box so heavy that those twenty men cannot drag it up the bank. Let us go, brothers, and help pull at the ropes, and perchance we may see what's inside. Treasure, no doubt. Gold is heavy and hard to hold, O Brothers! Let us go and earn a recompense from the fierce Rajah of the Sea who shouts over there, with a red face. See! There is a man carrying a pile of books from the boat! What a number of books. What were they for? [...] . And an old invalided jurumudi, who had travelled over many seas and had heard holy men speak in far-off countries, explained to a small knot of unsophisticated citizens of Sambir that those books were books of magic--of magic that guides the white men's ships over the seas, that gives them their wicked wisdom and their strength; of magic that makes them great, powerful, and irresistible while they live, and--praise be to Allah!--the victims of Satan, the slaves of Jehannum when they die.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{in this study}} is to semiotically think abouthow the concept of decisive moment as defined by Henri Cartier-Bresson constructs an anarchical aesthetic which can be perceived in a photographic workmanship. The bases for the anarchical aesthetic are drawn from the concepts in Charles Sanders Peirce’s aesthetic semiotics. The principles also include the inferences through contiguity and resemblance as the two axles that form poetics. The results show that in its simplicity, the extraordinary statement made by the photographer will lead to clean breaking with the photographic <b>look.</b> <b>O</b> objetivo deste estudo é pensar de um modo semiótico como o conceito de instante decisivo definido por Henri Cartier- Bresson constrói uma estética que pode ser percebida numa obra fotográfica.

A fundamentação também situa as inferências por similaridade e contigüidade como os dois eixos que formam a poética.

December 27, 1942 Dear Friends: This is my {{thank you}} note for that swell present of two boxes of chocolates that I {{received}} from the Bryant Service Club a few days ago. I really do mean “thank you,” too, as it certainly is nice to be remembered when away from Providence.

All in all, however the Army isn’t so bad and things <b>look</b> <b>O.</b> K. for the future. Sorry that a graduate of BRYANT is still a private after almost a year on duty but it wasn’t the fault of my teachers. I just had a little tough luck and spent four months in the hospital here. Have been back on the job for a couple of months, however, and should move along now. Expect to be shipped South soon. That’s all for now and thank you all for the candy. The boys and I went through it in no time. Sincerely,Pvt. Harold M. CrowleyClass of [torn from letter][Transcription ends...|$|E
