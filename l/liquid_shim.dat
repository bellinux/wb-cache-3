40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a microwave interferometer technique which measures the thickness of <b>liquid</b> <b>shim</b> material applied to composite surfaces. <b>Liquid</b> <b>shim,</b> which is a low dielectric material, is applied to spar cap surfaces in order to maintain wing skin mold-line tolerances while reducing stresses at the location of fastener holes. For this application, the thickness of the shim material must be controlled within specified limits. Microwave reflection techniques provide an alternative nondestructive approach to <b>liquid</b> <b>shim</b> thickness measurements...|$|E

These intakes {{are attached to the}} power plant frame by a dissimilar material bonded joint, where <b>liquid</b> <b>shim</b> adhesive is used to avoid the dielectric formation between dissimilar materials. In previous works, the authors reported that the A 320 intakes corrosion {{is a result of the}} adhesive inability to avoid the dielectric formation, which is a result of micro-cracks formation within the adhesive layer. The main reason that lead to these cracks is the adhesive aging and thermal cycling at very low temperatures, which quite often reach values lower than - 50 ºC. This paper studies the effect of negative thermal loading on dissimilar materials bonded joints. Two epoxy adhesives are studied and compared, namely the Hysol EA- 934, which is the adhesive currently used in the A 320 Airbus intakes, and the Hysol EA- 9394, a second generation adhesive candidate to replace the actual adhesive. A numerical study was performed in order to simulate the adhesive joint using a finite element analysis commercial package, where several hypotheses were explored. These hypotheses where focused on the effects of several factors on the adhesive layer stress distribution. Factors such as temperature range, boundary conditions, variation of the coefficient of thermal expansion with temperature, and interfacial cracks between the adhesive layer and dissimilar adherend materials were analyzed. Results show that very low temperatures have a negative impact on the adhesives strength and micro-cracks formation may result from thermal loads below zero degrees Celsius, even for adhesives without any aging. Moreover, low temperatures in dissimilar materials bonded joints may create stress states that surpass the adhesive lap shear strength. Some conclusions are drawn regarding adhesive selection for dissimilar materials bonded joints in order to overcome these issues.

40|$|The F- 35 Joint Strike Fighter, {{produced}} by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, requires precision {{control of the}} designed-in shim gap between the forward fuselage understructure and the mating skin. The current manual shimming method results in excessive time and material waste which {{makes it impossible to}} support a peak production rate of one aircraft a day. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a concept for an efficient, automated <b>liquid</b> <b>shimming</b> system and to verify the feasibility of specific components of the system. A team was assembled to gather requirements for a production-ready shimming system, develop a shim cell concept, and complete a cost benefit analysis to justify the need for an automated system. Gage repeatability/reproducibility and accuracy tests were completed to verify that a non-contact metrology system could meet requirements for structure location and surface profile verification. Tests were performed to identify various material options and release agents for an outer mold line (OML) control tool, and a sub-scale OML control test tool was designed and fabricated. The results of this study provided Lockheed Martin Aeronautics the necessary foundation to verify system feasibility and validate system components in order to begin specification development for the procurement of an automated shim cell for F- 35 forward fuselage outer mold line control. © 2011 Lockheed Martin Corporation...|$|R
30|$|Many {{methods have}} been {{introduced}} to enhance the ability of dispersing of nanotubes in solvents, for example, polymer and DNA wrapping, sidewall functionalization, modification through π–π stacking with aromatic molecules and addition of surfactant [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. These methods usually cannot disperse a very large amount of CNTs, thus, a much simpler and more convenient method is needed {{to be capable of}} dispersing the CNTs at higher concentrations for large scale applications. Many efforts have been made to search the convenient solvents for CNT low solubility. One of the best groups of solvent for dispersing of CNTs is the group of room temperature ILs which can disperse the CNTs well without disarranging the structures by the formation of bulky gels. Very recently Aida et al. [19] demonstrated that discotic ionic liquid crystals of triphenylene derivatives [20, 21] bearing six imidazolium ion pendants [22] are the best liquid crystalline dispersants for pristine CNTs. They showed that the orientation of CNTs is a dominant factor for charge-carrier transport properties of the ionic <b>liquid</b> crystalline/CNT composite. <b>Shim</b> et al. [23] investigated the solvated single- and double-walled CNTs in the ILs. They indicated that cations and anions show smeared-out, cylindrical shell-like distributions outside of the nanotubes regardless of the nanotube diameter. Some attempts have been done for determining the dispersion mechanism of CNTs in ILs. The simulation evidence and experimental results have indicated that the ILs interact with CNTs by weak interaction of van der Waals other than the previous supposed cation −π interaction [24].|$|R
