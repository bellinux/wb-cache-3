40|$|Few recent {{outbreaks}} in Europe and the US involving Campylobacter and Salmonella {{were linked}} to the consumption of chicken livers. Studies investigating Staphylococcus aureus in chicken <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> gizzards are very limited. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence of S. aureus and MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in retail chicken <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> gizzards in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In this study, 156 chicken <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> 39 chicken gizzards samples of two brands were collected. While one of the brands showed very low prevalence of 1 % (1 / 100) for S. aureus in chicken <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> gizzards, the second brand showed prevalence of 37 % (31 / 95). No MRSA was detected since none harbored the mecA or mecC gene. Eighty seven S. aureus isolates from <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> 28 from gizzards were screened for antimicrobial resistance to 16 antimicrobials and the possession of 18 toxin genes. Resistance to most of the antimicrobials screened including cefoxitin and oxacillin was higher in the chicken gizzards isolates. While the prevalence of enterotoxin genes seg and sei was higher in the gizzards isolates, the prevalence of hemolysin genes hla, hlb, and hld was higher in the livers ones. The lucocidin genes lukE-lukD was equally prevalent in chicken <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> gizzards isolates. Using spa typing, a subset of the recovered isolates showed that they are not known to be livestock associated and, hence, may be of a human origin. In conclusion, this study stresses the importance of thorough cooking of chicken <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> gizzards since it might contain multidrug resistant enterotoxigenic S. aureus. To our knowledge this is the first study to specifically investigate the prevalence of S. aureus in chicken <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> gizzards in the US...|$|R

5|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein.

Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the <b>liver,</b> <b>and</b> fatty degeneration of the <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours.
