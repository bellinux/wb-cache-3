5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and <b>looked</b> <b>even</b> more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E
25|$|Derbyshire were {{unchanged}} {{from their}} first Championship match, and the first day at the Parks left them at 225 for 8 at close. After recent rain in Oxford, and with a swinging ball in hand, the Oxford UCCE bowlers were commendably accurate.

25|$|For a {{while it}} looked close between Räikkönen and Alonso, but by Brazil Alonso had become Formula One's {{youngest}} ever champion. The Constructors' Championship <b>looked</b> <b>even</b> more likely for McLaren, {{widely regarded as the}} faster car and with reliability much improved. However, a retirement for Juan Pablo Montoya in the season finale at Shanghai secured the Constructors' title for Renault. One statistic proved the two teams' dominance: they together won {{all but one of the}} races, the controversial US Grand Prix, (in which neither of the two teams participated) which was Schumacher and Ferrari's only win of the year.|$|E

25|$|The {{play-off}} was a two-legged tie {{between the}} team finishing 2nd bottom in the Premier Division {{and the team}} finishing 2nd in the First. Murdo McLeod's Partick Thistle {{took the lead in}} the 1st leg at Firhill, but a last-minute Christian Dailly header equalised for United and the scores were level for the 2nd leg at Tannadice four days later. After attacking for most of the match, United went 1–0 down to an Ian Cameron penalty, and things <b>looked</b> <b>even</b> worse as Cameron went down in the box with minutes remaining. But a second penalty wasn't given and United desperately pushed for the all important equaliser.|$|E
25|$|Jason Lewry {{then took}} six Middlesex wickets for 65 runs, {{reducing}} them to 244, although {{if it had}} not been Jamie Dalrymple's (65) and Paul Weekes' (71) partnership of 140 for the sixth wicket, things would have <b>looked</b> <b>even</b> nastier for Middlesex. In reply, Sussex were cautious in their chase of 314, but a big partnership between Richard Montgomerie and Murray Goodwin nearly won it for them. However, New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris took four Sussex wickets for 79, and Alan Richardson took four for 38 - including Goodwin and skipper Adams. Sussex lost four wickets for 17 runs to crash to 280 for 6, but Kirtley and Lewry held out as Sussex finished 28 runs short of a victory and Middlesex finished one wicket short of victory in this bottom-fight.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies {{introduced}} {{three new}} players – Frederick, Holt and McWatt – and recalled Headley and Kentish. In so doing, Headley became the oldest cricketer {{to play for}} West Indies. With consistent batting, West Indies made 417, with five players reaching 50 and Holt top-scoring with 94. After Holt was out, adjudged lbw, the wife and son of the umpire, Perry Burke, were attacked in the crowd, though they were not seriously hurt. England's reply was woeful, Ramadhin and Valentine taking seven wickets {{in a total of}} 170 all out. West Indies captain Stollmeyer was booed by the crowd for not enforcing the follow-on, and he declared at 209 for six wickets, setting England 457 to win. At 277 for two, with Watson making a century, the game <b>looked</b> <b>even.</b> But England lost seven wickets for eight runs and were all out for 316, Kentish taking five wickets for 49 runs. Lock was no-balled for throwing, the first such instance in a Test match since Ernie Jones at Melbourne for Australia against England in 1897–98.|$|E

25|$|Three {{plays into}} the final quarter, New England fumbled another punt return, this one lost by Roland James, and Miami took over on the Patriots 10-yard line. This time, they took {{advantage}} of their scoring opportunity with Marino's 10-yard touchdown pass to Tony Nathan on the next play, cutting their deficit to 24–14. Things <b>looked</b> <b>even</b> more promising for the Dolphins when they forced a punt {{and drove to the}} New England 38-yard line. But then Carter fumbled the ball and defensive end Julius Adams pick it up for the Patriots fourth fumble recovery of the day. New England then put the game away with a 9-play drive, featuring a 14-yard run by Tony Collins and a 13-yard carry by James. Tatupu later finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, putting the score out of reach at 31–14. With 7:34 left in the game, Miami mounted one last spirited drive, moving the ball to the NE 8-yard line. But two penalties pushed them back to the 28, and then a desperate pass from Marino was picked off by Raymond Clayborn in the end zone.|$|E

2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with both {{versions}} of the Wranglers, Phoenix-area fans largely viewed the Outlaws with indifference.

[...] The crowds <b>looked</b> <b>even</b> smaller than that due to the spacious configuration of Sun Devil Stadium. [...] The Outlaws actually drew 4,000 fewer fans than they did in Tulsa, even though Sun Devil Stadium was almost double the size of Skelly Stadium.

2500|$|The [...] "must-win" [...] game at relegation rivals Newcastle's St James' Park {{was likely}} to {{determine}} both sides' chances of avoiding the drop. Tuncay's early shot rebounded off of the Newcastle keeper and then off Habib Beye, who put the ball into his own net for an own goal, giving the visitors the lead after just three minutes. Steven Taylor brought the scores level six minutes later as Boro conceded another poorly defended corner. The game was close, with both sides having several good opportunities, before substitute Obafemi Martins scored for Newcastle straight after coming on. Peter Løvenkrands settled the game as he put in his side's third goal. The 3–1 win was Alan Shearer's first as Newcastle manager and Middlesbrough's eleventh away defeat in a row. With Middlesbrough three points from safety, and a considerable inferior goal difference with just two games to go, relegation <b>looked</b> <b>even</b> more likely.|$|E

2500|$|Although it was {{designed}} {{from the ground up}} to accommodate baseball, it was never a true multipurpose stadium. Rather, it was built as a football stadium that could convert into a baseball stadium. [...] Most of the seats in the baseball configuration were pointed toward center field – where the 50-yard line {{would have been in the}} football configuration. As a result, even with the reduced capacity, the sight lines for baseball left much to be desired. This was particularly evident during the Marlins' World Series appearances in 1997 and 2003. Some portions of left and center field were not part of the football playing field, and fans sitting in the left field upper-deck seats were unable to see these areas except on the replay boards. [...] Even with the reduced capacity, during years the Marlins were not contending, they often drew crowds of 5,000 or fewer—a total that <b>looked</b> <b>even</b> smaller due to the cavernous environment.|$|E
2500|$|The Prinzregentenzeit ("prince's regent's time"), as the regency of Luitpold {{is often}} called, {{was due to}} the {{political}} passiveness of Luitpold an era of the gradual transfer of Bavarian interests behind those of the German empire. In connection with the unhappy end of the preceding rule of King Ludwig II this break in the Bavarian monarchy <b>looked</b> <b>even</b> stronger. Finally, the constitutional amendment of 1913 brought the determining break in the continuity of the king's rule in the opinion of historians, particularly as this change had been granted by the Landtag as a House of Representatives and meant therefore indirectly the first step from constitutional to the parliamentary monarchy. Today the connection of these two developments is regarded as a main cause for the unspectacular end of the Bavarian kingdom without opposition {{in the course of the}} November revolution of 1918. However the course of his 26-year regency Luitpold knew to overcome, by modesty, ability and popularity, the initial uneasiness of his subjects. These prince regent's years were transfigured, finally—above all in the retrospect – to a golden age of Bavaria, even if one mourned the [...] "fairy tale king" [...] Ludwig II furthermore what happens in a folkloric-nostalgic manner till this day.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately for the team, the ESA {{would not}} be {{complete}} for two more years. The only arena in the Triangle area with an ice plant was 45-year-old Dorton Arena; at 5,100 seats, it was completely inadequate even for temporary use. The Hurricanes were thus forced to play home games in Greensboro, 90 minutes west of Raleigh, for their first two seasons after the move. [...] However, the team would be based in Raleigh and practice in nearby Hillsborough—effectively saddling the Hurricanes with 82 road games {{for the next two}} years. [...] This choice was disastrous for the franchise's attendance and reputation. With a capacity of over 21,000 people for hockey, the Greensboro Coliseum was the highest-capacity arena in the NHL. [...] However, Triangle-area fans balked at making the 80-mile drive down I-40 to Greensboro. Likewise, fans from the Piedmont Triad mostly refused to support a lame-duck team that had displaced the popular Greensboro/Carolina Monarchs minor-league franchise. As a result, while the opening game drew a sellout (and is still the largest home crowd in franchise history), most games in Greensboro attracted crowds of 10,000 or fewer. The crowds <b>looked</b> <b>even</b> smaller than that in the cavernous environment. [...] Furthermore, only 29 out of 82 games were televised (over-the-air and cable combined), and radio play-by-play coverage on WPTF was often pre-empted by Wolfpack basketball (for whose broadcasts WPTF was the flagship station), leaving these games totally unavailable to those who did not have a ticket. With by far the smallest season-ticket base in the NHL and attendance figures routinely well below the league average, Sports Illustrated ran a story titled [...] "Natural Disaster," [...] and ESPN anchors mocked the [...] "Green Acres" [...] of empty seats; in a 2006 interview, Karmanos admitted that [...] "as it turns out, [...] was probably a mistake." [...] Under the circumstances, the Hurricanes managed to stay competitive, but still finished last in the Northeast Division with 74 points, nine points out of the playoffs.|$|E
