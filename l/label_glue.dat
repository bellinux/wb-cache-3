40|$|Low-cost passive {{wireless}} electronic sensor <b>labels</b> <b>glued</b> onto {{packages are}} highly desirable since they enable {{monitoring of the}} status of the packages for instance along the logistic chain or while stored at a shelf. Such additional sensing feature would be of great value for many producers and vendors, active in e. g. the food or construction industries. Here, we explore a novel concept for wireless sensing and readout, in which the humidity sensitive ionic motion in a polyelectrolyte membrane is directly translated into a shift of the resonance frequency of a resonance circuit. Thanks to its simplicity, the wireless sensor device itself can be manufactured entirely using common printing techniques and can be integrated into a low-cost passive electronic sensor label.

Verso, Original <b>label</b> <b>glued</b> on the tablet, stating the locality and the taxon name (in this case, in Pfeiffer's handwriting), and notes by subsequent curators. The locality label is probably in the handwriting of Robert Furley Geale, who worked for Cuming as an Assistant for many years (P. Dance, pers. comm.). The characteristic abbreviation "M. C. ", added after the collection had arrived in the NHM in 1866, appears in black ink in the left-hand corner.

5000|$|Subsequent years brought changes: the pickups {{became more}} like Gibson pickups and gained chrome covers, a trapeze {{tailpiece}} became available, the [...] "pitchfork" [...] Epiphone logo {{was added to}} the pickguard—and, in 1972, the model designation changed to EA-250. In the same period Matsumoku also made a companion short-scale bass, the 5120 / EA-260. In 1975 or '76 the guitar was replaced by the ET-255.In addition to the change from the original black plastic dual-coil Humbucker pick-ups, this guitar was altered into the EA-250 Riviera, and re-introduced with single coil pick-ups covered with the standard two coil Humbucker pick-up covers. This was a unique element on this guitar model. To identify the style, {{you can look at the}} paper <b>label</b> <b>glued</b> inside the body of the guitar under the top f-hole. It should read EA-250 Riviera Epiphone Kalamazoo, Michigan Made in Japan. The paper is light blue in color on an authentic model, and the serial number is on the back metal neck plate. It is not possible to determine the exact year of these guitars, but it is generally accepted that the Matsumoku factory built these guitars between 1970 and 1975.|$|R

Casein glue is mainly used to adhere glass bottle <b>labels.</b> Animal <b>glues</b> have traditionally been used in bookbinding, wood joining, and many other areas but now are largely replaced by synthetic glues except in specialist applications like the production and repair of stringed instruments.

40|$|BIt was {{considered}} in the article the research of physical and mechanical properties of materials based on PVC film ORACAL and RITRAMA that used {{in the production of}} volume labels. In particular, it was shown the changes of dependences between linear deformation of printed and unprinted films and the value of stress with regard to their minimum and maximum values. It was also established that deformation properties of the films are different in the transverse and longitudinal directions, which should be considered when producing labels. It was conducted the modeling of stress-strain state of volume <b>label</b> when <b>gluing</b> it to the surfaces of various shapes. We considered the boundary conditions for displacement and stress of labels layer components with regard to the chemical structure of epoxy resins and their physical and mechanical characteristics...|$|R

The amount and viscosity of the mucilage are important nattō characteristics, contributing to nattō's unique taste and smell.|$|R
