The huge design and fabrication obstacles solved by the innovative solutions devised during the {{three years of the}} OPTHER project added new knowledge over the state-of the-art 1. The backward wave regime was chosen to allow a moderate beam voltage (10 kV) with dimensions compatible with the <b>LIGA</b> fabrication <b>process.</b> The cascade backward wave amplifier consists of the cascade of two backward wave amplifiers. The first one is fed by the input RF signal and is devoted to establish a sufficient beam current modulation. The second one provides the amplified signal at the output port by interacting with the modulated electron beam flowing from the previous BWA section. A drift tube RF isolates the two BWA sections. The length of the drift tube is critical for the whole amplifier performance and has to be minimized. The double corrugated waveguide was adopted as slow wave structure to support a cylindrical electron beam, generated by a miniaturized Pierce electron gun.

40|$|Megasonic {{agitation}} is used {{to improve}} the uniformity of the LIGA{sup 1 } development process. To investigate the acoustic wave fields induced by megasonic agitation, we compute wave fields for a development tank containing a submerged wafer and for a typical trench-like feature on the wafer face. This separate treatment of these two problems is advantageous, because the length scales of the tank and the feature differ by three to four orders of magnitude. A spectral method based on Green's functions {{is used to}} construct the acoustic wave field, avoiding the alternative of solving partial differential equations over the entire domain. The total acoustic wave field is obtained by superposing of the primary wave field and the first reflected wave field, which are computed in sequence without any need for iterations. The wafer interference to the wave field is treated directly by a priori recognition of shadow regions in the primary field and a concept of boundary of dependence in the reflected field. Unlike a divergent wave field produced by ultrasonic agitation, {{results show that the}} wave field in the tank becomes narrowly focused at megasonic frequencies such that the most effective agitation is confined in a region directly above the acoustic source; this numerical expectation has been verified analytically and further confirmed experimentally by Sandia's LIGA Group. {sup [13]} The amplitude of the focused wave pressure is proportional to square root of the wave frequency.

MEMS processes leverage mainstream IC technologies to achieve on chip sensor interface and signal processing circuitry, multi-vendor accessibility, short design cycles, more on-chip functions and low cost. MEMS fabrications {{are based on}} thin-film surface microstructures, bulk micromaching, and <b>LIGA</b> <b>processes.</b> This thesis centered on developing optical micromaching inertial sensors based on MEMS fabrication technology which incorporates bulk Si into microstructures. Micromachined inertial sensors, consisting of the accelerometers and gyroscopes, {{are one of the}} most important types of silicon-based sensors. Microaccelerometers alone have the second largest sales volume after pressure sensors, and it is believed that gyroscopes will soon be mass produced at the similar volumes occupied by traditional gyroscopes. A traditional gyroscope is a device for measuring or maintaining orientation, based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The essence of the gyroscope machine is a spinning wheel on an axle. The device, once spinning, tends to resist changes to its orientation due to the angular momentum of the wheel. In physics this phenomenon is also known as gyroscopic inertia or rigidity in space. The {{applications are}} limited by the huge volume. MEMS Gyroscopes, which are using the MEMS fabrication technology to minimize the size of gyroscope systems, are of great importance in commercial, medical, automotive and military fields. They can be used in cars for ASS systems, for anti-roll devices and for navigation in tall buildings areas where the GPS system might fail. They can also be used for the navigation of robots in tunnels or pipings, for leading capsules containing medicines or diagnostic equipment in the human body, or as 3 -D computer mice. The MEMS gyroscope chips are limited by high precision measurement because of the unprecision electrical readout system. The market is in need for highly accurate, high-G-sustainable inertial measuring units (IMU's). The approach optical sensors have been around for a while now and because of the performance, the mall volume, the simplicity has been popular. However the production cost of optical applications is not satisfaction with consumer. Therefore, the MEMS fabrication technology makes the possibility for the low cost and micro optical devices like light sources, the waveguide, the high thin fiber optical, the micro photodetector, and vary demodulation measurement methods. Optic sensors may be defined as a means through which a measurand interacts with light guided in an optical fiber (an intrinsic sensor) or guided to (and returned from) an interaction region (an extrinsic sensor) by an optical fiber to produce an optical signal related to the parameter of interest. During its over 30 years of history, fiber optic sensor technology has been successfully applied by laboratories and industries worldwide in the detection of a large number of mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic, radiation, chemical, motion, flow and turbulence of fluids, and biomedical parameters. The fiber optic sensors provided advantages over conventional electronic sensors, of survivability in harsh environments, immunity to Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI), light weight, small size, compatibility with optical fiber communication systems, high sensitivity for many measurands, and good potential of multiplexing. In general, the transducers used in these fiber optic sensor systems are either an intensity-modulator or a phase-modulator. The optical interferometers, such as Mach-Zehnder, Michelson, Sagnac and Fabry-Perot interferometers, have become widely accepted as a phase modulator in optical sensors for the ultimate sensitivity to a range of weak signals. According to the light source being used, the interferometric sensors can be simply classified as either a coherence interferometric sensor if a the interferometer is interrogated by a coherent light source, such as a laser or a monochromatic light, or a lowcoherence interferometric sensor when a broadband source a light emitting diode (LED) or a superluminescent diode (SLD), is used. This thesis proposed a novel micro electro-mechanical gyroscope system with optical interferometer readout system and fabricated by MEMS technology, which is an original contribution in design and research on micro opto-electro-mechanical gyroscope systems (MOEMS) to provide the better performances than the current MEMS gyroscope. Fiber optical interferometric sensors have been proved more sensitive, precision than other electrical counterparts at the measurement micro distance. The MOMES gyroscope system design is based on the existing successful MEMS vibratory gyroscope and micro fiber optical interferometer distances sensor, which avoid large size, heavy weight and complex fabrication processes comparing with fiber optical gyroscope using Sagnac effect. The research starts from the fiber optical gyroscope based on Sagnac effect and existing MEMS gyroscopes, then moving to the novel design about MOEMS gyroscope system to discuss the operation principles and the structures. In this thesis, the operation principles, mathematics models and performances simulation of the MOEMS gyroscope are introduced, and the suitable MEMS fabrication processes will be discussed and presented. The first prototype model will be sent and fabricated by the manufacture for the further real time performance testing. There are a lot of inventions, further research and optimize around this novel MOEMS gyroscope chip. In future studying, the research will be putted on integration three axis Gyroscopes in one micro structure by optical sensor multiplexing principles, and the new optical devices like more powerful light source, photosensitive materials etc., and new demodulation processes, which can improve the performance and the interface to co-operate with other inertial sensors and navigation system...|$|R
40|$|There are a {{significant}} number of microwave applications, including active antenna arrays, wireless communication systems, navigational applications, etc., where improvement of such qualities as manufacturing costs, size, weight, power consumption, etc. is still on the agenda of today’s RF design. In order to meet these requirements, new technologies must be actively involved in fabrication of RF components with improved characteristics. One of such fabrication technologies is called LIGA, used before primarily in fluidics, photonics, bioengineering, and micromechanics, and only recently receiving growing attention in RF component fabrication. One of the RF components suffering limitations in performance due to limitations in fabrication capabilities is the compact single metal layer (SML) coupled-line 3 -dB coupler, also called “hybrid”, required in some applications thanks to its ability to divide power equally and electrically isolate the output from the input. In today’s practical edge-coupled SML coupler designs, the level of coupling is limited by the capabilities of the photolithographic process to print the coupled lines close enough for tight coupling and it is usually no tighter that 8 dB. A promising way to overcome this limitation is increasing the area of metallic interface of the coupled lines, thus increasing the mutual capacitance of the lines, and inherently the coupling between them. This should be preferably done with keeping the coupler compact with respect to the footprint area, which is attained by making taller conductors, i. e. employing the third dimension. In contrast with previously used RF component fabrication <b>processes,</b> <b>LIGA</b> is the technology that allows the designer to explore the third dimension and build tall conductors while being also able to use small features. When the two-dimensional edge-coupled SML couplers are extended into the three-dimensional structures, they rather become the side-coupled SML couplers. Tall-conductor coupled lines have been characterized in this work to reveal their dependence on their geometry and a 3 -dB SML coupler with tall conductors has been developed and fabricated using LIGA at the Institute for Microstructure Technology (IMT), Karlsruhe, Germany. The simulation and measurement results demonstrate the potentially superior performance of LIGA couplers, and the promising capabilities of LIGA for fabrication of RF microstructures...|$|R
40|$|Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) {{devices have}} been {{increasing}} in popularity for radio frequency (RF) and microwave communication systems {{due to the}} ability of MEMS devices to improve the performance of these circuits and systems. This interdisciplinary field combines the aspects of lithographic fabrication, mechanics, materials science, and RF/microwave circuit technology to produce moving structures with feature dimensions on the micron scale (micro-structures). MEMS technology has been used to improve switches, varactors, and inductors to name a few specific examples. Most MEMS devices have been fabricated using planar micro fabrication techniques that are similar to current integrated circuit (IC) fabrication techniques. These techniques limit the thickness of individual layers to a few microns, and restrict the structures to have planar and not vertical features. One micro fabrication technology that has not seen much application to microwave MEMS devices is LIGA, a German acronym for X-ray lithography, electroforming, and moulding. LIGA uses X-ray lithography to produce very tall structures (hundreds of microns) with excellent structural quality, and with lateral feature sizes smaller than a micron. These unique properties have led to an increased interest in LIGA for the development of high performance microwave devices, particularly as operating frequencies increase and physical device size decreases. Existing work using LIGA for microwave devices has concentrated on statically operating structures such as transmission lines, filters, couplers, and antennas. This research uses these unique fabrication capabilities to develop dynamically operating microwave devices with high frequency performance. This thesis documents the design, fabrication and testing of LIGA-MEMS variable capacitors that exploit the vertical dimension. Also included are methods to improve both the reliable fabrication and operation of these devices as well as material property characterization. Variable capacitors can be found in systems such as voltage-controlled oscillators, filters, impedance matching networks and phase shifters. Important figures-of-merit for these devices include the quality factor (Q), tuning range and tuning voltage. Two different types of variable capacitors are presented, a pull-away design and a design based on the principle of leveraged bending. The pull-away style variable capacitors were found to have high Q-factors, especially the devices fabricated using a thick gold device layer. As an example, the small gold half capacitance electrode design features a Q-factor of 95 at an operating frequency of 5. 6 GHz and a tuning ratio of 1. 36 : 1 with a tuning voltage range of 0 to 7. 8 V. The design based on leveraged bending significantly improves the tuning ratio to a value of 1. 9 : 1 while still maintaining a high Q-factor similar to those found in the pull-away style designs. A further increase in tuning ratio to a value of approximately 2. 7 : 1 would be possible, based on simulated results, by simply changing the angle of the capacitance electrode in the layout. To improve device performance and fabrication reliability, modifications were made to both the fabrication process and the device layout. In the fabrication process the exposure step, electroplating step, and the etching process were modified {{to improve the quality of}} the resulting devices. In the layout, anti-stiction measures were introduced that reduce the contact area during collapse. To improve device characterization as well as the feedback link between simulation and fabrication, a set of test structures called VM-TEST was developed to accurately determine the important mechanical material properties of thick electroplated layers. These structures utilize the measurement of the pull-in voltage in cantilever and fixed-fixed beams, along with measured structure dimensions, to accurately extract the mechanical properties. Both nickel and gold test structures were analyzed with extracted Young’s modulus values of 186. 2 and 60. 8 GPa respectively. Also presented is a study of the gap shape in cantilever and fixed-fixed beams that significantly reduces the pull-in voltage while still maintaining a required maximum actuator displacement. It was shown that in the case of cantilever beam actuators, an approximately 40 % reduction in pull-in voltage is possible, and in the case of fixed-fixed beam actuators, an approximately 30 % reduction is possible by simply varying the shape of the gap between the beam and actuator electrode. These results can be used to significantly reduce the pull-in voltage of future designs. These promising results show that the <b>LIGA</b> fabrication <b>process</b> is capable of producing high performance dynamically operating RF MEMS devices, by exploiting the vertical dimension, not typically performed in most existing RF MEMS designs...|$|R
