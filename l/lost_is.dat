Several days before shooting, Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.

With the revelation of Sun as one of the Oceanic Six, all six members have been revealed. Executive producers and writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof left the identity of the sixth deliberately ambiguous to provoke debate after the episode.|$|E

Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where <b>Lost</b> <b>is</b> filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E
