40|$|The {{neuronal}} protein calexcitin {{from the}} <b>long-finned</b> <b>squid</b> <b>Loligo</b> pealei has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Calexcitin is a 22 kDa calcium-binding protein that becomes up-regulated in invertebrates following Pavlovian conditioning {{and is likely}} to be involved in signal transduction events associated with learning and memory. Recombinant squid calexcitin has been crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique in the orthorhombic space group P 212121. The unit-cell parameters of a = 46. 6, b = 69. 2, c = 134. 8 Å suggest that the crystals contain two monomers per asymmetric unit and have a solvent content of 49 %. This crystal form diffracts X-rays to at least 1. 8 Å resolution and yields data of high quality using synchrotron radiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{domestic}} butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) fishery off the Northeast USA {{has increased}} in importance in recent years, {{to the extent that}} the quantity allocated to foreign countries fishing within USA waters has been decreased to by-catch levels. This restriction resulted in closure of a portion of the foreign squid fishery in 1985, when the by-catch quota for butterfish was exceeded. This analysis is designed to determine co-occurrence between <b>long-finned</b> <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> pea/ei) and butterfish particularly in directed fisheries for each species with a view that areal, diel, and/or seasonal regulations of these fisheries may be feasible to reduce the potential adverse effects of high by-catch rates. Squid and butterfish exhibited high degrees of overlap in temperature and depth preferences as indicated by seasonal and spatial distribution data from research and fishery sources. Commer-cial fishery data, however, suggested that by-catch of butterfish in the directed squid fishery can be maintained at relatively low levels (~ 6 %), when the fishery was prosecuted offshore during the winter. The domestic USA fishery, operating with effort directed at either species at various times of the year, has not been limited as to by-catch of either species. If a need develops, it is likely that seasonal and areal management measures could result in significant reductions in the by-catch of either species...|$|E

The {{early development}} of the Patagonian <b>squid,</b> <b>Loligo</b> gahi D'Orbigny, 1835, was studied {{in the field and}} in the laboratory. Egg strands, spawned off San Lorenzo Island, Peru, were collected, carried to the laboratory, and incubated in a closed sea water system. Egg capsules ranged from 88 to 169 mm in length, and each capsule contained between 56 and 114 fertilized eggs. Individual eggs ranged from 1, 7 to 2, 1 mm in length, and the mantle length of hatchlings varied from 1, 9 to 2, 8 mm. Development took about 20 days at a mean temperature of 19 ºC. The pattern of embryonic development is similar to that previously observed in other species of Loligo.
