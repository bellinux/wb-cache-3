Saban had periods of {{success as a}} player and as a coach at the college and professional levels, but his constant moves from job to job eventually came to define him. [...] "I have been known as a peripatetic coach", he said in 1994. [...] "The first time I was called that, I thought it was a dirty word. I <b>looked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in the dictionary and found it meant I moved around a lot." [...] Saban was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 and, in a surprise move, was added to the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame in 2015.

2500|$|Harlan Ellison long {{maintained}} that the ancient ruins {{were the result of}} someone's misreading his description in the script of the city as [...] "covered with runes." [...] When informed that the word [...] "runes" [...] did not appear in any version of his treatments or script, Ellison responded in Edge Words, the letter column of IDW's comic book adaptation of his original script, by admitting that his memory was faulty, and that he actually told Matt Jefferies that the set should appear [...] "Ancient, incredibly ancient, with runes everywhere..." [...] He surmises that he perhaps slurred the word [...] "runes" [...] and Jefferies misheard him. Fontana later explained that Jefferies was not working that week due to an illness, and so Rolland Brooks, the chair of the Art Department, took over set design duties. He had been drinking while reading the script and failed to understand what [...] "rune stones" [...] were. He <b>looked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in a dictionary, and drunkenly reached [...] "ruin" [...] first, which resulted in a set filled with broken columns. Brooks had also been responsible for the creation of the Guardian of Forever, to which Jefferies exclaimed [...] "What the hell is this?" [...] when he returned to work, too late to change it.|$|E

60|$|I couldn't help it. I tell it as a {{vindication of}} Roscoe {{and all the}} other navigators. The poison of power was working in me. I was not as other men--most other men; I knew what they did not know,-- the mystery of the heavens, that pointed out the way across the deep. And the taste of power I had {{received}} drove me on. I steered at the wheel long hours with one hand, and studied mystery with the other. By the end of the week, teaching myself, I was able to do divers things. For instance, I shot the North Star, at night, of course; got its altitude, corrected for index error, dip, etc., and found our latitude. And this latitude agreed with the latitude of the previous noon corrected by dead reckoning up to that moment. Proud? Well, I was even prouder with my next miracle. I was going to turn in at nine o'clock. I worked out the problem, self- instructed, and learned what star of the first magnitude would be passing the meridian around half-past eight. This star proved to be Alpha Crucis. I had never heard of the star before. I <b>looked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> on the star map. It was {{one of the stars of}} the Southern Cross. What! thought I; have we been sailing with the Southern Cross in the sky of nights and never known it? Dolts that we are! Gudgeons and moles! I couldn't believe it. I went over the problem again, and verified it. Charmian had the wheel from eight till ten that evening. I told her to keep her eyes open and look due south for the Southern Cross. And when the stars came out, there shone the Southern Cross low on the horizon. Proud? No medicine man nor high priest was ever prouder. Furthermore, with the prayer-wheel I shot Alpha Crucis and from its altitude worked out our latitude. And still furthermore, I shot the North Star, too, and it agreed with what had been told me by the Southern Cross. Proud? Why, the language of the stars was mine, and I listened and heard them telling me my way over the deep.|$|E

'My dear fellow,' said he, 'you did me the turn of my life.--How can I ever repay you?' 'Hang your impudence,' said I, but I wanted to hear what he had to say. 'Don't lose your temper, old chap,' he laughed; 'you took a few liberties with my name, and there was no good reason why I shouldn't take some with yours. Was there? When I think of it, the thing was most decidedly convenient; it was the hand of Providence.' 'You took liberties with my name,' I cried. With that he coolly called to the waiter to fill our glasses. 'Now,' said he, 'I've got a story for you. Do you remember the cotillon, or whatever it was, that Cooke gave? Well, that was all in the Chicago papers, and the [...] "Miles Standish" [...] agent there saw it, and he knew pretty well that I wasn't West. So he sent me the papers, just for fun. You may imagine my surprise when I read that I had been leading a dance out at Mohair, or some such barbarous place in the northwest. I <b>looked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> on the map (Asquith, I mean), and then I began to think. I wondered who in the devil it might be who had taken my name and occupation, and all that. You see, I had just relieved the company of a little money, and it hit me like a clap of thunder one day that the idiot was you. But I couldn't be sure. And as long as I had to get out very soon anyway, I concluded to go to Mohair and make certain, and then pile things off on you if you happened to be the man.'" ...|$|E
