40|$|Abstract-Buckling of arches is studied using a corotational {{finite element}} model in {{conjunction}} with a modified Riks-Wempner technique. The corotational formulation allows for separation of rigid body displacements from deformation displacements of the element. The program can equally be applied to rigid or prestressed arches, as it takes into account the sequential fabrication of stressed (i. e. prebuckled) arches. Loo:ping paths tracing nonlinear response of arches have been successfully obtained for several cases, including rigid and prestressed elastica arches with both symmetric and asymmetric modes of buckling. Comparisons are made with the results for prestressed arches using shooting <b>method,</b> <b>and</b> with <b>the</b> benchmark results for various rigid arches using discrete <b>lement</b> <b>method.</b> When compared to a discrete element technique, the present method appears to be more cost-effective, as a finite element mesh with 60 % fewer elements can result in virtually the same degree of accuracy.

30|$|In {{this work}} two {{relatively}} new methods, the spectral homotopy analysis <b>method</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> successive linearisation <b>method,</b> {{have been successfully}} used to solve the von Kármán nonlinear equations for swirling flow with and without suction/injection across <b>the</b> disk walls <b>and</b> an applied magnetic field. The velocity components were compared with numerical results generated using the built-in Matlab bvp 4 c solver <b>and</b> against <b>the</b> homotopy analysis <b>method</b> <b>and</b> homotopy-Padé results in the literature. The results indicate that both the spectral homotopy analysis <b>method</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> successive linearisation <b>method</b> may give accurate and convergent results using only few solution terms compared with <b>the</b> homotopy analysis <b>method</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Homotopy-Padé <b>methods.</b> Comparison has also been made with the recent findings by Turkyilmazoglu [13]. The successive linearisation method gives better accuracy at lower orders than the spectral homotopy analysis method. The tradeoff, however, is that both the spectral homotopy analysis <b>method</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> successive linearisation <b>method</b> may involve more computations per step compared to the methods in the literature.|$|R
