Wood chips and bark pellets were used as tracer particles. Characterization of the fuel mixing pattern was made by single tracer particle tracking while tracking of batches of tracer particles was applied to quantify the fuel <b>mixing</b> through <b>lateral</b> dispersion coefficients. The experimental technique shows good repeatability and dispersion coefficients {{are found to be}} in the order of 10 (- 3) m(2) /s. The lateral transport of the wood chips is observed to occur mainly while these are submerged in the dense bed. Increased fluidization velocity accentuates this pattern, i. e. the share of time spent in the dense bed increases. Only for the wood chips the fluidization velocity was found to have an influence on the lateral dispersion coefficient, which is due to that these are of larger size and lower density than the bark particles. Diffusion-type modeling of the horizontal fuel dispersion is discussed, concluding that such an approach is not suitable in cases with low <b>lateral</b> fuel <b>mixing</b> rate or with a characteristic mixing length in the same order as the lateral length scale of the bed.

Differences in knee pain severity were compared among categories of PFJ full-thickness cartilage loss and BMLs using quantile regression. ResultsIn MOST (n =  1137 knees), compared with knees without full-thickness cartilage loss, knees with isolated <b>lateral</b> or <b>mixed</b> PFJ full-thickness cartilage loss had 1. 9 (1. 3, 2. 8) and 1. 9 (1. 2, 2. 9) times the odds of knee pain, respectively, while isolated medial cartilage loss had no association with knee pain. BMLs in both the medial and lateral PFJ had 1. 5 (1. 1, 2. 0) times the odds of knee pain compared with knees without BMLs. Knee pain severity was lowest in knees with isolated medial PFJ cartilage loss or BMLs. In FOA (n =  934 knees), neither isolated medial nor lateral cartilage loss was associated with knee pain, whereas isolated BMLs in either region were associated with pain.

A swarm experiment with seven gliders equiped with biophysical sensors measuring pressure, temperature, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence and turbidity was conducted in early 2013 in the upwelling region off Peru. The goal of the experiment was to sample a relatively small spatial area as synoptically as possible, {{in order to allow}} seperation between temporal and spatial variability. In particular, the role of submesoscale processes for the near coastal vertical oxygen distribution was assessed. Each glider carried out about one dive per hour measuring two multi-parameter profiles with a lateral resolution of about 500 m. Alltogether more than 15. 000 profiles were recorded during the two-months deployment. The glider data shows small scale filamentary structures of different tracers such as salinity and oxygen at different depths. There are density compensated salinity filaments at about 150 m depth were lateral mesoscale eddy stirring of the lateral background salinity gradient is suggested as the main formation mechasim. Closer to the surface, however, non-density compensated salinity and oxygen intrusions reaching well below the mixed layer can be seen. These structures are found at strong <b>lateral</b> <b>mixed</b> layer density fronts, suggesting that submesoscale frontal processes are responsible for the observed structures.

40|$|This study investigates <b>lateral</b> <b>mixing</b> of tracer fluids in {{turbulent}} open-channel flows {{when the}} tracer and ambient fluids have different densities. Longitudinal dispersion in flows with longitudinal density gradients is investigated also. <b>Lateral</b> <b>mixing</b> was studied {{in a laboratory}} flume by introducing fluid tracers at the ambient flow velocity continuously and uniformly across {{a fraction of the}} flume width and over the entire depth of the ambient flow. Fluid samples were taken to obtain concentration distributions in cross-sections at various distances, x, downstream from the tracer source. The data were used to calculate variances of the lateral distributions of the depth-averaged concentration. When there was a difference in density between the tracer and the ambient fluids, <b>lateral</b> <b>mixing</b> close to the source was enhanced by density-induced secondary flows; however, far downstream where the density gradients were small, <b>lateral</b> <b>mixing</b> rates were independent of the initial density difference.

A simplified set of equations of motion for a fluid with a horizontal density gradient was integrated to give an expression for the density-induced velocity distribution. The dispersion coefficient due to this velocity distribution was also obtained.

40|$|Numerical {{experiments}} are performed using an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) {{to assess the}} impact of the form of <b>lateral</b> <b>mixing</b> of momentum and tracers on the state of an equatorial ocean. It is found that the large-scale structure of both the velocity and temperature fields are very sensitive to the imposed parameterization of <b>lateral</b> <b>mixing</b> in the model. With uniform values for the viscosity and diffusion coefficient across the domain, a decrease in these coefficients increases the activity of tropical instability waves (TIW), resulting in an increase in the sea surface temperature of the cold tongue, and thus overcoming the cold bias often found in ocean models of the equatorial Pacific. However, there is an associated increase in the strength of the Equatorial Under-Current (EUC) to unrealistic levels. It is found that the strength of the EUC can be limited, while little affecting the TIW activity, by applying an enhanced level of mixing in the vicinity of the equator. This enhanced mixing is used to model the effect of the observed interleaving of water masses across the equator. Both the level and distribution of eddy kinetic energy (associated with TIWs) varies with the level and orientation of the <b>lateral</b> <b>mixing.</b> An examination of the main energy conversion terms of mean to eddy energy reveals that both the barotropic and baroclinic energy conversion terms are important for the production of TIWs.

The cascade process of eddy breakdown is incorporated into the statistical model through an average over an assumed log-normal distribution of vortex radii. We calculate the statistical properties of the model, in particular order-n velocity structure functions defined by rank-n tensors for the ensemble average of a set of incremental differences in velocity components. We define Di[centered ellipsis]s =, where denotes the ensemble average. Specifically Dij, Dijkl, and the longitudinal component of Dijklmn are calculated directly from the spherical vortex ensemble. Matching the longitudinal components of Dij and Dijkl with experimental results fixes two independent model parameters. The <b>lateral</b> and <b>mixed</b> components of Dijkl and the longitudinal component of Dijklmn are then model predictions...|$|R
40|$|A {{correlation}} between orbital chemistry (FeO, Al 2 O 3, Mg/Al, MgO/FeO, Th) and the lunar crustal thickness is examined. The correlation suggests either lack of complete homogenization by <b>lateral</b> or vertical <b>mixing,</b> or <b>lateral</b> {{variation in the}} differentiation process. In addition, links between orbital chemistry and lunar sample chemistry are investigated. In regions with crustal thickness between 100 and 110 km, gabbroic anorthosites are very abundant, while in regions with crustal thickness of about 80 km anorthositic gabbros are frequent. Special attention {{is given to the}} distribution of low-potassium Fra Mauro basalt, found in high concentrations in regions with 50 to 60 km crustal thickness...|$|R
50|$|Adaptive (non-constant) {{mixing length}} schemes {{are widely used}} for {{parameterization}} of both <b>lateral</b> and vertical <b>mixing.</b> In the horizontal, parameterizations dependent on the rates of stress and strain (Smagroinsky), grid spacing and Reynolds number (Re) have been advocated. In the vertical, vertical mixing as a function stability frequency (N^2) and/or Richardson number are historically prevalent. The rotated mixing tensors scheme is the one considering {{the angle of the}} principle direction of mixing, as for in the main thermocline, mixing along isopycnals dominates diapycnal mixing. There for the principle direction of mixing is neither strictly vertical nor purely horizontal, but a spatially variable mixture of the two.|$|R
