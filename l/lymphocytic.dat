5|$|Doxorubicin, {{sold under}} the trade names Adriamycin among others, is a {{chemotherapy}} medication {{used to treat}} cancer. This includes breast cancer, bladder cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia. It is often used together with other chemotherapy agents. Doxorubicin is given by injection into a vein.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{interstitial}} pneumonia or noninfectious pneumonia is a {{class of}} diffuse lung diseases. They include diffuse alveolar damage, organizing pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, <b>lymphocytic</b> interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease, and usual interstitial pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Beverly died on October 11, 2011. Agnew was {{diagnosed}} of chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia, and died {{at his home}} in Solana Beach, California, on September 29, 2013, while watching football on television. He was survived by his daughter Nancy and son John. He had arranged to be cremated and his ashes interred with Beverly's at the Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.|$|E
5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: <b>lymphocytic</b> thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. <b>Lymphocytic</b> thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 2003, after {{enduring}} a twelve-year sickness {{with chronic}} <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia, Edward W. Said died, at 67 years of age, in New York City. He was {{survived by his}} wife, Mariam C. Said, his son, Wadie Said, and his daughter, Najla Said. The eulogists included Alexander Cockburn ("A Mighty and Passionate Heart"); Seamus Deane ("A Late Style of Humanism"); Christopher Hitchens ("A Valediction for Edward Said"); Tony Judt ("The Rootless Cosmopolitan"); Michael Wood ("On Edward Said"); and Tariq Ali ("Remembering Edward Said, 1935–2003"). In November 2004, in Palestine, Birzeit University renamed their music school the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and <b>lymphocytic</b> hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} his father due to heart {{problems}} at the age of 49 had a lasting effect on Henderson. He was conscious of his own health, and survived a blockage in his own heart that was discovered in 2004. He was diagnosed with chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia in 2009. The disease prevented him from attending 40th anniversary celebrations of the Summit Series in Moscow, but he was responding well to experimental treatment as part of a clinical trial he participated in into 2013.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous, clear {{secretions}} may collect {{within these}} cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter. These {{are present in}} the midline of the neck anterior to the trachea. Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foramen cecum. The disorders that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium. Characteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there is an intense <b>lymphocytic</b> infiltrate. Superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.|$|E
25|$|In lymphoblastic or <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemias, the {{cancerous}} change {{takes place}} in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form lymphocytes, which are infection-fighting immune system cells. Most <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemias involve a specific subtype of lymphocyte, the Bcell.|$|E
25|$|Neprilysin is {{expressed}} {{in a wide variety}} of tissues and is particularly abundant in kidney. It is also a common acute <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia antigen that is an important cell surface marker in the diagnosis of human acute <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (ALL). This protein is present on leukemic cells of pre-B phenotype, which represent 85% of cases of ALL.|$|E
25|$|The {{first human}} disease {{associated}} with deregulaton of miRNAs was chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia.|$|E
25|$|Early {{clinical}} failures led to dismissals of gene therapy. Clinical successes since 2006 regained researchers' attention, although as of 2014, it {{was still}} largely an experimental technique. These include treatment of retinal diseases Leber's congenital amaurosis and choroideremia, X-linked SCID, ADA-SCID, adrenoleukodystrophy, chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (CLL), acute <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma, haemophilia, and Parkinson's disease. Between 2013 and April 2014, US companies invested over $600 million in the field.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at Cardiff University {{achieve a}} major {{breakthrough}} in treating chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukaemia (CLL), {{the most common form}} of leukaemia.|$|E
25|$|As with B-cell chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia, {{mutations}} in the IGHV on hairy cells {{are associated with}} better responses to initial treatments and with prolonged survival.|$|E
25|$|Hypothyroidism is {{a growing}} problem in the Rhodesian ridgeback, and this {{condition}} causes a multitude of symptoms, including weight gain and hair loss. Treatment for hypothyroidism in dogs consists of an inexpensive once-daily oral medication. Dr. Lorna Kennedy at the University of Manchester’s Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research in England has found the haplotype (group of genes), which, when present, double {{the chances of a}} Ridgeback becoming hypothyroid due to <b>lymphocytic</b> thyroiditis. This is important to the breed because <b>lymphocytic</b> thyroiditis is the overwhelming cause of hypothyroidism in ridgebacks.|$|E
25|$|If the {{meninges}} are affected, CSF {{will show}} abnormally low glucose levels in CSF, an increased level of protein in the CSF, and <b>lymphocytic</b> pleocytosis. Rarely, CSF eosinophilia is present.|$|E
25|$|Large {{granular}} <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia {{may involve}} either T-cells or NK cells; like hairy cell leukemia, which involves solely B cells, it {{is a rare}} and indolent (not aggressive) leukemia.|$|E
25|$|By {{measuring}} activity among 217 genes encoding miRNAs, {{patterns of}} gene activity that can distinguish types of cancers were identified. miRNA profiling can determine whether {{patients with chronic}} <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia had slow growing or aggressive forms of the cancer.|$|E
25|$|Lenalidomide is {{approved}} in nearly 70 countries, {{in combination with}} dexamethasone {{for the treatment of}} patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. Orphan indications include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Damage to the Bcl-2 gene {{has been}} {{identified}} as a cause of a number of cancers, including melanoma, breast, prostate, chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia, and lung cancer, and a possible cause of schizophrenia and autoimmunity. It is also a cause of resistance to cancer treatments.|$|E
25|$|A {{second group}} with an NCI contract, led by John Montgomery at the Southern Research Institute, {{synthesized}} nitrosoureas, an alkylating agent which cross-links DNA. Fludarabine phosphate, a purine analogue {{which has become}} a mainstay in treatment of patients with chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukaemia, was another similar development by Montgomery.|$|E
25|$|Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is {{sometimes}} considered {{a subset of}} chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia, but does not fit neatly into this category. About 80% of affected people are adult men. No cases in children have been reported. HCL is incurable but easily treatable. Survival is 96% to 100% at ten years.|$|E
25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis forms {{neurotrophic}} infections, and is {{the black}} yeast that most commonly causes life-threatening phaeohyphomycosis. Conditions that might predispose people towards an invasive opportunistic infection include diabetes mellitus, <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and catheterization. Systemic infections are often reported to be without cutaneous or subcutaneous involvement.|$|E
25|$|Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), or thyroid {{eye disease}} (TED), {{is the most}} common extrathyroidal manifestation of Grave's disease. It is a form of {{idiopathic}} <b>lymphocytic</b> orbital inflammation, and although its pathogenesis is not completely understood, autoimmune activation of orbital fibroblasts, which in TAO express the TSH receptor, is thought to play a central role.|$|E
25|$|Imatinib, {{sold under}} the brand names Gleevec among others, is a {{chemotherapy}} medication {{used to treat}} cancer. Specifically, it is used for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (ALL) that is Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) and certain types of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), systemic mastocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (CLL) {{most often}} affects adults {{over the age}} of 55. It {{sometimes}} occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. Two-thirds of affected people are men. The five-year survival rate is 75%. It is incurable, but there are many effective treatments. One subtype is B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, a more aggressive disease.|$|E
25|$|This {{exposure}} {{of the body to}} substantial amounts of previously isolated thyroid enzymes is thought to contribute to the exacerbation of tolerance breakdown, giving rise to the more pronounced symptoms seen later in the disease. <b>Lymphocytic</b> infiltration of the thyrocyte-associated tissues often leads to the histologically significant finding of germinal center development within the thyroid gland.|$|E
25|$|In August two {{of three}} {{subjects}} of a pilot study were confirmed to have been cured from chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (CLL). The therapy used genetically modified T cells to attack cells that expressed the CD19 protein to fight the disease. In 2013, the researchers announced that 26 of 59 patients had achieved complete remission and the original patient had remained tumor-free.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{case study}} in rational drug design is imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed specifically for the bcr-abl fusion protein that is characteristic for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias (chronic myelogenous leukemia and occasionally acute <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia). Imatinib is substantially different from previous drugs for cancer, as most agents of chemotherapy simply target rapidly dividing cells, not differentiating between cancer cells and other tissues.|$|E
25|$|Leukemias* are {{progressive}} {{proliferation of}} cancerous {{white blood cells}} within the bone marrow, resulting in destruction of the bone marrow and pancytopenia in many cases. Types of leukemia in dogs include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, acute myelomonocytic leukemia, acute megakaryocytic leukemia, chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic basophilic leukemia, and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (or hypereosinophilic syndrome).|$|E
25|$|In this pattern, {{hepatocellular}} necrosis {{is associated with}} infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug-induced hepatitis. (A) viral hepatitis is the most common, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. (B) in focal or non-specific hepatitis, scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany <b>lymphocytic</b> infiltration. (C) chronic hepatitis {{is very similar to}} autoimmune hepatitis clinically, serologically, and histologically.|$|E
25|$|Skin dryness in {{some people}} with SS {{may be the result}} of <b>lymphocytic</b> {{infiltration}} into skin glands. The symptoms may develop insidiously, with the diagnosis often not considered for several years, because the complaints of sicca may be otherwise attributed to medications, a dry environment, aging, or may be regarded as not of severity warranting the level of investigation necessary to establish the presence of the specific underlying autoimmune disorder.|$|E
25|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}}, {{also known}} as chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> thyroiditis and Hashimoto's disease, is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed. Early on {{there may be no}} symptoms. Over time the thyroid may enlarge forming a painless goiter. Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with its accompanying weight gain, feeling tired, constipation, depression, and general pains. After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size. Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Due to dose-limiting thrombocytopoenia of navitoclax as {{a result}} of Bcl-xL inhibition, Abbvie {{successfully}} developed the highly selective inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199), which inhibits Bcl-2, but not Bcl-xL or Bcl-w. Clinical trials studied the effects of venetoclax, a BH3-mimetic drug designed to block the function of the Bcl-2 protein, on patients with chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (CLL). Good responses have been reported and thrombocytopoenia was no longer observed. A phase 3 trial started in Dec 2015.|$|E
25|$|Ofatumumab is {{a second}} {{generation}} human IgG1 antibody that binds to CD20. It {{is used in the}} treatment of chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> leukemia (CLL) because the cancerous cells of CLL are usually CD20-expressing B-cells. Unlike rituximab, which binds to a large loop of the CD20 protein, ofatumumab binds to a separate, small loop. This may explain their different characteristics. Compared to rituximab, ofatumumab induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity at a lower dose with less immunogenicity.|$|E
25|$|The general {{prognosis}} for PNP is poor. It is more hopeful if the tumor is benign, {{but in the}} case of malignant tumors, the mortality rate is roughly 90%. The two most commonly associated types of tumors are non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> lymphoma; nearly all of these patients die within two years of diagnosis. This is attributed to the effects of the tumor combined with the negative side effects of the medication administered to treat PNP.|$|E
