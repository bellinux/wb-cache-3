Attempts at {{introducing}} a census in West Germany sparked strong popular resentment in the 1980s since many quite personal questions were asked. Some campaigned for a boycott. In the end the Constitutional Court stopped the census in 1980 and 1983. The last census was in 1987. Germany has since used population samples in combination with statistical methods, {{in place of a}} full census.|$|E

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{techniques for}} rice cultivation {{have been established}} with the agricultural experiments in the government experiment stations {{since the end of}} last century. Before that period, there were various techniques which remained almost unchanged from ancient times and some new techniques devised by skilled farmers. In order to improve the rice cultivation, the government made many efforts to select these techniques and to extend them to the farmers. For these purposes, the government held many meetings of skilled farmers and put in practice several <b>large-scale</b> <b>censuses.</b> Some interesting documents about them which remained in Oosima-gun are described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|A {{protected}} area network should ensure {{the maintenance of}} biodiversity. Because of climate change, species ranges are expected to move polewards, causing further demand for the {{protected area}} network to be efficient in preserving biota. We compared population changes of different bird species groups according to their habitat preferences in boreal protected areas in Finland {{on the basis of}} <b>large-scale</b> <b>censuses</b> carried out in 1981 – 1999 and in 2000 – 2009. Population densities of common forest habitat generalists remained the same between the two periods, while densities of species of conservation concern showed contrasting trends: species preferring old-growth forests increased, but those living in mires and wetlands, and species of Arctic mountains decreased. These trends are most probably connected with climate change, but successional changes in protected areas and regional habitat alteration should also be taken into account. Of species preferring old-growth forests, a larger proportion are southern than among species of mires and wetlands, or of Arctic mountains, most or all of which, respectively, had a northerly distribution. In general, northern species have decreased and southern increased with the exception of northern species of old-growth forests which had not declined. On the other hand, bird species of mires and wetlands decreased also in the northernmost protected areas although mires had not been drained in the region in contrast with southern and central Finland thus indicating that regional-scale direct habitat loss did not cause the decline of these species in the north. It is suggested that climate change effects on species in natural boreal and Arctic habitats most probably are habitat-specific with large differences in response times and susceptibility...|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 30 {{research}} institutions have now carried out parallel censuses of large forest plots. There are four such <b>large-scale</b> <b>census</b> projects in Africa, nine in Latin America, and 25 in Asia. Moreover, the census {{program has been}} expanded to include temperate and subtropical forests in China. Approximately 4.5 million individual trees of 8500 species are being monitored. Numerous scientific research reports on tree species diversity, distribution, life span, and growth rates have been published based on these plots.|$|E
40|$|Using <b>large-scale</b> <b>census</b> {{data and}} {{adjusting}} for sending-country fixed effect {{to account for}} changing composition of immigrants, we study relative immigrant selection to Canada and the U. S. during 1990 - 2006, a period characterized by diverging immigration policies in the two countries. Results show a gradual change in selection patterns in educational attainment and host country language proficiency in favor of Canada as its post- 1990 immigration policy allocated more points to the human capital of new entrants. Specifically, in 1990, new immigrants in Canada {{were less likely to}} have a B. A. degree than those in the U. S.; they were also less likely to have a high-school or lower education. By 2006, Canada surpassed the U. S. in drawing highlyeducated immigrants, while continuing to attract fewer low-educated immigrants. Canada also improved its edge over the U. S. in terms of host-country language proficiency of new immigrants. Entry-level earnings, however, do not reflect the same trend: Recent immigrants to Canada have experienced a wage disadvantage compared to recent immigrants to the U. S., as well as Canadian natives. One plausible explanation is that, while the Canadian points system has successfully attracted more educated immigrants, it may not be effective in capturing productivity-related traits that are not easily measurable...|$|E
40|$|The Government {{announced}} on 13 November 1989 that an ethnicity {{question would be}} asked in the 1991 Census. The decision was taken following the favourable public response to the fielding of {{a new form of}} ethnicity question in the <b>large-scale</b> <b>Census</b> Test carried out in April 1989. The question asks the respondent to tick one box from among the following categories: White, Black-Caribbean, Black-African, Black-Other (with description), Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Any other ethnic group (with description). The 1991 Census will be the first British census to include an ethnicity question, though not the first for which such a question was proposed. The 1981 Census was to have had a question on race/ethnic group but the proposal was dropped following the unsuccessful trial of a question in the 1979 Census Test in Haringey. The absence of an ethnic-group question from the 1981 Census was a cause of concern to many connected with race relations and was extensively discussed following the decision to omit the question. An inquiry into the inclusion of an ethnicity question in the census was held by the Home Affairs Committee Sub-Committee on Race Relations and Immigration. The Sub-Committee's final report was published in 1983 and, together with the memoranda and verbal evidence presented to the Committee, gives a very full account of the issues in this area...|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{have been}} able to {{identify}} several ecological factors for the survival of both released birds and wild populations. Typically, in any region where Houbara bustard are released, biologists perform such operations as <b>large-scale</b> vegetation surveys, <b>census</b> of invertebrate and vertebrate animal life, habitat mapping and climate surveys at strategically located satellite stations. The effects of agricultural methods, in particular grazing, are measured to assess their impact on regeneration of appropriate plant life. The information gathered by IFHC biologists is important for regional conservation programmes in biodiversity and ecosystems.|$|R
5000|$|When the Scot John MacDonald Kinneir visited Cyprus in 1814, he {{estimated}} about 40 Armenian families in Nicosia (around 200 persons) - {{out of a}} total of 2,000 families (about 10,000 persons), as did British Consul Niven Kerr and Greek Vice-Consul Demetrios Margarites in 1844 and 1847, respectively. The first <b>large-scale</b> Ottoman <b>census</b> in 1831, under the supervision of Muhassil Halil Effendi, counted 114 non-Muslim males in the Armenian quarter of Nicosia and 13 at the Armenian Monastery (with a total male population of 45,365). Therefore, the number of Armenians in Cyprus would have been around 200 ({{out of a total}} of about 88,500). Visiting Cyprus in 1835, American missionary Rev. Lorenzo Warriner Pease writes [...] "the number of Armenians Nicosia is between 30 and 40 families". In 1841, about 200 Armenians lived on the island ({{out of a total of}} 108,600), of whom about 150-160 resided in Nicosia (with a population of 12,000) - according to the record of population by Muhassil Talât Effendi and the writings of French historians and travellers Louis Lacroix and Count Louis de Mas Latrie. The Latin Vicar General Paolo Brunoni also mentioned 200 Armenians in Nicosia in 1848, as well as some others at the Magaravank. In 1874 Belgian traveller Edmond Paridant-van der Cammen estimated 190 Armenians in Nicosia (out of a total of 13,530). Although unreliable for the Armenian population of Nicosia (mentioning only 20 families in 1875), researcher Philippos Georgiou recorded 6-8 Armenian families around the Magaravank and 5 Armenian families in Larnaca. In 1877, newly arrived priest Hovhannes Shahinian recorded 152 Armenians living in Cyprus, while the first modern population census of Nicosia, carried out in 1879 by the District Commissioner, Major-General Sir Robert Biddulph, counted 166 Armenians - out of a total of 11,197 inhabitants.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{development}} of REDD+ mechanisms require reliable estimation of carbon stocks, especially in tropical forests that are particularly threatened by global changes. Even if tree height {{is a crucial}} variable to compute the above-ground forest biomass, tree heights are rarely measured in <b>large-scale</b> forest <b>census</b> because it requires consequent extra-effort. Tree height have thus to be predicted thanks to height models. Height and diameter of all trees above 10 cm of diameter were measured in thirty-three half-ha plots and nine one-ha plots throughout the northern French Guiana, an area with substantial climate and environmental gradients. We compared four different model shapes {{and found that the}} Michaelis-Menten shape was the most appropriate for the tree biomass prediction. Model parameters values were significantly different from one forest plot to another and neglecting these differences would lead to large errors in biomass estimates. Variables from the forest stand structure explained a sufficient part of the plot-to-plot variations of the height model parameters to affect the AGB predictions. In the forest stands dominated by small trees, the trees were found to have rapid height growth for small diameters. In forest stands dominated by larger trees, the trees were found to have the greatest heights for large diameters. The above-ground biomass estimation uncertainty of the forest plots was reduced by the use of the forest structure-based height model. It demonstrates the feasibility and the importance of height modeling in tropical forest for carbon mapping. Tree height is definitely an important variable for AGB estimations. When the tree heights are not measured in an inventory, they can be predicted with a height-diameter model. This model can account for plot-to plot variations in height-diameter relationship thank to variables describing the plots. The variables describing the stand structure of the plots are efficient for this. We found that variables describing the plot environment (rainfall, topography, [...] .) do not improve the model much. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Spatial data {{collection}} in an organizational setup {{is growing in}} terms of the number of applications. While these applications are similar in providing the capability to collect and store spatial data, they are inherently different in the domains they cater to. For instance, they range from collecting data for facilitated Voluntary Geographic Information (VGI) like evaluating children’s walkability to schools or visual quality assessment of a community to crowd sourcing or emergency dispatch and <b>large–scale</b> <b>census</b> gathering. Mobile devices are a great medium to collect such VGI. Several constraints with respect to time, manpower and efficiency contribute to the lack of a technology model to enable dynamic creation and delivery of such projects. In this thesis, we address the research questions as to what a model for rapidly deploying a mobile VGI should look like and how to create one. We demonstrate this by creating a web–based project authoring system. The data collected from this system is fed into a Geographic Information System (GIS) model that automates creation of necessary spatial components and exposes them as Representational State Transfer (REST) services. An iOS mobile application consumes the web services and enables field {{data collection}}. The model also integrates multiple projects for a user while providing a domain specific means for collecting non–spatial attributes. Existing solutions for gathering data do not consider the relationship of attributes to one other. This thesis presents a dynamic decision tree implementation for the same, which improves efficiency and ensures correctness of the data collected in the field...|$|E
40|$|The Population Census is an {{important}} source of statistical information in most countries that is capable of producing reliable estimates of population characteristics for small geographic areas. One limitation of a census is that there are many population characteristics that cannot be collected due to respondent burden or cost. This means that statistical agencies have to conduct population based surveys to provide social, economic and demographic characteristics for a target population which are not captured by a <b>large-scale</b> <b>census.</b> These surveys are usually capable of producing direct estimates at the national level and high level regions but often cannot produce reliable estimates for smaller areas. Due to the increasing demand for comprehensive statistical information not only at the national level but also for sub-national domains, there is a wide discussion in the literature about the use of statistical techniques that combine survey with census data to provide more detailed, finer-level estimates. Where censuses and sample surveys are based on the same reporting units, statistical matching techniques can be employed to link the records from survey and census data where exact matching of reporting units is impossible due to confidentiality restrictions. These techniques can then provide the detailed social, economic and demographic information required for small areas. An approach is developed in this paper in which a close-to-reality synthetic population of individuals and households is generated from available census tables using an iterative proportional updating (IPU) method. Statistical matching using a nearest neighbour method is then used to impute survey data to the individuals and households in the synthetic population. To evaluate this approach, 2011 Bangladesh census data is used to generate a district-specific synthetic population of individuals and households. Matching is then performed by imputing the nearest possible records among the 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey to estimate the wealth index for each household within the synthetic population. The results show that using the method presented in this paper helps with achieving more representative estimates (comparing with direct survey estimates,) particularly for areas with small sample sizes where not all population units with different socio-demographic characteristics are included...|$|E
30|$|Table 1 in the Appendix {{also gives}} {{information}} on the accessibility of the registers for scholars from academia and on the national statistical infrastructure that researchers can use to design their research, such as regular national reports or regular data sources (<b>censuses,</b> <b>large-scale</b> surveys) providing national statistics on migration and other relevant side information for sampling designs. Registers are available for scientific research in all countries except Italy, however, the countries differ widely in the conditions attached to access. For example, the research {{has to be in}} the public interest (Germany), supported by the public administration (Spain), or done in cooperation with a national (domestic) research institute or university (The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden). Certainly, these conditions are difficult to fulfill for foreign researchers and hence, cooperation or affiliation with national researchers is always useful, if not necessary. Linkage with other registers is also possible (and available for researchers) in the countries with a long tradition of register-based statistical accounting (such as Denmark or Sweden), but not in Germany with its historical reluctance towards centralized and linked registers after the experience of the Third Reich. In Italy, only the national statistical office ISTAT has the possibility to link information in registers.|$|R
40|$|We present Census, a {{platform}} for building <b>large-scale</b> distributed applications. <b>Census</b> provides a membership service and a multicast mechanism. The membership service provides every node with a consistent view of the system membership, which may be global or partitioned into location-based regions. Census distributes membership updates with low overhead, propagates changes promptly, and is resilient to both crashes and Byzantine failures. We believe that Census is the first system to provide a consistent membership abstraction at very large scale, greatly simplifying the design of applications built atop large deployments such as multi-site data centers. Census builds on a novel multicast mechanism that is closely integrated with the membership service. It organizes nodes into a reliable overlay composed of multiple distribution trees, using network coordinates to minimize latency. Unlike other multicast systems, it avoids the cost of using distributed algorithms to construct and maintain trees. Instead, each node independently produces the same trees from the consistent membership view. Census uses this multicast mechanism to distribute membership updates, along with application-provided messages. We evaluate the platform under simulation and on a real-world deployment on PlanetLab. We find that it imposes minimal bandwidth overhead, is able to react quickly to node failures {{and changes in the}} system membership, and can scale to substantial size. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} field of information policy in a historic setting in Sweden, namely the early 1970 s. At the time the question of privacy in relation to databanks, data systems and personal records was intensively discussed in all public media, starting {{in the fall of}} 1970 when a <b>large-scale</b> population <b>census</b> was carried out in Sweden. The political discussions and public debate resulted in the first Swedish data protection law, Datalag (1973 : 289), and was counted {{as one of the first}} of this type of national legislation in the world. The focus of the empirical study lies in the analysis of the lines of arguments, political reasoning and debates concerning privacy, data protection, information and technology in documents such as official reports, committee reports, proposals and parliamentary records and publications that were produced in the policy process preceding the new legislation. The public debate itself is investigated through the editorials and reports in the daily press of the time. A combination of discourse analysis and agenda-setting theory, as it is presented and used by the political scientist John W Kingdon, constitutes the theoretical framework of the thesis. The study is introduced with a discussion concerning discourse and language use in politics, and here Norman Faircloughs CDA, Critical Discourse Analysis, has been the main inspiration. Kingdon’s agenda-setting model contributes with an interesting theoretical perspec¬tive on the social and political context of the discourses under study. The research questions also draw upon library and information science and theoretical work within the area of information policy, with issues concerning notions of information and technology, for example information as a public good versus private good in the market, and information as a free or restricted/protected resource. The main findings of the study imply that the political discussion and debate on databanks and privacy were heavily influenced by a public-oriented discourse focusing mainly on governmental authorities’ own use of information systems holding personal data. The new legislation, datalag (1973 : 289) could also be seen as a tool that sanctions governmental authorities’ extensive use and dependence on new data technologies and automatic data-processing in building up the welfare state and the growing public sector. The discourse was also based on a mixed notion of the new technology, perceiving data technology mainly as the “big machine” which contains a vast amount of personal information. This, at a time when the technology itself was transforming rapidly from bulky machines to personal computers. The practical effects of this discourse could be seen, for example, in the serious underestimation of the overall use of automatic data-processing in society as a whole, the use of which the legislation was set to regulate. When it comes to agenda-setting the public debate together with the activities of different actors in parliament had a major influence on the outcome of the work of the commission of inquiry that was set up. The public debate affected how the problem area of databanks and privacy was considered, but the commission formulated the actual legislation independently, without interference or adjustments by the social democratic government...|$|R
