30|$|Due to {{the ease}} in the pants lining, the {{specific}} moving degrees on the pattern {{to develop the}} lining pattern from the outer shell pattern was different. As shown in Table  3, the suit pants lining was for the front only, and the back patterns in Figure  3 are for casual pants. The back pants lining showed two different types. One type of lining has the length below the knee line (average 2.3  cm below the knee level), which is a match up with the front <b>lining</b> <b>panel.</b> The second type has the length below the crotch level (average 7.2  cm below the crotch level), and is shorter than the front <b>lining</b> <b>panel.</b> This shortened back <b>lining</b> <b>panel</b> reduces the potential discomfort of the wearer.|$|E
30|$|Third, ease in {{the pants}} lining pattern at the waist, hip, and thigh {{were the same}} {{measurement}} of 0.75  cm. To ensure that the outer shell is comfortable when worn, the lining pattern had ease on the circumference and length, even though the back <b>lining</b> <b>panel</b> hangs freely within the pant shell. Due to the horizontal and vertical ease, a specific shifting amount was necessary to {{increase the size of}} the lining pattern. The length of the back <b>lining</b> <b>panel</b> could be adjusted to reach just below the crotch level or below the knee level.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, the {{researchers}} found that the pants lining pattern size was increased in circumference and in length from the outer shell pattern size. The casual pants manufacturing was varied from that of the suit pants, as the casual pants occasionally have a back <b>lining</b> <b>panel.</b> This was in contrast to womenswear pants manufacturing. Therefore, this study suggests that new menswear manufacturers or womenswear fashion designers could apply these specific results when developing pants lining patterns. As the study results show, pants lining patterns are as important as the outer shell patterns. Garment manufacturers should take these results into consideration to develop proper menswear pants lining patterns. We believe that this study will contribute to an area of clothing construction science applying study results, and save construction time and manufacturing cost sharing companies’ information. For future research, more detailed manufacturing conditions and methods of casual pants is suggested. More in-depth studies comparing and contrasting menswear with womenswear pants manufacturing is also suggested.|$|E

The {{counterpart}} point (➄, ➅) X values were the same as 0.4 cm, which means moving to the right from the side seam. The bottom of the lining pattern (around the knee level), the point ➃ and ➆ values are − 0.18 and 0.35 cm. These values are not similar; the inseam point ➃ (− 0.18 cm), was less than the outseam point ➆ (0.35 cm). The point ➇, which determines the length of the pants lining was − 2.31 cm below the knee line. The length of pants lining varied; the longest <b>lining</b> <b>panel</b> was 7 cm below the knee line, while the shortest one was 5 cm above the knee line. These results were also different from the comparative literature, which stated 10 cm below and 7 cm below the knee line was average. The length of the pants lining pattern in menswear brands was shorter than that in the literature reviews.|$|E

Blurb: "The view up here: research to commercialisation" presents the product outcome of my design research - a lightweight, truly sustainable interior acoustic <b>lining</b> <b>panel</b> which utilises Papua New Guinea (PNG) balsa wood as a core substrate material in sandwich panels. The photograph represents the significant scale of this research outcome. Balsa farmers in PNG rely heavily on this resource for financial returns to support their family and community livelihoods. A lack of design innovation has resulted in a mass over-supply and under-demand for PNG balsa in global markets. The development of a new balsa product outcome has a significant impact on PNG farmers and the PNG balsa industry by offering alternative consumer markets. Additionally, this product innovation demonstrates an opportunity to generate global demand for PNG balsa as a sustainable alternative to current building materials used in the construction industry. Balsa is one of the lightest commercial timbers available and the only material used in sandwich composite panels to derive from a natural and renewable resource grown on sustainable plantations. My research has proven that balsa has superior thermal performance and acoustic absorption properties that make it a desirable material for lightweight, interior fit-outs where thermal comfort and noise control are essential in contemporary high-rise concrete construction. This design research outcome has been installed into commercial environments and has successfully delivered premium results for clients proving it is a commercially viable and innovative design outcome...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a {{heterogeneous}} and biologically poorly understood disease. To tailor CRC treatment, {{it is essential}} to first model this heterogeneity by defining subtypes of patients with homogeneous biological and clinical characteristics and second match these subtypes to cell lines for which extensive pharmacological data is available, thus linking targeted therapies to patients most likely to respond to treatment. Methods We applied a new unsupervised, iterative approach to stratify CRC tumor samples into subtypes based on genome-wide mRNA expression data. By applying this stratification to several CRC cell <b>line</b> <b>panels</b> and integrating pharmacological response data, we generated hypotheses regarding the targeted treatment of different subtypes. Results In agreement with earlier studies, the two dominant CRC subtypes are highly correlated with a gene expression signature of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT). Notably, further dividing these two subtypes using iNMF (iterative Non-negative Matrix Factorization) revealed five subtypes that exhibit activation of specific signaling pathways, and show significant differences in clinical and molecular characteristics. Importantly, we were able to validate the stratification on independent, published datasets comprising over 1600 samples. Application of this stratification to four CRC cell <b>line</b> <b>panels</b> comprising 74 different cell lines, showed that the tumor subtypes are well represented in available CRC cell <b>line</b> <b>panels.</b> Pharmacological response data for targeted inhibitors of SRC, WNT, GSK 3 b, aurora kinase, PI 3 kinase, and mTOR, showed significant differences in sensitivity across cell lines assigned to different subtypes. Importantly, some of these differences in sensitivity were in concordance with high expression of the targets or activation of the corresponding pathways in primary tumor samples of the same subtype. Conclusions The stratification presented here is robust, captures important features of CRC, and offers valuable insight into functional differences between CRC subtypes. By matching the identified subtypes to cell <b>line</b> <b>panels</b> that have been pharmacologically characterized, it opens up new possibilities for the development and application of targeted therapies for defined CRC patient sub-populations. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} few decades, panels of human cancer cell lines have made a {{significant}} contribution to the discovery and development of anticancer drugs. The National Cancer Institute 60 (NCI 60), which consists of 60 cell lines from various human cancer types, remains the most powerful human cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>panel</b> for high throughput screening of anticancer drugs. The development of JFCR 39, comprising a panel of 39 human cancer cell lines coupled with a drug-activity database, was based on NCI 60. Like NCI 60, JFCR 39 not only provides disease-oriented information but can also predict the action mechanism or molecular target of a given antitumor agent by utilizing the COMPARE algorithm. The molecular targets of ZSTK 474 as well as several other antitumor agents have been identified by using JFCR 39 and some of these compounds have since entered clinical trials. In this review, we will describe human cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>panels</b> particularly JFCR 39 and its application in the discovery and/or development of anticancer drug candidates...|$|R
40|$|Eribulin mesylate is a {{synthetic}} macrocyclic ketone analog {{of the marine}} sponge natural product halichondrin B. Eribulin is a mechanistically unique inhibitor of microtubule dynamics. In this study, we investigated whether selective signal pathways were associated with eribulin activity compared to paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubules, based on gene expression profiling of cell <b>line</b> <b>panels</b> of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer in vitro. We determined the sets of genes that were differentially altered between eribulin and paclitaxel treatment in breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>panels.</b> Our unsupervised clustering analyses revealed that expression profiles of gene sets altered with treatments were correlated with the in vitro antiproliferative activities of the drugs. Several tubulin isotypes had significantly lower expression in cell lines treated with eribulin compared to paclitaxel. Pathway enrichment analyses of gene sets revealed that the common pathways altered between treatments in the 3 cancer panels were related to cytoskeleton remodeling and cell cycle regulation. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway was enriched in genes with significantly altered expression between the two drugs for breast and endometrial cancers, but not for ovarian cancer. Expression of genes from the EMT pathway correlated with eribulin sensitivity in breast cancer and with paclitaxel sensitivity in endometrial cancer. Alteration of expression profiles of EMT genes between sensitive and resistant cell lines allowed us to predict drug sensitivity for breast and endometrial cancers. Gene expression analysis showed that gene sets that were altered between eribulin and paclitaxel correlated with drug in vitro antiproliferative activities in breast and endometrial cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>panels.</b> Among the panels, breast cancer provided the strongest differentiation between eribulin and paclitaxel sensitivities based on gene expression. In addition, EMT genes were predictive of eribulin sensitivity in the breast and endometrial cancer panels...|$|R
