5000|$|The offseason proved very {{difficult}} for Ortiz, as on New Year's Day 2002, his mother died following a car accident. Gardenhire reached out and helped Ortiz deal with the tragic death, and Ortiz prepared hard for the coming baseball season, both saddened his mother never saw him play at his best and determined to reach new heights. When the season began, Ortiz battled knee injuries. It was {{a tale of two}} seasons for David, as his [...]240 average with 5 homers and 33 RBI before the All-Star break was disappointing.

5000|$|Bimodality is the {{simultaneous}} use of two distinct pitch collections. It is more general than bitonality since the [...] "scales" [...] involved {{need not be}} traditional scales; if diatonic collections are involved, their pitch centers need not be the familiar major and minor-scale tonics. One example is the opening (mm. 1-14) of Béla Bartók's [...] "Boating" [...] from Mikrokosmos (no. 125, vol. 5). Here, the right <b>hand</b> uses <b>pitches</b> of the pentatonic scale on E and the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> uses those of the diatonic hexachord on C, perhaps suggesting G dorian or G mixolydian.|$|R
