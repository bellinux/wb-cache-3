25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” {{and he was}} right, {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” a little thing <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only the board knows! I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the board can {{get an idea of}} it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E
25|$|The gamble {{to carry}} out the {{operation}} in daylight proved successful. Daylight not only helped the aircraft to navigate better, but also greatly reduced the time required for units to assemble on the drop zones. This was achieved with over 5,200 sorties by fighters and bombers devoted to warding off the Luftwaffe and suppressing German flak batteries. However, it did not eliminate the need for pathfinders. The recovery rate for airdropped supplies also improved but was still poor. The 101st Airborne Division retrieved less than 50% of its supplies, while the 82nd Airborne Division, greatly aided by Dutch civilians, still managed less than 70%. The beleaguered British 1st Airborne Division retrieved less than 15% of its supplies. Major General James M. Gavin of the 82nd Airborne Division estimated that collecting all of the airdropped supplies would have required a third of men. Nothing <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> available in battle. In all, IX Tactical Air Command flew 4,242 aircraft and 1,899 glider sorties, losing 98 aircraft and 137 gliders. Nos 38 and 46 Groups RAF flew 1,340 aircraft and 627 glider sorties, losing 55 aircraft and two gliders.|$|E

After the race, Jeff Gordon (who was {{involved}} in the lap-137 accident) was less optimistic about his championship chances: [...] "This pretty much does it for us as far as I'm concerned for the championship. You knew exactly that something <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> going to happen." [...] In the Manufacturers' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179. The race took three hours, ten minutes and twenty-three seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

[...] As for the A$AP Rocky feature on [...] "Brothers," [...] Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: [...] "I felt <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in a place where a lot of kids are up to him and Kendrick.
