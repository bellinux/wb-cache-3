5|$|The Shapley–Folkman <b>lemma</b> {{depends upon}} the {{following}} definitions and results from convex geometry.|$|E
5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking <b>lemma,</b> according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this <b>lemma</b> states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E
5|$|The Shapley–Folkman <b>lemma</b> implies, for example, {{that every}} point in {{is the sum}} of an integer from{0,1} and a real number from.|$|E
30|$|By an {{argument}} similar to <b>Lemmas</b> 27, 28 in [1] and <b>Lemmas</b> 3.3, 3.4 in [31], {{we have the}} following two <b>lemmas.</b>|$|R
30|$|Using <b>Lemmas</b> 2.9 and 2.10, {{repeating the}} {{arguments}} of <b>Lemmas</b> 2.6 and 2.7 in [40], one can easily prove <b>Lemmas</b> 2.11 and 2.12.|$|R
5000|$|Correctness of the best- ranked <b>lemmas</b> {{created in}} the {{previous}} step are checked by the manual validator, who should be a native speaker.Lemmas are at this stage divided into three categories:- valid <b>lemmas,</b> appended to lexicon- erroneous <b>lemmas</b> generated by valid forms ( [...] later associated to another <b>lemmas)</b> - erroneous <b>lemmas</b> generated by invalid forms (these need to be excluded) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} {{distinct}} solutions {{can also be}} identified with Burnside's <b>Lemma.</b> For a solution, the set of equivalent solutions which can be reached using these operations (excluding relabeling), form an orbit of the symmetric group. The number of essentially different solutions is then the number of orbits, which can be computed using Burnside's <b>lemma.</b> The Burnside fixed points are solutions that differ only by relabeling. Using this technique, Jarvis/Russell computed the number of essentially different (symmetrically distinct) solutions as 5,472,730,538.|$|E
5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's <b>lemma,</b> an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter <b>lemma,</b> which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E
5|$|For example, the {{subset of}} the integers{0,1,2} is {{contained}} in the interval of real numbers, which is convex. The Shapley–Folkman <b>lemma</b> implies that every point in {{is the sum of}} an integer from{0,1} and a real number from.|$|E
30|$|The {{subsequent}} two <b>lemmas</b> for (3.1), (3.2) are partial {{extensions of}} [1], <b>Lemmas</b> 25, 26, proved for partial metric spaces (see also [15], <b>Lemmas</b> 1, 2).|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} about the Borel-Cantelli <b>lemmas</b> and ways one can generalize them. I will give the original version of the <b>lemmas</b> and their proofs and then look at further research {{that has been done}} on these <b>lemmas.</b> I will try to explain how the <b>lemmas</b> can be generalized, give some results published in articles that are about the <b>lemmas</b> and provide proof of certain of these results. ...|$|R
40|$|Leymus chinensis is a {{dominant}} {{grass in the}} Songnen grassland of Northern China. The lower germination caused {{by the presence of}} <b>lemmas</b> has proved to be an obstacle {{for the use of the}} seeds of this plant by humans. However, it is still unknown if the <b>lemmas</b> have other ecological roles such as resisting drought and saline conditions. Three experiments were designed to investigate the ecological roles of the <b>lemmas</b> in Leymus chinensis seeds. The results showed that <b>lemmas</b> significantly improved the amount of water uptake and slowed down the dehydration rate of the seeds under dry conditions. Likewise, the <b>lemmas</b> induced seed dormancy, and removal of the <b>lemmas</b> improved the germination at all temperatures. Although germination percentage of the seeds without <b>lemmas</b> were higher than that of seeds with <b>lemmas</b> under salinity stress, the recovery and total percentage were significantly lower than the seeds with <b>lemmas,</b> especially at 400 mM stress. These results suggest that the <b>lemmas</b> play a vital function in water uptake, dehydration and salt tolerance during the germination stage of the seeds as a response to adverse environmental conditions. Although <b>lemmas</b> showed a dormancy effect, if we want to plant this species in salinity soil in Northeast China, the approach of removing the <b>lemmas</b> by artificial means and improving the seed germination percentage is not feasible...|$|R
5|$|Viète {{began by}} solving the PPP case (three points) {{following}} {{the method of}} Euclid in his Elements. From this, he derived a <b>lemma</b> corresponding {{to the power of}} a point theorem, which he used to solve the LPP case (a line and two points). Following Euclid a second time, Viète solved the LLL case (three lines) using the angle bisectors. He then derived a <b>lemma</b> for constructing the line perpendicular to an angle bisector that passes through a point, which he used to solve the LLP problem (two lines and a point). This accounts for the first four cases of Apollonius' problem, those that do not involve circles.|$|E
25|$|Important theorems {{that apply}} in all abelian {{categories}} include the five <b>lemma</b> (and the short five <b>lemma</b> {{as a special}} case), {{as well as the}} snake <b>lemma</b> (and the nine <b>lemma</b> as a special case).|$|E
25|$|This proof {{does not}} rely on Fatou's <b>lemma.</b> However, we do explain how that <b>lemma</b> might be used.|$|E
30|$|Against our expectations, ZSL {{accuracy}} {{does not}} seem to suffer from the “n-gram-ness” of visual class <b>lemmas</b> as n-gram <b>lemmas</b> even outperform single word <b>lemmas</b> by an average of 2 %.|$|R

25|$|The {{diagonal}} <b>lemma</b> {{applies to}} theories capable of representing all primitive recursive functions. Such theories include Peano arithmetic and the weaker Robinson arithmetic. A common {{statement of the}} <b>lemma</b> (as given below) makes the stronger assumption that the theory can represent all computable functions.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} prove the main results, we need the {{following}} <b>lemmas.</b> The first two <b>lemmas</b> are extensions of <b>Lemmas</b> 1 and 2 in [9] to the nonlinear equation (1.1) with exactly the same proof.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} two <b>lemmas</b> {{are very similar}} to <b>Lemmas</b> 2.6 and 2.7, respectively.|$|R
25|$|The {{proof of}} the theorem above runs by setting a {{structure}} theorem for congruence lattices of semilattices—namely, the Erosion <b>Lemma,</b> against non-structure theorems for free distributive extensions G(Ω), the main one being called the Evaporation <b>Lemma.</b> While the latter are technically difficult, they are, in some sense, predictable. Quite to the contrary, the {{proof of the}} Erosion <b>Lemma</b> is elementary and easy, so it is probably the strangeness of its statement that explains {{that it has been}} hidden for so long.|$|E

25|$|According to the Soviet Mathematical Encyclopaedia (ed. I.M. Vinogradov), {{a related}} 1929 theorem (of Knaster, Borsuk and Mazurkiewicz) had also {{become known as}} the Sperner <b>lemma</b> – this point is {{discussed}} in the English translation (ed. M.
