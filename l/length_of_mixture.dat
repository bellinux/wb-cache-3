When the brushes do not overlap, the problem is shown to be analogous to the system of two hard walls in a near critical binary mixture.

This attractive interaction, which arises from the preferential attraction of the good solvent to the brushes, has a range comparable to the correlation <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mixture.</b> When the brushes do overlap, the interaction between the brushes is repulsive.

When DGK is reconstituted {{into a series of}} phosphatidylcholines containing monounsaturated fatty acyl chains, activity against dihexanoylglycerol (DHG) as a substrate was found to be markedly dependent on the fatty acyl chain length with the highest activity in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine [di(C 18 : 1) PC] and a lower activity in bilayers with shorter or longer fatty acyl chains. Low activities in the short chain phospholipid dimyristoleoylphosphatidylcholine [di(C 14 : 1) PC] followed from an increase in the Km value for DHG and ATP, with no effect on vmax.

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the effective}} spin Hall properties of a composite {{consisting of two}} materials with and without spin-orbit (SO) coupling. In particular, we assume that SO material represents a system of grains in a matrix with no SO. We calculate the effective spin Hall angle and the effective spin diffusion <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mixture.</b> Our main qualitative finding is that, when the bare spin diffusion length is {{much smaller than the}} radius of the grain, the effective spin diffusion length is strongly enhanced, well beyond the "geometrical" factor. The physical origin of this additional enhancement is that, with small diffusion length, the spin current mostly flows around the grain without suffering much loss. We also demonstrate that the voltage, created by a spin current, is sensitive to a very weak magnetic field directed along the spin current, and even reverses sign in a certain domain of fields. The origin of this sensitivity is that the spin precession, caused by magnetic field, takes place outside the grains where SO is absent. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of the laminar burning velocity and introduces the Markstein <b>length</b> <b>of</b> powder–air <b>mixtures.</b> A powder burner was used to stabilize laminar cornstarch–air dust flames and the laminar burning velocity was determined by means of laser Doppler anemometry. The dust concentration was varied from 0. 26 to 0. 38 kg m- 3. The measured laminar burning velocities were found {{to be sensitive to the}} shape of the flame. With the same dust concentration, parabolic flames were found to have a laminar burning velocity, which was almost twice that of a planar flame (ca. 30 cm s- 1 for the latter as compared with ca. 54 cm s- 1 for the former). From this discrepancy and the flame curvature, the Markstein length could be determined. It was found to have a value of 11. 0 mm. This Markstein length was subsequently used to correct the measured laminar burning velocities at various dust concentrations in order to obtain the unstretched laminar burning velocity. The unstretched laminar burning velocity lies between 15 and 30 cm s- 1 and is thought to be a property of the dust and of the concentration...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, {{laminar flame}} speeds and Markstein <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> iso-octane/n-butanol−air <b>mixtures</b> were {{measured}} via the outwardly expanding spherical flame method and high-speed schlieren photography {{over a wide}} range of equivalence ratios and blending ratios of n-butanol at elevated initial temperatures. Results show that laminar flame speeds of fuel blends slightly increase with increasing blending ratio of n-butanol. The effect of blending ratio on laminar flame speed of fuel blends was mechanistically interpreted through examining the thermodynamic and diffusive property, as well as the overall oxidation kinetics. Measurements on the burned gas Markstein length show a generalized behavior. There exists a minimum absolute Markstein length at the critical equivalence ratio ϕ*, under which the stretch effect on the flame propagating speed is minimized. At equivalence ratios less than ϕ*, Markstein length is decreased with increasing blending ratio of n-butanol, indicating that the addition of n-butanol reduces the diffusional thermal stability of the blend; while at equivalence ratios larger than ϕ*, Markstein length increases with increasing blending ratio of n-butanol. This experimental observation on the Markstein length is consistent with the theoretical investigation. A correlation of laminar flame speed of n-butanol/iso-octane blend as a function of equivalence ratio, temperature, and blending ratio of n-butanol is given on the basis of experimental data. 1...|$|R

Ignition <b>of</b> the <b>mixtures</b> was attained using an exploding wire (120 Joules stored energy) or a solid explosive detonator. Comparison of the experimentally measured detonation velocity and pressure to the theoretical Chapman-Jouguet velocity and pressure indicates the existence of a self-sustained heterogeneous detonation.

40|$|Constant {{pressure}} outwardly propagating flame {{experiments in}} a spherical bomb are performed {{to examine the}} duration and radius over which spark ignition effects persist. This is motivated {{by the need to}} properly account for such effects in the measurement of laminar burning velocity and Markstein length using the spark ignited expanding flame technique. Ignition energy was varied and its effects on flame propagation in methane-air and isooctane-air mixtures were studied. The Markstein <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mixture</b> proved critical in the ignition energy dependency of flame propagation. For relatively high values, an underlying common variation of self-sustaining flame speed with radius can be identified by the rapid convergence of curves for different ignition energies. As the Markstein length decreases, low energy spark ignition is found to give rise to a distorted and wrinkled flame kernel. For such mixtures, due to the weak effect of stretch, the kernel subsequently develops into a non-spherically propagating flame. In these cases the spark ignition effect persists up to large radius. It is shown that using low ignition energy leads to a flame speed, during the development phase, which is higher than that of a self-sustaining spherical flame. It is further shown that if this effect is not accounted for, measurements <b>of</b> Markstein <b>length</b> using standard fitting techniques results in a large error. This problem is found to worsen as the Markstein length decreases, such that its apparent measured value becomes increasingly influenced by any distortions of the flame kernel produced by the spark...|$|R
