5|$|Only a {{few months}} later, on 14 December 1861, Albert died at Windsor Castle. During his final illness, Alice {{remained}} at his bedside. Alice sent for the Prince of Wales by telegram, without {{the knowledge of the}} Queen, who refused to notify him because she blamed him for Albert's death. The Queen was distraught by her husband's death, and the court entered a period of intense mourning. Alice became her mother's unofficial secretary, and for the next six months, the physical representation of the monarch. Through her passed the Queen's official papers to and from her government ministers, while the Queen secluded herself from all public life. Alice was aided in this task by her younger sister Princess Louise. Although Princess Helena, Louise's elder sister, would normally have been selected to assist, her inability to go <b>long</b> <b>without</b> crying was held against her.|$|E

5000|$|Because he was {{the first}} Prime Minister, {{and the fact that he}} served for more than twenty years, Walpole holds the {{distinction}} of serving over the longest period during which no prime ministers died.

25|$|Members who are {{not living}} in {{accordance}} with the doctrines taught in the INC are admonished. Those who continue in violation of INC doctrines after being admonished are excommunicated or expelled from the INC and thus lose salvation, and therefore, the church does not believe in the perseverance of the saints. Certain violations, such as eating blood, being absent from worship services too <b>long</b> <b>without</b> any solid reason, or marrying or having a romantic relationship with a non-member may result in mandatory excommunication.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{modification}} {{is found}} in male diving beetles (of the family Dytiscidae), who are equipped with suction cup structures on their front legs. They use these to grab passing females and attach to their dorsal surfaces. To get the females to submit, males shake the females violently and keep them submerged underwater (diving beetles cannot go <b>long</b> <b>without</b> atmospheric oxygen). Unable to get air, female diving beetles submit to the male’s advances {{in order to avoid}} drowning (and they lose the energy to resist). Once the males attach, copulation can occur.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, William McGregor {{a gentleman}} from Perthshire and a {{director}} of Aston Villa F.C was the main force between meetings held in London and Manchester involving 12 football clubs, {{with an eye to}} a league competition. These 12 clubs would later become the Football League's 12 founder members. The meetings were held in London, the main concern was that an early exit in the knockout format of the FA Cup could leave clubs with no matches for almost a year, and if that happened, not only could they suffer heavy financial losses, but fans often didn't stick around for that <b>long</b> <b>without</b> a game, and instead went to other teams.

25|$|A lack {{of oxygen}} or {{chemical}} changes in the lungs may cause the heart to stop beating. This cardiac arrest stops {{the flow of blood}} and thus stops the transport of oxygen to the brain. Cardiac arrest used to be the traditional point of death but at this point there is still a chance of recovery. The brain cannot survive <b>long</b> <b>without</b> oxygen and the continued {{lack of oxygen}} in the blood combined with the cardiac arrest will lead to the deterioration of brain cells causing first brain damage and eventually brain death from which recovery is generally considered impossible. The brain will die after approximately six minutes without oxygen at normal body temperature, but hypothermia of the central nervous system may prolong this.|$|E
25|$|Going {{into the}} game, the Giants were 5–6. A three-game losing streak {{on the road}} had made the team's playoff {{prospects}} much dimmer since midseason. However, a win at home against the favored Eagles could, the team hoped, reverse the trend and keep an outside shot at a playoff spot alive. Despite the team's storied past, the Giants had not played in the postseason since 1963 and had managed only two winning seasons since then. Although they were the league's fourth oldest franchise, they were almost a non-entity in the post-merger NFL. The move to New Jersey in 1976 had alienated some longtime fans, even if it made more seats available. Fans had never gone this <b>long</b> <b>without</b> a contender, but while they were growing restless, they were still forgiving.|$|E
25|$|After {{the hero}} Houyi shot down {{nine of the}} ten suns, he was {{pronounced}} king by the thankful people. However, he soon became a conceited and tyrannical ruler.

But his wife, Chang'e, stole it on the fifteenth of August {{because she did not}} want the cruel king to live long and hurt more people. She took the magic potion to prevent her husband from becoming immortal. Houyi was so angry when discovered that Chang'e took the elixir, he shot at his wife as she flew toward the moon, though he missed. Chang'e fled to the moon and became the spirit of the moon. Houyi died soon because he was overcome with great anger. Thereafter, people offer a sacrifice to Chang'e on every lunar fifteenth of August to commemorate Chang'e's action.|$|E

25|$|When a goaltender blocks or stops a {{shot from}} going into his goal net, that action {{is called a}} save. Goalies often use a {{particular}} style, but in general they make saves any way they can: catching the puck with their glove hand, deflecting the shot with their stick, blocking it with their leg pads or blocker or another part of their body, or collapsing to butterfly position to block any low shot coming, especially in close proximity. After making a save, the goaltender attempts to control the rebound to avoid a goal scored by an opposing player when the goaltender is out of position ('scoring on a rebound'), or to allow the goalie's own team {{to get control of}} the puck. Goalies may catch or hold a puck shot at the net to better control how it re-enters play. If there is immediate pressure from the opposing team, a goalie may choose {{to hold on to the}} puck (for a second or more, with judgment from the referee) to stop play for a face-off. If a goalie holds on to the puck for too <b>long</b> <b>without</b> any pressure they may be subject to a 2-minute delay of game penalty. Recently, in the NHL and AHL, goalies have been restricted as to where they can play the puck behind the net.|$|E
