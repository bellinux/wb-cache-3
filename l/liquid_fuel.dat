5|$|KNI and its {{subsidiary}} Pilersuisoq, a state-owned {{chain of}} all-purpose general stores in Greenland, {{are based in}} Sisimiut. The Pilersuisoq chain operates in all small settlements in the country, as well as smaller towns which {{are not covered by}} supermarket chains. A range of shops operate in Sisimiut, from chain supermarkets of Pisiffik and Brugsen to independent outlets, also serving supplies to the smaller settlements in the region. Polaroil, a <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> distribution company, is headquartered in Sisimiut. It employs 70 staff and operates 70 stations in Greenland. The headquarters were moved from Maniitsoq to Sisimiut in the late 2000s. In 2010 KNI announced plans to also move the operational base of Polaroil from Maniitsoq to Sisimiut, causing protests in the former community already experiencing depopulation. Other facilities include two banks, a library, a Post Greenland office and a small hospital/health center with 19 beds.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse the {{development}} of South Africa's <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> industry from 1930 s to the present and the various ways in which the state has extended subsidies and other measures of support to <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> producers. The nature and extent of government support to the South African <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> industry has remained hidden for many years, due to the veil of secrecy surrounding the industry prior to the country's transition to democracy. The study expands past analyses to identify and estimate the magnitude of subsidies to <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> production in South Africa in the present. Using the historical institutional approach, the study then places these measures of support in the South African political economy environment so as to understand the institutional barriers to their reform. In doing so, the study sheds light on the drivers informing the endurance of the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> subsidy regime and state support to the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> industry following the transition to democracy...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{demand for}} <b>liquid</b> {{transportation}} <b>fuels,</b> environmental concerns and depletion of petroleum resources requires {{the development of}} efficient conversion technologies for production of second-generation biofuels from non-food resources. Thermochemical approaches hold great potential for conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels.</b> Direct thermochemical processes convert biomass into <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> in one step using heat and catalysts and have many advantages over indirect and biological processes, such as greater feedstock flexibility, integrated conversion of whole biomass, and lower operation costs. Several direct thermochemical processes are employed {{in the production of}} liquid biofuels depending {{on the nature of the}} feedstock properties: such as fast pyrolysis/liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass for bio-oil, including upgrading methods, such as catalytic cracking and hydrogenation. Owing to the substantial amount of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> consumed by vehicular transport, converting biomass into drop-in <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> may reduce the dependence of the fuel market on petroleum-based fuel products. In this review, we also summarize recent progress in technologies for large-scale equipment for direct thermochemical conversion. We focus on the technical aspects critical to commercialization of the technologies for production of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> from biomass, including feedstock type, cracking catalysts, catalytic cracking mechanisms, catalytic reactors, and biofuel properties. We also discuss future prospects for direct thermochemical conversion in biorefineries for the production of high grade biofuels...|$|R

25|$|Pyrolysis is {{a process}} of thermo-chemical {{decomposition}} of organic materials by heat in the absence of oxygen which produces various hydrocarbon gases. During pyrolysis, the molecules of object are subjected to very high temperatures leading to very high vibrations. Therefore, every molecule in the object is stretched and shaken to an extent that molecules starts breaking down. The rate of pyrolysis increases with temperature. In industrial applications, temperatures are above 430°C (800°F). Fast pyrolysis produces <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> for feedstocks like wood. Slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal. Pyrolysis hold promise for conversion of waste biomass into useful <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel.</b> Pyrolysis of waste plastics can produce millions of litres of fuel.

40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> {{are still}} the {{backbone}} of world transportation nowadays. Therefore, the development of carbon neutral <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> is being crucial. Solar energy has the largest technical potential of all renewable energy sources available and is therefore considered as an appropriate energy resource for the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> production. The proposed thermochemical concept to convert solar energy to <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> is the combination of concentrated solar power (CSP), reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). Two concepts were proposed differing on the heat supply to the RWGS reactor. The first concept applies burner to supply heat to the RWGS reactor, on the other hand, the second concept places RWGS reactor {{to the top of}} solar tower as solar reactor to cover the heat demand by concentrated solar irradiance. Both concepts were modeled and simulated in Aspen plus. By using the base case capacity of 20 MW solar heat in the firsts concept, 1, 865 tons of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> per year can be generated by feeds of 10, 092 tons of water per year and 6, 720 tons of carbon dioxide per year.
