5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that when energy was applied to a combination of gases <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Titan's atmosphere, five nucleotide bases, the building blocks of DNA and RNA, were among the many compounds produced. In addition, amino acids, the building blocks of protein were found. It was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids had been found in such an experiment without liquid water being present.|$|E

5|$|NIF's laser uses {{a system}} of large flashtubes (<b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> a {{photography}} flashlamp) to optically pump {{a large number of}} glass plates. Once the plates are flashed and have settled into a population inversion, a small signal from a separate laser is fed into the optical lines, stimulating the emission in the plates. The plates then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.|$|E

5|$|Herrerasaurus {{displays}} {{traits that}} are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most {{of the characteristics of}} dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony acetabulum (where the femur meets the pelvis) that was only partially open. The ilium, the main hip bone, is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the pubis points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a booted shape, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an hourglass shape as found in Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In February 1989 {{one hundred}} {{construction}} workers were assembling temporary housing {{for themselves in}} Leninakan {{with a plan to}} start on the local population's housing {{by the end of the}} month, though schools and factories were also on the list of facilities to be rebuilt. Deputy chairman of a city building and architecture council said that updated building codes <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the United States were being drafted (along with a strict requirement that the new protocols be respected) and that the new buildings would be no taller than four stories and would be located away from areas with the highest seismic risk. Other officials decided that the town would be relocated several miles to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> {{the police}} force, {{many in the}} medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E

5|$|Prosecutions {{began to}} decline as trials were more tightly {{controlled}} by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. The exposure of prickers as frauds in 1662 removed a major form of evidence. The Lord Advocate George Mackenzie made efforts to make prosecutions ineffective. There {{may also have been}} a growing popular scepticism, and, with relative peace and stability, the economic and social tensions that may have contributed to accusations were reduced, although there were occasional local outbreaks, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> East Lothian in 1678 and in Paisley in 1697. The last executions in the records of the central courts were in 1706. The last trial was held in the court of a sheriff-depute at Dornoch in 1727, and was of questionable legality. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736, making the legal pursuit of witches impossible. Nevertheless, basic magical beliefs persisted, particularly in the Highlands and Islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E

5|$|Curium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators <b>like</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm emits a 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.|$|E
