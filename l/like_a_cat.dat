5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> would, licking {{their front}} paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub {{their backs and}} bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.|$|E

25|$|Byron- A griffin {{saved by}} the {{children}} from Hogsqueal's gang of goblins, {{who were going to}} eat it. Simon took care of him and made him his pet. Resembling a hawks head with a lion's body, Byron often behaves <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat,</b> attempting to eat Hogsqueal and Mulgarath's dragons, and serving as a ride for the children and for Spiderwick.|$|E

25|$|The Shiba is a {{relatively}} fastidious breed and feels {{the need to maintain}} itself in a clean state. They can often be seen licking their paws and legs, much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat.</b> They generally {{go out of their way}} to keep their coats clean. Because of their fastidious and proud nature, Shiba puppies are easy to housebreak and in many cases will housebreak themselves. Having their owner simply place them outside after meal times and naps is generally enough to teach the Shiba the appropriate method of toileting.|$|E
500|$|The dual {{nature of}} the Eye goddess shows, as Graves-Brown puts it, that [...] "the Egyptians saw a double nature to the feminine, which {{encompassed}} both extreme passions of fury and love." [...] This same view of femininity is found in texts describing human women, such as the Instruction of Ankhsheshonq, which says a man's wife is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> when he can keep her happy and like a lioness when he cannot.|$|E
500|$|Purr's scent {{is fresh}} with a citrus twist which also {{features}} peach nectar and apple with green bamboo. It {{also includes a}} [...] "delicate bouquet of jasmine blossom, pink freesia and Bulgarian rose, balanced by vanilla orchid, white amber, creamy sandalwood and musk." [...] The bottle is purple, shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat,</b> decorated with jeweled eyes and features metallic details. Its design was hand-sketched by Katy Perry herself, and was influenced by her Catwoman stage costume.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Eragon, Brisingr {{features}} multiple {{points of}} view. Parts {{of the book}} are written in Saphira's perspective {{for the first time}} in the series. Paolini based the dragon's behavior and attitude on the pets and animals he grew up around, particularly his pet cats: [...] "I thought a dragon would be <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> in some ways, that same sort of self-satisfied attitude." [...] He added that it was challenging to depict scenes from the standpoint of a dragon, but he enjoyed doing it because Saphira [...] "has so many interesting thoughts and opinions." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{incorporates}} use of wah-wah pedal and fuzzbox. Marshall Chess augmented {{the rhythm}} of Muddy Waters' live band {{with the use of}} electronic organ and saxophone. Blues purists criticized the album's psychedelic sound. According to Marshall Chess, [...] "It was never an attempt to make Muddy Waters a psychedelic artist; it was a concept album like David Bowie being Ziggy Stardust." [...] Muddy Waters said of the album's sound, [...] "That guitar sounds just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> – meow – and the drums have a loping, busy beat." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{recently}} as the 1800s, the behaviour of the red-throated loon was used to forecast the weather; according to the conventional wisdom of the time, birds flying inland or giving short cries predicted good weather, while those flying out to sea or giving long, wailing cries predicted rain. In the Orkney and Shetland islands of Scotland, the species is still known as the [...] "rain goose" [...] in deference to its supposed weather-predicting capabilities. The people of the Faroe Islands believed that if the red-throated loon miaowed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat,</b> then rain was imminent, while a call of gaa-gaa-gaa or turkatrae-turkatrae predicted fine weather.|$|E

500|$|Think <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cat</b> is an American {{game show}} created by Grand Central Marketing and {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network. Hosted by Chuck Woolery and sponsored by Meow Mix, eight cats and their owners {{compete in the}} contest, which includes contestants playing games with their cats showcasing their knowledge of cat-based trivia and their relationships with their own cats. The overall winner of the game participates in a bonus round for a million dollar prize. The show premiered as a one-time special on November 15, 2008 and was critically panned, with writers arguing that the special was [...] "embarrassing" [...] and {{that it should be}} [...] "put down".|$|E
500|$|Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment gave Think <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cat</b> {{one star}} out of five. Grosvenor {{thought that the}} show should be [...] "put down", saying that its only pros were Woolery's hosting {{and the fact that}} the episode was [...] "only 30 minutes long". Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times was equally unimpressed, calling the special [...] "not only one of the most {{embarrassing}} half-hours in the history of television, [...] also a significant step toward the collapse of civilized society". Genzlinger also called the games [...] "idiotic" [...] and added that the infomercial feeling of the show was its [...] "overarching problem". Despite the criticism, over 1,000,000 combined viewers watched the show at some point during its five airings.|$|E
500|$|As {{the final}} verse {{of the song}} begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a {{stalking}} cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat.</b> She pours it {{over her shoulder and}} it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat,</b> is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was and looks up at both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, [...] "Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind".|$|E

500|$|Gielgud, aged seventeen, {{joined a}} private drama school run by Constance Benson, {{wife of the}} actor-manager Sir Frank Benson. On the new boy's first day Lady Benson remarked on his {{physical}} awkwardness: [...] "she said I walked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> with rickets. It dealt a severe blow to my conceit, which was a good thing." [...] Before and after joining the school he played in several amateur productions, and in November 1921 made his debut with a professional company, though he himself was not paid. He played the Herald in Henry V at the Old Vic; he had one line to speak and, he recalled, spoke it badly. He was kept on {{for the rest of}} the season in walk-on parts in King Lear, Wat Tyler and Peer Gynt, with no lines.|$|E
500|$|In Tokyo, Japan, a {{young girl}} named Ichigo Momomiya attends an {{endangered}} species exhibit with her [...] "crush" [...] Masaya Aoyama. After an earthquake, Ichigo and four other girls are bathed in a strange light. A cat appears before Ichigo, then merges with her. The next day, she begins acting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> and making cat puns. After meeting Ryô Shirogane and Keiichirô Akasaka, Ichigo learns that she was infused with the DNA of the Iriomote cat. Ryou and Keiichirou explain that this allows her to transform into Mew Ichigo, a powerful heroic cat girl. She is ordered to defeat Chimera Animas—alien parasites which infect animals {{and turn them into}} monsters. Ryou and Keiichirou instruct Ichigo to find the four other girls from the exhibit—the remaining Mew Mews.|$|E
500|$|The series {{revolves}} around its title character and his various friends. SpongeBob SquarePants is an energetic and optimistic sea sponge (although his appearance more closely resembles a kitchen sponge) {{who lives in}} a submerged pineapple and loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab. He has a pet snail, Gary, who meows <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat.</b> Living two houses down from SpongeBob is his best friend Patrick Star, a dim-witted yet friendly pink starfish who lives under a rock. Despite his mental setbacks, Patrick still sees himself as intelligent. Squidward Tentacles is SpongeBob's next-door neighbor and co-worker at the Krusty Krab. Squidward is an arrogant and ill-tempered octopus {{who lives in a}}n Easter Island moai and dislikes his neighbors (especially SpongeBob and Patrick) [...] due to their childish nature. He enjoys playing the clarinet and painting self-portraits, but hates his job as a cashier.|$|E

500|$|In 1969 the UK {{television}} channel ITV televised a Christmas special recorded by Thames Television; entitled [...] "Carry On Christmas", it was watched by over eight million viewers. [...] Subsequent Christmas specials {{were recorded in}} 1972 and 1973. [...] In 1975 a 13-episode television series was commissioned by ATV for ITV. Carry On Laughing ran for two seasons, with six half-hour episodes in season one and seven in season two. [...] The writer Penelope Gilliatt wrote: [...] "The usual charge to make against the Carry On films {{is to say that}} they could be so much better done. [...] This is true enough. [...] They look dreadful, they seem to be edited with a bacon slicer, the effects are perfunctory and the comic rhythm jerks along <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> on a cold morning. [...] But if all these things were more elegant I don't really think the films would be more enjoyable: the badness is part of the funniness." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, the family is watching Aquaman on television. Peter is shown watching Jaws 5 on the television, a sequence which MacFarlane describes as [...] "one of [...] favourite gags [...] ever done on the show". Stewie is shown asking viewers to change the channel to one which is showing Desperate Housewives. When Peter is describing Jesus, he does so in a similar manner to that shown on Quantum Leap. Peter's stuttering while attempting to say [...] "wrong" [...] is a reference to a scene in which Fonzie was unable to say the word on Happy Days. At one point a modified video of [...] "Opposites Attract" [...] with Paula Abdul is shown with Peter dressed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat.</b> [...] The music playing in the background during the end credits is [...] "Rock Around the Clock", the original Happy Days opening theme; additionally, the credits themselves are shown in a similar style and font.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas and co-directed by Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month. It was the first video of the eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The music video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] is only one-minute long and it serves as the introduction for the music video of [...] "Green Light". On the other hand, Matsoukas said that the half-day shoot for [...] "Kitty Kat", by comparison, [...] "was a breeze." [...] Elaborating on the conception of the video, Knowles said: [...] "We had the oversized kitty cat , which was so cute! I had to pretend it was there, because I was really {{in front of the}} green screen — I'd be on a big giant wooden cow and they superimposed a kitten. And we used leopard-print makeup and the catsuit and the nails to make me more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat.</b> I really am a cat person".|$|E

His nephew irritated him. The lad seemed to him too special, self-contained. His nature was fierce enough, but too much abstracted, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> separate thing, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat's</b> nature. <b>A</b> <b>cat</b> could lie perfectly peacefully on the hearthrug whilst its master or mistress writhed in agony a yard away. It {{had nothing to do}} with other people's affairs. What did the lad really care about anything, save his own instinctive affairs? ...|$|R
