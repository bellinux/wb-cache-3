2500|$|The very {{structure}} of American entertainment bears minstrelsy's imprint. The endless barrage of gags and puns {{appears in the}} work of the Marx Brothers and David and Jerry Zucker. The varied {{structure of}} songs, gags, [...] "hokum" [...] and dramatic pieces continued into vaudeville, variety shows, and to modern sketch comedy shows such as Hee Haw or, more distantly, Saturday Night Live and In Living Color. Jokes once delivered by endmen are still told today: [...] "Why did the chicken cross the road?" [...] "Why does a fireman wear red suspenders?" [...] Other jokes form part of the repertoire of modern comedians: [...] "Who was that lady I saw you with <b>last</b> <b>night?</b> <b>That</b> was no lady—that was my wife!" [...] The stump speech is an important precursor to modern stand-up comedy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920, he {{was back}} in a musical comedy, The Little Whopper by George Grossmith, Jr. at the Shaftesbury Theatre. [...] The Times wrote that [...] "Lewis, {{sterling}} actor that he is, gave the impression <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> he had been playing in musical comedy all his life. [...] He sang with the best, and he gave a perfect little study". [...] Later that year, he played in Brown Sugar by Lady Lever at The Duke of York's. [...] In 1921, he was seen in The Trump Card by Arthur Wimperis at the Strand Theatre. [...] The following year, at the Aldwych Theatre, he was seen in Money Doesn't Matter by Gertrude Jennings and the farce Double-Or Quit! by Theophilus Charlton. [...] In 1923, he played in another farce, Three's a Crowd, by Earl Derr Biggers at the Court and Frederick Lonsdale's Aren't We All? at the Globe Theatre. [...] In 1924 Lewis appeared in Kate at the Kingsway Theatre, together with Nellie Briercliffe, and starred in The Other Mr. Gibbs, by Will Evans and Guy Reeves, at the Garrick.|$|E
2500|$|After the trawl {{had been}} {{dragging}} {{for some time}} on the ocean bottom in 65 fathoms, it was raised and the crew stood by to receive the catch. Those with experience of mine sweeping during the war were startled when the mine tumbled out on deck. It stood about four feet high with a diameter of two feet and weighed about five cwt. Long immersion and rolling about {{on the ocean floor}} had made the mine harmless. The cap and firing mechanism were gone, and there was no cable. A quantity of explosive still remained. This was taken out and the mine brought back to Sydney where the trawler berthed yesterday morning. Any marks of identification are hidden by a heavy marine growth. Captain J. Farquhar, master of the Koraaga, who gained a knowledge of mines while fishing In the North Sea, said <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> he believed the mine had been cut adrift from a minefield during sweeping, and after going to the bottom was carried south by the current. It was possible, he said, that the Koraaga was responsible for rendering the mine harmless, since she swept the Gabo field with the Brolga and Gunundaal. The Gabo minefield was first discovered by one of the State trawlers, and that before the danger area was properly swept the Cumberland was blown up. [...] "The laying of the mines by the Wolf was very cleverly done," [...] he said. [...] "They were put down at night in an area that was {{in full view of the}} Gabo lighthouse during daylight." [...] The mine will be retained by Mr. Cam among the many curiosities that have been brought back to Sydney by his trawlers.|$|E

6000|$|... "I've {{just looked}} {{in to see}} if you got back comfortably <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> <b>that's</b> all," [...] she said gently. [...] "I was afraid {{afterwards}} that you might have met with any mishap?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems the}} captain has his man in view," [...] Joel said, keenly eyeing his master. [...] "Perhaps 'tis the same I saw {{out with him}} <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> <b>That's</b> a {{reliable}} person, I do s'pose." ...|$|R
60|$|Many weeks {{had passed}} since that <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> Betty and Alfred Clarke had been together.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Welcome! I have {{expected}} you. You could not surprise old Miriam. The teraph told me <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> {{you would be}} here....' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are unusually enthusiastic, cousin," [...] said Emma, with a laugh. [...] "I {{thought you}} said <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> weather never {{affected}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I couldn't, sir. I {{was out in}} the evening. Perhaps Annie {{could tell}} you, though she's a {{careless}} girl. Never cleared the coffee-cups away <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> <b>That's</b> what happens when I'm not here to look after things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Written to me? {{when did}} she ever write to me? No, I saw a fellow in town this morning who saw her there--at breakfast yesterday. He came over <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> <b>That's</b> how I know my wife's in Paris. You can't have better proof than that!' ...|$|R
60|$|Thus was the <b>last</b> <b>night</b> of <b>that</b> year {{passed in}} the drawing-room. Let us see how it was spent in the kitchen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Old Cragg isn't so stony-hearted, after all. Just my {{suggestion}} <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> Ingua was being neglected {{has resulted in}} the new dress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Melema, what evil dream did {{you have}} <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> <b>that</b> you took my light grasp for that of a sbirro or {{something}} worse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't {{you mention}} <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> {{it was through}} Miss Horsfield that you got the tug? I was {{thinking}} about something else at the time." ...|$|E
60|$|Lov. I {{know not}} yet what {{conditions}} he'll propose. I should have {{spoke with him}} <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> but <b>that</b> a cross chance hindered it.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{think that}} it was you <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and <b>that</b> I never dreamed it," [...] exclaimed Theodora. [...] "Oh, Donald, if I hadn't gone to town!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Skip Paray... uh, Skip Caray, whose pappy was {{the legendary}} Harry, and whose son is Skip, {{died in his}} sleep <b>last</b> <b>night...</b> make <b>that</b> his son, Chip." ...|$|R
60|$|First I must {{thank you}} for your great {{kindness}} to Gerald. I didn't know <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> he owed you a good deal of money.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is pretty}} nice. You can come if Demi don't mind, and I guess he won't, {{because he said}} <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> he liked you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have a maid {{who has a}} sweetheart? I {{think that}} you remarked to your uncle <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> she had been out to see him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and <b>that's</b> why Sam {{was trying}} to get the best of us. We {{attempted}} to capture him, but made a botch of the business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon, O Pharaoh," [...] {{interrupted}} the Prince, [...] "my sister {{spoke to me}} of no decree <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> save <b>that</b> I should attend at the court here to-day." ...|$|R
50|$|But that presupposition, as stated, is {{completely}} trivial, {{given what we}} know about New York. Several million people had dinner in New York <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and <b>that</b> in itself doesn't satisfy the presupposition of the sentence. What is needed for the sentence to be felicitous is really that somebody relevant to the interlocutors had dinner in New York <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and <b>that</b> this has been mentioned in the previous discourse, or that this information can be recovered from it. Presupposition triggers that disallow accommodation are called anaphoric presupposition triggers.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Assembly was {{in session}} all <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> <b>That</b> is all. These damned Privileged {{multiply}} our difficulties. They {{will do so}} until we decree their abolition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Darrell,' said Lord Squib, 'is {{there any}} chance of my being a {{commissioner}} for anything? It struck me <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> I {{had never been in}} office.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s a great {{temptation to}} housebreakers," [...] said her sister, not {{pressing}} the point. [...] "I made sure <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> I heard {{somebody in the}} house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe it}} was you who tipped her off that I was in the larder <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> so <b>that</b> she could find me there with that pie, thus {{damaging}} my prestige." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where {{were you}} <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> brother, <b>that</b> {{you came in}} near the dawn, all covered with mud?" [...] asked Ragnar, turning his back on Iduna, without making any answer to her words.|$|R
60|$|The metaphysical {{effect of}} tea cake <b>last</b> <b>night</b> was, <b>that</b> I had a perilous and weary journey in a desert, in which I had to dodge hostile tribes round {{the corners of}} pyramids.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{saw them}} on the train <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> <b>that</b> is all," [...] {{answered}} Roger. [...] "They said something about Mr. Blower queering a land deal for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] I answered, [...] "it {{was only}} <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> I was {{looking over my}} old notes, and {{classifying}} some of our past results." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ogilvie went {{up after}} breakfast {{to see the}} elder lady, who said, [...] "Do turn out Fanti; I dreamed <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> he went mad and bit".|$|E
2500|$|Examples: to mean [...] "comfort," [...] “He’s been in poor hap {{since his}} wife died" [...] (Maxfield 1931); to mean [...] "comforter, quilt," [...] “It was cold <b>last</b> <b>night</b> but <b>that</b> hap kept me warm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come up-stairs and see!" [...] said Bessie, {{holding her}} friend's {{hand on the}} sofa where they had dropped down together, and going all over the scene of <b>last</b> <b>night</b> in <b>that</b> place for the thousandth time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{do think}} so. Hawk, my Hawk, I lay awake nearly all <b>night</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> realizing <b>that</b> we are one, {{not because of}} a wedding ceremony, but because we can {{understand}} each other's make-b'lieves and seriousnesses. I knew {{that no matter what}} happened, we had to try again.... I saw <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> by myself, <b>that</b> it was not a question of finding out whose fault a quarrel was; that it wasn't anybody's 'fault,' but just conditions.... And we'll change them.... We won't be afraid to be free." ...|$|R
