40|$|In {{this thesis}} I develop a political-ecological model of Resource Appropriation called <b>Landscape</b> <b>Consumption.</b> Resource Appropriation, the {{intentional}} taking by a social group(s) from one {{society of the}} resources of another sovereign political society without consent, is a pervasive and persistent social phenomenon. Resource Appropriation may manifest between states, nations, corporations {{or other forms of}} social organisation and may range from the direct looting of resources, occupation of land and colonialism, to the enforcement of disadvantageous economic, political and trading relationships. Consistent with the field of Political Ecology this thesis attempts to account for the broader environmental and social transformations that accompany Resource Appropriation and the underlying political and economic processes. In doing so the thesis contributes to the growing collection of literature that explores the relationship between natural resource development and social and ecological transformation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract : ased on the {{findings}} of thе recently finalised research project REGALP we present some ideas on the future spatial development of the Alps. For the diverse types of alpine areas there are rather different future perspectives, but generally we can suppose that the spatial polarisation between prosperous and less favoured areas will continue. For the future of alpine cultural landscapes this means that by 2020 we can expect two contrary phenomena at the same time : firstly a growth of prosperous urban agglomerations, with the related problems of <b>landscape</b> <b>consumption</b> and land use conflicts, and secondly an aggravation of phenomena of decline and abandonment. We present the basements of this diagnosis stemming from the REGALP project, such as the analyses of local developement types and of regional accessibility levels. Furthermore, secenarios {{for the future of the}} Alps have been elaborated and discussed with stakeholders from seven alpine pilot regions. Finally we summarise some policy requirements for a more sustainable and balanced development of the Alps. For more information see : www. regalp. atFavry Eva, Pfefferkorn Wolfgang.

Drawing on a multi-methods approach, this exploratory research shows how to construct the livestock animal displacement actor-networks.

The critical action route of livestock animal displacement demonstrated in this research is aimed to improve residents' participation willingness and further to change the local livestock feeding model and traditional dwelling by rural environment governance and rural tourism <b>landscape</b> <b>consumption.</b> Through the process of translation, problematization, interest, enrollment, mobilization and opposition, the livestock displacement actor-networks were constructed to build a heterogeneous network of the local government, tourists, local residents, livestock and human dwelling.

40|$|The American {{suburban}} {{landscape and}} lifestyle incites my investigation of land use, development and consumerism. Our cultural {{obsession with the}} “dream home” and the act of displaying a social identity through popular architectural enhancements is what attracts me to this landscape. In my work I emphasize banal architecture and ornamentation to accentuate issues of sameness and {{draw attention to the}} loss of individuality. The information is distilled into a visual language inspired by my personal histories with zoning, geography, and land use, borrowing from the flatness and simplicity of cartographic design, informational graphics and architectural illustration. In my own work I use the same approach for the clear readability of subjects. The sterile forms and structures within my work are removed from their context to communicate discomfort with this new non-space and the continuing suburban development. I am attracted to the repetitive visual patterns of these suburban spaces and utilize their elements to emphasize their intended use as solely decorative embellishments. Examining the landscape for architectural elements that have become fundamental signifiers of living space, I appropriate these repetitive forms by reconstructing them into piles and emphasizing mundane façades. In this manner, I draw attention to the ideas of <b>landscape</b> <b>consumption</b> and identity. I incorporate the endless rhythm of this landscape through the repetition of generic, silhouetted house forms and dense groupings of architectural elements to highlight how one individual space can no longer be distinguished from another. The repetition of indistinguishable architectural and decorative elements mirrors the monotonous nature of the suburban terrain. These architectural components have become so redundant that {{they are part of the}} natural landscape. This replication of housing contradicts the desire to achieve a unique identity by providing a false sense of individuality through predetermined design choices such as color palettes and exterior ornamentation. These superficial elements are limited to a select group of architectural enhancements that become a standard for housing developments. The over-production of this typology becomes so commonplace that it becomes both the architectural standard for many communities and the only option for new homeownership.

The Italian Aurelio Peccei, promoted as member of the “Club di Roma”, contributed to the drafting of the known report “I limiti dello sviluppo” Limits to growth published in 1972. It is a report drawn up {{by a group of}} analysts from MIT Cambridge who modeled the limits to the environmental systems’ of the planet to supporting our social-economic system. Today in Italy, according to various sources, we have 130 million rooms. We have more than five million apartments that are not inhabited. A lot of industrial areas are abandoned, many public facilities such as hospitals or schools are disused, a great number of railway and road infrastructures is not fully used or sits abandoned. The Italian urban and territorial planning system {{has not been able to}} harness territorial development effectively in the past decades. Our fragile territory has been subject to serious damage because of climate change – storms, fires, floods, land-slides - as well as earthquakes. At the same time, valuable farming and wildlife land is being lost to further expansion of urban areas. We share the opinion of those who think it is necessary to slow down or reduce to zero soil and <b>landscape</b> <b>consumption</b> in Italy. We must better mitigate factors which fuel global warming, as well as start adapting to whatever climate change-related events will affect us in the future, regardless of our (belated) efforts at mitigation. This choice means determination to build a strong model of sustainable development, already suggested by the European Union, by outlining some environmental *, energy and industrial ** policies. As concerns landscape, territorial and urban systems, we need to go beyond the already established paradigm of sustainable city – the city that is ‘easy on the nature’ – towards the idea, and urgent application, of a city which is able to withstand the ‘nature’s revenge’. Towards that end, two emerging concepts appear useful and effective - smart city and resilient city. The concept of smart city*** was developed around 2000 to refer to the possibility of using ICT tools in order to improve the overall efficiency of urban areas. The concept initially targeted streamlining of urban and territorial systems concerning energy, mobility and housing systems. But now it also promoted – and already implemented – as a way to improve the overall environmental efficiency of the entire urban system. The next stage is likely to be advancing cities, and the individual constituent elements in them, towards greater self-sufficiency too. This is in line with one of the core principles of urban resilience – reducing (or eliminate, when possible) all types of dependency...|$|E

This paper examines how cultural, economic and political aspects of globalization interact with processes of urbanization in less developed country (LDC) cities to create new <b>landscapes</b> of housing <b>consumption.</b> Drawing evidence from the current literature, the paper demonstrates that globalization processes influence the housing preferences and housing consumption decisions of a small yet growing, middle-income segment of LDC urban residents. These changes lead to patterns of urban resource use akin to those associated with suburbanization and suburban sprawl in more developed countries (MDC), particularly the USA. In effect, these changes amount to the manifest export of the American Dream - the ideal of homeownership of a single-family house in a suburban area - to LDC cities. A critical element of this process explored in the paper is how this suburban ideal is set down within each city context. This placement is presented {{as the result of}} global-, national- and local-level drivers. The emergence of <b>consumption</b> <b>landscapes</b> raises critical questions about the environmental and social sustainability of globalization, as LDC residents increasingly emulate the highly resource-consumptive, energy-intensive and exclusionary lifestyles currently practised by MDC suburbanites.

40|$|Urban {{landscape}} {{offers an}} effective means to improve local capability for regional and global competitions. Along with the growing power of cultural economy, urban landscape with unique identity is increasingly repackaged as venue for cultural, particularly visual, consumption. At the same time, globally oriented cities compete with one another by promoting arts districts. In this context, arts districts have become a global urban phenomenon, contributing significantly to agglomerate cultural consumption activities. For the past two decades, arts districts in Beijing have gained rapid increase in terms of locations and spatial patterns. However,they were called ‘artist villages’ which represent their undergrounded statues in the early 1990 s. It was not until 2000 s {{that some of them}} were soon commercialized with international galleries, trendy restaurants, caf?s and night clubs appearing on the scene. These underground settlements were eventually recognized as “creative clusters” by the government. Speculative developers have seized the opportunity to investigate arts districts along with the growing importance of cultural economy. Compared with western cases, Beijing’s arts districts merely took less than 20 years to shift from its isolated state to a tremendously popular one among local citizens and foreign visitors. Under this specific circumstance, the mechanism that contributes to such transformation has yet to be explored. Knowledge in this field in China is still on the stage of adopting the western model with a strong passion for explaining their economic capability. Whereas, in order to explore the relation between production <b>landscape</b> and <b>consumption</b> <b>landscape,</b> there is need to conduct a critical investigation for arts districts as a cultural spatial product in a social process. In light of the scenario given above, the study aims to examine the role of place identity in producing Beijing’s arts districts with special focus placed on their branding strategy. The first step of the study is to review the overall development process of Beijing’s arts districts to identify specific background conditions and analyze their development characteristics. In the given urban context, two case studies of Factory 798 and Jiuchang are carried out, which are designed to achieve the research objectives. The two cases display different patterns of development mode. However, according to the study findings, similarities between them can be explored. Based on the distinctive image that the cases create, the study arrives at a conclusion that the role of place identity is evident in forming the characteristic of the consumption pattern. The significance of place identity is recognized for lending its value to Beijing’s arts districts. Further, from production <b>landscape</b> to <b>consumption</b> <b>landscape,</b> the commodification process of arts districts is ineffective without the interplay of social actors. published_or_final_versionArchitectureMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

A theoretical framework that combines retailing geography, the study of the urban form, and the study of everyday practices is proposed. The research posits that the development of a street's retail landscape is an important expression of an emerging culture of mass consumption and leisure; through this research I seek to better understand how such a new reality impacts the daily routine of the residents of Beijing who use the local commercial streets. Drawing on abundant data derived from varied empirical procedures, this study documents and interprets the physical and social manifestations pertaining to seven local commercial streets. The social practices and perceptions of groups of users are investigated through questionnaires, interviews, and observations. I discuss how, through their daily interactions with the built environment, lay urban dwellers create space, while collectively conferring meaning to otherwise inert artefacts.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the proliferation of holiday homes, particularly in remote and isolated areas, has provoked widespread concern regarding {{the fate of the}} indigenous rural community. The central concern of this thesis is to investigate how the rural community is adapting to the presence of the outsider as both a temporary and permanent resident, by examining the interaction between local and outsider resident {{in order to get a}} sense of the dynamics involved in the restructuring of the rural community. The study approached this central problematic, by looking at how rural space is being socially constructed as a result of this interaction, and how rural space is determining the dynamic involved in this interaction. The two rural villages which were chosen for this study, are located in regions of unique cultural and historical interest: Dunfarraig in the Burren region in the west of Ireland, and Gireux in the Cathar region in the south of France. Despite their empirical similarities, these villages have demonstrated quite different responses to the presence of the outsider, which has become apparent through a comparative analysis of the way in which concepts such as ‘community membership’ are played out in either context. The central findings of this research, has been to show how the landscapes of Dunfarraig and Gireux are being symbolically constructed as ‘suburban’ through the social practices of its residents, taking an abstract or social form in the French context, and a material form in the Irish context. Further, how these practices are appealing to a vocabulary of ‘suburbia’, located in the suburban imaginary of residents. These findings of ‘suburbia’ are premised on the theory that residents are constructing a view of the physical <b>landscape</b> for private <b>consumption</b> in the Irish context, and a view of the social <b>landscape,</b> for private <b>consumption</b> in the French context. However, the thesis ultimately defends the rural character of these two villages, maintaining that this interpretation of the ‘suburban imaginary’ is one way of understanding the complexity of these social practices...|$|R

The analysis draws upon an empirical study carried out in a gentrifying area in Vancouver, the Downtown Eastside, which has Canada’s largest community of concentrated urban poor. The empirical material consists of data collected by the author, {{with an emphasis on}} site observations, attendance on public planning and community meetings and interviews. The study focuses on the street and the sidewalk as public space and discusses these spaces through the lens of theory on gentrification and urban justice. The study shows that gentrification has an impact on the street life and the physical space of the study area. The Vancouver Downtown Eastside is interpreted as a socially and economical problematic area, and the City of Vancouver attempts to carry through changes according to the concept of “revitalization without displacement”, something which this study confirms can be hard to implement successfully. Further, this thesis argues the importance for landscape architects and planners to take on an active role in creating more just and diverse cities, where segregation between socio-economic groups attempts to be avoided.

40|$|Time {{frames are}} vital {{determinants}} in carrying capacity assessment modelling, but their quantification can be problematic. A strictly literal definition of sustainable carrying capacity implies calculating {{the maximum number}} of people a landscape can support in perpetuity. However, the concept of perpetuity, representing infinite time, renders the concept impractical, if not impossible, to quantify; so a more pragmatic approach can be to perform assessments for a range of time frames in order to establish potential trends. One Australian-orientated model, the Carrying Capacity Dashboard, was developed to begin exploring temporal flexibility in resource-based carrying capacity modelling. It offers users the ability to choose projected time frames of between one and 150 years for a variety of <b>landscape</b> scales and <b>consumption</b> patterns. Generally, the longer time frames resulted in reduced carrying capacities. One reason for this result is that a completely self-sufficient population would need to match its consumption and hence its size to the anticipated least productive year within any given time frame; and as projected time periods increase, the likelihood of encountering more extreme climatic conditions with smaller yields increases...|$|R

To these activities we can add those taking place in virtual communities of consumption, online shops, brand websites, and online auction houses that together amount to a vast new <b>landscape</b> of <b>consumption.</b> Digital virtual consumption motivates concatenated practices which produce meaningful experience for their users as well as market opportunities to profit from them. Consumers create and maintain elaborate wish lists, engaging with simulations of brands on websites and in videogames, coveting items for use in online games and even spending ‘real’ money on these, undertaking entrepreneurial activity in virtual worlds, conjuring nostalgia via online auctions, engaging in playful consumption in other new retail formats, writing reviews of products {{as part of the}} consumption experience, engaging in online activist activities, and many other emerging behaviors. Analyses of consumption in the digital virtual realm are however limited. This collection brings together experienced researchers from the fields of consumer research, digital games, and virtual worlds to provide conceptual and empirical work that helps us understand these new and significant consumer activities. Online communities negotiate the ‘correct’ use of goods and offer technical advice, consumers develop new products, individuals create and distribute their own promotional material for their favorite brands, and entrepreneurial consumers marketing and selling their own products online. Here we may see a blurring of consumption and production, or work and leisure activity that requires further thought about what makes it meaningful for individuals. The chapters in this volume take stock of the emergence and likely importance of digital virtual consumption for consumer culture, including a review of both new and existing conceptual and methodological tools as well as a resource of key examples and analyses of practices. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In {{the years}} after WWII the Baltic Sea Area {{developed}} into an area strongly divided between East and West. Because of the tensions between the blocs, the coastal areas where strongly militarized and prepared for war. The new political situation after 1989 propelled an international military disarmament and closing down of bases, training areas around Europe. Since the Baltic Sea Area {{was one of the}} heaviest militarized part of Europe the question of disarmament here is of particularly great economic, social and cultural importance. This study is about the post-military landscape in the Baltic Sea Area with examples from Dejevo on the Estonian island Saaremaa, Dranske on the (East) German island Rügen and Fårösund on the Swedish island Gotland. The aim of this thesis is to shed light on the process where the military landscape of the Cold War is transformed in order to be incorporated in the macro-regional endeavors for unity in the new Europe. I want to analyze the implications that planning visions have on the everyday life of people. A following aim is to shed light on the challenges that urban planning has to face in this transformation. Three research questions frame the study. The first question analyzes the process where the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea {{after the end of the}} Cold War are disarmed and transformed, from a landscape of production of military services and objects into a <b>landscape</b> of <b>consumption</b> for recreation and tourism. The second question takes its point of departure in the relation between planning visions and everyday life. The third question concerns the matter of the past and analyzes what aspects of the military landscape are emphasized respectively pushed aside in the transformation into post-military landscape. The study is based on interviews with inhabitants and local planners as well as macro-regional and local planning documents, articles and photographs...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I endorse and put forward {{the idea that}} space is a {{practical}} category; that is, not a place or setting where we stand and do things, not even - or not solely - somewhere that can be variously signified by our actions and therefore symbolically constructed or evoked, but an action itself. Space, I contend, {{is something that we}} do or that other people or even things do. The argument that I hold is that we create spaces as we cope with the world that we live in. Our act of ‘coping’ is a spatial act, a mode of comportment through which we lay out what we want or do not want to do with and in the world. Space is but another mode of expressing agency, another way to bestow, obtain or elicit meanings from the world. In this context, I prefer to speak of space as a capacity: an instrument and idiom that we use to obtain things. This quality of space brings forth and illuminates its inherent political dimension. I support this reading of space on an ethnographic account of the dimensions through which urban space in the Chilean city of Antofagasta is constructed; specifically, the socio-spatial rhythms through which ideas about the house, the street and certain <b>landscapes</b> of <b>consumption</b> - a high street, a number of supermarkets, a shopping centre, a boulevard, a street market - are given social form. The ethnography shows the local people to refer their spatiality to the flow of social relationships and not to the material setting of the places they occupy (people talking of doing things somewhere rather than going somewhere to do something). My argument is that, in this light, space, far from a transparent medium, becomes the idiom or dimension through which certain people effect their agency. Peer reviewe...|$|R
30|$|Sedimentary {{records of}} fire {{occurrence}} have expanded {{our understanding of}} fire regimes beyond the observable record and the scope of physical evidence identified by dendroecology. These records have also contributed {{to our understanding of}} fire regimes in ecosystems (e.g. rainforests, grasslands) where previous knowledge of fire frequency was limited (Long et al. 1998, Whitlock and Larsen 2001, Duffin 2008, Walsh et al. 2008, Conedera et al. 2009, Brunelle et al. 2010). Recent analyses of fire histories based on sedimentary charcoal have expanded the interpretation of these data to include some metrics of fire biomass consumption (Duffin 2008, Marlon et al. 2008, Higuera et al. 2009, Marlon et al. 2009). For example, Duffin (2008) reported that increased fire intensity was associated with greater precipitation and resulted in greater herbaceous pollen abundance and charcoal abundance in African savanna lakes. Marlon et al. (2009) showed changes in charcoal abundance during the transition {{into and out of the}} Younger Dryas chronozone, 13 ka and 11.5 ka before present (ka BP). They inferred that abrupt climate change left a large amount of weakened or dead biomass on the <b>landscape</b> available for <b>consumption</b> by subsequent fire events.|$|R
40|$|Another Space {{is a short}} ethnographic {{film about}} artist Antony Gormley‟s {{installation}} „Another Place ‟ at Crosby Beach north of Liverpool. The visuals, shot {{on a visit to}} the beach in Easter 2009, are cut to a mosaic of voices drawn from interviews conducted with visitors to the beach. Respondents are asked what the artwork means to them and what feelings and emotions it evokes. This article, written as an accompaniment to the film, as well as to Hazel Andrew‟s study published in the edited volume Liminal Landscapes: Travel, Experience, and Spaces In-between (2012), provides an auto-ethnographic reflection on the installation and beachscape as a liminal space. As a marked landscape – the „site of artist Antony Gormley‟s installation Another Place ‟ – by what measure is it possible to stake out the parameters that set Crosby beach apart from more routine <b>landscapes</b> of everyday <b>consumption</b> and spectacle? What makes it „another place ‟ as distinct from, say, (just) „another space‟? Gleaning the urban littoral that defines this stretch of the Mersey estuary, the film and article explore an experiential framework by which to gauge the performative status of the beach as a liminal landscape...|$|R
