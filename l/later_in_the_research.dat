40|$|As a {{relatively}} new discipline Security Science is searching for academic acceptance very often combining established hard science approaches with those of Social Science and Humanities. Methodologies {{need to be developed}} to equip the discipline to conduct more varied research. One such method is the use of the case study approach, as it allows multiple inputs {{from a variety of sources}} to build up the research into a central review, allowing conclusions and recommendations to be drawn from the data. Though relatively common in the business world for conducting reports, this has not hitherto been the position in academia The objective of this speculative paper develops a process used for research and seeks to open a debate as to the importance of case studies in the security field; the paper argues that it is an underutilised research paradigm. The merits of using the case study structure will be discussed, including the debate over positivism and constructivism, which will then lead on to a potential analytical method called Interpretative Phenomological Analysis (IPA); used predominately in ethnographical studies. The importance of using a pilot study before proceeding to the full study is also suggested to avoid costly mistakes <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research...</b>|$|E
40|$|Given {{the current}} {{emphasis}} on the diligent management of research data, it is almost self-evident that curation should be a fundamental aspect of the research practice in the chemical sciences. An essential ingredient in the curation process is metadata: descriptive information and classification labels that group related items, provide context and facilitate the reuse of specified research outputs. In our view, {{the single most important}} function of metadata is to capture context. Problems can and do arise <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> cycle if researchers do not capture the correct context as they record their experiments and acquire their data, so curation is naturally most effective when researchers capture metadata at source. However, researchers perceive curation as a burden, raising a range of issues that we examine generically and with regard specifically to the challenges that the burden of creation presents in the chemical sciences. We examine the significance of training in data management and explore the potential role for librarians. We also consider the issues relating to the deployment of controlled vocabularies. We conclude with the view that chemists have yet {{to take full advantage of}} the extra opportunities created by effective curation, emphasising the importance of capturing contextual information at the earliest possible stage: at source...|$|E

40|$|This article {{questions}} the methodological convention {{in the social}} sciences that the interviewer must never disagree with a respondent in qualitative research. The issue arose during research on the British Serbian community when some participants sought to justify, exculpate or reject Serbian liability for atrocity. My initial response not to demur but to simply move onto the next question morally tainted the research, as it seemed to collud in a denial of Serbian responsibility for atrocity in an understanding of war (1991 - 99) in which the Serbs were always the victim. I discuss, through an extended excerpt from an interview conducted <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research,</b> my attempt to challenge respondents over this claim. I set the moral and methodological case to object to the denial of atrocity against the practical dangers present in doing so: the risk of a loosing track of the spine of a prepared script of questions as a fruitless argument develops and the intricacies of the subject matter are exposed. But I also allow for an interpretation that would suggest that my response was altogether too cautious. My conclusion, such as one can make one about such a complex matter, is that to object in such a kind of instance is legitimate. Serbs, interview, atrocity, denial, argument, ethics. ...|$|E
40|$|Using videotaped data as {{the sole}} source for a study {{produces}} unique challenges {{that have not been}} fully addressed in the literature. Our particular interest was the analysis of videotaped data in which the scene–that captured within the frame–is the sole source of data. The researcher does not have access to interviews or other interpretive data to provide the participants' perspective, therefore analysis relies on the actions of the participants as they occurred. When recording video data in this manner, nothing is manipulated or staged for the recording. The challenge for the researcher is to describe and to analyze the scene as it stands. How does one make sense of such data? And how can one be assured that the research interpretation is correct? We argue here that the level and accuracy of interpretation possible depends on the context–on what is being studied, and what is known about the topic of interest. In this section, we will address issues inherent in analysis of sole source videotaped data, with particular attention to the selection and use of a scaffold for analysis. The example that we use is a study that came <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> program: a secondary analysis of videotaped data to explore nurse-patient-family interactions in a trauma-resuscitation room of the Emergency Department (Morse & Pooler, 2002) ...|$|E
40|$|Geosynthetics, in {{the form}} of three {{dimensional}} geocell mattresses has emerged as a promising technique to improve the performance of foundations. This study pertains {{to the development of a}} mathematical formulation to predict the behaviour of footings (Strip and Circular footings) resting on geocell reinforced granular layer overlying soft soil. To obtain the approximate behaviour of the geocell reinforced system contact pressure distribution of the geocell reinforced bed was considered. The approach based on contact pressure distribution is demonstrative in understanding the pattern of bearing capacity improvement but for exact predictions of the same, numerical investigations using foundation models or experimental studies have to be conducted. Pasternak model was used to represent the geocell reinforced-footing system as it considers the material properties of geocell - subsoil system. Linear and nonlinear responses were considered to account for the behaviour at low and high settlements respectively. The predictions of the Pasternak model were found to hold good for lower range of settlements. The necessity of improvement of the model was understood since Pasternak model doesn’t account for the confining stresses that act on the geocell system from which it derives its major strength. Hence, the stress dependent behaviour was also analyzed <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> to fully understand the behaviour of geocell reinforced systems. To check the efficiency and applicability of the proposed models the results were validated in several ways (Theoretical, numerical, experimental validation) which indicated good agreement...|$|E

Here the idea of the functional region as a unit in the space-of-places is considered. In each spatial unit special consideration needs to be directed towards the regulation of three elements which should be observable and controllable: labour, land and money. The aim is to construct a model which enables regional authorities and managers of global supply chains to analyse interactions, regulate the space-of-flows, support decisions in the space-of-places and forecast the interactions between the space-of-flows and the space-of-places, but especially to evaluate the impact of supply chain perturbations regarding ICT development and policies in the space-of-places. Here the net present value (NPV) of all activities in a global supply chain is the criterion function. Therefore, the paper shows that a more permanent study of interactions between the supply chain flows (flow of items, information and financial flows) and land use in the space-of-places could support a more sustainable economic growth, while ICT makes it more successful...|$|E
40|$|Current micro-scale {{electronics}} {{technology has}} been approaching rapidly towards its technological limit. This has shifted the focus towards nano-scale technology in recent years. More and more researchers around the globe are working in pursuit of bringing nano-scale technology into mainstream. The research carried out here is a small step towards a similar goal. The remarkable optical properties exhibited by certain nano-scale structures are {{in stark contrast to}} their bulk form and this provides the basis for this research. Two kinds of nanostructures are developed and investigated for their optical properties. One of these is nanofibers processed from a polymer known as polyaniline (PANI). The focus {{of this study is to}} investigate its optical and conductive properties under different conditions of doping environments, temperature and polymerization conditions. Optical characterization technique such as UV-Visible spectroscopy is developed to carry out the investigation. The developed nanofibers have been demonstrated to possess optical and conductive properties to be dependent on doping variables. Study of these optical properties could prove very useful in the development of electrochromic devices and gas sensors. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research,</b> UV-Visible spectroscopy has been improved into a low cost Raman spectroscopy setup which is validated by experimentation carried out on some samples. The second type of nano-structure developed and investigated, is an array of nanoparticles of noble metals such as gold and silver. Such an array is shown to exhibit a phenomenon called plasmon resonance effect when excited by light. UV-Visible spectroscopy technique is utilized to investigate this effect for metal nano-arrays. A biologically nano-structured surface (wing of an insect called cicada) is used as the substrate for the fabrication of metal array. A serious attempt has also been made to do &# 039;Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) &# 039;, making use of the metal nano-array developed.

40|$|This text aims {{to place}} nonhuman animals {{at the core}} of urban space and history to provide an insight into the life and {{materiality}} of dogs in Stockholm 1824 - 1920. The theoretical possibilities of more-than-human enquiries into history are discussed along with non-human animals as historical beings together with humans creating a common history (Ingold 2000, Whatmore 2002). Moreover nonhuman animals are discussed and incorporated in an exploration into using what is here discussed as a multispecies narrative and used as an analytical tool to try to avoid the pitfalls of representationalism. It is also introduced as a possible new methodology to approaching the urban landscape within the field of environmental history. The main empirical material of dogs in nineteenth century Stockholm are records from the city dog pound along with records of dog tax and rabies. Other than archive material a wide range of material contemporary to the research period such as art, photography and literature is used as part of a broad exploration of nonhuman animals as integral in materiality of Stockholm and as historical beings. Findings of the study confirm that dogs and other nonhuman animals hugely impacted both the spatial structure and social space of Stockholm and that this impact transformed over the research period defined by societal changes. More specifically the study shows that dogs played an important role as free roaming scavengers and were for this reason accepted {{as an integral part of}} the city in the nineteenth century in Stockholm. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> period when the city became more regulated this role started to change and dogs were not accepted loose on the streets to the same degree and transformed into pets and symbols of social mobility and class.

Delivering electric power from the most economical source through fewest and shortest transmission lines to customers frequently increases the stress on the system and prevents it from maintaining its stability. Events like loss of transmission equipment and phase to ground faults can force the system to cross its stability limits by causing the generators to lose their synchronism. Therefore, a helpful solution is detection of these dynamic events and prediction of instability. Decision Trees (DTs) were used as a pattern recognition tool in this thesis. Based on training data, DT generated rules for detecting event, predicting loss of synchronism, and selecting stabilizing control.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a qualitative enquiry into {{the experiences of}} families visiting an adult intensive care unit (ICU) during a critical illness of a family member and nurses’ perceptions of families in this environment. A Grounded Theory approach was taken. Nine families (12 adults, 12 young people) with a family member in intensive care and twenty intensive care nurses in five focus groups contributed their experiences to the study through group interviews. Families described the admission of a family member as a traumatic event. The core experiences of families which emerged in the study revolved around uncertainty. Drawing on Davis’ (1963 / 1991, 1966) concepts of ‘clinical uncertainty’ and ‘functional uncertainty’ a number of strategies families and young people developed {{in dealing with the}} situation were identified. ‘Clinical uncertainty’ captures the unknown and unknowable aspects of critical illness. The ‘Functional uncertainty’ category emerged <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> process and brings to light management of information disclosure for functional gain as a communication strategy. Functional uncertainty was identified in communications between nurses and families and between parents and children within families. Moreover, young people used the same ‘functional uncertainty’ strategy when disclosing information to peers within the school environment. ‘Keeping normality in life’ and ‘fishing for information’ and the associated strategies were identified as direct responses of young people to clinical and functional uncertainty. The strategies identified provide new insights into how young people process a critical illness event in their families. This emphasises the importance of listening to young people’s voices and the need to include young people in future studies. ‘Nursing in public’ emerged as an overarching theme within the data from nurses’ interviews. The contrasting interests of nurses and families in the context of critical illness became evident when open visiting policies were discussed. The promotion by policy makers and nursing scholars of a patient centred health care service and thus the implicit integration of families into care challenges nurses to adapt their working practices. Whilst this study provides evidence for the importance of integrating families into care it also shows the needs of nurses are in danger of being marginalised. Respecting the needs of families and nurses the question becomes how best to balance the competing needs of both groups. It is suggested that a ‘partnership in care’ approach which is firmly based on negotiations between nurses and families under the leadership of nurses will allow for the emergence of family care in intensive care, to the benefit of patients, families and nurses.

40|$|The Department {{of organic}} {{chemistry}} {{was founded on}} October 1 st, 1922 {{as part of the}} Chemical Engineering Department of the High Technical School in Zagreb. The first-appointed professor of organic chemistry was Ivan Marek, formerly the professor at the School of Trade in Zagreb. The High Technical School with all its departments was soon (1926 / 27) incorporated into the University of Zagreb and became the nucleus of the Technical Faculty. The management of the faculty was fully aware of the necessity to engage the best scientists in the field as faculty professors. As far as organic chemistry was concerned, there was no better choice in the mid 1930 's, than to invite young but already recognized organic chemist Dr. Vladimir Prelog to join the staff and to succeed professor Marek, who retired in 1935. Dr. Prelog did not hesitate to accept the invitation and was eager to continue his scientific work in an academic laboratory in Zagreb. At the time of the invitation, Dr. Prelog was engaged in a small laboratory synthesizing special samples of rare chemicals to be sold through the chemical store "Dřiza" in Prague. There he was provided the modest opportunity to carry on his own research, and together with Rudolf Lukeš and Emil Votoček, published a number of papers concerning organic synthesis and chemistry of natural products. Elected in Zagreb for the lectureship of the assistant professor in organic chemistry, Prelog started teaching as early as in the summer semester of 1934 / 35. The ingenious and bright lecturing of young professor Prelog inspired his students, and many of them were attracted to organic chemistry. On the other hand, the working conditions in the disposable laboratory of the Organic Chemistry Department were too modest to accept a number of students. The budget was so small that it only covered tuition, while there was no research fund at the faculty. Luckily, Dr. Prelog did not hesitate to accept an offer for scientific co-operation from the small but prosperous pharmaceutical company "Kaštel" in Zagreb. On behalf of the agreement, Prelog and his department obtained funds to fit up the laboratory and to start very prosperous research in the synthesis and studies of pharmaceutically interesting compounds. With his assistants, students and other collaborators, Prelog started research of cinchona bark alkaloids, preferentially oriented to the synthesis of quinine. For example, Prelog's method of double intramolecular alkylation to synthetize the quinuclidine moiety of quinine was patented by "Kaštel". With R. Seiwerth he developed the first useful synthesis of adamantane. Prelog's group started research in the field of sulphonamides and commercial success of "Streptazole" stimulated the development of the research laboratories within "Kaštel". The collaboration in the research continued in fields of other chemotherapeutics, analeptics, spasmolitics, barbiturates etc. Within the period 1935 - 1941, Prelog published 48 scientific papers and 8 patents. In less than seven years, his results enormously influenced the entire organic chemistry in Zagreb till nowadays. Under the confused and uncertain circumstances caused by the beginning of World War II, Prelog left Zagreb in 1941 and continued his extraordinary scientific career at the ETH in Zürich. During the war (1942 - 1945) the tuition and the Department were run by Dr. Rativoj Seiwerth, former collaborator and first assistant to V. Prelog. In almost unbelievable conditions, the young assistant, then assistant professor (since January 1943), R. Seiwerth fully succeeded in continuing most activities founded by Professor Prelog. After the war (1945), R. Seiwerth was forced to resign. Nevertheless, soon after R. Seiwerth continued his research work, firstly in the Institute for Industrial Research in Zagreb (1946 - 1952), and <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Research</b> Institute of "Pliva" in Zagreb. He retired in 1980. In post-war conditions (1945 / 46), the activity of the Technical Faculty and its Organic Chemistry Department was restored. The tuition and leading of the Department were offered to Dr. Viktor Hahn, former student and Prelog's collaborator since 1936. The influence of Professor V. Hahn {{on the development of the}} Technical Faculty and the Department of Organic Chemistry in the period 1945 - 1970 (V. Hahn ceased on May 17, 1970) was enormous.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{exploratory}} research examined {{the potential for}} online social networks to provide the context for humans to anthropomorphize companies {{in a way that}} leads to new considerations of electronic word-of-mouth communication (eWOM); specifically, the possibility for organizations to be the initiator of the communication. Traditional models of word-of-mouth communication show individuals as the starting point for word-of-mouth communication but online social networks have created an environment in which humans may respond to organizations in social ways and engage an organization in communication previously considered to be restricted to human-to-human interaction. The impact of group status, loneliness, trust, credibility, interpersonal influence, and behavioral cues in social situations were considered as important influences in this new view of eWOM. Two exploratory surveys (Study 1), two experiments (Study 2 (Forced Like) 2 ̆ 6 Study 3) and content analysis (Study 4) were the primary tools of investigation. The two exploratory surveys involved questions related to Facebook use, interaction with individuals and firms on Facebook, and questions related to the importance of brand influence. Information from the exploratory surveys was used to create appropriate experimental conditions <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research.</b> For example, it was determined that a fictional travel firm should create less of a confounding impact on the experiments because travel firms were perceived as having a lower level of brand influence during the exploratory surveys. The two experiments conducted in Study 2 and Study 3 were nearly identical in that both studies involved a 2 x 2 between subjects design with random assignment of participants to one of the four conditions. Both studies involved the independent variables of group status (in-group or out-group) and level of positive social communication (high or low). Additionally, both studies involved the same questions related to a fictional travel firm 2 ̆ 7 s Facebook page. Participants responses to questions related to anthropomorphism, word-of-mouth communication, loneliness, need for social cues and general Facebook use. The difference between Study 2 and Study was that Study 2 involved a Forced Liking component. That is, subjects in Study 2 in the in-group status conditions were directed to click on the Like button for the travel firm 2 ̆ 7 s Facebook page whereas participants in Study 3 who were in the in-group conditions were only asked to imagine having clicked on the Like button on the travel firm 2 ̆ 7 s Facebook page. Study 2 is referred to hereafter in this document as Study 2 (Forced Like). The findings of the research show a variety of results. It was expected that increased positive social communication between organizations and others within Facebook would generate social responses from subjects and this was supported in experimental Study 2 (Forced Like) (Forced Like) but not in Study 3. Group status was not found to increase anthropomorphism in either study but both studies showed significant correlation between individuals who did anthropomorphize an organization in an online social network and an interest in word-of-mouth communication. While increases in positive social communication did lead to significant increases in trust of an organization by individuals in Study 2 (Forced Like) such increases were not found in Study 3. Neither study found support for the idea that individuals forming a relationship with an organization in an online social network will cause an increase in the willingness to engage in word-of-mouth communication. Individuals self-reporting as more lonely were expected to anthropomorphize more and this was supported in Study 2 (Forced Like) but not in Study 3. Individuals reporting a higher reliance on interpersonal influence in consumer decision making situations were expected to be more likely to anthropomorphize a business in an online social network and this was supported in Study 3 but not in Study 2 (Forced Like). It was also predicted that subjects with a higher self-reported need for behavior cues would also be more likely to anthropomorphize and while this was not supported in Study 3 there was significant support in Study 2 (Forced Like). Finally, the level of trust subjects had for companies Liked on Facebook prior to the study was expected to show a correlation to the likelihood to anthropomorphize a business in the experiments. This was supported in Study 3 but not in Study 2 (Forced Like). Content analysis conducted through unobtrusive observational analysis resulted in a number of interesting possible themes related to anthropomorphic responses to organizations by Facebook users. Anthropomorphic themes involved social motivation, effectance motivation and elicited agent knowledge. Additionally, the Content analysis seemed to uncover themes involving word-of-mouth communication within the online social network including themes involving self-disclosure and trust. Overall, the results for this {{exploratory research}} provide direction for future research related a new model of word-of-mouth communication within online social networks although there are numerous lingering questions regarding the reasons for differing results in several important parts of the experiments...|$|E

Prvi {{profesor}} organske kemije, dr. Ivan Marek, djelovao je najprije u sklopu Zavoda za analitičku i fizikalnu kemiju. Dodatni impuls razvoju dalo je osamostaljivanje Zavoda za organsku kemiju 1922. godine, no znanstveni rad je zadržao orijentaciju ka analitici. Prekretnicu u nastavi i znanstvenom radu zavoda nakon umirovljenja I. Mareka, predstavlja dolazak u Zagreb kasnijeg nobelovca dr. Vladimira Preloga. Presudno je bilo unošenje, tada u svijetu opće prihvaćene orijentacije na organsku sintezu. V. Prelog je taj zaokret pretvorio u (kako danas možemo reći) "zlatno doba" organske kemije na našem fakultetu. Nepunih sedam godina (1935. - 1941.) njegova djelovanja u Zagrebu, sudbinski je utjecalo ne samo na današnji Zavod za organsku kemiju FKIT-a nego i na cjelokupnu hrvatsku kemijsku znanost, osobito u području organske kemije. Po izbijanju drugog svjetskog rata, profesor Prelog odlazi u Zürich, gdje na ETH nastavlja svoju fascinantnu karijeru. U Zagreb se nije vratio ni po svršetku rata, no njegova stalna pomoć i blagotvorni utjecaj ostavili susvoj trag do danas. Tijekom rata (1942. - 1945.) nastavu organske kemije i Zavod za organsku kemiju vodio je dr. Rativoj Seiwerth, višegodišnji suradnik i prvi asistent V. Preloga. U gotovo nevjerojatnim uvjetima, mladi asistent i zatim (od siječnja 1943.) docent, R. Seiwerth uspješno nastavlja večinu djelatnosti koje je uspostavio V. Prelog. Po svršetku rata 1945. godine, R. Seiwert je bio prisiljen odstupiti. Ipak, poslije kratkog vremena R. Seiwerth nastavlja sa svojim znanstveno-istraživačkim radom. Do 1952. djeluje u Institutu za industrijska istraživanja, a od 1952. do svog umirovljenja 1980. godine u Istraživačkom institutu farmaceutske tvrtke "Pliva". U poslijeratnim uvjetima (1945. / 46.) djelatnost Tehničkog fakulteta i njegova Zavoda za organsku kemiju bila je obnovljena. Za nastavnika i predstojnika zavoda pozvan je dr. Viktor Hahn, raniji student profesora V. Preloga i njegov suradnik od 1936. godine. Utjecaj profesora Hahna na razvoj Tehničkog fakulteta i Zavoda za organsku kemiju bio je presudan u razdoblju 1945. - 1970. ali prerana smrt (17. svibnja, 1970.) prekinula je njegov vrlo uspješan rad. Zahvaljujući odlično organiziranoj nastavi i znanstveno-istraživačkom radu, njegovi studenti i suradnici uspješno su nastavili s tim djelatnostima sve do današnjih dana. The Department {{of organic}} chemistry {{was founded on}} October 1 st, 1922 {{as part of the}} Chemical Engineering Department of the High Technical School in Zagreb. The first-appointed professor of organic chemistry was Ivan Marek, formerly the professor at the School of Trade in Zagreb. The High Technical School with all its departments was soon (1926 / 27) incorporated into the University of Zagreb and became the nucleus of the Technical Faculty. The management of the faculty was fully aware of the necessity to engage the best scientists in the field as faculty professors. As far as organic chemistry was concerned, there was no better choice in the mid 19302 ̆ 7 s, than to invite young but already recognized organic chemist Dr. Vladimir Prelog to join the staff and to succeed professor Marek, who retired in 1935. Dr. Prelog did not hesitate to accept the invitation and was eager to continue his scientific work in an academic laboratory in Zagreb. At the time of the invitation, Dr. Prelog was engaged in a small laboratory synthesizing special samples of rare chemicals to be sold through the chemical store "Dřiza" in Prague. There he was provided the modest opportunity to carry on his own research, and together with Rudolf Lukeš and Emil Votoček, published a number of papers concerning organic synthesis and chemistry of natural products. Elected in Zagreb for the lectureship of the assistant professor in organic chemistry, Prelog started teaching as early as in the summer semester of 1934 / 35. The ingenious and bright lecturing of young professor Prelog inspired his students, and many of them were attracted to organic chemistry. On the other hand, the working conditions in the disposable laboratory of the Organic Chemistry Department were too modest to accept a number of students. The budget was so small that it only covered tuition, while there was no research fund at the faculty. Luckily, Dr. Prelog did not hesitate to accept an offer for scientific co-operation from the small but prosperous pharmaceutical company "Kaštel" in Zagreb. On behalf of the agreement, Prelog and his department obtained funds to fit up the laboratory and to start very prosperous research in the synthesis and studies of pharmaceutically interesting compounds. With his assistants, students and other collaborators, Prelog started research of cinchona bark alkaloids, preferentially oriented to the synthesis of quinine. For example, Prelog 2 ̆ 7 s method of double intramolecular alkylation to synthetize the quinuclidine moiety of quinine was patented by "Kaštel". With R. Seiwerth he developed the first useful synthesis of adamantane. Prelog 2 ̆ 7 s group started research in the field of sulphonamides and commercial success of "Streptazole" stimulated the development of the research laboratories within "Kaštel". The collaboration in the research continued in fields of other chemotherapeutics, analeptics, spasmolitics, barbiturates etc. Within the period 1935 - 1941, Prelog published 48 scientific papers and 8 patents. In less than seven years, his results enormously influenced the entire organic chemistry in Zagreb till nowadays. Under the confused and uncertain circumstances caused by the beginning of World War II, Prelog left Zagreb in 1941 and continued his extraordinary scientific career at the ETH in Zürich. During the war (1942 - 1945) the tuition and the Department were run by Dr. Rativoj Seiwerth, former collaborator and first assistant to V. Prelog. In almost unbelievable conditions, the young assistant, then assistant professor (since January 1943), R. Seiwerth fully succeeded in continuing most activities founded by Professor Prelog. After the war (1945), R. Seiwerth was forced to resign. Nevertheless, soon after R. Seiwerth continued his research work, firstly in the Institute for Industrial Research in Zagreb (1946 - 1952), and <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Research</b> Institute of "Pliva" in Zagreb. He retired in 1980. In post-war conditions (1945 / 46), the activity of the Technical Faculty and its Organic Chemistry Department was restored. The tuition and leading of the Department were offered to Dr. Viktor Hahn, former student and Prelog 2 ̆ 7 s collaborator since 1936. The influence of Professor V. Hahn {{on the development of the}} Technical Faculty and the Department of Organic Chemistry in the period 1945 - 1970 (V. Hahn ceased on May 17, 1970) was enormous. Thanks to the well-established research and tuition in the Department, his former students and colleagues have successfully continued the work until today...|$|E
