5000|$|The {{potentially}} <b>lethal</b> <b>protein</b> {{component in}} the crude venom of T. draco is a 105 kDa polypeptide which is called Dracotoxin. The crude venom of T. draco {{has been shown to}} have membrane depolarizing and haemolytic characteristics. Those characteristics could be retraced to said single protein component. The depolarisation effect however could not be explained by well-established approaches. Neither does the depolarisation effect take place through Na+ or K+-channels nor through Na+-K+-ATPase activity.⁠The weever sting is often followed by first ischemic and subsequently hyperemic effects in the tissue surrounding the sting. These effects might be related to the high concentrations of histamines and catecholamines found in the venom.⁠⁠⁠While Church & Hodgson (2002) suggest a cholinesterase activity of the toxin itself, Haavaldsen & Fonnum (1963) interpreted their finding of a high concentration of cholinesterase in the venom as a sign for a cholinergic mechanism in the production of the venom because cholinesterase activity hasn’t yet been described in the venoms of the animal kingdom.⁠ As Russel & Emery (1960) stated, the toxin extract of T. draco has a greyish colour but is clear in its appearance. It is said to have a “fishy taste” and “ammoniacal odor”. The pH value of the extract seems to be 6.78 and is with that slightly sour.⁠The toxin of the closely related lesser weever T. vipera has been shown to contain 5-Hydroxy-Triptamine also called Serotonin but in the toxin of T. draco this finding could not be confirmed⁠.⁠The toxicity of the venom was dependent on the way of extraction. The highest toxicity was measured in live fish which were shock frozen and laired in -70 °C-freezers. Under such conditions the minimal lethal dose for mice was 1.8 μg/g while at least 110 mg could be extracted from an average sized fish.⁠ ...|$|E
40|$|The {{trade-off}} between lifespan {{and reproduction}} is commonly explained by differential allocation of limited resources. Recent {{research has shown that}} the ratio of protein to carbohydrate (P : C) of a fly 2 ̆ 7 s diet mediates the lifespan–reproduction trade-off, with higher P : C diets increasing egg production but decreasing lifespan. To test whether this P : C effect is because of changing allocation strategies (Y-model hypothesis) or detrimental effects of protein ingestion on lifespan (<b>lethal</b> <b>protein</b> hypothesis), we measured lifespan and egg production in Queensland fruit flies varying in reproductive status (mated, virgin and sterilized females, virgin males) that were fed one of 18 diets varying in protein and carbohydrate amounts. The Y-model predicts that for sterilized females and for males, which require little protein for reproduction, there will be no effect of P : C ratio on lifespan; the <b>lethal</b> <b>protein</b> hypothesis predicts that the effect of P : C ratio should be similar in all groups. In support of the <b>lethal</b> <b>protein</b> hypothesis, and counter to the Y-model, the P : C ratio of the ingested diets had similar effects for all groups. We conclude that the trade-off between lifespan {{and reproduction is}} mediated by the detrimental side-effects of protein ingestion on lifespan...|$|E

40|$|Identifying <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins</b> is {{important}} for understanding the intricate mechanism governing life. Researchers {{have shown that the}} lethality of a protein can be computed based on its topological position in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Performance of current approaches has been less than satisfactory as the lethality of a protein is a functional characteristic that cannot be determined solely by network topology. Furthermore, a significant number of <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins</b> have low connectivity in the interaction networks but are overlooked by most current methods. Our work reveals that a protein’s lethality correlates more strongly with its “functional centrality ” than pure topological centrality.

40|$|In the X 174 procapsid, 240 {{external}} scaffolding proteins form a nonquasiequivalent lattice. To {{achieve this}} arrangement, the four structurally unique subunits must undergo position-dependent conformational switches. One switch is mediated by glycine residue 61, which allows a 30 ° kink {{to form in}} -helix 3 in two subunits, whereas the helix is straight {{in the other two}} subunits. No other amino acid should be able to produce a bend of this magnitude. Accordingly, all substitutions for G 61 are nonviable but mutant proteins differ vis-à-vis recessive and dominant phenotypes. As previously reported, amino acid substitutions with side chains larger than valine confer dominant lethal phenotypes. Alone, these mutant proteins appear to have little or no biological activity but rather require the wild-type protein to interact with other structural proteins. Proteins with conservative substitutions for G 61, serine and alanine, have now been characterized. Unlike the dominant <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins,</b> these proteins do not require wild-type subunits to interact with other viral proteins and cause assembly defects reminiscent of those conferred by the <b>lethal</b> dominant <b>proteins</b> in concert with wild-type subunits. Although atomic structures suggest that only a glycine residue can provide the proper torsion angle for assembly, mutants that can productively utilize the altered external scaffolding proteins were isolated, and the mutations were mapped to the coat and internal scaffolding proteins. Thus, the ability to isolate strains that could utilize the single mutant D protein species would not have been predicted from past structural analyses...|$|R
40|$|The MSL {{complex of}} Drosophila upregulates {{transcription}} {{of the male}} X chromosome, equalizing male and female X-linked gene expression. Five male-specific <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins</b> {{and at least one}} of the two noncoding roX RNAs are essential for this process. The roX RNAs are required for the localization of MSL complexes to the X chromosome. Although the mechanisms directing targeting remain speculative, the ratio of MSL protein to roX RNA influences localization of the complex. We examine the transcriptional regulation of the roX genes and show that MSL 2 controls male-specific roX expression in the absence of any other MSL protein. We propose that this mechanism maintains a stable MSL/roX ratio that is favorable for localization of the complex to the X chromosome...|$|R

Paenibacillus dendritiformis produces a <b>lethal</b> <b>protein</b> (Slf) that is able to induce cell death in neighbouring colonies and a phenotypic switch in more distant ones.

Here, we present new crystal structures of DfsB homologues from a variety of bacterial species and a surprising version present in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Adopting a four-helix bundle decorated with a further three short helices within intervening loops, DfsB belongs to a non-enzymatic class of the DinB fold.

In addition to having a common structure of vespid mastoparans, the peptide shows a less hydrophobic sequence at positions 1, 2, 5, 8 and 9.

However, the latter effect was inhibited by 'anti-serotonin' (anti- 5 -hydroxytryptamine) (cyproheptadine), but not by antihistamine (chlorpheniramine).

40|$|Abstract. The Centrality-Lethality Hypothesis {{states that}} {{proteins}} {{with a higher}} degree centrality {{are more likely to}} be <b>lethal,</b> i. e. <b>proteins</b> in-volved inmore interactions aremore likely to cause deathwhen knocked off. This proposition gave rise to several new investigations in which stronger associations were obtained for other centrality measures. Most of this previouswork focused on thewell known protein-interaction net-work of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In a recent study, however, it was found that degree and betweenness of <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins</b> is significantly above av-erage across 20 different protein-interaction networks. Closeness cen-trality, on the other hand, did not perform as well. We replicate this study and show that the reported results are due largely to a misapplication of closeness to disconnected networks. A more suit-able variant actually turns out to be a better predictor than betweenness and degree in most of the networks. Worse, we find that despite the dif-ferent theoretical explanations they offer, the performance ranking of centrality indices varies across networks and depends on the somewhat arbitrary derivation of binary network data from unreliable measure-ments. Our results suggest that the celebrated hypothesis is not sup-ported by data...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} protein interaction {{networks in}} terms of network entropy. This approach suggests a ranking principle, which strongly correlates with elements of functional importance, such as <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins.</b> Our combined analysis of protein interaction networks and functional profiles in single cellular yeast and mulit-cellular worm shows that proteins with large contribution to network entropy are preferentially lethal. While entropy is inherently a dynamical concept, the present analysis incorporates only structural information. Our result therefore {{highlights the importance of}} topological features, which appear as correlates of an underlying dynamical property, and which in turn determine functional traits. We argue that network entropy is a natural extension of previously studied observables, such as pathway multiplicity and centrality. It is also applicable to networks in which the processes can be quantified and therefore serves as a link to study questions of structural and dynamical robustness in a unified way...|$|R

The isolated proteins have masses of 6236 and 6345 Da and are structurally related to short-chain neurotoxins from other elapids. Six cDNAs encoding isoforms of related neurotoxins were cloned using the RT-PCR of the venom gland mRNAs. The sequences of the corresponding proteins consist of 57 ± 58 amino acid residues and display several unique features when compared with all known short-chain neurotoxins. Accordingly, they grouped separately in phylogenetic analysis. The six cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant proteins were characterized.

40|$|The caspases are {{cysteine}} proteases {{that have}} been implicated in the execution of programmed cell death in organisms ranging from nematodes to humans. Many members of the Bcl- 2 family, including Bcl-xL, are potent inhibitors of programmed cell death and inhibit activation of caspases in cells. Here, we report a direct interaction between caspases and Bcl-xL. The loop domain of Bcl-xL is cleaved by caspases in vitro and in cells induced to undergo apoptotic death after Sindbis virus infection or interleukin 3 withdrawal. Mutation of the caspase cleavage site in Bcl-xL {{in conjunction with a}} mutation in the BH 1 homology domain impairs the death-inhibitory activity of Bcl-xL, suggesting that interaction of Bcl-xL with caspases may be an important mechanism of inhibiting cell death. However, once Bcl-xL is cleaved, the C-terminal fragment of Bcl-xL potently induces apoptosis. Taken together, these findings indicate that the recognition/cleavage site of Bcl-xL may facilitate protection against cell death by acting at the level of caspase activation and that cleavage of Bcl-xL during the execution phase of cell death converts Bcl-xL from a protective to a <b>lethal</b> <b>protein...</b>|$|E
40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} H(+) -ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is an essential}} protein that is required to establish cellular membrane potential and maintain a normal internal pH. An Asp- 378 to Asn substitution at the residue phosphorylated during catalysis is dominant lethal when the pma 1 -D 378 N mutation is expressed along with a wild-type {{plasma membrane}} H(+) -ATPase (PMA 1) gene. Several mutations {{in the first two}} putative transmembrane domains are also dominant lethal. However, these dominant lethal mutants often appear to be innocuous, because they are frequently lost by gene conversion to the wild-type sequence during the process of introducing the mutant sequence and subsequently removing the wild-type gene. Loss of the mutation by gene conversion does not occur while introducing recessive lethal mutations. Cells carrying the wild-type PMA 1 gene on the chromosome and a dominant lethal mutation under the control of a GAL 1 promoter on a centromere-containing plasmid exhibit a galactose-dependent lethality. Indirect immunofluorescence staining using anti-Pma 1 antibodies shows that induction of dominant lethal PMA 1 mutations leads to the accumulation of a number of intensely staining cytoplasmic structures that are not coincident with the nucleus and its immediately surrounding endoplasmic reticulum. These structures also accumulate the endoplasmic reticulum protein Kar 2. Expression of the dominant <b>lethal</b> <b>protein</b> also prevents transport of the wild-type ATPase to the plasma membrane...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Natural {{habitats}} vary in {{available nutrients}} and room for bacteria to grow, but successful colonization {{can lead to}} overcrowding and stress. Here we show that competing sibling colonies of Paenibacillus dendritiformis bacteria survive overcrowding by switching between two distinct vegetative phenotypes, motile rods and immotile cocci. Growing colonies of the rodshaped bacteria produce a toxic protein, Slf, which kills cells of encroaching sibling colonies. However, sublethal concentrations of Slf induce some of the rods to switch to Slf-resistant cocci, which have distinct metabolic and resistance profiles, including resistance to cell wall antibiotics. Unlike dormant spores of P. dendritiformis, the cocci replicate. If cocci encounter conditions that favor rods, they secrete a signaling molecule that induces a switch to rods. Thus, in contrast to persister cells, P. dendritiformis bacteria adapt to changing environmental conditions by inducible and reversible phenotypic switching. IMPORTANCE In favorable environments, species may face space and nutrient limits due to overcrowding. Bacteria provide an excellent model for analyzing principles underlying overcrowding and regulation of density in nature, since their population dynamics can be easily and accurately assessed under controlled conditions. We describe a newly discovered mechanism for survival of a bacterial population during overcrowding. When competing with sibling colonies, Paenibacillus dendritiformis produces a <b>lethal</b> <b>protein</b> (Slf) that kills cells at the interface of encroaching colonies. Slf also induces {{a small proportion of}} the cells to switch from motile, rod-shaped cells to nonmotile, Slf-resistant, vegetative cocci. When crowding is reduced and nutrients are no longer limiting, the bacteria produce a signal that induces cocci to switch back to motile rods, allowing the population t...|$|E

Specifically, we concentrate on three relevant problems today in proteomics, namely detection of <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins,</b> functional modules and alignments from protein interaction networks. We propose novel graph theoretic models for these problems and devise practical parameterized algorithms. At a broader level, we demonstrate how these methods can be viable alternatives for the several heurestic, randomized, approximation and sub-optimal methods by arriving at parameterized yet optimal solutions for these problems. We substantiate these theoretical results by experimenting on real protein interaction data of S. cerevisiae (budding yeast) and verifying the results using gene ontology.

Only 2 of the 21 MalF mutant proteins allowed growth on maltose and maltodextrins. Most mutations resulting in immunodetectable proteins mapped to hydrophilic domains, indicating that insertions affecting transmembrane segments gave rise to unstable or <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins.</b> All MalF mutant proteins, even those C-terminally truncated or with large N-terminal deletions, were inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane.

40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTL) contain granules {{that are}} exocytosed during specific interaction with target cells (TC). In this process, the granule contents, including the <b>lethal</b> <b>protein</b> perforin, {{as well as}} granzymes, a family of serine esterases, are delivered to the TC. Information regarding the routing of these proteins towards the granule and their exact localization within the granule is of primary importance to resolve the mechanism of granule-mediated TC killing. In this study, the subcellular localization of perforin, granzymes, and known endosomal and lysosomal marker proteins was determined in human and murine CTL, by immunogold labeling of ultrathin cryosections followed by electron microscopy. Perforin and granzymes can be detected in rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, trans-Golgi reticulum, and in all cytotoxic granules. Within the granules, they have a similar distribution and are localized {{not only in the}} so-called dense core but also over the region containing small internal vesicles. This finding implies that perforin and granzymes can be released in membrane- enveloped and/or -associated form into the intercellular cleft formed upon CTL-TC interaction. On the basis of the present evidence, additional release of these molecules in soluble form cannot be excluded. The lysosomal membrane glycoproteins lamp- 1, lamp- 2, and CD 63, are abundantly present on the granule-delimiting outer membrane, which becomes incorporated into the CTL plasma membrane during lethal hit delivery. In contrast, the cation-dependent mannose 6 -phosphate receptor, known to be present in endosomes and absent from lysosomes, is found only in a minority of the granules. Together with our previous findings that the granules are acidic and connected to the endocytic pathway, these observations define CTL granules as secretory lysosomes...|$|E
40|$|Dosage {{compensation}} (equalisation of X-linked gene products) {{occurs in}} Drosophila melanogaster by a two-fold transcriptional increase of X-linked gene {{expression in the}} male. This involves the binding of four proteins, MSL- 1, MSL- 2, MSL- 3 and MLE (collectively known as the MSLs), to hundreds of sites {{along the length of}} the male X. The MSLs are thought to recruit MOF, a histone acetyl transferase, which facilitates the increase in transcriptional activity of X-linked genes. The DNA sequences required to target the MSL complex to the X chromosome (known as dosage compensation regulatory elements, or DCREs) remain elusive, despite numerous attempts over the last ten years to identify them. DCREs are thought to be present at multiple sites {{along the length of the}} X chromosome, as antibodies to the MSLs bind to hundreds of sites along the X, and autosomal genes transduced to the X usually become dosage compensated. The first objective of this study was to develop a reporter gene assay to screen for DCREs that would minimise problems previously encountered. A construct consisting of the constitutive armadillo promoter fused to the lacZ reporter gene (called arm-lacZ) was flanked by insulator elements which block the repressive effects of the autosomal chromatin environment. Fragments of X-linked DNA were inserted upstream of the armadillo promoter with the premise that males carrying one copy of an autosomal insertion of this construct would express twice the level of ß-galactosidase as females. Transgenic flies carrying autosomal insertions of X-linked fragments plus arm-lacZ were generated and one dose males and females were assayed for ß-galactosidase activity using a spectrophotometric assay. In all cases, males and females expressed the same level of lacZ. This suggests that no DCREs that could confer dosage compensation onto arm-lacZ were present in the X-linked fragments. arm-lacZ is capable of being dosage compensated as males and females carrying one copy of an X-linked insertion of arm-lacZ produce a 2 : 1 male to female ratio. This implies that DCREs of the 'strength' required to dosage compensate arm-lacZ are rarer than previously thought. A second method of dosage compensation that is independent of the MSLs is thought to occur in Drosophila. The X-linked gene runt is dosage compensated in the absence of the MSLs. It is possible that runt is sex specifically regulated by the female specific Sex <b>lethal</b> <b>protein</b> (Sxl). Sxl down-regulates msl- 2 in females by binding to (U) 8 or A(U) 7 sequences in the msl- 2 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNA. runt mRNA contains three Sxl binding sites in its 3 ' UTR, as do 20 other X-linked genes. The second objective of this project was to determine if Sxl could down regulate a gene in females, purely by the addition of three Sxl binding sites to the 3 'UTR. Sxl binding sites were inserted into the 3 'UTR of arm-lacZ in the form of a 40 bp synthetic linker containing three of the sites, and also as a 170 bp fragment from the runt 3 ' UTR. ß-galactosidase assays of flies carrying the Sxl binding sites from runt showed that males expressed an average of 1. 31 to 1. 46 times the level of lacZ than females. This shows that Sxl can down-regulate a gene if there are Sxl binding sites in its 3 ' UTR, however, to achieve two-fold regulation, additional factors may be required, or topologically, the sites may not have been in the right position in the 3 ' UTR for optimal activity of Sxl. Flies carrying the synthetic linker expressed the same level of ß-galactosidase in both sexes which suggests that either additional elements within the 3 ' UTR are required, or that the spacing between the sites is critical for the action of Sxl...|$|E
40|$|Geminiviruses are {{circular}} single-stranded DNA {{viruses and}} are classified into family Geminiviridae. The family {{consists of four}} genera Mastrevirus, Curtovirus, Topocuvirus and Begomovirus. Begomoviruses can be broadly divided into two groups, the Old World (eastern hemisphere, Europe, Africa, Australia, Asia) and the New World viruses (western hemisphere, the Americas). Their genomes have number of characteristics that distinguish Old World and New World viruses. All New World begomoviruses are bipartite, whereas both bipartite and monopartite begomoviruses {{are present in the}} Old World. Chilli leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB) is a disease specific betasatellite and is found associated with monopartite as well as bipartite begomoviruses. On the other hand Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) is an Old World bipartite begomovirus whereas Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) is New World bipartite begomovirus. The aim of research work presented here was to study the interaction of ChLCB with both the Old and New World bipartite begomoviruses and the identification of DNA A encoded proteins that contributed to symptoms induction, suppressor of gene silencing, and pathogenicity. The other objective was to find out the host genes that are up or down regulated due to the interaction of Ã¢C 1 protein encoded by ChLCB. Differential display analysis was done to find out the host genes that are activated against Ã¢C 1 Chi, whereas gateway cloning technology and two expression systems i. e. prokaryotic (BL 21 bacterial strain) and yeast (Pichia pastoris) were used for the expression analysis of geminivirus encoded proteins. Co-inoculation of the DNA ACa and DNA BCa yielded efficient infection, typical symptoms of leaf curling, leaf crinkling, mild yellow, leaf deformation and stunting after seven to eight days of inoculation and the levels of siRNA derived from CaLCuV correlated positively with the levels of viral DNA. It was observed that the inoculation of ACa + Ã¢Chi showed mild symptoms and low levels of viral DNA ACa accumulation in systemic leaves as compared to both components of ACa + BCa. From this study it was concluded that betasatellite interacted with the New World begomovirus (CaLCuV), intensified symptoms and also helped in virus movement. These results confirmed that the interaction of betasatellites was not limited to monopartite begomoviruses and that betasatellites can complement movement of bipartite begomoviruses from both Old and New World. The role of DNA A encoded proteins of both Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus and Cabbage leaf curl virus in viral pathogenicity was studied. For this study cloning and expression of AC 2 Ca, AC 4 Ca, and AV 2 To genes were carried out into pDONOR/Zeo entry vector and destination vectors p 100, p 201 and p 202 having 35 S promoter and different protein tags such as HA and FLAG through gateway technology. Floral dip transformation method was also used to express protein in Arabidopsis transgenic plants. It was found that AC 2 Ca was a suppressor of RNA silencing and its expression induced the hypersensitive response. Similarly, AC 4 Ca suppressed miRNA whereas AV 2 To was a weak suppressor of RNA silencing. Putative transgenic plants expressing AC 2 p 201 Ca, AC 4 p 100 Ca and AC 4 p 201 Ca showed distinct phenotype. AC 4 p 100 Ca and AC 4 p 201 Ca developed downward leaf curling, crumpling and stunted plants, whereas AC 2 p 201 Ca plants developed elongated leaves, rosette like pattern, slightly rolling and margins of the leaves were deformed. On the other hand, p 202 (AV 2) To developed upward leaf curling and deformed leaves, AV 2 p 100 To and AV 2 p 201 To expression vectors showed scrunch and slightly deformed leaves. From all experimental data it can be concluded that these proteins are pathogenicity determinants and are involved in symptom induction and upon complementation of movement function by ChLCB were able to develop disease phenotype in the absence of DNA B Ca. In this regard efforts were made to express Ã¢C 1 Chi protein through both bacterial and yeast expression systems to understand their binding activity with DNA/RNA or protein-protein interaction through in vitro binding assays like pull down assay or co-immunoprecipitation. It was found that Ã¢C 1 Chi was <b>lethal</b> <b>protein</b> for bacterial and yeast expression system. The expression of Ã¢C 1 Chi from bacterial system was not detectable due to nucleotide mutations which resulted in failure of protein expression. Similarly, Pichia pastoris system was also failed to produce detectable expression and protein could not be purified. On the other hand AV 2 To was successfully expressed in BL 21 system and indicated that bacterial system was working and the problem was occurred due to toxicity of Ã¢C 1. Later Ã¢C 1 Chi was expressed in N. tabacum to isolate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through differential display analysis during host protein interaction. It was observed that WRKY transcription factor IId- 1 splice, putative Rieske iron-sulfur protein, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2, Quinonprotein alcohol dehydrogenase, trigger factor (chaperone in protein export), Arabidopsis thaliana calmodulin-binding receptor-like kinase, and Polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase were isolated from N. tabacum in response of Ã¢C 1 Chi under 35 (CaMV) promoter after two and four days of infiltration. Delta, Livak and Pfaffi mathematical models of quantitative real time PCR gave an idea that these DEGs were up and down regulated. Interestingly these all DEGs are related to the chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, involved in plant development and growth processes, cell protection, replication mechanisms, act as carriers of ATP synthesis and electron transporters during photosynthesis and respiration processes. Kegg Orthology based annotation system indicated that Polynucleotide nucleotidyltransferase is a RNA binding protein, and involved in the purine and pyrimidine metabolic pathway that relates to RNA degradation. The data presented here show that the interaction of betasatellite is not limited to monopartite begomoviruses. The spread of begomovirus complexes that contain betasatellite thus pose a serious threat to global agriculture. It was concluded that AC 2 Ca, AC 4 Ca, AV 2 To, and Ã¢C 1 Chi proteins of both monopartite and bipartite begomoviruses involved in viral movement, symptom induction, and pathogenicity determinant...|$|E

Some of the inhibitors apparently interact with several-conserved residue in the cofactor-binding site. The docking work suggests virtual derivatives of the predicted inhibitor that can improve hydrogen bond interaction between inhibitor and protein. From structural and docking analyses, it is hypothesized that 1 YQY protein interacts with azelastine molecule shows the lowest docking energy in AutoDock software...|$|R
40|$|Painting of fourth (POF) is a chromosome-specific {{protein in}} Drosophila and {{represents}} {{the first example}} of an autosome-specific protein. POF binds to chromosome 4 in Drosophila melanogaster, initiating at the proximal region, followed by a spreading dependent on chromosome 4 -specific sequences or structures. Chromosome-specific gene regulation is known thus far only as a mechanism to equalize the transcriptional activity of the single male X chromosome {{with that of the}} two female X chromosomes. In Drosophila, a complex including the male-specific <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins,</b> “paints” the male X chromosome, mediating its hypertranscription, explained to some extent by the acetylation of lysine 16 on histone H 4. Here, we show that Pof is essential for viability in both sexes and for female fertility. POF binding to an autosome, the F element, is conserved in genus Drosophila, indicating functional conservation of the autosome specificity. In three of nine studied species, POF binds to the male X chromosome. When bound to the male X, it also colocalizes with the dosage compensation <b>protein</b> male-specific <b>lethal</b> 3, suggesting a relationship to dosage compensation. The chromosome specificity is determined at the species level and not by the amino acid sequence. We argue that POF is involved in a chromosome-specific regulatory function...|$|R
40|$|Misfolded {{proteins}} {{are usually}} {{arrested in the}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and degraded by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery. Several mutant alleles of PMA 1, the gene coding for the plasma membrane H +-ATPase, render misfolded proteins that are subjected to ERAD. A subset of misfolded PMA 1 mutants exhibits a dominant negative effect on yeast growth since, when co-expressed with the wild type allele, both proteins are retained in the ER and degraded. We have used a PMA 1 -D 378 T dominant lethal allele to analyse the mechanism underlying the retention of the wild type enzyme by the dominant negative mutant. A genetic screen was performed for isolation of intragenic suppressors of PMA 1 -D 378 T allele. This analysis pointed to transmembrane helix 10 (TM 10) as {{an important element in}} the establishment of the dominant lethality. Deletion of the TM 10 was able to suppress not only the PMA 1 -D 378 T but all the dominant lethal alleles tested. Biochemical analyses suggest that dominant <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins</b> obstruct, through TM 10, the correct folding of the wild type enzyme leading to its retention and degradation by ERAD.

40|$|The øX 174 DNA pilot protein H {{forms an}} {{oligomeric}} DNA-translocating tube during penetration. However, monomers are in-corporated into 12 pentameric assembly intermediates, which become the capsid’s icosahedral vertices. The protein’s N termi-nus, a predicted transmembrane helix, is not {{represented in the}} crystal structure. To investigate its functions, a series of absolute and conditional lethal mutations were generated. The absolute <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins,</b> a deletion and a triple substitution, were effi-ciently incorporated into virus-like particles lacking infectivity. The conditional lethal mutants, bearing cold-sensitive (cs) and temperature-sensitive (ts) point mutations, were more amenable to further analyses. Viable particles containing the mutant pro-tein can be generated at the permissive temperature and subsequently analyzed at the restrictive temperature. The characterized cs defect directly affected host cell attachment. In contrast, ts defects were manifested during morphogenesis. Particles synthe-sized at permissive temperature were indistinguishable from wild-type particles {{in their ability to}} recognize host cells and deliver DNA. One mutation conferred an atypical ts synthesis phenotype. Although the mutant protein was efficiently incorporated into virus-like particles at elevated temperature, the progeny appeared to be kinetically trapped in a temperature-independent, unin-fectious state. Thus, substitutions in the N terminus can lead to H protein misincorporation, albeit at wild-type levels, and sub-sequently affect particle function. All mutants exhibited recessive phenotypes, i. e., rescued by the presence of the wild-type H protein. Thus, mixed H protein oligomers are functional during DNA delivery. Recessive and dominant phenotypes may tempo-rally approximate H protein functions, occurring before or after oligomerization has gone to completion...|$|R

25|$|In {{organisms that}} use {{this method of}} dosage compensation, the {{presence}} {{of one or more}} X chromosomes must be detected early on in development, as failure to initiate the appropriate dosage compensation mechanisms is lethal. Male specific <b>lethal</b> <b>proteins</b> (MSLs) are a family of four proteins that bind to the X chromosome exclusively in males. The name “MSL” is used because mutations in these genes cause inability to effectively upregulate X-linked genes appropriately, and are thus lethal to males only and not their female counterparts. SXL regulates pre-messenger RNA in males to differentially splice MSLs and result in the appropriate increase in X chromosome transcription observed in male Drosophila. The immediate target of SXL is male specific lethal-2 (MSL-2). Current dogma suggests that the binding of MSL-2 at multiple sites along the SXL gene in females prevents proper MSL-2 translation, and thus, as previously stated, represses the possibility for X-linked genetic upregulation in females. However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family—maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3—are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex. Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of euchromatin. Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread {{along the length of the}} chromosome and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications. The implications of this spreading epigenetic regulation along the male X chromosome is thought to have implications for understanding the transfer of epigenetic activity along long genomic stretches.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{relative}} {{resistance of}} the coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and the chinook salmon (O. tshawyscha) to the parasitic larvae (glochidia) of the freshwater mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) was studied {{in an attempt to}} determine why the coho appeared to be more resistant. Natural and acquired antibody was sought in the mucus and plasma of the coho and chinook salmon using microtiter and gel diffusion plates. Whole mucus and plasma from fish not possessing the parasite were tested for lethality by observing living glochidia in each. Mucus and plasma from both species were fractionated using Sephadex G- 200 gel. Total protein and lethality to living glochidia were determined for fractions possessing high protein levels. Histological sections were made at periodic intervals into the infection period to determine how the coho salmon sloughed the parasite from its gill filaments after a week into the parasitic period, while the chinook salmon held the parasite on its gills for 12 weeks. Acquired antibody was sought in the mucus and plasma of both species every 2 weeks into the parasitic period. This is the first documented report of what appears to be acquired antibody to the glochidia of M. margaritifera. Antibody precipitates appeared in the plasma of both infected coho and chinook salmon at 8 and 12 weeks into the parasitic period. Histological sections showed encysted glochidia of M. margaritifera being sloughed by coho salmon due to increased cellular hyperplasia (cell proliferation) {{in the area of the}} cysts. No such hyperplastic reaction was noted in the gills of the chinook salmon. Natural antibodies were not found. <b>Lethal</b> <b>proteins,</b> if present, in mucus or plasma of uninfected fish are too weak to play an important role in the coho's resistance to glochidiosis...|$|R
