40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{framework}} for modeling image-dependent contextual relationships using graphbased context model. This approach {{enables us to}} selectively utilize the contextual relationships suitable for an input query image. We introduce a context <b>link</b> <b>view</b> of contextual knowledge, where {{the relationship between a}} pair of annotated regions is represented as a context link on a similarity graph of regions. Link analysis techniques are used to estimate the pairwise context scores of all pairs of unlabeled regions in the input image. Our system integrates the learned context scores into a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework in the form of pairwise cost and infers the semantic segmentation result by MRF optimization. Experimental results on object class segmentation show that the proposed graph-based context model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{multi-step}} biosynthesis of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase enzyme {{involves a}} variety of accessory proteins. To further understand this process, a Strep-tag II variant of the large subunit of Escherichia coli hydrogenase 3, HycE, was constructed to enable isolation of protein complexes. A complex with SlyD, a chaperone protein implicated in hydrogenase production through association with the nickel-binding accessory protein HypB, was observed. A SlyD–HycE interaction preceding both iron and nickel insertion to the enzyme was detected, mediated by the chaperone domain of SlyD, and independent of HypB. These results support a model of several roles for SlyD during hydrogenase maturation.

These are often described by mathematical models, such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which enable {{the integration of}} a multitude of different data and data types using parameter estimation. Due to the limited amount of data, parameter estimation does not necessarily yield a single point in parameter space and many attributes of the model remain uncertain. Our system visualizes the model as a graph, where the statistics of the attributes are mapped {{to the color of}} edges and vertices. The graph view is combined with several <b>linked</b> <b>views</b> such as lineplots, scatterplots, and correlation matrices, to support the identification of uncertainties and the analysis of their mutual dependencies as well as their time dependencies.

40|$|Current {{views of}} {{conceptual}} combination postulate that novel phrases are interpreted by linking one constituent to another via a relation. For example, robin snake might {{be interpreted as}} “a snake that eats robins. ” Two studies examined the generality of this relation <b>linking</b> <b>view</b> by examining interpretations of novel noun–noun combinations. The results provide support for the relation <b>linking</b> <b>view</b> but suggest other ways that novel phrases are interpreted. In particular, the first study suggested that people commonly use a strategy called property mapping, in which they assert that a property of the modifier concept {{is true of the}} head noun, e. g., interpreting robin snake, as “a snake with a red underbelly. ” A second study showed that high similarity between the two nouns strongly predicts when people will map properties. I propose an extension to current models of conceptual combination in which property mapping is carried out by a comparison process. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

40|$|A data {{pipeline}} transforms data, {{through a series}} of stages, into visualizations. Buja et al. [1] introduce the use of the pipeline design pattern for statistical data visualization. Figure 1 gives an overview of the design. They argue that an interactive and dynamic visualization requires real-time data processing. Their suggested pipeline is constituted by seven stages. The pipeline begins with the raw data. The second stage performs non-linear transformations on the data, if requested. The next stage standardizes the variables, and the following stage randomizes variables, so that they may serve as a graphical permutation test. After randomization comes the projection engine, which reduces the dimensionality of the data, either by selecting variables for the axes or projecting multiple variables onto a lower dimensional space, as in tours. The viewporting stage is next; it decides the visible range and scale of the data, which may be specified by a user through pan, zoom and scale controls. The final stage is the actual plot. Thus, the pipeline incorporates many of the common needs of dynamic statistical graphics: transformation, standardization, permutation, projection, and viewporting. The Orca project [2] extends the Buja et al. pipeline to support multiple <b>linked</b> <b>views.</b> The <b>linked</b> <b>views</b> adhere to a model view controller (MVC) pattern, in that user manipulation, such as brushing, changes values in the underlying OrcaAppearance model, and these changes are then propagated to an...|$|R
