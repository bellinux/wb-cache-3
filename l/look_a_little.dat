25|$|New {{sheet metal}} {{highlighted}} by new swept back grilles/headlights, new taillights and revised coupe rooflines {{were among the}} changes to the 1980 Buick LeSabre aside from the complete disappearance of Buick's traditional portholes (the C-body Electra would retain them until 1984). The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bigger than their 1977–79 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{team had}} played six {{first-class}} matches {{prior to this}} match, {{and they had a}} below-par win-loss ratio of one win and two losses, both being innings defeats. Australia, though, had a remarkable record in their last ten test series, winning eight of them, and three out of a total three series after the war. Their win-loss record was exemplary as well, winning 29 and losing only 7, out of 45 tests. However, the Indian team had reason to believe that they could punch above their weight, as they had unearthed in Vinoo Mankad, a talented all-rounder, who had taken 39 wickets in those six matches, and had also scored 516 runs from 11 innings at an average of 46.90, and their captain Lala Amarnath's good run with the bat and the emergence of a future batting stalwart for India, Vijay Hazare, made India's prospects <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> brighter. However, Australia's captain, Don Bradman was a major stumbling block in India's path. At the start of the series his record was: 42 test matches, 5773 runs, Average of 97.84. Worryingly, for the touring side, He had already scored heavily against the Indian attack for the Australian XI outfit against India, an imposing 172. So his presence meant definite trouble for Lala Amarnath's side.|$|E
500|$|Late on September15, National Hurricane Center {{forecaster}} Robbie Berg {{noted that}} Nadine began [...] "to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more ragged", as microwave data observations noted shearing of deep convection {{to the northeast}} of the center. Late on September16, the eye became tilted and disappeared, convective bands began disorganizing, and the overall shower and thunderstorms activity waned since early that day. Nadine weakened back to a tropical storm on September17. Additionally, a trough in the area caused Nadine to acquire a less tropical satellite appearance on September17.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stay at the club, despite interest from Chelsea, who had been acquired by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in the summer. Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand that we <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and you will see that we look good. To write us off just because we haven't spent £100million is a bit easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Cortana {{has been}} turned into an action figure twice to promote Halo. The first was {{released}} as a seven-inch (178mm) [...] miniature as part of the [...] series of action figures. The character is also featured in the first series of Halo 3 action figures, distributed by McFarlane Toys. [...] In an interview, McLees noted that the first action figure was supposed to convey an older appearance than was depicted in the games. This was accomplished by making the figure <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> buxom, despite McLees' direct request to reduce the mass of the figure. She explains that the sculptor appeared reluctant to make the change and that time constraints ultimately left the design intact.|$|E
500|$|The {{staff were}} {{concerned}} over the animation of the characters' {{eyes in the}} episode, as the pupils were larger than normal, making the characters look [...] "stoned", and the eyeballs were [...] "too round" [...] and large. The animation artists at the animation studio in South Korea, {{where much of the}} animation process takes place, had begun stenciling the eyes with a template, which according to Lynch resulted in [...] "strangely round eyes which <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too big sometimes and much too perfect. Which is very un-Simpsons like." [...] Marge was designed with shorter hair in the flashback sequences to make her appear younger. Lynch thought it was nice to see Marge in a [...] "younger, more attractive mode, and sort of watching her progress through pregnancy." ...|$|E

500|$|Downey, Stiller, Black and Cruise were {{repeatedly}} {{singled out}} for praise by numerous critics, claiming that they [...] "stole the show", was [...] "...off-the-charts hilarious ...", and would bring viewers [...] "...the fondest memories of [...] work." [...] Scott Feinberg, of the Los Angeles Times, criticized the concept of Downey's portrayal of an African-American, writing [...] "...I just can't imagine any circumstance under which a blackface performance would be acceptable, any more than I can imagine any circumstance under which {{the use of the}} N-word would be acceptable." [...] Sara Vilkomerson said Cruise did [...] "...an astonishingly funny and surprising supporting performance." [...] Logan Hill of New York argued against Cruise's cameo saying that it [...] "...just makes him <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lost and almost pathetic—shucking and jiving, trying to appeal to the younger moviegoers who are abandoning him." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, Francis, a {{soap opera}} [...] "legend", reunited with her former onscreen husband, Anthony Geary, during the [...] "Soap Opera Spectacular" [...] episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. Both Francis and Geary {{were part of the}} supercouple pairing of Luke and Laura on the ABC Daytime soap opera General Hospital. When {{questioned}} by show host Oprah Winfrey if Francis would ever reprise the role of Laura Spencer, she revealed: [...] "I would like her to be funny and {{have a little bit of}} an agenda that might <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit vengeful, but it really isn’t. I think she’d have a plan. If there is a way to go forward with Laura and make her into what I'd like her to be now, then perhaps I would do it. There is nothing in me that is willing to play a victim anymore. I’m sort of done with the wounded dove in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Lynch recalls {{having a}} happy childhood, {{although}} {{he suffered from}} bouts of agoraphobia in his youth, especially after having been scared by a screening of Henry King's 1952 film Wait till the Sun Shines, Nellie, when he was six years old. He would develop a brief habit of wearing three [...] neckties at a time, which he understands {{to have been a}} manifestation of his personal insecurity. He also points to a particular image from his childhood that shaped his understanding of the world—" [...] was a dream world, those droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it was supposed to be. But then on the cherry tree would be this pitch oozing out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions and millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree. So you see, there's this beautiful world and you just <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit closer and it's all red ants".|$|E

500|$|Bart's ballet {{teacher was}} voiced by Susan Sarandon, and was {{designed}} to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit like her. Sarandon had wanted to guest star on the show because her children were big fans; she brought them {{with her to the}} recording session. Due to a traffic jam, she was late for the recording session, but once she arrived, she fell into character and worked very hard on getting her accent accurate. Sarandon would later have a cameo appearance as the voice of a computer in the season 17 episode [...] "Bart Has Two Mommies". Mel Brooks has a cameo appearance as himself. His wife Anne Bancroft had {{played a role in the}} episode [...] "Fear of Flying" [...] and Brooks had accompanied her to the recording session. David Mirkin realized that Brooks was [...] "dying to do the show" [...] and asked him if he would be willing to do a guest part, and he agreed. Many of the writers were fans of Brooks, and Matt Groening described the chance to have him guest star as [...] "an incredible honor".|$|E
500|$|Burbank, California was {{considered}} as a possible location for the suburban neighborhoods, but Burton believed the city had become too altered since his childhood so the Tampa Bay Area of Florida, including the town of Lutz and the Southgate Shopping Center of Lakeland was chosen for a three-month shooting schedule. The production crew found, {{in the words of}} the production designer Bo Welch, [...] "a kind of generic, plain-wrap suburb, which we made even more characterless by painting all the houses in faded pastels, and reducing the window sizes to make it <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more paranoid." [...] The key element to unify the look of the neighborhood was Welch's decision to repaint each of the houses in one of four colors, which he described as [...] "sea-foam green, dirty flesh, butter, and dirty blue". The facade of the Gothic mansion was built just outside Dade City. Filming Edward Scissorhands created hundreds of (temporary) jobs and injected over $4 million into the Tampa Bay economy. Production then moved to a Fox Studios sound stage in Century City, California, where interiors of the mansion were filmed.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Jerry Doolittle {{thought that}} Bond is [...] "still irresistible to women, still {{handsome}} in a menacing way, still charming. He has nerves {{of steel and}} thews of whipcord", even if [...] "he's starting to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older." [...] Doolittle was fulsome in his praise for the novel, saying [...] "Fleming's new book will not disappoint his millions of fans". Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning, although even he admitted that [...] "you can't argue with success". However, {{he went on to}} say that [...] "simply pro forma, I must set down my opinion that this is a silly and tedious novel." [...] Boucher went on to bemoan that although On Her Majesty's Secret Service was better than The Spy Who Loved Me, [...] "it is still a lazy and inadequate story", going on to say that [...] "my complaint is not that the adventures of James Bond are bad literature... but that they aren't good bad literature". Boucher finished his review lamenting that [...] "they just aren't writing bad books like they used to." ...|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Martin-Jenkins {{noted in}} The Times that the {{tourists}} were [...] "too {{dependent on their}} fast-medium bowling" [...] and that the batting would <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shaky when Wessells retires, given the performances of Hudson and Cronje, though he praised Darryl Cullinan's emergence as [...] "a batsman of genuine Test class".|$|E

2500|$|The Mark III, {{introduced}} in March 1967, {{was the first}} major facelift to the Spitfire. The front bumper was raised in response to new crash regulations, as well as the front coil springs being slightly raised, which made the car sometimes <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> out of proportion. Although much of the bonnet pressing was carried over, the front end looked quite different. The rear lost the overriders from the bumper but gained reversing lights as standard (initially as two separate lights {{on either side of the}} number plate, latterly as a single light in a new unit above the number plate); the interior was improved again with a wood-veneer instrument surround and a smaller 15-inch wire spoked steering wheel. A folding hood replaced the earlier [...] "build it yourself" [...] arrangement. For most of the Mark III range, the instrument cluster was still centre-mounted (as in the Mark I and Mark II) so as to reduce parts bin counts (and thereby production costs) for right-hand and left-hand drive versions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{recognition}} of Torquay’s impressive {{start to the}} season, Paul Buckle was named League Two Manager of the Month for August. [...] However, after a near perfect August, September was to prove something of a reality check for the Gulls. [...] With Torquay’s clean sheet record ending against Port Vale in their previous match, a 2-1 defeat away to Southend in their {{first game of the}} month put to an end a twelve match unbeaten run in the League which had stretched back to March. [...] This was then followed up by two successive 0-0 draws at home to Accrington Stanley and away to Stevenage. [...] Although these results seemed to suggest the Gulls had got their defensive house back in the order, they were now struggling to find the back of the net. [...] With summer signings Billy Kee and Martin Gritton yet to register on the goalscorer charts, and Elliot Benyon out injured for the Accrington game and on the bench for most of the Stevenage match, the Gulls were starting to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> light up front, despite the best efforts of the versatile Chris Zebroski who was being employed as both winger and striker.|$|E
2500|$|After {{establishing}} {{herself as}} a [...] "discovery" [...] of Hal Wallis, Miller soon found herself left behind. In an interview with Mike Fitzgerald, she was quoted as saying, [...] "Hal called me the 'Viking Girl.' He didn't {{know what to do}} with me." [...] The situation was aggravated by the return of veteran actors from overseas, either in uniform or the USO. Compounded by the economic slump after the war, rise of television and the breakup of the studio system, Miller's initial difficulties during the war years would be multiplied many fold. Miller's prospects began to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better when she met journalist and film producer Mark Hellinger, who felt sure that she could become a star. But Hellinger died suddenly in 1947, and Miller soon found herself making a living with the usual small roles that she had always been given. Of the nine films she would make under contract to Paramount, three were loan-outs to other studios, two of which were more significant than her Paramount films, with the exception of I Walk Alone. Typical of the Paramount years, in Sorry, Wrong Number (1948), she was cast as the wife of the investigating detective but was recast as the mistress of the physician, dropping from 3rd to 13th place in billing.|$|E
