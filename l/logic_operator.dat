40|$|In this study, we are {{concerned}} with a category of <b>logic</b> <b>operators</b> for fuzzy sets that is inherently associated with underlying statistical properties of membership grades they operate on. These constructs {{are referred to as}} statistically grounded <b>logic</b> <b>operators,</b> namely statistically grounded ORs (SORs, for short) and statistically grounded ANDs (SANDs, for short) operators. In essence, they arise as a solution to the optimization problem of the following form:where {xk}, kÂ =Â  1, 2,Â  [...] .,Â N are the corresponding membership grades to be combined. The weight function w: [0,Â  1]Â  [...] >Â [0,Â  1] captures the nature of the logic and and or aggregation, respectively. We show that the weight function could be induced by t-norms and t-conorms. The weight functions could be also implied by some statistical characteristics of data (membership grades). The choice of the t-norm (t-conorm) depends upon the predefined form of the <b>logic</b> <b>operators</b> to be developed. We demonstrate that SANDs and SORs offer an efficient operational framework for constructing fuzzy rough sets; lead to the increased sensitivity of computing possibility and necessity measures, bring a new insight into fuzzy relational equations and deliver an interpretation vehicle for fuzzy clustering (that is provided in the form of dependency analysis).

40|$|Geologic {{information}} extraction and integration {{are the main}} goals of this study. Tools are designed to aid in exploration for common mineral deposits by intelligently and efficiently processing spatial geological data. Gabor filters, comprising Gaussian-attenuated sinusoidal weight vectors, are used for textural discrimination. A highly non-linear <b>logic</b> <b>operator</b> was designed for "valley", "ridge", edge, and intersection extraction from multispectral images to cover most of the possible local lineament types. A zonation detector (a non-linear <b>logic</b> <b>operator)</b> indicates {{the presence or absence}} of lithologic zonation, the number and the types of zones using a series of automatically expanding moving windows. The ultimate window size represents the zonation size. Two different types of raster-based expert systems help optimize pixel-by-pixel knowledge extraction and representation over the spatial information and throughout the different raster feature layers. First a 2 -D expert system is used for classification, ranking, recognition and searching for important pattern associations in the feature space. Second, a multilayer adaptive raster-based expert system allows the processing of multiple geologic features, and operates over each pattern in the feature layers. The fuzzy integral method of evidence fusion is used to integrate information from a variety of mineral exploration sources. This nonlinearly combines objective mineral occurrence evidence, in the form of a fuzzy membership function, with subjective evaluation of the worth of the sources with respect to the decision. An application of these methods to the Tombstone mineral district in southern Arizona demonstrates its ability to pick out circular features from TM imagery, Gabor transforms and lineament patterns, as well as identify favorable zonation for new mineral occurrence.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{lossless}} image compression studies {{the various ways}} to represent image data in the most compact and efficient manner possible that also allows the image to be reproduced without any loss. One of the most efficient strategies used in lossless compression is to introduce entropy reduction through decorrelation. This study focuses on using the exclusive-or <b>logic</b> <b>operator</b> in a decorrelation filter as the preprocessing phase of lossless image compression of continuous-tone images. The exclusive-or <b>logic</b> <b>operator</b> is simply and reversibly applied to continuous-tone images {{for the purpose of}} extracting differences between neighboring pixels. Implementation of the exclusive-or operator also does not introduce data expansion. Traditional as well as innovative prediction methods are included for the creation of inputs for the exclusive-or logic based decorrelation filter. The results of the filter are then encoded by a variation of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch dictionary coder. Dictionary coding is selected for the coding phase of the algorithm because it does not require the storage of code tables or probabilities and because it is lower in complexity than other popular options such as Huffman or Arithmetic coding. The first modification of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch dictionary coder is that image data can be read in a sequence that is linear, 2 -dimensional, or an adaptive combination of both. The second modification of the dictionary coder is that the coder can instead include multiple, dynamically chosen dictionaries. Experiments indicate that the exclusive-or operator based decorrelation filter when combined with a modified Lempel-Ziv-Welch dictionary coder provides compression comparable to algorithms that represent the current standard in lossless compression. The proposed algorithm provides compression performance that is below the Context-Based, Adaptive, Lossless Image Compression (CALIC) algorithm by 23 %, below the Low Complexity Lossless Compression for Images (LOCO-I) algorithm by 19 %, and below the Portable Network Graphics implementation of the Deflate algorithm by 7 %, but above the Zip implementation of the Deflate algorithm by 24 %.
