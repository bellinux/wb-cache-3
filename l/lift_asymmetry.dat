40|$|Background: Specific {{information}} regarding obstacle-clearance strategies used by community-dwelling young and elderly is scant in the literature, and physical barriers encountered in real-life situations {{have not been}} used {{in most of the}} studies. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} determine foot <b>lift</b> <b>asymmetry</b> during obstacle avoidance in young and elderly subjects. Settings and Design: This was an observational study. Materials and Methods: Thirty elderly and 30 young individuals were taken for the study. All the subjects were evaluated using different scales and foot <b>lift</b> <b>asymmetry</b> was measured on a walkway using three obstacles of different heights. Results: The mean and standard deviation (SD) value of the asymmetric index of the young was 3. 25 ± 0. 28 and the mean and SD value of the asymmetric index of the elderly was 3. 53 ± 0. 47. The asymmetric index of the elderly population was found to be higher than that of the younger population. Conclusion: The asymmetric index of the elderly population was found to be higher than that of the younger population, though it is not clinically significant...|$|E
40|$|Video-based posture {{analysis}} {{employing a}} biomechanical model is gaining a growing popularity for ergonomic assessments. A human posture simulation {{method of estimating}} multiple body postural angles and spinal loads from a video record was developed to expedite ergonomic assessments. The method was evaluated by a repeated measures study design with three trunk flexion levels, two <b>lift</b> <b>asymmetry</b> levels, three viewing angles and three trial repetitions as experimental factors. The study comprised two phases evaluating the accuracy of simulating self and other people's lifting posture via a proxy of a computer-generated humanoid. The mean values of the accuracy of simulating self and humanoid postures were 1220 and 1520, respectively. The repeatability of the method for the same lifting condition was excellent (220). The least simulation error was associated with side viewing angle. The estimated back compressive force and moment, calculated by a three dimensional biomechanical model, exhibited a range of 5...|$|E
40|$|Asymmetric lifting is {{associated}} with an increased risk of low back disorders. Especially in lifting movements, characterized by a small amount of asymmetry, it is still the question if asymmetric lumbosacral torques occur, or if subjects try to avoid asymmetric back loading by twisting their pelvis with respect to the feet. An increase of the lifting speed or the box weight might amplify the lumbar torques but might also result in an attempt to limit further increase of asymmetric torques by increasing pelvic twist. In the current study, asymmetrical lifting movements were analyzed {{with the aid of a}} 3 D linked segment model, using cuffs mounted to the body segments. Eight subjects performed lifting movements with five different asymmetry conditions, ranging from 0 to 90 °lifting asymmetry with respect to the sagittal plane, using two lifting speeds and two box weights. A significant increase in lateral flexing and twisting low back torque was found for each increase in <b>asymmetry</b> of the <b>lifting</b> movement. Pelvic twist accounted more or less constantly for about 25 % of the <b>lifting</b> <b>asymmetry</b> and was hardly influenced by lifting speed or box weight. Even for 10 or 30 °of <b>lifting</b> <b>asymmetry,</b> subjects did not twist their pelvis far enough to avoid asymmetric loading of the low back. Assuming that asymmetric loading of the low back is more strenuous to the spine than symmetric loading, the current results indicate that even small deviations of a lifting movement from the sagittal plane can explain an increased risk of low back disorders...|$|R
40|$|Although lifting {{tasks are}} {{traditionally}} evaluated by researchers, {{through the use}} of methods which depend on one or more approaches (i. e., psychophysical, biomechanical and physiological methods), none of these approaches makes use of expert workers in the evaluation of lifting activities. Given that 97 % of lower back symptoms are aches, pains and discomfort and rely on self-reports, it is intuitive to use expert workers in evaluating the stressfulness of lifting activities. In this investigation, 217 workers from three industries in the Hong Kong area were surveyed to determine what constitutes a demanding lifting job from a worker standpoint. This was achieved by asking workers to map, in numerical terms, the level of lifting task parameter described in linguistic values. For example, the weight of load was described in three linguistic descriptors, namely, 'light', 'moderate' and 'heavy'. Then, each worker was asked to assess the meaning of these linguistic descriptors in numerical terms, based on their perception and experience with manual handling work. In this study, workers were asked to map the physical analogue of linguistic descriptors for seven lifting task parameters which are utilized in the NIOSH lifting equation, that is, weight of load, horizontal distance, vertical travel distance, vertical origin of <b>lift,</b> angle of <b>asymmetry,</b> frequency of handling and task duration. The data obtained from the workers were then subjected to validity testing in relation to norms and values reported in the published literature. On a preliminary basis, it appears that workers' assessments are logical and valid. The results suggest that the worker-based methodology is a promising approach and that it is worthwhile to pursue this approach further in the evaluation of industrial lifting activities.
