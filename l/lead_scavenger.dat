40|$|A {{sediment}} core {{collected in}} Caminha tidal marsh, NW Portugal, {{was used to}} assess bromine (Br) signal over the last ca. 1, 700 years. The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance (TSI) and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH 3 Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20 th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p< 0. 05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as <b>lead</b> <b>scavenger</b> to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980 s through mid- 1990 s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

While lead ammunition has been banned from waterfowl hunting in North America for almost two decades, lead ammunition is still widely used for hunting big game and small game animals. In this study, we evaluated the association between big game hunting and blood lead concentration in an avian scavenger species that feeds regularly on large mammals in California. We compared blood lead concentration in turkey vultures within and outside of the deer hunting season, and in areas with varying wild pig hunting intensity. Lead exposure in turkey vultures was significantly higher during the deer hunting season compared to the off-season, and blood lead concentration was positively correlated with increasing wild pig hunting intensity. Our results link lead exposure in turkey vultures to deer and wild pig hunting activity at these study sites, and we provide evidence that spent lead ammunition in carrion poses a significant risk of <b>lead</b> exposure to <b>scavengers.</b> © 2011 Kelly, Johnson...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a kinetic model to investigate how DNA repair processes and scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can affect the dose-response shape of prooxidant induced DNA damage. We used as an example chemical KBrO 3 which is activated by glutathione and forms reactive intermediates that directly interact with DNA to form 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine DNA adducts (8 -OH-dG). The single strand breaks (SSB) that can result from failed base excision repair of these adducts were considered as an effect downstream from 8 -OH-dG. We previously demonstrated that, {{in the presence of}} effective base excision repair, 8 -OH-dG can exhibit threshold-like dose-response dependence, while the downstream SSB can still exhibit a linear dose-response.

We tested 81 blood samples from bald eagles before, during and after the big game hunting seasons in 2005 – 2010, excluding 2008, and found eagles had significantly higher lead levels during the hunt. We found 24 % of eagles tested had levels indicating at least clinical exposure (. 60 ug/dL) during the hunt while no birds did during the non-hunting seasons. We performed driving surveys from 2009 – 2010 to measure eagle abundance and found evidence to suggest that eagles are attracted to the study area during the hunt.

40|$|The {{addition}} of fillers {{has long been}} used to improve both the mechanical and electrical properties of polymers. While mechanical properties have been well investigated, only recently has more attention {{been paid to the}} effect of fillers on electrical properties. The main objective of this work is to study charge relaxation in filled ethylene propylene copolymer. Ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) copolymer is a polymer which is widely used as insulation in medium and high voltage cable. This EPR insulation is highly filled and can have as many as 20 additives. Although the major effect of these additives on mechanical performance is known the effect on the dielectric behavior is not well understood. Thermally Stimulated Discharge Current (TSDC) measurements and Time Domain Dielectric Spectroscopy (TDDS) are employed to characterize the dielectric behavior of clay (kaolin) filled ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) copolymer. The TSDC results show two peaks at - 30 ∘C and 50 ∘C. ^ The low temperature peak is affected by the type of base polymer and is attributed to the motion of polymer chain segments. The high temperature peak is caused by the {{addition of}} the clay filler and shows dipole behavior. This peak is thought to be due to a distribution of dipole relaxations caused by the polarization at the clay/polymer interface. This peak can be described using Maxwell-Wagner interfacial effects where the polarization is dependent on the particle shape. The TDDS results show a loss peak in the low frequency region (0. 001 Hz) which is also attributed to the interfacial polarization introduced by the clay. Although bulk interfacial effects are thought to be the main mechanism which causes the polarization, the results have also indicated that surface ions on the clay filler will affect the polarization. The effect of silane treated clay, ion exchange of the clay and the effect of adding red <b>lead</b> (an ion <b>scavenger)</b> strongly suggests that ion motion and type of ion will affect this mechanism. ...|$|R

Decane adsorption experiments lend support to the theory that removal of hydrocarbon contaminants is responsible for superhydrophilic TiO 2 surfaces. Oxidiation of methanol led to formation of surface bound formic acid. Titanium dioxide was then doped with nitrogen atoms via high temperature treatment with ammonia, toward the goal of developing a catalyst capable of using visible light to degrade organic substrates. Catalyst efficiency was tested by monitoring formate degradation to CO 2 and H 2 O under visible light using ion chromatography. However, reduced photocatalytic activity in the UV region, as well as a strong synthesis temperature dependence on catalytic efficiency, was observed. The N-doped TiO 2 surface was probed with diffuse infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), leading us to conclude that Ti-N triple bond defect sites control visible light activity and lead to an apparent reduction in overall crystallinity. Visible light photocatalytic H 2 production was then studied. Microporous and mesoporous silicas (Zeolite-Y, Zeolite-L, SBA- 15) and niobium oxides (KNbO 3, K 4 Nb 6 O 17) were combined with nanoparticulate CdS particles and Ni to form hybrid photocatalysts that produced H 2 from water/ethanol solutions under visible light irradiation. Silica cavity size, which determines CdS particle size, and photocatalytic activity were found to be correlated. Photocatalytic activity was seen to decrease under acidic or basic conditions with an associated negative ionic strength effect. In the niobate catalysts, Ni doping was shown to lead to higher-energy Nb-O bonding states and to compete with Cd for ion exchange sites.

40|$|The {{reactions}} between aqueous radiolysis {{products and}} oxide surfaces {{are important in}} nuclear technology in many ways. In solid-liquid systems, they affect (and {{at the same time}} are dependent on) both the solution chemistry and the stability of materials under the influence of ionizing radiation. The stability of surface oxides is a factor that determines the longevity of the materials where such oxides are formed. Additionally, the aqueous radiolysis products are responsible for corrosion and erosion of the materials.   In this study, the reactions between radiolysis products of water – mainly H 2 O 2 and HO radicals – with metal, lanthanide and actinide oxides are investigated. For this, experimental and computational chemistry methods are employed. For the experimental study of these systems it was necessary to implement new methodologies especially {{for the study of the}} reactive species – the HO radicals. Similarly, the computational study also required the development of models and benchmarking of methods. The experiments combined with the computational chemistry studies produced valuable kinetic, energetic and mechanistic data.   It is demonstrated here that the HO radicals are a primary product of the decomposition of H 2 O 2. For all the materials, the catalytic decomposition of H 2 O 2 consists first of molecular adsorption onto the surfaces of the oxides. This step is followed by the cleavage of the O-O bond in H 2 O 2 to form HO radicals. The HO radicals are able to react further with the hydroxylated surfaces of the oxides to form water and a surface bound HO• center. The dynamics of formation of HO• vary widely for the different materials studied. These differences are also observed in the activation energies and kinetics for decomposition of H 2 O 2. It is found further that the removal of HO• from the system where H 2 O 2 undergoes decomposition, by means of a <b>scavenger,</b> <b>leads</b> to the spontaneous formation of H 2.   The combined theoretical-experimental methodology led to mechanistic understanding of the reactivity of the oxide materials towards H 2 O 2 and HO radicals. This reactivity can be expressed in terms of fundamental properties of the cations present in the oxides. Correlations were found between several properties of the metal cations present in the oxides and adsorption energies of H 2 O, adsorption energies of HO radicals and energy barriers for H 2 O 2 decomposition. This knowledge can aid in improving materials and processes important for nuclear technological systems, catalysis, and energy storage, and also help to better understand geochemical processes.
