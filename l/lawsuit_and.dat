5|$|Gilbert brought suit, {{and after}} The Gondoliers closed in 1891, he withdrew the {{performance}} rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy. Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith, and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert eventually won the <b>lawsuit</b> <b>and</b> felt vindicated, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners.

5|$|In August 1989, Cranor {{proposed}} {{amendments to}} the existing 1976 contract for US franchisees: PepsiCo could take over weak franchises, existing restaurants would not be safeguarded against competition from new outlets, and PepsiCo would {{have the right to}} increase royalty fees. The contract proved controversial amongst franchisees, who countered with a <b>lawsuit,</b> <b>and</b> the issue was not resolved until 1996. PepsiCo was accused of behaving in an imperious manner towards franchisees, who it believed were holding back the firm's growth, while the franchisees believed they had been the backbone of the company during a succession of indifferent corporate owners.|$|E
5|$|In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres {{dismissed}} Coppola's claim.

Coppola then appealed his suit, {{taking it to the}} California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.|$|E

5|$|The second-place bidder, Lane Construction Corporation, sued OCX {{after an}} {{appeal of the}} {{decision}} {{was rejected by the}} OCX board. Lane alleged that scoring of the bids were improperly skewed in Jr. Davis' favor and that the latter was not properly licensed. Lane's bid was cheaper, at $62million, but OCX determined that the Jr. Davis bridge design was superior. Lane did not succeed with the <b>lawsuit</b> <b>and</b> a notice to proceed, authorizing construction to begin, was issued in December 2013. To construct the bridge, a temporary haul road was constructed across the RCMB.

The theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (at least on the specific drug which {{is the subject of}} the <b>lawsuit)</b> <b>and</b> the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the lurch.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided {{it was not necessary}} to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the <b>lawsuit</b> <b>and</b> represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous <b>lawsuit</b> <b>and</b> legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E
