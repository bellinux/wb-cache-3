Here gas is heated in a water bath heater then through a pressure <b>let-down</b> skid and via a 16-inch 1.5km pipeline to the Hatfield Moor well site for injection into the reservoir for storage. The sandstone reservoir has a capacity of about 4.1 billion cubic feet (116 million cubic metres). During periods of high demand gas is withdrawn from the reservoir and through the 16-inch pipeline to the Lindholme site. Here the gas is dehydrated with glycol and compressed using a gas-turbine driven compressor to a pressure suitable for export to Beltoft and into the NTS.|$|E

5000|$|For the {{capabilities}} of what the software could do, the Cantor software was dubbed [...] "the future of music." [...] At {{the time of its}} release, Cantor 2 was considered ground breaking technology. Despite its capabilities, one of its <b>let-downs</b> was considered the high price for its contents in comparison to other software. The biggest criticism toward the software itself was its unintelligible results despite being a powerful tool and though improvements were made between Cantor and Cantor 2. It still lacked clarity which put it at a disadvantage against the more realistic sound of Vocaloid. The simple design of its interface despite the complexity of its capabilities was highly praised overall by reviewers.|$|R
40|$|The Biphase turbine is {{a device}} for {{effectively}} producing shaft power from two-phase (liquid and gas) pressure <b>let-downs</b> and for separating the resulting phases. No other device is currently available for simultaneously performing these tasks. The {{performance of the}} Biphase turbine and its advantages over single-phase, energy-conversion devices has been demonstrated with subscale and commercial scale steam/water (geothermal wellhead) operations. Its development and application to two-phase process streams is now being pursued and {{is the subject of}} this paper. The two-phase working fluid may be a single component, two-phase stream, as in a steam/ water combination, or it may be a multicomponent, two-phase process stream which may also include foam and/or entrained solids. Performance data from initial tests using a subscale Biphase turbine on a two-phase, expanding, gas-cleaning application (Selexol/C 02 mixture) are presented. Turbine designs for tests scheduled for gas/oil wellhead applications are described...|$|R

The movie was a <b>let-down.</b> His next film, Neel Akasher Neechey (Under the Blue Sky), earned him local recognition, while his third film, Baishey Shravan (the day when Rabindranath Tagore died), was his first film that gave him {{international}} exposure.|$|E
25|$|Adult Nursing Relationship (ANR): The {{suckling}} of {{milk from}} a female's breast {{on a regular}} basis from one or more partner(s). Successful ANRs depend on a stable and long-term relationship, as otherwise {{it is very difficult to}} maintain a steady milk flow. Couples may begin an ANR by transferring regular suckling from a child to a sexual partner (e.g. spouse). Such a relationship may form as an expression of close intimacy and mutual tenderness, and may even exist without sex. Breastfeeding can have a strong stabilizing effect on the partnership. The breastfeeding woman may experience orgasms or a pleasurable <b>let-down</b> reflex.|$|E
5000|$|The Soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon released mainly praising [...] "Indiane Vaa" [...] but criticizing other songs.Uma Sudhir of NDTV stated, [...] "Music by AR Rahman {{is not really}} soul-stirring except the song [...] "Indiane Vaa". Some frames in the song sequences remind you of scenes from earlier films. The Mona song with Anushka has a nice lilt." [...] Reviewing for Hindustan Times, Gautham Bhaskaran felt, [...] "AR Rahman's music does not help...to stop Lingaa from stumbling on its plot track." [...] T.S. Sudhir of India Today noted, [...] "For the Rajini-Rahman team that gave hit music in Sivaji, Enthiran, this film doesn't match up. Music by A R Rahman is a letdown. Except for the [...] "Indiane Vaa" [...] score sung by AR himself, rest of the music is disappointing." [...] Critics from Indo Asian News Service raised the similar concern writing, [...] "A.R Rahman's music, doesn't touch the bar that he had set with his previous collaborations with the superstar (Rajinikanth)." [...] Bodrul Chaudhury of Bollyspice who reviewed the Hindi version of the soundtrack stated, [...] "The music wasn't as strong as what we normally hear from Rahman. Overall, this is an album which {{had the potential to}} be so much better." [...] Siddharth K of Sify felt that the album was [...] "highly underwhelming". He noted that every song’s genre was almost similar to a template and called the album [...] "nowhere near Rahman's best". Behindwoods stated, [...] "With Rahman experimenting to give period specific music, Lingaa isn't the usual easily accessible Rajinikanth album. Time and visuals might give a different perspective." [...] Saisuresh Sivaswami of Rediff claimed, [...] "It is sacrilege to criticise A. R. Rahman’s music, but of the five songs in the film, only one, Indianey Vaa, had the anthem potential, the others being just about fine. The songs don’t jump out and grab you by the throat." [...] Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu praised the song [...] "Mona Gasolina", calling it [...] "edgy and good". Also writing for The Hindu, S. Shiva Kumar called Rahman's songs and background score [...] "unbelievably prosaic". R. S. Prakash in Bangalore Mirror summarized, [...] "Rahman's music {{is a far cry from}} his usual compositions, and it's one of the biggest <b>let-downs</b> in the film. Even the introductory song of Rajinikanth creates no impact." [...] J. Hurtado of Twitch Film said [...] "The music by AR Rahman in the film seems to fall flat, with the exceptions of perhaps Rajini's intro song, [...] "Oh Nanba", Anushka's lovelorn dream suite [...] "Mona Gasolina", and Sonakshi's paean to Rajini, [...] "En Mannavva"." ...|$|R
25|$|Qadir {{made his}} Test debut {{at his home}} ground, Gaddafi Stadium, against England in December 1977; he took one wicket in the solitary innings and made 11 runs in the only innings he played. In the second innings of the second Test played at the Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad, he took his first five-wicket haul—six wickets for 44 runs in 24 overs. Qadir {{remained}} highest wicket taker of the series, taking 12 wickets in three matches conceding 305 runs. Qadir's second Test series, in England in 1978, was an injury-plagued <b>let-down,</b> {{but he was a}} strong and established force by his return in 1982, when his six wickets in the Lord's Test {{played a major role in}} a historic Pakistani victory.

25|$|The {{radio range}} system had {{recently}} been calibrated twice and the commission found {{nothing wrong with the}} navigational aids. On the other hand, the aircraft's equipment had been turned to compass instead of antenna. This would have made the beam north of the cone of silence twenty degrees wide instead of four. Although not decisive, it was cited as giving the pilot a disadvantage in navigation. The aircraft's radio range equipment also lacked a marker beacon receiver, due to lack of sufficient parts. This forced the pilots to manually calculate the distance to the beacon. The crew carried out the procedural turn in the right area, but should, according to their route instruction book, have been at no lower an altitude than , thus the aircraft was too low, caused by the <b>let-down</b> being started too early.|$|E
25|$|New leader, John Alderdice, polled 32.0% of {{the vote}} in East Belfast, while Alliance came within 15,000 votes of both the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin across Northern Ireland. In 1988, in Alliance's keynote post-Anglo Irish Agreement document, Governing with Consent, Alderdice called for a devolved power-sharing government. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, Alliance's vote stabilised at between 7% and 10%. After the IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994, Alliance became the first non-nationalist party to enter into talks with Sinn Féin, as an active {{participant}} in the Northern Ireland peace process negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement, which it strongly supported. Alliance polled poorly in the 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum, and the 1998 election for the Northern Ireland Assembly winning around 6.5% {{of the vote}} each time. This did enable the party to win six seats in the Assembly, although this was somewhat of a <b>let-down</b> given that it had been expected to do much better.|$|E

500|$|However, the song's lyrics were a {{focal point}} for criticism. Andy Gill of The Independent {{dismissed}} it as a [...] "euphemism too far", while Keith Bruce of The Sunday Herald called the song [...] "lyrically awful". Gavin Martin of the Daily Mirror described it a [...] "frisky but a pale reflection of past G.A.Y. disco glories". Hot Press magazine's Pete Murphy felt that the song was a <b>let-down</b> and called it [...] "standard dancefloor fodder veneered with a patina of urban and/or Afro-Caribbean sophistication". A writer for The Scotsman stated that regarded the song as [...] "another of those anonymous, mass-produced party hits sung by a faceless rent-a-vocalist".

500|$|With the {{resumption}} of full League football again in the 1946–47 season, Shankly returned to Preston who held his registration, but he was now 33 and coming {{to the end of}} his playing days. By 1949, he was Preston's club captain but had lost his place in the first team, which was struggling against relegation despite having Tom Finney in the side. Shankly was a qualified masseur and had decided he wanted to become a coach so, when Carlisle United asked him to become their manager in March of that year, he retired as a player and accepted the job. Shankly's departure from Preston was resented by some at the club and he was refused a benefit match, to which he felt entitled. He described Preston's attitude as [...] "the biggest <b>let-down</b> of my life in football".|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine {{reviewer}} Steven Cooper {{described it}} as [...] "a very enjoyable episode", though he noted that [...] "the conclusion {{of the story is}} a slight <b>let-down</b> after the excellence of what has preceded it" [...] because the issues between the Doctor and Jex were left unresolved. Neela Debnath, writing for The Independent, praised the [...] "brilliant twist" [...] in having Kahler-Jex be the villain rather than the Gunslinger. She found the Doctor holding Jex at gunpoint as [...] "completely uncharacteristic", but interpreted it as foreshadowing Amy and Rory's departure. Likewise, Charlie Jane Anders from io9 felt that the Doctor's decision to let Jex die was [...] "out of character". She criticised the Gunslinger for neither simply using its presumably advanced targeting systems to kill Jex or making the townspeople leave so that he would not have human shields. Additionally, according to her, the episode in general [...] "felt [...] like a [...] episode transplanted to the Wild West".|$|E
500|$|Tales of Xillia {{was one of}} the top selling {{games on}} the North American PlayStation Network in August 2013. All English reviewers agreed the battle system was fast and engaging; however, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, GameSpot, and PlayStation Official Magazine panned the map designs calling them repetitive, lifeless and bland. The plot {{received}} neutral to positive reception. Game Revolution wrote [...] "There's a pleasing inertia to the way plotlines form, unfold, and reach a conclusion that propels our heroes ever-forward, never stopping long enough to feel meandering but never feeling rushed or forced either.", praising the narrative {{to be one of the}} qualities to the game. Game Informer described the plot as [...] "investing" [...] and liked the balance in tragic and lighthearted moments. Joystiq lauded the execution of the plot for avoiding the usual JRPG [...] "info dumps" [...] and how small plot-lines intertwined into a larger conflict. PlayStation Official Magazine considered the plot as average and called it a <b>let-down</b> compared to the combat system. Reviewers have also noted the dual-protagonist execution caused incoherency in Milla's story.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Peace on Earth {{met with}} a mixed {{reception}} from music critics. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising it for its [...] "wide appeal" [...] and for having [...] "a cohesive set of songs that brings out the worship aspect of the holidays" [...] and particularly praising [...] "While You Were Sleeping" [...] and [...] "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel". Andrew Greer of CCM Magazine gave it 3 out of 5 stars, regarding it as a <b>let-down</b> {{in comparison to the}} band's previous albums as well as holiday albums that other artists had put out. Russ Breimier of Christianity Today gave it 2 out of 5 stars, describing it as [...] "predictable". However, he praised [...] "While You Were Sleeping" [...] as an example of Mark Hall's [...] "bold, poignant songwriting". Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms gave the album a perfect 10 out of 10 stars, saying that it [...] "bucks all the trends in that it doesn't contain saccharine, sleigh bell-drenched arrangements nor those ghastly songs about Santa and chestnuts roasting in an open fire" [...] and praising it as an [...] "inventive and on occasions brilliant exploration of the wonders of the incarnation". Justin Mabee of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, praising the traditional Christmas songs on the album but criticizing the original songs as having a [...] "forced feel to them, almost like Casting Crowns wanted to do a whole album of traditional songs, but were told differently"; he remarked that [...] "this would have probably worked better, because the originality is lacking in these few original Christmas tunes".|$|E
500|$|... "Father's Day" [...] was {{met with}} a {{generally}} positive reception. Piper stated that this was her favourite episode of the first series, and the most emotionally taxing for her to perform. SFX praised the way the concept of time was explored {{as well as the}} accurate representation of the '80s, and stated that Dingwall gave [...] "one of the series' best performances" [...] as Pete Tyler. However, the reviewer thought that the Reapers were the <b>let-down</b> of the episode, finding that [...] "the episode doesn't feel as much like horror as it should". Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode an A for the emotional impact and the acting. Blumburg did note, however, that there were [...] "enormous logical gaps" [...] involving [...] "glowing TARDIS keys and under-explained paradoxes". In 2013, Radio Times reviewer Mark Braxton described it as [...] "a time-travel tale with immense heart" [...] and highlighted the shift of identification from the Doctor to Rose and the acting of Piper and Dingwall. Braxton, on the other hand, felt that the Reapers were redundant and the episode would have done [...] "equally well if you scythed the Reapers from the script". Reviewing [...] "Father's Day" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins gave it a grade of [...] "A", finding the story powerful. In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith praised the emotion and the dilemma, which he felt was not heavy-handed. He was also positive about the direction and Dingwall's performance, though he felt that removing the Doctor from the plot suggested that he would have done something else to resolve it, and he was not a fan of the scene where the Doctor tells two ordinary people how important their lives are, because it was [...] "cheesy" [...] and [...] "disconnected" [...] {{from the rest of the}} story. Coauthor Graeme Burk was also positive, writing that it may be [...] "the best story this season". He called the direction [...] "wonderful" [...] and the script [...] "sublime", and noted how the story was more about family than time travel.|$|E

When half of the resulting material was set in the Middle Ages, and half was set in the present day, the group opted to focus on the Middle Ages, revolving on the legend of the Holy Grail. By the fourth or fifth version of their screenplay, the story was complete, and the cast joked the fact that the Grail was never retrieved would be [...] "a big <b>let-down</b> ... a great anti-climax".

Nitsuh Abebe of Pitchfork wrote, [...] "She really is pop" [...] before finishing the review with the declaration, [...] "It's a success". Concerning {{the quality of}} the songs, journalist Charlotte Heathcote noted, [...] "Impressively, there's not a <b>let-down</b> track on the album and a perfectionist attention to detail sees synths, strings, wind and percussion used to creative, compelling effect". Simon Price in The Independent shared the same point of view, stating that [...] "Mantaray is a bracing and beautiful blast of ice". In a review rated 4 stars out of 5, The Times observed that her [...] "steely-toned voice is as beguiling as ever". Simarly, The Telegraph critic Andrew Perry noted, [...] "She sounds imperious, passionate". Qs Gary Mulholland published a positive review and said, [...] "Siouxsie voice is as rich and sensual as ever, and lyrical references to rebirth abound". Uncut wrote, [...] "Fortunately [...] she's still the uncompromising outsider at heart". In a review rated 4 out of 5 stars, Metro commented that the 10 songs of her first solo album [...] "do add further depth to her repertoire". Slant Magazine qualified Mantarays sound as [...] "distinctly modern", stating that [...] "it's Siouxsie voice—trembling and echoing all at once—that reaffirms the album's urgency".|$|E
2500|$|The Salt Lake Tribune {{said that}} the album [...] "largely drops the punk-by-numbers that {{dominated}} past efforts {{to get a little}} more personal lyrically, thus becoming more approachable." [...] Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald explained that, [...] "Coming Home pretty much leaves any punk element behind. The songs still rock - just note the wallop delivered by [...] "Hold My Hand" [...] or [...] "Connected." [...] But the band pulls back on the tempos of virtually all of the songs." [...] Scene Point Blank writer Chris Abraham noted, [...] "Coming Home still encompasses the things that make New Found Glory great. Relatable lyrics, hooks so melodic and catchy that my hands are red from not buying a mitt, and, despite a mellower tone, I could still imagine myself going fucking nuts singing along to these songs live." [...] AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate warned that, [...] "it's crucial you abandon any pre-conceived expectations for this album. If you're anticipating the band's previous albums re-hashed, you're going to be completely <b>let-down.</b> While the choruses and sing-a-long hooks could compete with the best on any of their previous albums - it's the slower melodic approach to the songs that truly makes the album come alive and fully breathe." [...] Rae Alexandra of Kerrang! magazine called the album a [...] "massive departure" [...] and suggested that, [...] "NFG are taking what will be, by far, the biggest gamble of their career. Some of you won't even recognise them immediately; it's not fast, it's not forced, but - in an entirely new way - it soars." [...] In an earlier Kerrang! article discussing the album, Alexandra wrote that [...] "It's Not Your Fault" [...] displays [...] "more maturity - and piano - than ever before", while [...] "When I Die" [...] is [...] "low key with orchestral accents", making it [...] "one of the most beautiful moments on Coming Home." [...] Corey Apar of AllMusic was in agreement and stated that [...] "from the album's packaging to the comfortable nature of the music, it actually feels more mature {{in a way that is}} catchy without seeming to care about radio accessibility." ...|$|E

He spoke of his sister Lorna--how he had tried so hard to make her see, and had failed. He importuned Bessy to help him as only a girl could. And lastly, he brought the conversation back to her and told her bluntly what he thought of the vile verses, how she dragged her girlhood pride in the filth and made of herself a byword for vicious boys. He told her the truth of what real men thought and felt of women. Every man had a mother. No war, no unrest, no style, no fad, no <b>let-down</b> of morals could change the truth. From the dark ages women had climbed on the slow realization of freedom, honor, chastity. As the future of nations depended upon women, so did their salvation. Women could never again be barbarians. All this modern license was a parody of love. It must inevitably end in the degradation and unhappiness of those of the generation who persisted on that downward path. Hard indeed it would be to encounter the ridicule of girls and the indifference of boys. But only through the intelligence and courage of one could there ever be any hope for the many.|$|E
