5|$|All true {{caterpillars}} have an upside-down Y-shaped {{line that}} runs {{from the top of}} the head downward. In between the Y-shaped line lies the frontal triangle or frons. The clypeus, located below the frons, lies between the two antennae. The labrum is found below the clypeus. There is a small notch in the centre of the labrum with which the <b>leaf</b> <b>edge</b> engages when the caterpillar eats.|$|E
25|$|The five {{to eight}} fleshy, light-green to reddish, {{elliptic}} to lanceolate leaves form a ground-hugging rosette up to 6cm (2.5in) in diameter. The upper surface of the leaves are sticky from the mucilage secreted by stalked glands covering the leaf surface. Small insects alighting upon this surface are caught by the mucilage, upon which sessile glands embedded in the leaf surface (except for the central vein) secrete digestive enzymes to digest the prey. The leaves of this species are able to further aid digestion by growing such that the <b>leaf</b> <b>edge</b> rolls toward the center, bringing additional glands {{into contact with the}} prey. Most plants are reddish-green in full sun, though some plant will turn completely red while a smaller percentage will remain completely green.|$|E

A great rug--indeed it was a Turkey carpet--four hundred square feet of it, upon which young Redwood was soon to crawl--stretched to the grill-guarded {{electric}} radiator that was to warm the whole place. A man from Cossar's hung amidst scaffolding overhead, fixing the great frame that was to hold the transitory pictures. A blotting-paper book for plant specimens {{as big as a}} house door leant against the wall, and from it projected a gigantic stalk, a <b>leaf</b> <b>edge</b> or so and one flower of chickweed, all of that gigantic size that was soon to make Urshot famous throughout the botanical world ...|$|E

6000|$|... 13. I {{had a long}} bit in my head, that I {{wanted to}} write, about St. George of the Seaweed, but I've no time to do it; and those few words of Tennyson's are enough, if one thinks of them: only I see, in {{correcting}} press, that I've partly misapplied the idea of 'gathering' in the <b>leaf</b> <b>edge.</b> It would be more accurate {{to say it was}} gathered at the central rib; but there is nothing in needlework that will represent the actual excess by lateral growth at the edge, giving three or four inches of edge for one of centre. But the stiffening of the fold by the thorn which holds it out is very like the action of a ship's spars on its sails; and absolutely in many cases like that of the spines in a fish's fin, passing into the various conditions of serpentine and dracontic crest, connected with all the terrors and adversities of nature; not to be dealt with in a chapter on weeds.|$|E
60|$|Get clearly {{into your}} mind {{the nature of}} those two conditions. When a leaf is to be spread wide, like the Burdock, it is {{supported}} by a framework of extending ribs like a Gothic roof. The supporting function of these is geometrical; every one is constructed like the girders of a bridge, or beams of a floor, with all manner of science in the distribution of their substance in the section, for narrow and deep strength; and the shafts are mostly hollow. But when the extending space of a leaf is to be enriched with fulness of folds, and become beautiful in wrinkles, this may be done either by pure undulation as of a liquid current along the <b>leaf</b> <b>edge,</b> or by sharp 'drawing'--or 'gathering' I believe ladies would call it--and stitching of the edges together. And this stitching together, if to be done very strongly, is done round a bit of stick, as a sail is reefed round a mast; and this bit of stick needs to be compactly, not geometrically strong; its function is essentially that of starch,--not to hold the leaf up off the ground against gravity; but to stick the edges out, stiffly, in a crimped frill. And in beautiful work of {113} this kind, which we are meant to study, the stays of the leaf--or stay-bones--are finished off very sharply and exquisitely at the points; and indeed so much so, that they prick our fingers when we touch them; for they are not at all meant to be touched, but admired.|$|E

The flexibility in choosing the weight for path edges versus the weight for <b>leaf</b> <b>edges</b> gives some useful flexibility in modeling. In particular, one can accommodate problems motivated by communications theory such as the “last mile problem. ” Geometric and probabilistic inequalities are developed that lead to a limit theorem that is analogous to the well-known Beardwood, Halton, and Hammersley theorem for the length of the shortest tour through a random sample, but the minimal spanning caterpillars fall outside the scope of the theory of subadditive Euclidean functionals...|$|R
