There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph.

2500|$|Fires can be {{particularly}} dangerous and damaging within an underground system. [...] In October 1972, two trains and a 200m <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnel</b> were completely destroyed when the trains caught fire; the reconstructed tunnel is clearly differentiated from the old one. [...] Another train burned out in the connecting tunnel between Klosterstraße and Alexanderplatz in 1987. [...] On 8 July 2000, the last car of a GI/I train suffered a short circuit, burning out {{at the rear of}} the Deutsche Oper station. [...] The single exit of the station was unreachable, forcing the passengers to run through the tunnel to reach the next emergency exit. [...] The fire also damaged the station, which remained closed until September. [...] The Portuguese Ambassador, João Diogo Nunes Barata, presented the BVG with [...] (tiled paintings), specially designed for the station, by the artist José de Guimarães. [...] Installation of Portugal's gift to the city was completed on 30 October 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Along a 50-metre <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnel,</b> the {{normally}} 0.4-metre thick tunnel lining {{was reduced to}} a mean depth of 0.17metres, with the thinnest area being 0.02metres. [...] The chalk marl showed no signs of failing or collapsing but colliery arches were installed as a precaution. Over a 240-metre long section (70metres towards Britain, 170metres towards France), damage to the concrete extended {{as far back as the}} first set of reinforcement bars. Superficial damage to the surface of the concrete segments was evident along a further 190metres of tunnel length. In the vicinity of the fire, services were destroyed, including high-voltage cables, low-voltage cables, communications, lighting systems, traction and junction boxes over a length of 800metres. Five hundred metres of track had to be replaced, as did 800metres of overhead line, 800metres of refrigeration pipe and signalling equipment over a length of 1,500metres. [...] Four escape cross-passages and five pressure relief ducts had to be refitted with new doors and dampers. The damage was in interval 3. Service through the tunnel restarted using single track working over the parallel interval 4. [...] In a phased re-opening, freight train service was restored on 29 November 1996, followed by Eurostar services on 4 December, and tourist shuttles on 10 December for cars and 6 January 1997 for coaches. Agreement had been reached on the repairs by 24 January 1997. The civil engineering work, repairing the tunnel wall, was completed by the French contractor Freyssinet in 60 days. This was followed by the replacement of the track, overhead line and signalling by Eurotunnel and, completed in less than a month, the tunnel was fully reopened on 15 May 1997.|$|E
60|$|For a {{while the}} imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the tone of {{assurance}} and courage he assumed, completely dominated my mind. I believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader who thinks me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position, reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine, crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening, distracted by apprehension. We talked in this manner through the early morning time, and later crept out of the bushes, and, after scanning the sky for Martians, hurried precipitately to the house on Putney Hill where {{he had made his}} lair. It was the coal cellar of the place, and when I saw the work he had spent a week upon--it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long, which he designed to reach to the main drain on Putney Hill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his powers. Such a hole I could have dug in a day. But I believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at his digging. We had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range. We refreshed ourselves with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry. I found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in my mind, and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I worked there all the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a purpose again. After working an hour I began to speculate on the distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached, the chances we had of missing it altogether. My immediate trouble was why we should dig this long tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of the manholes, and work back to the house. It seemed to me, too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnel.</b> And just as I was beginning to face these things, the artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me.|$|E

5000|$|Falling down {{vertical}} openings is {{the most}} common cause of death and injury in abandoned mines. Winzes are vertical or inclined shafts sunk from a tunnel and these can be hidden by darkness, water, loose debris or false floors.

50|$|When {{work began}} on London Underground's Victoria {{line in the}} early 1960s, {{responsibility}} for the tunnelling works was split between Mott, Hay and Anderson and Sir William Halcrow and Partners, each acting as Engineer for approximately half {{the length of the}} line. MHA partner John Bartlett patented the bentonite-slurry shield tunnel boring machine (UK patent 1083322) and a trial <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnel</b> was drilled successfully through poor ground conditions at New Cross in London.

50|$|As the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnel</b> increases, the {{friction}} {{of the ground}} around the pipe increases as well. Usually, two practices are used to minimize this friction. First, over-cutting is used to give a slight gap between the inner edge of the tunnel and {{the outer edge of}} the liner. Usually this is achieved by using a cutter wheel with a diameter ½ inch (12mm) to 4 inches (100mm) larger than the outside diameter of the liner. Secondly, a lubricant, often bentonite slurry, is injected into this gap. In addition to lubrication, the pressure of the lubricant prevents the gap from collapsing.|$|E
