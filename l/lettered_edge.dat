5000|$|Approximately 63,353 Wreath cents were struck. Early {{specimens}} {{featured a}} stylized [...] "vine/bars" [...] design {{on the edges}} of the planchet, which was identical to that of the earlier Chain cent. Later on, this was changed to a <b>lettered</b> <b>edge</b> reading [...] "". Early American copper collectors generally categorize the coins still further into thirteen different varieties under the Sheldon system. Most of these variations entail relatively minor changes, and often require careful examination to discern. One variety, however, is far more recognizable: the [...] "Strawberry Leaf". On these strikings, the trefoil sprig above the date took the form of a strawberry plant. Only four such specimens are known, and all are heavily circulated. The finest known Strawberry Leaf cent sold at auction for $414,000 in November 2004.|$|E
5000|$|In England, a 1560 {{proclamation}} of Elizabeth I exchanged old debased coins for new pure coins. The Tower Mint added machinery to its hammering for this “great recoinage”. Eloy Mestrelle did the technology transfer from France {{but when the}} great recoinage ended mint authorities found him redundant and in 1578 he was hanged for counterfeiting. [...] In 1632, Charles I employed another French refugee, Nicholas Briot, to improve coinage standards in both England and Scotland, which had its own coinage until 1707, but the English Civil War ended his machine coinage. Yet another Frenchman, Peter Blondeau, provided machinery for a proposed coinage designed by Thomas Simon with Oliver Cromwell’s portrait. The restoration of 1660 ended that, but in 1662 Charles II recalled Blondeau to establish a permanent machine made coinage. He employed a secret process for placing lettering or other designs {{on the edges of}} coins. The inscription chosen for the edge—DECVS ET TVTAMEN, meaning an ornament and a safeguard—refers to the protection against clipping which the <b>lettered</b> <b>edge</b> provided. In accordance with Gresham’s law, however, the inferior hammered coins limited the circulation of his coins until the hammered coins were demonetized in 1695.|$|E
