50|$|Shm-reduplication {{has been}} {{advanced}} {{as an example}} of a natural <b>language</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that cannot be captured by a context-free grammar. The essential argument was that the reduplication can be repeated indefinitely, producing a sequence of phrases of geometrically increasing length, which cannot occur in a context-free language.|$|E

50|$|The Greek {{language}} question (το γλωσσικό ζήτημα, to glossikó zítima) was {{a dispute}} {{about whether the}} language of the Greek people (Demotic Greek) or a cultivated imitation of Ancient Greek (katharevousa) should be the official language of the Greek nation. It was a highly controversial topic in the 19th and 20th centuries and was finally resolved in 1976, when Demotic was made the official language. The <b>language</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in question, which also occurs elsewhere in the world, is called diglossia.|$|E
5000|$|Compare {{this with}} collocation, the quality linking two words or phrases usually {{assumed to be}} within a given span of each other. Keyness is a textual feature, not a {{language}} feature (so a word has keyness in a certain textual context but may well not have keyness in other contexts, whereas a node and collocate are often found together in texts of the same genre so collocation is to a considerable extent a <b>language</b> <b>phenomenon).</b> The set of keywords found in a given text share keyness, they are co-key. Words typically found in the same texts as a key word are called associates.|$|E
5000|$|Ningbo {{speech is}} a dialect of Wu Chinese, and has {{preserved}} {{many aspects of}} ancient Chinese phonology. Its original wording mode {{can be found in}} classical reference books. It can be found that the trisyllable and tetrasyllable phrases or proverbs in Ningbo dialect make it most unusual and dynamic. Moreover, the onomatopoeia, assonance words, collocations, inversions, and other language characteristics within Ningbo dialect all add spice to people's life. After port-opening, the western culture gradually permeated Ningbo, thus the prefix [...] "洋yang" [...] before the nouns of imported goods is a special <b>language</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of Ningbo dialect.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Analysis {{of short}} message corpus is an {{important}} foundation for research of automatic short message processing technology. Based on large scale short message corpus, this paper firstly presents statistical data and performs analysis in detail on basic information of short message corpus and special <b>language</b> <b>phenomena</b> in it. The distributions of the corpus parameters and special <b>language</b> <b>phenomena</b> are also given out. The statistical results presented in the paper are meaningful for research of robust short message understanding and implementation of short message based manmachine dialog system and short message based machine translation system. And we also build an automatic error correction system on mobile phone to correct the misapplication of Chinese character in short messages. The preliminary results show that our method is effective...|$|R

40|$|Communication {{strategies}} {{represent an}} important aspect of second language acquisition research. They are of particular interest for applied linguists, especially psycholinguists and sociolinguists. While the former are interested in viewing these strategies as a part of broader language and cognitive processes as well as general problem – solving mechanisms, the latter approach them as a unique second <b>language</b> <b>phenomenon</b> crucial for solving any interactional problems which may occur in communication between a native speaker and a language learner. This paper, aside from providing a theoretical background to communication strategies, from models of communicative competence to interlanguage processes, presents the results of a research aimed at analysing the use of communication strategies by L 1 Croatian students of English as a foreign language. The results, although inconclusive, suggest that communication strategies should be considered a part of usual language processes, rather than a unique second <b>language</b> <b>phenomenon...</b>|$|E

Second, these representations (including the exponentially smaller ones) describe actual formal languages which successfully model natural <b>language</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> notably in the subfield of phonology. ...|$|E
