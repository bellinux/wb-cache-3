50|$|YellOwStaR's team {{played in}} IEM Season VI - Global Challenge Kiev January 2011. At this event, against All {{authority}} would place third in Group B, going 1-2 by defeating Sypher, then falling to Moscow Five and Team Dignitas. As {{they were unable}} to reach top two in their respective group, aAa was eliminated after the group stage, going home with a 5th-6th-place finish. Their next premier tournament performance occurred at the IEM Season VI - World Championship, where they would make it out of the group stage, to win against SK Gaming then lose versus American teams Team Dignitas and Counter Logic Gaming, eventually taking 4th at the event. Tension and rocky performances at tournaments in the months after, led to YellOwStar and his bot <b>lane</b> <b>support</b> partner, nRated, leaving aAa and rejoining Millenium in June 2012 for a test period. The bot lane for the team was short lived as both players decided to leave the team after their testing period was due, with YellOwStaR going to play for long established European organization, SK Gaming.His first event with the team was European Challenger Circuit: Poland where they made it past groups, but lost their match against CLG EU but were able to best Team Curse EU to achieve 3rd in the tournament. YellOwStaR and his team were granted a huge opportunity to play in the Season Two Regional Finals held in Cologne where the top 3 placing teams would be flown to Los Angeles for the Season 2 World Championship for a chance to play for a $1,000,000 grand prize. SK went an undefeated 4-0, winning a spot in the finals, besting Team Acer Poland and CLG Europe. They faced the fairly new team Moscow Five who had been dominant in tournaments since emergence. YellOwStaR and his team were unable to take a game in the set, ending 2-0, but still placed 2nd overall and earned a spot for the trip to Los Angeles.|$|E

40|$|Today {{a variety}} of Lane Departure Warning systems (LDW) are {{available}} for private cars. These systems alert the driver when the vehicle unintentionally (without use of turn signals) swerve out of the traffic lane or come across the opposite lane. The purpose of these systems is to avoid off-road or head-on accidents caused by inattentive drivers. There is limited evidence of safety effects, however the LDW systems are expected to reduce both the number and severity of accidents caused by inattention, fatigue and alcohol/drugs (Jenssen, 2010). <b>Lane</b> <b>support</b> systems are also assumed {{to have a positive}} effect on traffic flow, and furthermore it has an educational effect by increasing the directional stability and use of turn signals (Jenssen, 2010) Most LDW systems are based on some sort of optical detection of road markings through the use of video cameras. This solution requires visible road markings, and snow, ice and heavy rain can lead to system failure during winter time. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has tested an alternative system for lane departure warning based on RFID technology (WayPilot). As a part of this project, SINTEF was engaged to develop alternative Human Machine Interface (HMI) solutions for the LDW system, and also to evaluate the solutions with regard to user acceptance.

40|$|Run-off-road crashes {{have been}} {{identified}} as a major concern for automobile safety and several advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) targeting run-off-road crashes are on the market today. Assessment of ADASs require relevant test scenarios and valid computational models of driver behaviour. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis has been: (A) define run-off-road test scenarios, and (B) identify a conceptual framework suitable for modelling relevant behavioural mechanisms for crash causation. Cluster analysis was applied to run-off-road crashes from representative in-depth crash data from the German GIDAS database. Nine different clusters were identified, forming a basis for test scenarios. The two largest clusters included crashes relevant for current <b>lane</b> <b>support</b> ADASs (i. e. drift during daytime/night-time), while other clusters suggested that drivers may need support in judging the physical limits of the vehicle (e. g. on snowy rural roads). However, a need for more detailed driver behaviour data was identified. Indeed, naturalistic data, which include more information about driver behaviour in critical situations, may help the definition of test scenarios by linking them to the behavioural mechanisms contributing to the crash causation. This thesis also shows that modelling of driver behaviour may be supported by a framework based on new findings in contemporary neurocognitive science and, specifically, on predictive processing. This new framework improved the interpretation of the clusters and facilitated the formulation of plausible behavioural mechanisms leading to run-off-road crashes...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{dedicated}} bus shoulders {{is a key}} method for implementing bus rapid transit (BRT) in areas {{that do not have}} the space for additional infrastructure. However, the narrow width of the bus shoulder and the need to anticipate traffic hazards in the adjacent lane can both be significant stressors for bus drivers. Bus driver mental workload and stress in response to these conditions should be a significant concern both for operational safety and driver health. This pilot study evaluated the potential stressors of traffic density and shoulder width {{in the context of an}} express BRT service in a large US metropolitan area. In addition, the study considered the potential role of a prototype <b>lane</b> <b>support</b> system (LSS) to support vehicle control within the narrow shoulder boundaries. Ten experienced bus drivers drove an actual route with an instrumented bus equipped with and without LSS. Self-reported effort was recorded along with performance measures of speed and position control relevant to mobility and safety objectives. Bus drivers did note stressors in the BRT environment and the prototype LSS. However, the use of the shoulder during high-density traffic conditions did improve mobility. Moreover, the LSS did enhance safety on the shoulder when there was high-density traffic in the adjacent lane. However, there was no evidence that the LSS reduced bus driver workload while operating in the narrow shoulder. Future research should consider the impact of BRT operations and support systems on bus driver mental workload and stress, and support the deployment of such devices for bus operations on shoulders during high traffic volumes...|$|E
40|$|Despite massive {{research}} efforts {{carried out by}} racing car manufacturers aerodynamics {{is probably the most}} unexplored field in the design of high performance vehicles. Scale wind tunnel testing is still the most effective way {{for the development of a}} new car, CFD codes being at the experimental stage. Wind tunnel engineers produce what is called an “aero map”: a simple graph expressing aerodynamic forces versus ride height. That means, drag, downforce, and relative distribution are measured on an array of front and rear different ride heights. The same concept can be applied to track testing with the use of proper sensors on the real vehicle, such as ground height laser sensors and suspension force transducers. Reading such a map and relating it to static and dynamic suspension characteristics is a vital task for performance optimisation. In the perfect world the centre of pressure would always be in the ideal position anywhere on the track, thus enabling the driver to make the most out of the car. As a matter of fact any unwanted, back and forth movement of the centre of pressure due to pitch and/or heave (e. g. under power, in braking, or on road bumps) affects cornering behaviour: the car can be perceived as difficult and tricky for the driver thus jeopardising performance. A module dedicated to non-linear aerodynamics (called “Aerolap”) has been added to the RCS software for lap time simulation, working in close co-operation with the Minardi Formula 1 and BMS Scuderia Italia teams. The vehicle model can now take into account the effects of ride height variations on aerodynamic forces, as well as non-linear suspension and tire ground stiffness. The user can therefore simulate the impact of set-up modifications on aerodynamic balance along the track as well as on overall performance. The RCS project (presented at the 2000 SAE Motorsports Engineering Conference in Detroit) was conceived as a pit <b>lane</b> <b>support</b> tool for the race engineer, who usually works under pressure in a noisy, stressing environment were things happen –and decisions are taken- all very quickly. Therefore a particular effort was devoted to interface and graphics. Regarding the Aerolap an innovative method was devised for map visualisation as an alternative to the usual contour plot. This seems to enable a far more intuitive correlation with performance results. On the math side two different methods were used to approximate the aero map surface: a Gaussian array and the so-called Akima’s triangles, the former giving more reliable results where extrapolation is required...|$|E

40|$|Designing a new driver {{support system}} {{that meets the}} {{expectations}} of drivers is a difficult and time-consuming process. Despite the availability of various types of design support, it has essentially remained {{a process in which}} designers are forced to make assumptions about what other people want. This paper presents a new approach for determining users' preferences and finding the best compromise between those preferences when designing a new driver support system. Using scenarios, virtual reality simulation, and gaming principles, the new approach gives users a pro-active role in the design process. To evaluate the new approach, it was applied to the design of a <b>lane</b> change <b>support</b> system. This resulted in a hierarchy of information that is a detailed, consistent and reliable image of users' preferences. By combining this hierarchy with a manufacturing and marketing constraint, the design specification of a <b>lane</b> change <b>support</b> system was deduced. One of the many findings was that a <b>lane</b> change <b>support</b> system should be modular and that modules for the left side should be different from modules for {{the right side of the}} vehicle.
