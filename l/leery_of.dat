5|$|Carroll {{received}} a commission from Calvert as the colony's Attorney General on July 18, 1688, and {{arrived in the}} colony in October 1688. En route, Carroll changed his family motto from In fide et in bello forte (strong in faith and war) to Ubicumque cum libertate (anywhere {{so long as there}} be freedom). Soon after he left, the Protestant William of Orange invaded England, James II fled, and Parliament—which had been <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> James' Catholicism—recognized William and his wife Mary as the new King and Queen two weeks after Carroll's arrival in Maryland. This event, known as the Glorious Revolution, had profound implications {{for the future of the}} Maryland colony and for Carroll.|$|E
5|$|The {{enlisted men}} were <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> working with deadly {{explosives}} but {{were told by}} officers that the larger munitions were not active and could not explodethat they would be armed with their fuzes upon arrival at the combat theater. Handling of larger munitions, such as bombs and shells, involved using levers and crowbars from boxcars, {{in which they were}} packed tightly with dunnagelifting the heavy, grease-coated cylinders, rolling them along the wooden pier, packing them into nets, lifting them by winch and boom, lowering the bundle into the hold, then dropping individual munitions by hand a short distance into place. This series of actions was rough enough that damaged naval shells sometimes leaked identification dye from their ballistic caps.|$|E
5|$|On March31 {{the insurgents}} kept their {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E

5|$|Though Patton had ambitions {{to enact}} {{education}} reform {{early in his}} administration, his financial adviser, James R. Ramsey, convinced him to propose a conservative budget in the first legislative session. The two developed a plan to modernize the state government, making it more efficient. State employees were <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> increased efficiency, believing it was a code word for cutting state jobs. Patton dispelled this notion by promising no involuntary layoffs. Patton also anticipated difficulty persuading legislators to invest an estimated $100million in equipment and processes to realize improved efficiency. However, when economists projected a budget surplus for 1996, Patton agreed to invest half of it in capital projects in exchange for using the other half for measures to improve government efficiency. Patton formed an Office for Technology and made improvements in the compatibility and interoperability of the state's computer systems that were recommended by his son, Chris. Investments of $23.3million yielded a return of $300million in state revenue. By the time Patton's efficiency program was fully implemented, the state was realizing an annual return of 75cents for every dollar initially invested.|$|E

He {{followed}} this with the recurring role of Lucky on the NBC series Sisters from 1994 to 1995. Shipp also appeared on stage in the 1990s, starring in Erik Jendresen's The Killing of Michael Malloy in 1993. In 1998, he was cast as Mitch <b>Leery,</b> the father <b>of</b> the lead character Dawson, on The WB drama series Dawson's Creek; Shipp remained part of the series' main cast through its first four seasons, exiting in 2001.|$|R
25|$|Although {{there were}} already {{long-established}} communities along the Hudson River, the New Englanders avoided them as they were <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> the Dutch-descended inhabitants and their language, religion and customs. They organized their congregation in 1790, receiving a two-acre gift from Prevost that restricted the property's future use to educational and religious purposes. It was the first non-Dutch church in the Catskill region.|$|E
25|$|Galveston {{had become}} one of the largest {{shipping}} centers in the nation during the 19th century, but the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 destroyed much of the city and made outside investors <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> continuing to put money into the island.

Attempting to diversify away from shipping, business leaders tried various means of reviving tourism and establishing new enterprises such as insurance.|$|E

Of all the Nazgûl, the Betrayer is amongst the lowest of Sauron's lieutenants, for even the Dark Lord is <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> placing faith in one who betrayed his kin so readily. The Betrayer is another addition to the nine Ringwraiths by Games Workshop, depicted wearing Haradrim armor and a turban around his hood, although his weapon is a western longsword, instead of a Southron's weapon.|$|E
25|$|Gallatin's brief {{stint in}} the Senate was not without consequence. Gallatin had proven to be an {{effective}} opponent of Alexander Hamilton's financial policies, and the election controversy added to his fame. The dispute itself had important ramifications. At the time, the Senate held closed sessions. However, with the American Revolution only a decade ended, the senators were <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> anything which might hint that they intended to establish an aristocracy, so they opened up their chamber for the first time for the debate over whether to unseat Gallatin. Soon after, open sessions became standard procedure for the Senate.|$|E
25|$|When the United States {{began to}} expand {{to the west}} {{and other parts of the}} country, so did the {{distance}} of businesses to their customers. When businesses were close to those who purchased goods or services from them, it was easy for the merchants to extend credit to them, due to their proximity and the fact that merchants knew their customers personally and knew whether or not they would be able to pay them back. As trading distances increased, merchants no longer personally knew their customers and became <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> extending credit to people who they did not know in fear of them not being able to pay them back. Business owners' hesitation to extend credit to new customers led to the birth of the credit reporting industry.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, a middle class had {{developed}} that was <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> both the business elite and the somewhat radical political movements of farmers and laborers in the Midwest and West. Known as Progressives, these people favored government regulation of business practices to, in their minds, ensure competition and free enterprise. Congress enacted a law regulating railroads in 1887 (the Interstate Commerce Act), and one preventing large firms from controlling a single industry in 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act). These laws were not rigorously enforced, however, until the years between 1900 and 1920, when Republican President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909), Democrat President Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921), and others sympathetic to the views of the Progressives came to power. Many of today's U.S. regulatory agencies were created during these years, including the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Ida M. Tarbell wrote a series of articles against the Standard Oil monopoly. The series helped pave the way for the breakup of the monopoly.|$|E
25|$|As promised, Lapchick {{took over}} in 1947, {{bringing}} with him his up-tempo coaching style, which emphasized fast ball movement. Six new players were signed, including guard Carl Braun and Japanese American guard Wataru Misaka, the first non-Caucasian professional basketball player. Under Lapchick, the Knicks made nine straight playoff appearances beginning in 1947. Braun, who averaged 14.3 points, emerged as the team's star and paired with Dick Holub and Bud Palmer to account for half of the team's offense. Despite this, the Knicks struggled throughout the year, compiling a 26–22 record. Their finish {{was good enough to}} place them second in the Eastern Division and secure a playoff match-up against the Baltimore Bullets where they lost the series two games to one. In the 1948 NBA draft, the Knicks selected two future Hall of Fame players in center Dolph Schayes and Harry Gallatin. The Knicks were <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> Schayes' talent, prompting the center to leave to play for the Syracuse Nationals of the struggling National Basketball League. Despite losing Schayes, the team started the year well going 17–8 before they fell into a slump. They ended the year with a seven-game win streak to finish with a 32–28 record and a third-straight playoff appearance. The Knicks defeated the Bullets in a rematch of their previous encounter in 1947, winning the series 2–1. The team however struggled against the Washington Capitols and lost the series 1–2.|$|E

Batman, <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> Superman and Wonder Woman's relationship, tells Superman that he does not have a [...] "Kryptonite" [...] for Wonder Woman in case things get out of control, with Superman being the only one to stop her. The ring is given to Despero, who uses it to attack the Watchtower. When the Justice League recover the ring, they notice a small sliver had been cut out of it.|$|E
500|$|A more {{dangerous}} opponent than Howson was William Aberhart, the Calgary preacher who was proposing {{a form of}} social credit to cure the province's ills. Social credit, the brainchild of British engineer C. H. Douglas, purported {{to bridge the gap}} between a society's production and its purchasing power; Aberhart maintained that this gap was the source of Alberta's economic hardships. Reid was <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> Aberhart though he, like most politicians of the era, pronounced himself in favour of Douglas's philosophy. T. C. Byrne suggests that this expressed support was dishonest, that Reid considered social credit in all of its forms to be [...] "complete nonsense", and paid it [...] only because of its popularity among voters.|$|E
500|$|Though the UFA MLAs {{were not}} willing to accept a non-farmer as premier, many of them {{realized}} that the post of Attorney-General should go to a lawyer. Others were less convinced, and Brownlee was invited to address the UFA caucus. He acknowledged {{that there was no}} constitutional requirement on the question, but advised that a non-lawyer attorney-general would be wholly reliant on the advice of the lawyers on his staff. With the caucus convinced, Greenfield asked Brownlee to accept the position. Brownlee demurred, reluctant to take the resulting cut in income, not eager to leave his family in Calgary to work in Edmonton (the provincial capital), and <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> the high expectations invested in the new government by the province's farmers. [...] Ultimately, a combination of duty, loyalty, and ambition convinced him to accept the position. [...] Though the choice of cabinet ministers is traditionally the prerogative of the premier, as part of the UFA's agenda of democratic reform Greenfield agreed to present his choices to the caucus for vetting. Brownlee was approved August 11, 1921, and was sworn in two days later.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Austin Chronicle Marjorie Baumgarten gave the film {{a rating of}} 4.5 out of five stars, {{concluding}} that it helped unravel myths surrounding the word and describing it as captivating and educational. Steve Schneider reviewed the film for the Orlando Weekly, comparing it to an academic thesis despite its repeated use of off-color humor. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club gave the film a grade of B-minus, stating that Fuck succeeded where Kirby Dick's This Film Is Not Yet Rated did not, by providing viewpoints from multiple perspectives. Karl French wrote in a review for the Financial Times that the documentary was unique and reasonably entertaining. Moira MacDonald asked, in a review for The Seattle Times, if viewers could embrace the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and still be <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> the word's omnipresence in society. Mick LaSalle wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that the commentators seemed monotonous and formulaic in debating freedom of speech, and criticized the film's repetition of the word [...] "fuck".|$|E

[...] In 1919, Edsel Ford (acting {{for his father}} Henry) purchased Rackham's stock for 12.5 million dollars. Rackham's acquired wealth {{had little effect on}} his and Mary's lifestyle. Because Rackham was always cautious with his finances and <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> speculative nature of the stock market, the Great Depression had negligible effect on his fortune. Rackham spent {{the rest of his life}} as a philanthropist, giving money to children's charities, the University of Michigan, and other causes. At the time of his death, Rackham's wealth was valued at an estimated $16.5 million.|$|E

However, as the businessman's enthusiasm grew, so did Goddard's suspicion. Talks eventually broke down as Goddard began to fear his work might be appropriated by the business. However, an Army Signal Corps officer tried to make Goddard cooperate, but he was called off by General George Squier of the Signal Corps who had been contacted by Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Charles Walcott. Goddard became <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> working with corporations and was careful to secure patents to [...] "protect his ideas." [...] These events led to the Signal Corps sponsoring Goddard's work during World War I.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Paramount Television {{purchased}} the {{rights for the}} entire set of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe stories for Orson Welles. Welles had once {{wanted to make a}} series of Nero Wolfe movies, but Rex Stout—who was <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> Hollywood adaptations during his lifetime after two disappointing 1930s films—turned him down. Paramount planned to begin with an ABC-TV movie and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a mini-series. Frank D. Gilroy was signed to write the television script and direct the TV movie on the assurance that Welles would star, but by April 1977 Welles had bowed out. In 1980 the Associated Press reported [...] "the distinct possibility" [...] that Welles would star in a Nero Wolfe TV series for NBC television. Again, Welles bowed out of the project due to creative differences and William Conrad was cast in the role.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935 the UFA {{collapsed}} politically, and [...] Its defeat was in {{part due}} to the John Brownlee sex scandal and {{in part due to}} the government's inability to raise wheat prices or otherwise mitigate the Great Depression in Canada. [...] A prolonged drought in the southern two thirds of the province produced low grain harvests and forced the abandonment and/or foreclosure of thousands of farms, while there and elsewhere in Alberta the financial picture for farmers was harmed by low world prices for grain. Heavily indebted and operating with slim profit margins, farmers were open to theories of banking and monetary reform that had been kicking around western Canada since the start of commercial farming in the 1880s in western Canada. The UFA leadership were <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> such proposals and farmers turned to Aberhart's Social Credit movement as a weapon to do battle against what were seen as grasping bankers and collection agencies.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} May 27, 1967, Rex Stout told author Dick Lochte that Orson Welles had once {{wanted to make}} a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and Stout had turned him down. Disappointed with the Nero Wolfe movies of the 1930s, Stout was <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> Nero Wolfe film and TV projects in America during his lifetime: [...] "That's something my heirs can fool around with, if they've a mind to," [...] he said. In 1976, a year after Stout's death, Paramount Television purchased the rights for the entire set of Nero Wolfe stories for Orson Welles. Paramount paid $200,000 for the TV rights to eight hours of Nero Wolfe. The producers planned to begin with an ABC-TV movie and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a mini-series. Frank D. Gilroy was signed to write the television script ("The Doorbell Rang") and direct the TV movie on the assurance that Welles would star, but by April 1977 Welles had bowed out. Thayer David was cast as Wolfe in the 1977 TV movie.|$|E

These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people.

2500|$|The company's {{cash flow}} had {{decreased}} by over $120 million annually during the Shapiro years. In October 2008, Six Flags was warned its stock value had fallen below the required minimums to remain {{listed on the}} New York Stock Exchange. With the financial crisis of 2007–08 weighing both on consumer spending {{and the ability to}} access credit facilities, Six Flags was believed to be unable to make a payment to preferred stockholders due in August 2009. Management saw the business as a sound one, noting that attendance across the company's parks increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007. Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said that the company's problem was the declining attendance and cash flow created by his new management initiatives [...] If not resolved, the company warned in its 2008 annual report that the situation might require a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, with Six Flags already retaining counsel should that occur. The company stated at the time that it expected business to continue as normal in the event of such a filing, although one analyst believed attendance at the company's parks would decrease by six percent, suggesting parents would be <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> letting their children ride a roller coaster operated by a bankrupt company. In April 2009, the New York Stock Exchange announced it would delist Six Flags' stock on April 20, a decision that the company did not intend to appeal. On June 1, 2009, Six Flags announced they would delay their $15million debt payment further using a 30-day grace period. Less than two weeks later, on June 13, the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but issued a statement that the parks would continue to operate normally while the company restructured. On August 21, 2009, Six Flags' Chapter 11 restructuring plan was announced in which lenders would control 92% of the company in exchange for cancelling $1.13billion in debt.|$|E
2500|$|Later, the Eleventh Doctor {{entered his}} own {{timeline}} in [...] "The Name of the Doctor" [...] to rescue his companion Clara Oswald, {{and while there}} observed a past incarnation portrayed by John Hurt, one whose actions caused him to be unworthy of the name [...] "Doctor" [...] and viewed as shameful by his future selves. In the 50th anniversary special, [...] "The Day of the Doctor", the Eleventh Doctor encounters both the Tenth Doctor and the War Doctor (played by John Hurt). [...] The Tenth and Eleventh Doctors are generally amicable towards each other, despite bickering, although the War Doctor treats them both as behaving too childishly. Despite this, he does come to admire both of his future incarnations, working together with them and eventually choosing {{to go through with}} the act of destroying Gallifrey because he knows it will help them become what they are. The Tenth and Eleventh are initially <b>leery</b> <b>of</b> the War Doctor, the Eleventh describing him as the [...] "one life I have tried very hard to forget." [...] However, both of them later recognise that the War Doctor followed what seemed to be the only course open to him, and are even willing to help him carry it out so that he won't have to suffer the guilt alone. Fortunately, with influence from the Moment [...] a sentient Time Lord weapon that brought about their meeting [...] the three are able to stumble upon an alternative: sending Gallifrey into a pocket universe, making it seem as though it has been destroyed. The three are then joined by the other nine previous Doctors and the future Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) in this act (the War, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors having evidently contacted them off-screen). The Eleventh Doctor is shown to have memories of these events, but only recalls them after they have begun. This is explained in dialogue as an instability in the timeline, which causes the War and Tenth Doctors to forget their meeting, thus maintaining the continuity in which the Doctors from the War Doctor onwards believe themselves to have destroyed Gallifrey.|$|E
