5|$|Esbjerg Station is {{operated}} by Danish State Railways. The station is the western terminus of InterCity trains from Copenhagen (operating once an hour), with a journey time of about three hours. DSB also operates <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> to Fredericia. Arriva operates the Vestbanen with <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> travelling south to Ribe and Tønder and north to Struer.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{intercity}} {{trains to}} London Euston, Birmingham New Street, Manchester Piccadilly, Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley, {{the station is}} served by <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> to most parts of Lancashire, and parts of Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|The Jackson Heights–Roosevelt Avenue shell, a two-trackbed island-platformed station, {{would have}} been for <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> {{terminating}} at the station. Express trains would have stopped at the lower level (IND Queens Boulevard Line) platforms.|$|E

5000|$|There are no <b>local</b> <b>train</b> {{services}} between [...] and , {{since the}} line runs through practically unpopulated areas. There is a <b>local</b> <b>train</b> service between [...] and [...] (via Shin-Yūbari), with one train approximately every 2 hours.|$|R
50|$|The express {{which was}} {{travelling}} at around 60‒65 mph, {{collided with the}} rear end of a <b>local</b> <b>train</b> which had just {{pulled away from the}} station, and was travelling at around 30‒35 mph. The rear coach of the <b>local</b> <b>train</b> was wrecked in the collision and two more were overturned. One passenger in the <b>local</b> <b>train</b> was killed and 25 injured. The locomotive of the express overturned and the driver suffered severe shock.|$|R
5|$|The {{system is}} {{integrated}} with other public transport in Copenhagen. There is {{transfer to the}} S-train at Vanløse, Flintholm and Nørreport, to DSB's <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> at Nørreport, Ørestad and Lufthavnen, and to Copenhagen Airport at Lufthavnen. There are transfers to Movia bus services at all but four stations.|$|E
5|$|Kings Cross {{came into}} the {{ownership}} of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) following the Railways Act 1921. The LNER made improvements to various amenities, including toilets and dressing rooms underneath what is now platform 8. The lines through the Gas Works tunnels were remodelled between 1922 and 1924 and improved signalling {{made it easier to}} manage the increasing number of <b>local</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Local</b> <b>trains</b> began {{serving the}} {{partially}} completed station from 2 October 1874, {{and it was}} fully opened on 1 November 1875, at a final cost of over £2million. The original City terminus at Bishopsgate closed to passengers and was converted {{for use as a}} goods station from 1881. This continued until it was destroyed by fire in 1964.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} no longer {{accessible}} from the street, but its graffiti-covered walls can be seen {{through the windows of}} any Lexington Avenue <b>local</b> <b>train,</b> as well as from express <b>trains</b> if no <b>local</b> <b>train</b> blocks the view.|$|R
50|$|Local {{services}} {{along the}} line are roughly divided into three segments. In the segment between Asahikawa and Kamikawa, the line functions as a commuter rail of Asahikawa City. There is one <b>local</b> <b>train</b> service per one to two hours. The segment between Kamikawa and Engaru is a sparsely populated area. Between Kakikawa and Shirataki, a <b>local</b> <b>train</b> runs one lap per day. For the segment between Engaru and Abashiri, there is one <b>local</b> <b>train</b> service per one to two hours.|$|R
50|$|Bahnhof Unterhausen is the <b>local</b> <b>train</b> station.|$|R
5|$|On 11 April 2006, a house {{collapsed}} next to {{a railway}} line near London which caused Eurostar services to have to terminate and start from Ashford International instead of London Waterloo. Passengers waiting at Waterloo International were initially directed on to <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> towards Ashford leaving from the adjacent London Waterloo East railway station, until overcrowding occurred at Ashford.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} four tracks at Lysaker will allow NSB to run all <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> that {{previously}} have run to Skøyen {{all the way}} to Lysaker. The closed Høvik Station will be used to turn trains. The Oslo Tunnel remains the bottleneck west of Oslo, so no more trains can run westwards, although more will be able to continue past Skøyen.|$|E
5|$|There are {{regular train}} {{services}} {{from other parts}} of the UK to the south west, principal destination stations being Barnstaple, Exeter, Newquay, Penzance, Plymouth and Weymouth. From these places <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> or buses connect to many points of the path. Airports at Bournemouth, Exeter and Newquay are served from a range of national and international destinations.|$|E

5|$|A 1999 DEIS only {{proposed}} new subway service from 63rd Street north up Second Avenue to 125th Street via the Broadway Line to Lower Manhattan, with local and express tracks being {{switched on the}} Broadway Line. Second Avenue express trains would run to Lower Manhattan via the Montague Street Tunnel and <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> would run via the Manhattan Bridge and skip Lower Manhattan. A spur to Grand Central Terminal was considered, but later dropped due to its infeasibility.|$|E
5|$|After construction, {{the station}} {{served as the}} PRR's sole Philadelphia stop for most long-distance east-west Main Line traffic to avoid a reverse move into Broad Street Station (and later 30th Street Station). It also served <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> from Fort Washington, Chestnut Hill, Bustleton, and Trenton, {{as well as a}} variety of {{services}} from the PRR-owned West Jersey and Seashore Railroad system. Within a decade of completion, the station was already overcrowded. On June 22, 1912, the PRR signed a million-dollar contract for massive renovations to the station. Designed by PRR architect William H. Cookman, the modifications reflected the latest in passenger station design.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{airport site}} to Gardermoen was proposed at Hurum, south-west of Oslo. Had Hurum been chosen, the Gardermoen Line {{would not have}} been necessary for the airport express train, but the planning documents recommended that construction still proceed to ease traffic congestion north of Oslo. The tunnel is used by all trains on the Gardermoen Line, including the Flytoget airport express, and the regional and express trains which continue via the Dovre Line. <b>Local</b> <b>trains</b> on the Hoved Line and Kongsvinger Line to the north also use the tunnel. Use of the Hoved Line is limited to freight trains and commuter trains which make stops along the route.|$|E

5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves <b>local</b> <b>trains,</b> while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, {{there is no room for}} a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
5|$|From 18 November 1945, {{the daily}} Oslo–Bergen trains again ran via Roa, while the <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> from Oslo to Hønefoss {{increased}} to three daily round trips. Three weekly night trains were introduced from 1946. From 2 January to 1 May 1947, there was four weekly express services from Oslo to Geilo on the Bergen Line. By 1950, {{the situation had}} normalized and there were daily day and night trains and three weekly express trains—the latter with no stops between Hønefoss and Oslo. Kvellsrud Station opened on 18 August 1952.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, NSB {{launched}} a new branding scheme for their trains. In addition to Puls for <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> and Agenda for regional trains, the Signatur ("Signature") concept was introduced for intercity trains. Signatur would only be used on the Class 73 services, and consist of two classes, Comfort and Comfort Plus. NSB abolished its branding of only having red trains, and introduced a blue and silver livery on the Class 73 trains. The new service had fewer stops and faster travel times. To {{take advantage of the}} faster speeds, the Norwegian National Rail Administration needed to do upgrades to the track, overhead wires and signaling for NOK1.2 billion.|$|E

5|$|On 15 February 2010, {{services}} between Brussels and London {{were interrupted}} following the Halle train collision, this {{time after the}} dedicated HSL 1 lines {{in the suburbs of}} the Belgian capital were blocked by debris from a serious train crash on the suburban commuter lines alongside. No efforts were made to reroute trains around the blockage; Eurostar instead terminated services to Brussels at Lille, directing passengers to continue their journey on <b>local</b> <b>trains.</b> Brussels services resumed on a limited scale on 22 February.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth railway station, {{which opened}} in 1877, is managed by Great Western Railway and also sees trains on the CrossCountry network. Smaller {{stations}} are served by <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> on the Tamar Valley Line and Cornish Main Line. First Great Western have come under fire recently, due to widespread rail service cuts across the south-west, which affect Plymouth greatly. Three MPs from the three main political parties {{in the region have}} lobbied that the train services are vital to its economy.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1989 {{there were}} four <b>local</b> <b>trains</b> in each {{direction}} from Oslo to Hønefoss; followed by on rush hour service each, but this single service has since been terminated; mainly due to quicker travel times by coaches. The Ringerike Line would allow the Oslo Commuter Rail once again to serve Ringerike; other places served usually have one hourly service, with additional services in rush hour. Reducing travel time from Hønefoss to Oslo to 30 minutes would probably cause larger population growth in Ringerike.|$|E
