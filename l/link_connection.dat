500|$|Xbox {{division}} head Phil Spencer {{had also}} hinted {{the possibility of}} adding support for games from the original Xbox. For the backwards compatibility team, after they completed the framework for Xbox 360 compatibility so that other engineering teams could take over, they turned {{to the question of}} compatibility with the original Xbox console. The program was started in November 2016, under the code name [...] "Fusion", and was led by software engineer Spencer Perreault. Perreault initially tried the same approaches as the team had done with [...] "Fission", but due to the differences in memory management sizes and chipset bit-rates, these initial tests failed. Instead, Perreault worked to bring [...] "Dolphin", a developer tool for the original Xbox, working to get its emulation correct. La Chapelle brought in a number of personal Xbox titles to test in Perreault's emulation, getting about a 10% [...] "hit rate" [...] on successes, though the variety of failures helped Perreault to identify common problems, and within a month, had improved the successful hit rate to about 90%. As with Xbox 360 backwards compatibility, the Fusion emulation enables Xbox games to be scaled to 1080p resolutions, work with Xbox One networking features, and can allow mixed-console System <b>Link</b> <b>connection</b> between all three generations of Xbox.|$|E

50|$|While {{the exact}} {{mechanics}} of a forwarding table is implementation-specific, the general model is that frame relay switches have statically defined forwarding tables, one per interface.

50|$|As {{these cells}} {{traverse}} an ATM network, switching takes place {{by changing the}} VPI/VCI values (label swapping). Although the VPI/VCI values are not necessarily consistent {{from one end of}} the connection to the other, the concept of a circuit is consistent (unlike IP, where any given packet could get to its destination by a different route than the others). ATM switches use the VPI/VCI fields to identify the virtual channel link (VCL) of the next network that a cell needs to transit on its way to its final destination. The function of the VCI is similar to that of the data <b>link</b> <b>connection</b> identifier (DLCI) in frame relay and the logical channel number and logical channel group number in X.25.|$|E
50|$|Xlink Kai {{supports}} Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Xbox and Xbox 360 LAN enabled games. It features integrated chat lobbies {{in which}} players can meet and converse prior to starting a game session. Clan, tournament and ladder lobbies are also integrated for some games. A list of compatible games {{can be found}} on the Team-XLink website. Special considerations have been made for the Xbox 360, which is designed by Microsoft to be incompatible with this kind of software. The console will automatically drop connections if the ping is > 30 milliseconds in a system <b>link</b> <b>connection.</b> However a patch has been released to bypass this limit on modified consoles. At one point support for the Nintendo DS was planned, but was never completed.|$|E

In 2 to 8 player link-ups, each player, like in solo player mode, takes command of one specific instrument in the music piece. Each player in the group {{is part of a}} band, and must play the song together as a group, and the better each player follows along, the more in tune the song comes through. Every note played, right or wrong, can be heard on the other players' systems, and if every single part in the song is played by a human absolutely nothing will be automated. Scores are measured by percentage of notes hit, each players percentage is represented by a balloon in the bottom screen. This lets everyone know how they are doing in comparison to their friends score.|$|E
