5|$|Killer whales {{have good}} {{eyesight}} {{above and below}} the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family.|$|E
5|$|The chicks hatch 12–14days after {{incubation}} begins. Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and closed eyes. The mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing {{the growth of}} olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush {{rather than}} a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> and {{stalking}} prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses {{as large as a}} heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.|$|E

25|$|Birdwatching, or birding, {{is a form}} of {{wildlife}} observation in which the observation of birds is a recreational activity.

Today, the program is heard on more than 600 stations in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Guam.|$|E

25|$|Another {{application}} was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were {{mounted on the}} torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo left-right and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo went after the noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with active sonar – a transducer {{was added to the}} torpedo nose, and the microphones were <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows.|$|E
25|$|A {{receiver}} <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> {{these signals}} and displaying them on an oscilloscope {{will see a}} series of blips on the display. By measuring {{the distance between the}}m, the delay between the two signals can be calculated. For instance, a receiver might measure the distance between the two blips to represent a delay of 0.5ms. This implies that the difference in the distance to the two stations is 150km. In this case there are an infinite number of locations where that delay could be measured – 75km from one station and 225 from the other, or 150km from one and 300 from the other, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Situs inversus {{is found}} in about 0.01% of the population, or about 1 person in 10,000. In the most common situation, situs inversus totalis, it {{involves}} complete transposition (right to left reversal) {{of all of the}} abdominal organs. The heart is not in its usual position in the left chest, but is on the right, a condition known as dextrocardia (literally, right-hearted). Because the relationship between the organs is not changed, most people with situs inversus have no medical symptoms or complications, although they should wear a medical identification tag to warn emergency medical staff that the patient's internal organs are reversed from normal so they can act accordingly, e.g. by <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> a heartbeat on the right rather than left side of the chest.|$|E

25|$|Rosewater {{was also}} {{the site of the}} AdelaideRadio (VIA) {{maritime}} radio station system, the sixth built in Australia and one of 19 around the country. Opened 1 October 1912 it operated from 8am to midnight every day of the week, {{and was one of the}} first points of contact for ships sailing south from Hong Kong and Japan. Apart from its major function of <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> ships' messages, Adelaide also handled traffic to and from the State telegraph system, and broadcast time signals to shipping. By 1963 the rapid industrialisation of the Rosewater area had increased electrical interference to the point where a move to a new site became necessary and the operation was moved to McLaren Vale where it operated until 1993 when it was shut down.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 Konstantīns Raudive wrote Breakthrough, {{detailing}} what {{he believed}} was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP {{has been described as}} auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that one when the first sound (word or syllable) is coming from the speaker on the left, the second sound is coming from the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect what is on the listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.|$|E
500|$|Listening to shortwave {{broadcast}} {{stations for}} {{news and information}} programming is common, but for many shortwave listeners (abbreviated as [...] "SWLs"), {{the goal is to}} receive as many stations from as many countries as possible, also known as DXing. [...] "DXers" [...] routinely test the limits of their antenna systems, radios and radio propagation knowledge. Specialized interests of shortwave listeners may include <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> shortwave utility, or [...] "ute", transmissions such as shipping, sailing, naval, aviation, or military signals, <b>listening</b> <b>for</b> intelligence signals (numbers stations), or tuning in amateur radio stations.|$|E

500|$|An extinct, giant {{relative}} of the living aye-aye, the giant aye-aye shared {{at least two of}} the aye-aye's bizarre traits: ever-growing central incisors and an elongated, skinny middle finger.
