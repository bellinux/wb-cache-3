5|$|During the 2nd centuryBC, Roman {{territory}} saw {{an overall}} decline in population, partially {{due to the}} huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes into <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> of the census and the proletarii. As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers {{at the expense of}} the state, since many of the soldiers who made up its <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> were now impoverished proletarii in all but name, and were too poor to afford their own equipment.|$|E
5|$|In {{another example}} of {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> and upper classes, but because <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> {{want to look like}} the upper classes, they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.|$|E
5|$|Although Sunday schools such as {{the ones}} {{established}} by Trimmer have often been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> Thomas Laqueur has argued that the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E
25|$|Lower-class {{families}} are disproportionately {{made up of}} single mother households. According to Kathryn Edin, {{this is because of}} the lack of incentive to marry other <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> men among <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> women, and the desire to save marriage for more quality prospects. Unlike middle <b>class</b> women, <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> women do not have the same financial and marriage incentives to marry especially in the face of likely divorce. As a result, <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> mothers have less incentive to delay their childbearing to later years. Many of the problems shared by single parents are disproportionately felt by the <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> for these very reasons.|$|R
50|$|Of {{course there}} are {{examples}} of <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> Mexicans within the family as well. Lena, for example, has <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> friends {{and the fact that}} she does not care about family pride makes her an outsider of the family. Mema is often seen as <b>lower</b> <b>class,</b> because she has got an illegitimate child, whom she loves very much, though. Angie is a <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> Mexican because of her looks and her accent. As Maria is not educated, she seems to be a <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> Mexican as well. Still, she is wise enough to figure out what Miguel Chico needs. Therefore, Maria is able to teach him about joy, religion and love.|$|R

5|$|Etty was {{the first}} British artist to specialise in the nude, and the prurient {{reaction}} of the <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.

5|$|In 1833, William {{signed a}} new {{constitution}} for Hanover, which empowered the middle class, gave limited power to the <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> and expanded {{the role of the}} parliament of Hanover. The constitution was revoked after William's death by the new king, William's brother, Ernest Augustus.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} end of the first {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, there were efforts by the authorities to stem the upward pressure on wages and prices, with parliament passing the emergency Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. The efforts to regulate the economy continued as wages and prices rose, putting pressure on the landed classes, and in 1363 parliament attempted unsuccessfully to centrally regulate craft production, trading and retailing. A rising amount of the royal courts' time was involved in enforcing the failing labour legislation – as much as 70% by the 1370s. Many land owners attempted to vigorously enforce rents payable through agricultural service rather than money through their local manor courts, leading to attempts by many village communities to legally challenge local feudal practices using the Domesday Book as a legal basis for their claims. With the wages of the <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> still rising, the government also attempted to regulate demand and consumption by reinstating the sumptuary laws in 1363. These laws banned the <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> from consuming certain products or wearing high-status clothes, and reflected the significance of the consumption of high-quality breads, ales and fabrics as a way of signifying social class in the late medieval period.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lower</b> social <b>class</b> (or {{socioeconomic}} status) {{is associated}} with fewer resources, greater exposure to threat, and a reduced sense of personal control. Given these life circumstances, one might expect <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> individuals to engage in less prosocial behavior, prioritizing self-interest over the welfare of others. The authors hypothesized, by contrast, that <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> individuals orient {{to the welfare of}} others as a means to adapt to their more hostile environments and that this orientation gives rise to greater prosocial behavior. Across 4 studies, <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> individuals proved to be more generous (Study 1), charitable (Study 2), trusting (Study 3), and helpful (Study 4) compared with their upper class counterparts. Mediator and moderator data showed that <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> individuals acted in a more prosocial fashion because of a greater commitment to egalitarian values and feelings of compassion. Implications for social class, prosocial behavior, and economic inequality are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Most {{educators}} and policy-makers believe that <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> size means better education. It ain’t neces-sarily so, according to Solmon and Firetag. In fact, most research is inconclusive, {{or at least}} highly situational. As the authors write “At most one can conclude that Class Size Reduction produces gains in the lowest grades, in the poorest schools and in certain subjects, ” {{but there are no}} more gen-eral improvements. <b>Lower</b> <b>class</b> size is unlikely to bring improvements unless coupled with changes in teaching methods. Further, initia-tives to <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> size force school systems to hire more teachers, which may weaken teacher quality. As a charter school operator, your school might work better with 10 great, well paid teachers than with 15 pretty good, pretty well paid teachers.

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and the <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b> The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E
5|$|Other critics emphasise {{that the}} letter's object, Lord Molesworth, was {{targeted}} to bind the higher and <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> together. Using Molesworth, a religious dissenter, a nobleman, and {{the opposite of}} Swift, the Drapier unites all of the various people of Ireland in a common nationalist cause. Instead of defending charges against himself, the Drapier is calling up more support for the Irish cause; he seeks attention so that the greater liberty of Ireland will be respected.|$|E
5|$|Such {{measures}} impelled Pericles' {{critics to}} hold him responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy. Constantine Paparrigopoulos, a major modern Greek historian, argues that Pericles sought for the expansion and stabilization of all democratic institutions. Hence, he enacted legislation granting the <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> access to the political system and the public offices, from which they had previously been barred.|$|E
40|$|A current {{vocabulary}} of argot terms and meanings was collected from a Black male control {{group in the}} South Central Los Angeles ghetto. This lexicon was used to elicit and compare responses from 5 male groups of youths between 15 and 20 years old. Two of the groups consisted of <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> blacks separated geographically. The other groups were composed of middle class Blacks, middle <b>class</b> whites, and <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> whites. The data confirmed {{the existence of a}} well-formed argot known to all members of the South Central group. Although <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> whites live in close proximity, their knowledge of the argot was limited. <b>Lower</b> <b>class</b> Blacks in Venice, over 10 miles away, demonstrated a mastery of the argot. Middle class Blacks were not as fluent in the argot as <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> Blacks, but their facility was greater than either of the white groups. Those in the white and middle class Black group familiar with the argot were linked through illegal or anti-social life experiences. (Author/RS) U S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH...|$|R

50|$|In {{another study}} {{conducted}} by Bayton regarding race and class, 80 Black and 74 White college {{students were asked to}} assign traits (chosen from a list of 80 adjectives) to describe the Black <b>lower</b> <b>class,</b> the Black middle <b>class,</b> the White <b>lower</b> <b>class,</b> and the White middle class. The students were asked to choose five or fewer traits for each group and rate the traits on a scale from -5 to +5. Both Whites and Blacks assigned more advantageous traits to the middle as opposed to the <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> (though the effect was larger for White subjects).|$|R
5|$|The {{hundreds}} of villae found in Switzerland, some very luxurious, {{attest to the}} existence of a wealthy and cultured upper class of landowners. Many villae belonged not to Roman immigrants, but to members of the Celtic aristocracy who continued to hold their lands and their rank after the Roman conquest. Of the <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> much less is known, although there are inscriptions attesting {{to the existence of}} guilds (collegia) of boat skippers, doctors, teachers and traders, {{as well as to the}} existence of a trade in slaves.|$|E
5|$|This Joker's Card is a {{representation}} of the ghettos and the violence that occurs within them.

5|$|While some nudes {{existed in}} private collections, England had no {{tradition}} of nude painting and the display {{and distribution of}} nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice.

5|$|There is {{difficulty}} in labeling the trobairitz as either amateurs or professionals.

5|$|Al-Qassam {{concentrated}} {{his activities}} on the <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> setting up a night school for casual laborers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, {{and later in the}} Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek them out on the streets, in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, disco, a form {{of dance}} music, was {{becoming}} popular, evolving from underground dance clubs to mainstream America. Disco reached its zenith following the release of Saturday Night Fever and the phenomenon surrounding the movie and the soundtrack by The Bee Gees. Disco's time was short, however, and by 1980 was soon replaced {{with a number of}} genres that evolved out of the punk rock scene, like new wave. Bruce Springsteen became a major star, first in the mid to late 1970s and then throughout the 1980s, with dense, inscrutable lyrics and anthemic songs that resonated with the middle and <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, the interwar {{years and}} World War II, {{widespread}} poverty in Malta prevented {{the children of}} the <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> from pursuing basic education in favor of staying home to assist parents with agricultural work and other income earning activities. To counteract this phenomenon, education was declared compulsory in 1946. In 1964, Malta became an independent nation, and in 1988 a new Education Act was passed, lowering the compulsory education age to five years, decentralising educational decision making and establishing a right for any person to apply for a licence to open a school. The Faculty of Arts, Sciences and Theology at the University of Malta was also reinstated.|$|E

These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government in Syria and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq to have only employed Aflaq's ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.|$|E
