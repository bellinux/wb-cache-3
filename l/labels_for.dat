5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> IQ score ranges {{are specific to}} each brand of test. The test publishers {{do not have a}} uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor do they have a consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into categories of the same size or with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E

5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E

In a more grim case, the terms war dove and war hawk have been re-purposed as <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> two opposing political factions divided over the ongoing mutual hostility between birds and the human minority: the altruistic Dove Party, who advocate for cooperation and peace between the two groups, and the militant Hawk Party, whose goal is to exterminate humanity altogether. By the time Hatoful Boyfriends narrative begins, the Dove Party, the Hawk Party, and their respective schools of thought dominate much of the world's politics.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Compact Disc, the various <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> which Horowitz {{recorded}} began reissuing his pre-digital recordings. This began in the mid-1980s and increased in the years immediately following Horowitz’s death. Beginning in 1987, Columbia issued single-composer compilations drawn from various albums. RCA Victor issued many of Horowitz’s recordings on their Gold Seal mid-priced label. By 1993, both Columbia's and RCA's entire cache of previously issued recordings was available on CD, including several older items which had never appeared on LP. A number of items were issued more than once, including the 1978 recording of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 which was issued on CD in 1987, again in 1993, with a new cover, and in a new remastering in 2000. Over the past two decades, several previously unavailable Horowitz recordings have been issued. These include studio and live recordings from the Columbia era, and a collection from Carnegie Hall recitals between 1945 and 1951 which were recorded privately by Horowitz. In addition, several smaller labels have issued CDs made from bootleg recordings from the 1960s onward and several of Horowitz’s stereo recordings have been issued in the blu-spec and SHM-CD (Super High Material) formats.|$|E

Although approximately 75 per cent of PBLs <b>label</b> <b>for</b> either a- or b-group allotypes, the number of immunoferritin grains on the cell surface after <b>labelling</b> <b>for</b> b group allotypes is nearly twice as great as that observed after <b>labelling</b> <b>for</b> a group allotypes. We conclude that essentially all Ig-bearing blood lymphocytes of the rabbit express both heavy chains (a allotypes) and light chains (b allotypes) on their surface membranes, but that light chain allotypic determinants are more accessible or exposed than the heavy chain (Fd) allotypic determinants...|$|R
