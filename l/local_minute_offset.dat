40|$|Abstract − The {{purpose of}} this study is {{establishment}} of the high precision transmittance measurement technology (accuracy: 0. 01 %) of the large diameter lens(material: CaF 2, diameter: Φ 200 mm) for ultraviolet rays (wavelength: 193 nm). Transmittance measurement method with photoacoustic spectroscopy 1) is proposed. This technology depends on only photothermal spectroscopy at a <b>local</b> <b>minute</b> area and is independent of lens size. So this proposed method can be applied to large diameter lens. And measurment time at one point is extremely short. So the superiority of this new method is that the transmittance distribution in-plane can be easily measured. It was experimentally verified that this photoacoustic spectroscopy could be applicable to large diameter lens...|$|R

40|$|There {{appear in}} the wood of Entandrophragma, beside the basic {{interlocked}} grain, <b>local</b> <b>minute</b> undulations of grain the manifestation of which are checkered figures, either slanting or horizontal, on the radial face of boards. In reference to the model the slanting checkered figure is interpreted {{as the result of}} sudden appearance in the cambium of a wave of orientational tendency (morphogenetic wave) of relatively short wavelengths and stabilized amplitude from the moment of its appearance, moving vertically. This wave induces undulations in the arrangement of cambial initials. The undulation pattern also moves, however, its rate is half that of the morphogenic wave rate. The amplitude of the undulations oscillates between a maximal value and null which means that in successive wood layers there is wavy grain alternating with straight grain. The horizontal checkered figure may be explained by a local shift of the prase by one half of the period of the morphogenic wave of relatively long wavelengths underlying the interlocked grain formation...|$|R

40|$|In {{these past}} few decades, huge numbers of {{technologies}} {{have been developed for}} wastewater treatment. The scale of these technologies is also very diverse, from a basic aeration pond, to a more sophisticated nanotechnology based treatment system. In this research, dye removal from aqueous solution by adsorption was studied in batch and continuous mode. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) type adsorption unit for continuous dye removal from aqueous solution. The investigated parameters are the effect of adsorbent dose, and residence time on the performance of CSTR in treating synthetic Methylene Blue (MB) wastewater by using tea waste (TW). The equilibrium batch and kinetic study has been performed to characterize the adsorbent-adsorbate system. For the CSTR adsorption test, the adsorbent was added at suitable time intervals while the residence time and adsorbent dosage is varied. The Langmuir isotherm data obtained with varying MB concentrations fits the isotherm with an R 2 of 0. 99. The Langmuir parameters from the experiment were a Q (mg/g) of 68. 02 and K (L/mg) of 0. 385 while the RL value was 0. 017, assuring a favourable adsorption. Next, the kinetics data were fitted with Unified Approach Model and the adsorption and desorption rate constants were determined to be 1. 00 E- 8 ± 3. 00 E- 9 and 2. 60 E- 8 respectively. It was also found that the kinetic rate constants were initial concentration independent. Lastly, the CSTR adsorption study data was very comparable to the theoretical line predicted with the CSTR model, with very <b>minute</b> <b>offsets</b> from theoretical predictions. The maximum achievable utilization coefficient, ηmax was found to be 78 % for TW-MB system, where higher utilization coefficient attributes to the higher adsorption capacity and better performanc...|$|R

Thirty-two hereditary hypercho-lesterolemic (KHC) rabbits underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary artery balloon catheterization and injury to the common iliac artery, after which they were divided into four groups: untreated (control); Dispatch catheterized- 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>local</b> saline delivery [D(+) -tPA(-) ]; D(+) - 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>local</b> tPA delivery (0. 6 mg/kg) [D(+) -tPA(30 min) ]; and D(+) - 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>local</b> tPA + 3 days intravenous infusion (0. 6 mg/kg/ 24 h) [(D(+) -tPA(30 min + 3 d) ]. Twenty-eight days later, the intimal cross-sectional areas of all three Dispatch catheterized groups were significantly smaller than those of control groups, as were the intimal/medial area ratios. Moreover, the intima/media ratios of the D(+) -tPA(30 min + 3 d) group were significantly smaller than those of the D(+) -tPA(-) group. Thus, local delivery of tPA via Dispatch catheters followed by continuous intravenous infusion of tPA for 3 days prevented intimal hyperplasia after angioplasty...|$|R

60|$|He asked no more questions, and as {{the state}} of the road {{confined}} the driver’s attention to his steering, nothing was said as they sped on through the dark. Sometimes they swept across open country where straggling split-fences streamed back to them in the headlamps’ glare and a few stars shone mistily overhead. Sometimes they raced through the gloom beside a bluff, where dark fir branches stretched across the road and a sweet, resinous fragrance mingled with the smell of dew-damped dust.

A market worker, Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami), tries to impress her, {{but she is not}} interested. She befriends Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner). She soon gets closer to Kush, and they kiss and have sex. She tells Stacey that she had a daughter named Roya who she left on her aunt's doorstep and was adopted. The father is Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo). Shabnam develops feelings for Kush and when he gets her to admit it, he says he feels the same. They date in secret but Stacey finds out, and then Masood also finds out through gossip. Masood is against this, so Shabnam lies that Kush has proposed to her. Kush says it is happening too fast and Masood orders him to leave. Kush later admits that he is unable to commit as he is still mourning his dead wife. Shabnam admits that she only pushed their relationship through lying because she loves him. They resume their relationship and take things more slowly, and tell Masood of their plans, who comes round to the idea.|$|R

40|$|Management of drug {{resistant}} focal epilepsy {{would be}} greatly assisted by a reliable warning system capable of alerting patients prior to seizures {{to allow the}} patient to adjust activities or medication. Such a system requires successful identification of a preictal, or seizure-prone state. Identification of preictal states in continuous long- duration intracranial electroenceph-alographic (iEEG) recordings of dogs with naturally occurring epilepsy was investigated using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The dogs studied were implanted with a 16 -channel ambulatory iEEG recording device with average channel reference for a mean (st. dev.) of 380. 4 (+ 87. 5) days producing 220. 2 (+ 104. 1) days of intracranial EEG recorded at 400 Hz for analysis. The iEEG records had 51. 6 (+ 52. 8) seizures identified, of which 35. 8 (+ 30. 4) seizures were preceded by more than 4 hours of seizure-free data. Recorded iEEG data were stratified into 11 contiguous, non-overlapping frequency bands and binned into one-minute synchrony features for analysis.
