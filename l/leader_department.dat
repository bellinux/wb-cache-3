40|$|This Masters Thesis is {{concerned}} with developments in Norwegian society which affect the way its nursing homes are organised. These developments are ones that <b>department</b> <b>leaders</b> of nursing homes must deal with. The research question is therefore: “What challenges do <b>department</b> <b>leaders</b> face when trying to motivate employees {{to do a good}} job, to give good care and create a quality care service?” The backdrop to this is the rapidly growing demands of an aging population and the reforms that have been introduced in accordance with New Public Management (NPM), with the goal of increasing productivity and efficiency, as well as decreasing financial cost. To investigate this, the qualitative research method has been used. Four <b>department</b> <b>leaders</b> have been interviewed, as well as two district leaders (who are ‘above’ the <b>department</b> <b>leaders),</b> and six care-workers (who are ‘below’ the <b>department</b> <b>leaders).</b> Through narratives obtained from care-workers, <b>department</b> <b>leaders</b> and district leaders, the dilemmas that <b>department</b> <b>leaders</b> faced when trying to ensure sufficient competence ‘on the floor’, came to light. This research finds that the introduction of elements connected to NPM has resulted in certain mechanisms; including budget parameters becoming ‘sacred’, leading to <b>department</b> <b>leaders</b> organising the nursing home through ‘budgetary and transactional lenses’. This resulted in them having a tendency to view employees as an expense to be economised with rather than a resource to be invested in, thereby creating an ‘easy exit’ for employees. In addition to this <b>department</b> <b>leaders</b> are removed from ‘the floor’, and are therefore unable to see the ramifications that decisions made through these ‘budgetary and transactional lenses’ have for employees’ wellbeing, {{and the quality of the}} care service <b>department</b> <b>leaders</b> are responsible for. The findings in this research can serve as an eye-opener for <b>department</b> <b>leaders</b> of nursing homes, making them actively aware of the dilemmas that can present themselves in nursing homes...|$|R

40|$|Leadership {{has been}} a central, and {{sometimes}} controversial, topic {{in the study of}} organizations. In spite of claims to the contrary, there is substantial evidence that leadership is positively related to a variety of individual and organizational outcomes. While research has confirmed that leadership-performance associations exist, less {{attention has been paid to}} how senior leaders ensure that their strategic decisions are implemented. In this study, we investigated one mechanism of action, exploring how the consistency of leadership effectiveness across hierarchical levels enhanced or impeded influenced the implementation of a strategic initiative in a large health care system. We found that medical department performance was not affected by any one leader's (CEO, medical center <b>leader,</b> <b>department</b> leader) effectiveness but rather, it was only when leadership effectiveness at different levels were considered in the aggregate that significant performance improvement occurred. We discuss the implications of these findings for leadership research, specifically, that leaders at various levels should be considered collectively to understand how leadership influences strategic change. ...|$|E

The GodA-project - an introduction and some baseline results, presented by P. Lindberg Conditions in today’s working life make new approaches necessary in order to limit negative health effects of working life and to enhance wellbeing and health at work. Despite rather progressive legislation, a century of labour inspections, and the efforts of thousands of occupational health personnel, still around 20 % of the Swedish workforce report to have had work-related disorders other than accidents during the last year (1). Even if this "elimination approach" partly has succeeded it´s obvious that it is insufficient or inadequate for a working life where key issues for progress are motivation, cooperation and creativity (2). In order to achieve a sustainable working life, not the least to coop with issues related to the ageing population in the developed countries, it is likely that strategies and actions from different and new angles are needed. Healthy workplace has been defined as an organization that maximizes the integration of worker goals for wellbeing and company objectives for profitability and productivity(3). It is noteworthy that the notion healthy workplace is not a substitute for good work environment it is a consequence. Different models, e. g. the PATH-model by Grawitch et al. (4) shows a synthesis of earlier research {{in a number of different}} disciplines and frames how a healthy workplace with wellbeing for the individual and organizational improvements can be achieved. Five general categories of healthy workplace practices were identified in the literature: work-life balance, employee growth and development, health and safety, recognition, and employee involvement. Previous research also suggests that the link between these practices and employee and organizational outcomes is contingent on the effectiveness of communication within the organization and the alignment of workplace practices with the organizational context. The GodA-project aims at investigating if work place strategies in line with the PATH-model lead to better health and wellbeing among the employees as well as organizational improvements. The GodA project is a 2 year follow up study with a survey feedback design in three companies with both blue- and white collar workers within the energy sector. One of the companies serves as "intervention company", the other two as controls. The project started out with a pre-project, by means of focus groups and individual interviews, in 2012 in order to find out how employees and managers in the three companies describe the concept of a healthy work environment, what they consider to create well-being at work, and how they perceive their own work environment: What factors are important for well-being at work? presented by T. Karlsson In 2013 a baseline questionnaire where was sent out including items a) based on the results from the pre-study, and b) well-established questions and indices on health and work environment. The results from the survey have been reported back to the companies, which now are processing their results. Research question to be presented and discussed at the symposium: Is there a balance between factors of importance for wellbeing at work and the extent to which they are present at the workplace? presented by P. Lindberg. Is there a correlation between psychosocial work climate indicators and work-related well- The PATH-model emphasizes internal communication as critical in establishing a healthy workplace. As the baseline results show that the communication is not very well developed, this is the primary target for our intervention. We will demonstrate a method for how the survey data are presented back to the intervention company and how they are going to work with the results to improve their work environment, and at the same time enhance communication skills. After our presentation we invite the audience to discuss both the GodA-study and more general methodological issues when conducting intervention-studies, e. g: - When is a company ready (mature) to take part in research activities? - What are the pitfalls in workplace intervention studies? - To what degree can the researchers interact at the workplace and still be objective? - What is the value of focusing on the items that the employees responded to in the survey?

Focusing on Zhang Junmai’s career as an anti-Communist social democrat, the paper argues that whereas Asia’s supposed cultural commonality and superiority facilitated a critique of Western political and economic norms {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century, the Cold War imperative of containing Communist influence rendered this culturalism complicit in US strategic designs regarding Asia. Furthermore, the hope for an egalitarian economy and an international order based on altruistic reciprocity gave way to state-led developmentalism and market relations between Asian nation-states. Without a vision of overcoming the West’s political and economic hegemony, Zhang’s Pan-Asianism was reduced to hollow celebration of Oriental spirituality and of other anti-Communist Asian <b>leaders.</b> <b>Department</b> of Chinese Culture 2016 - 2017 > Academic research: refereed > Publication in refereed journalbcm...|$|R
