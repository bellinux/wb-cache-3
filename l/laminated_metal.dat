5000|$|... ==Terminology== Confusion arises {{because of}} {{the wide variety of}} terms by which similar armors are known.

The last description more closely fits splinted armor, which consists of long metal splints connected by mail/leather used for arm and leg protection. The final description of metal plates riveted to a sub-strate describe a coat of plates or brigandine, all of which consist of metal plates riveted to a leather or cloth fronting. Finally, armor constructed of rows of plates or platelets sewn or laced together, without backing/fronting, would be considered [...] "laminar". The current term for small metal plates joined together by chainmail is plated mail.|$|E

The intensive experimental analyses of these materials are focused on the assessment of their residual strength and on the assessment of new design methods.

Furthermore, loading functions are applied which account for cracking and delamination. Subsequently, results are discussed which are obtained from numerical analyses of the residual strength of plates made of GLARETM.

Literature information available for preparation of fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> are expensive and require huge investment for laminate preparation. The present work provides a simple, cost effective and widely adaptable process for the manufacture of fibre-metal <b>laminates.</b> Here, the <b>metal</b> surface is roughened with grit blasting for obtaining strong bond between metal and fibre cloth adhesive layers(Prepreg) as against the regular chemical pre-treatment process. Also, the prepreg layers are prepared in-house using RTM process.

However, the marked difference between the stiff steel laminate skins and the soft laminate adhesive core requires a three-layer mesh to capture the resulting through-thickness shearing. A finite element preprocessor, DAMP®, eases the design process by creating the three-layer representation, directly from a sheet metal mesh. DAMP ® utilizes both MSC. Patran [1] and MSC.

40|$|The dynamic {{failure of}} fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminates</b> was {{investigated}} experimentally. A projectile of hemispherical {{head with a}} diameter of 36. 5 mm was used to impact the fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> panels. Three types of woven fibre fabrics (Basalt, S 2 -glass and Kevlar- 29) were used to reinforce the aluminum sheets. Tests on these fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> panels were conducted by using an aerodynamic gun with the impact velocity ranging from 20. 6 m/s to 42. 8 m/s. Different deformation/failure modes of fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminates</b> were obtained by varying the impact energy. The failure mechanisms of composite layers were examined by the field emission scanning electron microscope. The results showed that before the fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> panels were penetrated, the global deformation increased with the impact velocity. However, evident reduction of global deformation can be observed after penetration occurred. Damages of fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> panels such as tearing of aluminum ply, fibre fracture, matrix cracks and debonding/delamination were observed around the impact region.

40|$|Cold {{expansion}} {{has proven}} to be an effective technique for extending the fatigue life of monolithic materials. Although fiber <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> materials show improved fatigue performance compared to their monolithic counterparts, the nucleation and growth of small cracks tends to occur early on in the fatigue life of the material, making acceptance of fiber <b>metal</b> <b>laminates</b> in aerospace more difficult. This work examined whether cold expansion could delay this process in fiber <b>metal</b> <b>laminates</b> and increase the fatigue life of these materials at the same time. The results showed that significant differences existed in the residual strain field between the mandrel exit and entry faces resulting in slower fatigue crack growth on the exit face, which also had higher residual strains in the region surrounding the cold expanded hole. Overall, cold expansion is effective at increasing the fatigue life of fiber <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> materials, but is less effective at delaying nucleation and growth of small cracks on the entry face.
