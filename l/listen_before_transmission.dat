Our concerns are the technologies that do not perform <b>listening</b> <b>before</b> <b>transmission</b> such as Bluetooth, {{and the ones that}} do not detect other technologies due to their channel sensing techniques like WiFi. To overcome this issue a WSN node should be able to identify the presence of such technologies. This will allow deducing the characteristics of the generated traffic of these technologies, and thus the behavior of the channel can be predicted. These predictions would help to trigger adequate reactions as to avoid or synchronize with the concurrent networks. Many works exist on link adaptation, but they concern blind adaptations which are unintelligent and solve momentarily the problem that may reappear over time. In this paper, we perform several experiments on a real testbed to categorize the model of the bit errors in corrupted received packets. These experiments are performed under different conditions of channel noise and interferences. This allows us to identify each corruption pattern as a fingerprint for the interfering technology. Then we propose the Fingerprint Identification Mechanism (FIM) to identify on the fly the source of the corruption. With an implementation on "Tmote Sky" motes using Tinyos 1. x, We demonstrate the use of FIM for link adaptation in a coexistence environment. Our mechanism led to throughput improvements of 87 %- 100 % depending on the transmission rate and channel quality...|$|R

30|$|From a {{high-level}} view, our proposed design makes the APs null their signals at the undesired clients (marked with different colors) while transmitting {{to the desired}} clients (marked with the same color) within their transmission range 1. The aim is to ensure that, when the desired APs transmit to all the desired clients, {{there will not be}} any collision of signals. In such an approach, neither of the APs has to <b>listen</b> and wait <b>before</b> <b>transmission</b> as is the case when using RTS/CTS, nor do the receiver clients have to re-encode any former decoded chunks as in the successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme [16].|$|R

40|$|Internet of Things devices {{communicate}} using {{a variety}} of protocols, differing in many aspects, with the channel access method being one of the most important. Most of the transmission technologies explicitly designed for IoT and machine-to-machine communication use either an ALOHA-based channel access or some type of <b>Listen</b> <b>Before</b> Talk strategy, based on carrier sensing. In this article, we provide a comparative overview of the uncoordinated channel access methods for Internet of Things technologies, namely ALOHA-based and <b>Listen</b> <b>Before</b> Talk schemes, in relation to the ETSI and FCC regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, we provide a performance comparison of these access schemes, in terms of both successful transmissions and energy efficiency, in a typical Internet of Things deployment. Results show that <b>Listen</b> <b>Before</b> Talk is effective in reducing inter-node interference even for long-range transmissions, although the energy efficiency can be lower than that provided by ALOHA methods. Furthermore, the adoption of rate adaptation schemes lowers the energy consumption while improving the fairness among nodes at different distances from the receiver. Coexistence issues are also investigated, showing that in massive deployments <b>Listen</b> <b>Before</b> Talk is severely affected by the presence of ALOHA devices in the same area...|$|R
