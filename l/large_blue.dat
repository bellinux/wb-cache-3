50|$|The banks lying off the hook-shaped {{island of}} Bermuda {{consistently}} produce blue marlin. Many Bermudian fish are small specimens in the 150 to 250 lb class, but every year much bigger {{fish in the}} 600 lb and larger class are caught. A 1352 lb giant boated aboard the Mako IV, skippered by Captain Allen DeSilva, in 1995, stands as the <b>largest</b> <b>blue</b> marlin caught in Bermudian waters.

5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. The portraits of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> eyes, fair hair with a slight tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|Most of Karen's {{appearances}} {{in the first four}} seasons depict her as a <b>large,</b> <b>blue</b> monitor in the Chum Bucket's laboratory; at other times, only her voice is heard from within Plankton's robotic creations. In The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, a mobile unit is introduced to allow Karen to interact more easily with others. Showrunner Vincent Waller stated that the mobile unit was introduced because having Karen able to move was more convenient for storytelling purposes. Karen alternates between her multiple forms in most episodes produced after the film. As of the tenth season, her wall monitor is no longer used and her mobile form is always equipped with a pair of robotic arms.|$|E
5|$|Several rare {{butterflies}} are {{indigenous to}} the area, including the nationally scarce pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), and white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album). The <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly (Maculinea arion) became extinct {{in the hills}} in the late 1970s, since when a research project has been undertaken into its ecology and reintroduction. The white-clawed crayfish is also nationally rare and is a declining species with small populations in {{a tributary of the}} Mells River and the River Chew.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Room-temperature 1. 3 -µm {{electroluminescence}} {{is observed}} for the InGaAs-capped GaSb quantum rings (QRs). The increasing carrier density in the InGaAs-capped type-II GaSb QRs would induce a <b>larger</b> <b>blue</b> {{shift in the}} same laser pumping power span and enhance the luminescence intensity. The enhanced luminescence intensity, a <b>larger</b> <b>blue</b> shift of peak wavelength, and 1. 3 -µm emission of the InGaAs-capped QR structure have revealed its potential application in multi-wavelength light-emitting devices in the near infrared range.

5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. <b>Large</b> <b>blue</b> (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into taking {{them back to the}} ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants and}} animals are generalists, and their habitat {{requirements}} are met {{in a wide range}} of locations. The small white butterfly (Pieris rapae) for example is found on all the continents of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of Brassicas and various other plant species, and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations. The <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.|$|E
5|$|The P. rebeli {{are noted}} for their <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> wings, with the males {{displaying}} a violet blue shade and the females displaying blue basal areas interspersed with brown spots, {{similar to other}} butterflies in its genus. The undersides of the butterfly are a dark brown with small black spots that are circled in white. It can be distinguished from its close relative, the P. alcon, by the broader black margins of the upperside male and the extensive blue basal areas in the females. It has a wingspan of approximately 32–36mm.|$|E

As Dan finally confronts Palethorn, he steals the pages from him and uses them to summon a <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> demon. Dan manages to turn the demon against Palethorn, putting a stop to both of them. As Palethorn blows up his lair with his last breath, Dan decides to join Kiya in the afterlife as they return to their eternal rest.

5|$|Many of the {{numerous}} human figures revel in an innocent, self-absorbed joy as they engage {{in a wide range}} of activities; some appear to enjoy sensory pleasures, others play unselfconsciously in the water, and yet others cavort in meadows with a variety of animals, seemingly at one with nature. In the middle of the background, a <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> globe resembling a fruit pod rises in the middle of a lake. Visible through its circular window is a man holding his right hand close to his partner's genitals, and the bare buttocks of yet another figure hover in the vicinity. According to Fraenger, the eroticism of the center frame could be considered either as an allegory of spiritual transition or a playground of corruption.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E
