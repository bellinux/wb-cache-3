40|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{problems}} of Central America is that of housing; more than 18 million people are in need of shelter. At one time, timber from extensive forests covering the region could have been used to provide the building materials needed to solve the housing problem. Unwise clearing of the forests to provide land for agricultural purposes, however, has largely depleted timber reserves. Since extensive forest land that could provide abundant solid wood to build housing is no longer available, alternative means to solve the problem are needed. ^ Thinnings from reforestation projects and commercial plantations along with agricultural residues such as rice straw, sugar cane bagasse, banana, coconut, and African palm are producing substantial amounts of unused residues. The production of <b>ligno-cellulose</b> composites from those residues can provide construction materials to aid in the solution of the housing problem, provide additional sources of income, promote incentives to a sustainable use of natural resources, and stimulate the forest and agriculture sectors to engage in activities that benefit the region as a whole. ^ The objective of this research was to provide the background information, based on the Central American experience, needed to help guide future research and development of <b>ligno-cellulose</b> composites intended for housing in this region of the world. This research considered the social, economic, technical and managerial environments of the construction sector of Central America as means of determining the possibilities and defining the constraints which would hinder the introduction and use of these composites. The research is based on literature reviews, consultation with experts, field visits, case study analysis, evaluation of statistics and projections, testing and analysis of material properties, and design of a proposed house solution. ^ The results of the study indicate that <b>ligno-cellulose</b> composites can provide a viable alternative to traditional materials and construction systems used for housing in Central America. Furthermore, <b>ligno-cellulose</b> composites can provide Central America with alternative uses of natural resources within the framework of sustainable development. ...|$|E

The likelihood of DNA preservation in amber {{has been questioned}} but, surprisingly, the fate of more decay-resistant macromolecules such as <b>ligno-cellulose</b> in plants or the chitin–protein complex in insect cuticle has not been investigated.

40|$|AbstractDeep {{reductions}} {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions in the automotive sector are difficult and often regarded as expensive. Use of ethanol from bio-resources is a potential way to reduce emissions. Ethanol produced from wheat typically reduces greenhouse gas emission by 35 % (well-to-wheel) compared to gasoline. In principle, greenhouse gas emissions may be further reduced by applying {{carbon capture and storage}} to store the co-produced carbon dioxide. In this study we assessed the technical, economical, regulatory and greenhouse gas performance aspects of bio-ethanol production from <b>ligno-cellulose</b> for a hypothetical plant in Germany. Reducing greenhouse gas emission by CCS from bio-ethanol plants is potentially economical attractive; for instance costs for a 170  kt sized bio-ethanol plant are estimated at 21 to 32  €/t of CO 2 stored. Emissions from <b>ligno-cellulose</b> based ethanol plants can be reduced by 150 %, i. e. resulting in negative emission when using biomass and CCS combined. Potential revenues may come from ETS (requires adjustments), voluntary markets (probably not sufficient yet) and increased value of the ethanol (requires additional regulation). In some cases, {{it might be possible to}} sell high quality CO 2 on the market. At the moment, none of these is applicable except the food-grade sales or will yield sufficient income to cover the costs.

40|$|Energy {{production}} from biomass can reduce „greenhouse effect” {{and contribute to}} solving energy security especially in the agricultural households which rely on energy from fossil fuels. In Croatia fuel-cured tobacco is produced on about 5000 ha. Gross income for the whole production is about 180 000 000 kn/year. Flue-cured tobacco is a high energy consuming crop. There are two parts of energy consumption, for mechanization used for the field production (11 %) and, energy for bulk-curing (89 %). In each case, presently used fuels of fossil origin need to be substituted by an alternative energy source of organic origin. Hereafter {{attention is paid to}} finding a more economic and ecologically acceptable fuel for curing tobacco. Curing flue-cured tobacco is done by heated air in curing burns. Various sources of heat have been used; wood, coal, oil and gas. In each case different burning facilities of different efficiency have been used. This has had an impact on curing costs and ecology. Recently, mostly used fuel has been natural gas. However, gas is getting expensive. Consequently, an alternative fuel for curing tobacco is sought for. According to literature, agricultural crops suitable for the latter purpose could be wheat, barley, maize, sorghum, sugar beet and some other annual and perennial plant species. Wooden pellets (by-products) are suitable for combustion too. <b>Ligno-cellulose</b> fuels have been used for heating since long time.

Previous {{studies have shown that the}} three-dimensional binding effects of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) and <b>ligno-cellulose</b> nanofiber (LCNF), when mixed with wood flour, can significantly improve the physical and mechanical properties of wood flour board. We use the word “LCNF” as the surface nanofibrillated wood flour. Previous studies have also highlighted problems that occur during compounding and board manufacturing. In this study, a reliable method was established to mix wood flour and LCNF. The method involved a compounding machine, which facilitated board manufacturing safely. Physical and mechanical properties of the resulting wood flour boards were significantly improved with the addition of LCNF, due to close binding between LCNF and wood flour particles.|$|E
30|$|In another study, <b>ligno-cellulose</b> {{nanofiber}} (LCNF) {{was made}} from wood flour, using a disk mill [19]. In this context, CNF refers to nanofibers made from cellulose alone.

However, in terms of productivity, LCNF is better than CNF because CNF {{requires a lot of}} process including delignification. Thus, we employed LCNF. The fabrication of LCNF by disk milling is simple and effective, and its incorporation into wood flour board significantly enhances the physical and mechanical properties of the board. When CNF or LCNF were initially mixed with wood flour, both materials were mixed manually. It is difficult to uniformly mix LCNF into wood flour. CNF and LCNF were made by wet milling, resulting in a moisture content of the mixture (CNF or LCNF and wood flour) over 300  %. Hot pressing of raw materials with high moisture content often reduces the quality of fabricated board.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFormerly on {{the margins}} of the European {{agricultural}} landscape, liquid biofuels for transport have recently come into sharp focus with the help of three drivers: the depletion of oil resources and the political motto of energy independence, international negotiations on climate, and finally - in Europe at least- the overhaul of the common agricultural policy underpinning the need tor diversify this sector. This political will has led to aggressive development targets in both Europe and the United States, implying a nearly ten-fold increase of biofuel production within 10 years. This article introduces the current biofuel production technologies (so-called 'first generation'), whose common marker is the reliance on the storage organs of agricultural plants. This implies a relatively strong demand in arable areas, along with only moderately positive energy and environmental advantages compared to fossil fuels.

Although well-preserved, the n-alkanes underwent β-oxidation yielding n-methyl ketones in a somewhat different distribution.

40|$|International audienceCost-effective biofuel {{production}} from lignocellulosic biomass depends on efficient {{degradation of the}} plant cell wall. One of the major obstacles {{for the development of}} a cost-efficient process is the lack of resistance of currently used fungal enzymes to harsh conditions such as high temperature. Adapted, thermophilic microbial communities provide a huge reservoir of potentially interesting lignocellulose-degrading enzymes for improvement of the cellulose hydrolysis step. In order to identify such enzymes, a leaf and wood chip compost was enriched on a mixture of thermo-chemically pretreated wheat straw, poplar and Miscanthus under thermophile conditions, but in two different setups. Unexpectedly, metagenome sequencing revealed that incubation of the lignocellulosic substrate with compost as inocu-lum in a suspension culture resulted in an impoverishment of putative cellulase-and hemi-cellulase-encoding genes.

Although macroscopic examination clearly established {{that it was}} fossil wood, as opposed to fossil charcoal, both transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy of its fine structure revealed that the previously stratified cell walls were apparently homogenized; a characteristic previously taken to be diagnostic of fossil charcoal. This fossil thus represents the only known example so far of fossil wood which was definitely not exposed to charring or charcoalification, yet possesses homogenized cell walls. Examination of the fossil wood using solid state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance suggests that the specimen was depleted in carbohydrate carbon and enriched in aromatic carbon and carbon from non-carbohydrate wood components when compared with NMR spectra of native <b>ligno-cellulose.</b> It is suggested that conditions in the unusual deposition environment of a highly acidic freshwater lake, could have directly or indirectly resulted in the cell wall homogenization.

Net mineralization was determined by using the buried-bag technique, which was combined with fumigation–extraction to recover microbial nutrients and estimate microbial nutrient immobilization. The measurements were carried out in unperturbed plots and in plots, which had been subjected to elevated temperature and fertilizer addition for 5 years before the experiment started. During the growing season, the microbes in the unperturbed plots immobilized the {{major part of the}} mineralized nutrients, which resulted in low net mineralization. This occurred also during winter, when we assumed that nutrients should be released during microbial die-back. However, we found no evidence for a large microbial winter die-back and the surviving microbial biomass even immobilized extra nutrients. Soil temperature enhancement by ca. 28 C in general increased, or tended to increase, net mineralization. However, there was not necessarily any strong correlation between net mineralization and temperature because temperature-induced increase in gross mineralized nutrients could either lead to nutrient immobilization in the microbes or the nutrients could be released to the soil inorganic pool.

Constraints-based methods used linear equations to simulate the growth under your model with different constraints. Graph-theoretical pathway finding methods use graphic approach to construct the gapless model so that each metabolite can be acquired from either nutritions or the products of other gapless reactions. In my thesis, a new method designed by Pitkänen [PJH+ 14] is used to reconstruct the metabolic networks of Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Five experiments were developed to evaluate the accuracy of the CoReCo method. The first experiment was to analyze the quality of the GMNs of Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae by comparing with the existing model. The second and third experiments tested the stability of CoReCo constructed under random mutation and random deletion of the protein sequence simulating noisy input data. The next two experiments were done by considering different number of phylogenetic neighbors in the phylogenetic tree. The last experiment tested the effect of the two main parameters (acceptance and rejection thresholds) when CoReCo filled the reaction gaps in the final step...|$|E
40|$|Phenological {{or plant}} age {{classification}} across a landscape allows for examination of micro-topographical effects on plant growth, {{improvement in the}} accuracy of species discrimination, and will improve {{our understanding of the}} spatial variation in plant growth. In this paper six vegetation indices used in phenological studies (including the newly proposed PhIX index) were analysed for their ability to statistically differentiate grasses of different ages in the sequence of their development. Spectra of grasses of different ages were collected from a greenhouse study. These were used to determine if NDVI, NDWI, CAI, EVI, EVI 2 and the newly proposed PhIX index could sequentially discriminate grasses of different ages, and subsequently classify grasses into their respective age category. The PhIX index was defined as: (An VNIR+ log(An SWIR 2)) /(An VNIR- log(An SWIR 2)), where An VNIRand An SWIR 2 are the respective nor- malised areas under the continuum removed reflectance curve within the VNIR (500 - 800 nm) and SWIR 2 (2000 - 2210 nm) regions. The PhIX index was found to produce the highest phenological classification accuracy (Overall Accuracy: 79 %, and Kappa Accuracy: 75 %) and similar to the NDVI, EVI and EVI 2 indices it statistically sequentially separates out the developmental age classes. Discrimination between seedling and dormant age classes and the adult and flowering classes was problematic for most of the tested indices. Combining information from the visible near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared region (SWIR) region into a single phenological index captures the phenological changes associated with plant pigments and the <b>ligno-cellulose</b> absorption feature, providing a robust method to discriminate the age classes of grasses. This work provides a valuable contribution into mapping spatial variation and monitoring plant growth across savanna and grassland ecosystems...|$|E

Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, Nutrition Society Conference on Malnutrition Matters, Harrogate, 2 - 3 November 2010, 69, (4), 613 - 620. IMPF: 03. 92 RONO: 03135 -CGCRuminant {{farming is}} {{an important component of the}} human food chain. Ruminants can use offtake from land unsuitable for cereal crop cultivation via interaction with the diverse microbial population in their rumens. The rumen is a continuous flow fermenter for the digestion of <b>ligno-cellulose,</b> with microbial protein and fermentation end-products incorporated by the animal directly or during post-ruminal digestion. However, ruminal fermentation is inefficient in capturing the nutrient resource presented, resulting in environmental pollution and generation of greenhouse gases. Methane is generated as a consequence of ruminal fermentation and poor retention of ingested forage nitrogen causes nitrogenous pollution of water and land and contributes to the generation of nitrous oxide. One possible cause is the imbalanced provision of dietary substrates to the rumen micro-organisms. Deamination of amino acids by ammonia-producing bacteria liberates ammonia which can be assimilated by the rumen bacteria and used for microbial protein synthesis. However, when carbohydrate is limiting, microbial growth is slow, meaning low demand for ammonia for microbial protein synthesis and excretion of the excess. Protein utilisation can therefore be improved by increasing the availability of readily fermentable sugars in forage or by making protein unavailable for proteolysis through complexing with plant secondary products. Alternatively, realisation that grazing cattle ingest living cells has led to the discovery that plant cells undergo endogenous, stress-mediated protein degradation due to the exposure to rumen conditions. This presents the opportunity to decrease the environmental impact of livestock farming by using decreased proteolysis as a selection tool for the development of improved pasture grass varieties.

40|$|The first {{generation}} biofuels {{which is coming}} from food crops for instance grain and sugar beet are inadequate to achieve desirable oil products because of the scarcity to food supply, therefore the importance of second generation biofuels has increased. Another advantage of second generation biofuel is that the feedstock (non-food-biomass) could be farmed for energy purposes, which enables better {{production per unit area}} of the land; and we could utilize the land efficiency. The feedstock of 2 nd generation biofuels which are <b>ligno-cellulose</b> in nature includes cereal straw, bagasse, forest residue and vegetable grasses. This project has theoretically assessed the use of hydrothermal media for direct liquefaction of biomass in a continuous flow tubular reactor using ANSYS Fluent and other relevant software?s. Micro-reactor is considered for better heat and mass transfer, also micro-reactor provides admissible control over unwanted side reactions. The exact reaction path of biomass dissociation is unknown therefore lumped kinetic is considered for model species like cellulose, hemi-cellulose and lignin. Computationally the velocity, temperature distribution, reaction kinetic, feed percentage and particle modeling are examined. It is being vindicated by results that the effect of fluid velocity over reactor domain is tremendous, and has high influence on temperature profile inside the reactor. The geometry of different dimensions is also investigated, which play integral role in the system. Furthermore, the effect of large or small eddies is examined by weightless particle and discussed in the result section. The optimum biomass particle size is proposed, which is suitable for our system. For future work, the predicted operating conditions for micro flow tubular reactor by simulation must be validated by experimental work. This computation work will facilitate and provide essential information to start experimental work. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comTwo hydrofluoric acid-treated soils were prepared with water contents ranging up to 22 % by exposing them {{to a range of}} atmospheric humidities. There was no effect of water content on the chemical shift distribution of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal in 13 C cross-polarization (CP) NMR spectra. The sensitivity of the 13 C CP NMR spectra decreased slightly with increasing water content. Much of this decrease could be attributed to decreases in T 1 ρH relaxation rates, caused by enhanced molecular mobility of the organic matter in the presence of absorbed water. Rates of T 1 H relaxation were very sensitive to water content, and average T 1 H relaxation rates decreased four- to five-fold from the smallest to the largest water content. Rates of T 1 H relaxation were non-uniform, and were better modelled by two-T 1 H component fits than one-T 1 H component fits. The ratio of rapidly to slowly relaxing components increased with increasing water content. Proton spin relaxation editing (PSRE) subspectra revealed substantial changes in the nature of these two components with increasing water content. These results indicate the presence of an organic matter component that is very sensitive to water content, transforming from slowly relaxing at a small water content to rapidly relaxing at a greater water content. This component was shown to be rich in O–alkyl and carbonyl C, and may be hemicellulosic root exudates and microbial mucilages. The slowly relaxing PSRE component was a mixture of <b>ligno-cellulose</b> and alkyl biopolymers, whereas the rapidly relaxing component was primarily charcoal for one of the soils, and was reminiscent of dissolved organic carbon for the other soil. These findings show that care must be taken in controlling water contents when using PSRE to study organic matter. R. J. Smerni...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogels {{are used}} for various applications, for example as {{transporters}} in drug delivery, incontrol lenses, and as superabsorbent material in diapers. [1] Most synthetic produced hydrogelsare based on synthetic polymers. Even though they are efficient and cheap, they are notbiodegradable and sometimes even toxic. To produce more environmental friendly and biodegradable superabsorbent polymers (Bio-SAPs), other building blocks can be used, such as polysaccharides[2] and various proteinstructures, for example fish shells[3], collagen[4], soy protein[5] and egg protein[6]. Experimentalstudies at the University of Boras show {{that it is possible}} to produce Bio-SAPs from by-productsof ethanol production from <b>ligno-cellulose.</b> [2, 6, 7] 2. MethodWe have studied the absorption properties of protein structures in silico as a comparison toexperimental studies. The NPT Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) simulation scheme withtwo phases is used in order to calculate the absorption capacity of the protein. Pure water wassimulated in the first GEMC-phase and the peptide in the second phase. The simulations weremade with SPC/E water model [8] and the AMBER 99 atomistic force field for the peptides [9]. Furthermore, mesoscopic studies with coarse grained force fields have been done. To facilitate faster computations, we used cell lists for the atom-atom interactions,configurational bias algorithm to build the water molecules and the peptide side-chains, and thecavity bias algorithm [10] for molecule insertions. Model peptides have been studied with varying secondary structure, temperature andprotonation (pH). We also plan to study how cross-links affect the absorption. One of the peptideswe study is a 20 amino acid long peptide called SSP 1. [11] This peptide is designed to form afibrous structure a hydrogel, and its structure is well defined. We have also studied a peptidewhich changes secondary structure when changing the pH, and concentration. [12] This makes itpossible to compare absorption properties with respect to the secondary structure. 3. ConclusionWe have simulated peptides with the Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo scheme in order to studythe water absorption rate dependent of structure, charge, pH and temperature. This information isuseful when developing new biodegradable superabsorbent materials...|$|E
