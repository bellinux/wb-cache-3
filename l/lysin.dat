50|$|Following {{its release}} from sperm, <b>lysin</b> binds to the egg vitelline {{envelope}} (VE) via the VE receptor for <b>lysin</b> (VERL), then non-enzymatically dissolves the VE {{to create a}} hole, thereby allowing the sperm {{to pass through the}} envelope and fuse with the egg. Lysins exhibit species-specific binding to their egg receptor, possibly through differences in charged surface residues. SP18 is also released from sperm, acting as a potent fusagen of liposomes to mediate the fusion between the sperm and egg cell membranes. Despite a similarity in the overall fold, the variation in the surface features of SP18 and <b>lysin</b> account for their different roles in fertilization.|$|E
50|$|Peptidoglycan {{consists}} of cross-linked amino acids and sugars which form alternating amino sugars: N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM). Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase <b>lysins</b> cleave NAGs while N-acetylmuramidase <b>lysins</b> (lysozyme-like <b>lysins)</b> cleave NAMs. Endopeptidase <b>lysins</b> cleave {{any of the}} peptide bonds between amino acids, whereas N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase <b>lysins</b> (or simply amidase <b>lysins)</b> hydrolyze the amide bond between the sugar and the amino acid moieties. Finally, the recently discovered γ-d-glutaminyl-l-lysine endopeptidase <b>lysins</b> cleave the gamma bond between D-glutamine and L-lysine residues.|$|R
40|$|Bacteriophage <b>lysins,</b> {{the highly}} evolved special {{peptidoglycan}} hydrolases, {{have long been}} demonstrated {{to be an effective}} enzybiotics in various infectious models. The modular structure of <b>lysins</b> makes it possible to design bioengineered <b>lysins</b> that have desired properties, such as higher activity, broader killing spectrum. Moreover, <b>lysins</b> can even be engineered to kill gram-negative bacterial pathogens from without, a property that is unavailable for natural <b>lysins.</b> In this era of ever increased multidrug resistant pathogens, engineered <b>lysins</b> represent a new class of enzybiotics that are powerful and readily available to fight the antimicrobial resistance...|$|R
50|$|All other <b>lysins</b> are monomeric and {{comprise}} two domains {{separated by}} a short linker region. For gram positive bacteria <b>lysins,</b> the N-terminal domain catalyses the hydrolysis of peptidoglycan whereas the C-terminal domain binds to the cell wall substrate.|$|R

50|$|The <b>lysin</b> {{catalytic}} domain digests peptidoglycan locally {{at a high}} rate, {{which causes}} holes in the cell wall. Since the cross-linked peptidoglycan cell wall is the only mechanism that prevents the spontaneous burst of bacterial cells due to the high internal pressure (3 to 5 atmospheres), enzymatic digestion by lysins irreversibly causes hypotonic lysis. Theoretically, due to the catalytic properties of phage lysins, a single enzyme would be sufficient to kill the host bacterium by cleaving the necessary number of bonds, even though this {{has yet to be}} proven. The work by Loessner et al suggests that cleavage is typically achieved by the joint action of multiple <b>lysin</b> molecules at a local region of the host's cell wall. The high binding affinity to the cell wall substrate (close to that of IgG for its substrate) of each <b>lysin</b> appear to be reason why multiple molecules are required, since every <b>lysin</b> binds so tightly to the cell wall that it can't break enough bonds to cause lysis by itself.|$|E
5000|$|Egg <b>lysin</b> is {{a protein}} {{that creates a}} hole in the {{envelope}} of the egg thereby allowing the sperm to pass through the envelope and fuse with the egg. [...] Fertilization proteins are acrosomal proteins involved in various roles during the fertilization process. Structurally these proteins consist of a closed bundle of helices with a right-hand twist. <b>Lysin</b> and SP18, both characterised in abalone, are two evolutionarily related fertilization proteins that have distinctive roles.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{two or more}} {{different}} catalytic domains are linked to a single cell-binding domain. This is typical in many staphylococcal <b>lysins</b> {{as well as the}} streptococcal PlyC holoenzyme, which contains two catalytic domains. Catalytic domains are highly conserved in phage <b>lysins</b> of the same class.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the main mechanism of evolution in phage <b>lysins</b> is the exchange of modular units, a process by which different catalytic and cell-binding domains have been swapped between <b>lysins,</b> which {{would have resulted in}} new combinations of both bacterial binding and catalytic specificities.|$|R

50|$|Phage <b>lysins</b> {{have been}} {{successfully}} tested in animal models to control pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria found on mucous membranes and in blood.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{possibilities}} of treating the contents of the blood stream as a hemolytic system in which a more or less steady state is maintained by the production of new red cells to replace those which are destroyed. The attempt will raise both new questions and questions which have been the subject of investigation already, and I realize that it will often do no more than outline the problems still to be solved. In their essentials, these problems are those of the nature of the in vivo <b>lysins,</b> the nature of their accelerators and inhibitors, the rules which apply to the mixtures of <b>lysins,</b> accelerators, and inhibitors which compose the in vivo hemolytic systems, and the kinetics which describe the way in which red cell destruction by the hemolytic mixtures is balanced by the production of new red cells. 1. The Lyric Effect of Mixtures of <b>Lysins,</b> Accderators, and Inhibitors In vivo hemolytic systems consist of mixtures of many <b>lysins,</b> accelerators, and inhibitors, and relations must exist between the hemolytic activity of these mixtures and the activity of the <b>lysins</b> acting singly, accelerated or inhibited b...|$|R
40|$|The lyric {{substances}} {{found in}} extracts of tissues {{have been shown}} to exist as lysin-inhibitor complexes of relatively low hemolytic activity, from which the much more active alcohol-soluble lytic components can be extracted (Ponder, 1951; Tyler, 1949, 1950). Some of these lytic components are soluble in ether as well as in alcohol while others are alcohol-soluble but ether-insoluble, and it is likely that they are related to the ether-soluble and etherinsoluble <b>lysins</b> which have been described as obtainable from plasma and serum by alcohol extraction. These <b>lysins,</b> however, have been so differently described by different observers that the first step towards a simplification of the subject must be a standardization of method which will allow one to prepare the <b>lysins</b> reproducibly, both from tissues and from plasma, and to compare them with one another as regards activity. This paper is concerned with three related aspects of this problem: [...] (1) the comparison of the <b>lysins</b> obtainable from blood with those obtainable from tissue such as mouse liver, (2) the application of paper chromatography and related technics to the separation of these <b>lysins</b> and of their complexes, and (3) various observations {{on the nature of the}} <b>lysins</b> and on some of the properties of the inhibitors which form part of the lysin-inhibitor complexes I The Relati~,e Hemolytic Activity of Extracted Material The essential steps of the various procedures which have been described for the extraction of <b>lysins</b> from blood and plasma can be combined into the following single process.

5000|$|Double-stranded DNA phage lysins tend to {{lie within}} the 25 to 40 kDa range {{in terms of}} size. A notable {{exception}} is the streptococcal PlyC endolysin, which is 114 kDa.

50|$|<b>Lysins,</b> {{also known}} as endolysins or murein hydrolases, are hydrolytic enzymes {{produced}} by bacteriophages in order to cleave the host's cell wall during {{the final stage of}} the lytic cycle. <b>Lysins</b> are highly evolved enzymes that are able to target one of the five bonds in peptidoglycan (murein), the main component of bacterial cell walls, which allows the release of progeny virions from the lysed cell. Cell-wall-containing Archaea are also lysed by specialized pseudomurein-cleaving <b>lysins,</b> while most archaeal viruses employ alternate mechanisms. Similarly, not all bacteriophages synthesize lysins: some small single-stranded DNA and RNA phages produce membrane proteins that activate the host's autolytic mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} worldwide prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, bacteriophage endolysins (<b>lysins)</b> represent a very promising novel alternative class of antibacterial {{in the fight}} against infectious disease. <b>Lysins</b> are phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases which, when applied exogenously (as purified recombinant proteins) to Gram-positive bacteria, bring about rapid lysis and death of the bacterial cell. A number of studies have recently demonstrated the strong potential of these enzymes in human and veterinary medicine to control and treat pathogens on mucosal surfaces and in systemic infections. They also have potential in diagnostics and detection, bio-defence, elimination of food pathogens and control of phytopathogens.

50|$|The Lactococcus lactis phage r1t genome {{includes}} two adjacent genes, orf48 and orf49, which encode Orf48 (TC# 1.E.18.1.1; 75 aas) and a <b>lysin</b> Orf49 (270 aas), probably an N-acetyl-muramoyl-L-alanine amidase, respectively. Orf48 exhibits 2 putative hydrophobic transmembrane segments (TMSs) {{separated by a}} short β-turn region. It also has a hydrophobic N-terminus and a highly charged C-terminus. Orf48/Orf49 constitute the phage r1t lysis cassette. An essential role of Orf49 in cell lysis by Orf48 has been demonstrated.|$|E
5000|$|No {{bacteria}} {{could be}} identified that were resistant to the compound (resistance frequency of <10−11). Thus, epimerox is an antibiotic with low resistance potential. Therefore, 2-epimerase is a new antibiotic target to which resistance is a rare event. 2-Epimerase was discovered as a target because {{it was one of}} the enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for synthesizing an essential neutral polysaccharide in the cell wall of B. anthracis (Glu:Gal-NAc:Man-NAc at a 3:2:1 ratio). [...] This polysaccharide is only found in B. anthracis and is the receptor for a bacteriophage <b>lysin</b> enzyme called PlyG, which is produced by the γ-bacteriophage to release its progeny from infected B. anthracis. For bacteriophage to survive they need to replicate inside a bacterial cell and release their progeny phage when they are assembled using their <b>lysin.</b> Since lysins from bacteriophage that infect Gram-positive bacteria must bind to a cell wall receptor to function, the enzymes have evolved over a billion years to identify substrate receptors in the bacterial cell wall that the bacteria cannot change easily. These substrates are either part of the peptidoglycan or sugars linked to it. Deletion of both 2-epimerase genes in B. anthracis is lethal to the bacterium.|$|E
50|$|Holins are {{a diverse}} group of small {{proteins}} produced by dsDNA bacteriophages in order to trigger and control the degradation of the host's cell wall {{at the end of the}} lytic cycle.

Holins have been shown to regulate the timing of lysis with great precision. Over 50 unrelated gene families encode holins, making them the most diverse group of proteins with common function.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{problematic}} aspects {{of the use of}} phage lysins as antimicrobial agents is the potential immunogenicity of these enzymes. Unlike most antibiotics, proteins are prone to antibody recognition and binding, which means that lysins could be ineffective when treating bacterial infections or even dangerous, potentially leading to a systemic immune response or a cytokine storm. Nonetheless, experimental data from immunologically-rich rabbit serum showed that hyperimmune serum slows down but does not block the activity of pneumococcal <b>lysin</b> Cpl-1.|$|E
50|$|Phage lysins are {{generally}} species or subspecies specific, {{which means that}} they are only effective against bacteria from which they were produced. While some lysins only act upon the cell walls of several bacterial phylotypes, some broad-spectrum lysins have been found. Similarly, some thermostable lysins are known, which makes them easier to use in biotechnology. Regarding their use as antibacterial agents, lysins have been found effective mainly against Gram-positive bacteria, since Gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrame that prevents extracellular <b>lysin</b> molecules from digesting peptidoglycan. However, lysins with activity against Gram-negative bacteria, such as OBPgp279, have garnered interest as potential therapeutics.|$|E

[...] This established a link between invertebrate and vertebrate fertilization by suggesting that, despite being separated by 600 million years of evolution, mollusk and human use a common protein fold to interact with sperm.|$|E
50|$|Although wall {{carbohydrates}} {{are ideal}} immunotherapeutic targets {{due to their}} abundance and high level of conservation, their poor immunogenicity compared with conventional protein targets complicates the production of effective antibodies.

Evidence was presented that the K 1 normal cell autolysin and the K phage virolysin could act synergistically with lysozyme on phage-sensitized cells, and that any effects observed with lysozyme were due to the simultaneous presence of trace amounts of these staphylococcal <b>lysins.</b> None of a series of lysozymelike agents from sea urchins, marine sepunculids, and from rabbit peritoneal histiocytes caused accelerated lysis of phage-sensitized cells, although like lysozyme they showed a slow lysis of phage-free living cells. Other enzymes which did not reduce the turbidity of sensitized cells included agents specific for intracellular components (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids), and enzymes, as decarboxylase, alkaline phosphatase, d-amino oxidase, and hyaluronidase.
