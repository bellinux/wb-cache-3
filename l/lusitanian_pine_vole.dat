40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Ecologia), 2010, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de CiênciasThe {{main goal}} of this thesis was to {{determine}} the environmental factors influencingthe distribution of two closely related voles in Portugal. More specifically the aimwas to analyse and compare the environmental preferences of the Lusitanian pinevole (Microtus lusitanicus (Gerbe, 1879)) and the Mediterranean pine vole (Microtusduodecimcostatus Sélys-Longchamps, 1839), at different scales of analysis, andalso to quantify the importance of spatial autocorrelation component in speciesdistribution models. At a national level the distribution pattern of pine voles was associated with climatevariables, landscape units, and soil types. The environmental associations at alandscape scale reflected the importance of habitat connectivity and heterogeneityfor the <b>Lusitanian</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole,</b> and of open areas, free of shrubs, for theMediterranean pine vole. At a local scale, the high importance of verges, especiallyfor the <b>Lusitanian</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole,</b> highlights the several advantages of these particularvegetation structures for small mammals. The sympatric area of both pine voles was consistently narrow in national andregional distribution maps. Results indicated that the local coexistence of the twovoles should be a rare event. Vole distribution data were characterized by strong spatial autocorrelation evenafter accounting for several significant environmental effects. At the largest scalethe spatial effects were the most important. At a finer scale, these effects, althoughstill important, played a secondary role when explaining the species distributionsand segregation. Furthermore, novel information was provided on space use, social behaviour,activity patterns, and habitat selection of <b>Lusitanian</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole.</b> The discrimination of the two species in the field, and in a potential sympatric area,was possible using presence signs, namely the proportion of burrow openings. Multiple factors may influence the distribution of pine voles in Portugal. Some ofthese factors gain importance at specific spatial scales and others can only bediscussed using more than one scale approach.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{analyzed}} the coexistence {{pattern of the}} <b>Lusitanian</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus lusitanicus) and the Mediterranean pine vole (Microtus duodecimcostatus) in a potential area of sympatry in a Mediterranean landscape (Portugal). We also determined the relative contribution of local, landscape, and spatial factors explaining the diﬀerences in the distribution patterns of the two species in the region. Using a kriging interpolation method, we obtained a map of sympatric and allopatric areas of species occurrence. The estimated sympatry area corresponded to a north-west–southeast belt representing 11. 3 % of the study area. Habitat niche differences were assessed with binomial GLMs followed by a variance partitioning. At a local scale, higher altitude, higher cover of shrubs, lower clay content in the soil, and lower cover of tree canopy {{were the most important}} factors distinguishing M. lusitanicus presence sites from those with M. duodecimcostatus. At a larger scale, the presence of forest landscape units and the low abundance of ‘‘montado’’ units were the most inﬂuencing landscape factors in the identiﬁcation of M. lusitanicus occurrence sites when compared to M. duodecimcostatus. Our results suggested that local coexistence of M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus in the ﬁeld is a rare event. The differences in distribution patterns of the two pine vole species were mostly explained by ﬁne-scale environmental factors and by shared spatial effects...|$|E

We documented large home range areas with values of 1042 m 2 for males and 862 m 2 for females (MCP method; 95 % kernel method with values of 229 m 2 and 159 m 2 for males and females, respectively). Although no signiﬁ cant diﬀ erences between sexes or reproductive status were found, longer daily movements were observed in reproductively inactive males. Pair bonding and home range overlap was observed between males and females, {{as well as between}} females and sub-adults. Voles showed no distinct preference for day or night for activity periods and movements. However, this result was dependent on sex, reproductive status and time of day. Voles revealed habitat preference for both spatial scales of analysis: they selected verges, vines and olives, within the study area, and used more verges within their home ranges, when compared to the other habitat types. The use of space by Microtus lusitanicus, in comparison with other microtines, suggests the occurrence of spatial associations between males and females in monogamous pairs.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Evolutiva), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2016 The present Ph. D. project {{constituted}} {{a first step}} in understanding mechanisms of reproductive isolation between two recently diverged sister species: the <b>Lusitanian</b> <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> Microtus lusitanicus and the Mediterranean pine vole Microtus duodecimcostatus. Reproductive isolation is essential to speciation, and two types of isolation, preand post-mating, may prevent hybridization between two species. While premating barriers prevent copulation and promote conspecific reproduction, postmating barriers affect the success of heterospecific fertilization and hybrid viability, and potentiate its sterility. M. lusitanicus diverged from M. duodecimcostatus approximately 60, 000 years ago, constituting one of the most recent speciation events among Microtus sp. voles. While M. lusitanicus inhabits the Northern region of the Iberian Peninsula, reaching the French Pyrenees, M. duodecimcostatus occupies Southern Iberia and part of the South of France. There is also a sympatry area of distribution, where both species occur, located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, covering parts of Portugal and Spain. Analyses on cytochrome b and microsatellites have uncovered a cytonuclear discordance over a large geographic area in Portugal, indicating a historical introgression of mitochondrial DNA from M. duodecimcostatus to M. lusitanicus. An incomplete reproductive isolation in nature is also suggested between both voles since two possible hybrids were detected in a sample size of nearly three hundred individuals. Moreover, behavioural isolation was hinted at, since there is a preference for conspecific over heterospecific odour cues. The gametic isolation barrier was proposed since heterospecific mating, in laboratory conditions, is less reproductively prolific than conspecific mating. This result suggests that fertilization between M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus may not always occur after copulation, probably due to incompatibilities in the sperm-oocyte heterospecific recognition. Considering these previous findings, the present Ph. D. project focused on M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus reproductive isolation, particularly on premating behavioural and post-mating gametic isolation barriers. It comprises five specific aims: 1) identify candidate genes related to odour cues communication; 2) analyse the expression of urinary proteins in both species; 3) infer if both species favour conspecific to heterospecific mating; 4) determine if both species present a pair bond, indicative of a monogamous mating system; and 5) evaluate the role of the sperm-binding protein zona pellucida 3, as a gametic isolation barrier. Four hypotheses were tested: 1) odour cues communication is an active behavioural reproductive barrier between M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus; 2) M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus prefer conspecific to heterospecific mating in the presence of potential mates of both species; 3) M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus are socially monogamous; and 4) the putative sperm-binding region of zona pellucida 3 is a gametic isolation barrier that impairs heterospecific mating between M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus. The results of the present Ph. D. project suggest that reproductive isolation between these sister species relies on multiple barriers and is still incomplete, enabling sporadic hybridization in nature. Overall, results also indicate that urinary proteins {{may play a role in}} species-specific discrimination; confirm social monogamy as the mating system of both voles, being a possible indirect behavioural isolation barrier at syntopy; reveal that individual behavioural variability may contribute to the behavioural isolation between M. lusitanicus and M. duodecimcostatus; and refute the putative sperm-binding region of ZP 3 as a gametic barrier.

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus pinetorum) {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as a pest species in fruit orchards of the eastern United States (Hamilton 1935). These semifossorial rodents construct tunnel systems beneath apple trees where they eat entire roots or strip roots of bark and cambium. Hamilton (1938) reported numbers of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> within apple orchards as high as 200 - 300 voles per acre which is {{in sharp contrast to}} the relative scarcity of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> outside orchard situations (Crain and Packard 1966; Goertz 1971), These findings suggest that orchard habitat provides excellent conditions for <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> growth and reproduction, although the specific components which are attractive to <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> and facilitate their proliferation remain poorly understood. Prior studies have suggested that <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> habitat selection is based on preference for a complex of habitat components including cover density (Benton 1955; Paul 1970; Goertz 1971), food resources (Noffsinger 1976), soil texture (Fisher and Anthony 1980), and soil moisture (Haines and Gier 1951; Miller 1964). With regard to the latter two variables, Miller (1964) and Best (1973) have presented evidence indicating that soil texture is a primary factor limiting the distribution of some fossorial mammals but soil moisture content may also be of importance (Miller 1948). The extent to which these soil properties influence the distribution and abundance of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> is presently unclear. Similarly, <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> response to soil temperature remains unexplored.

40|$|Habitat {{selection}} by <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus pinetorum) {{has been}} attributed to cover density (Goertz, 1971; Paul, 1970) soil condition (Benton, 1955; Fisher and Anthony, 1980), and food resources (Noffsinger, 1976; Paul, 1970). Goertz (1971) reported that <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> were distributed in diverse habitats, but there was a close correlation with height and diversity of grass. Miller and Getz (1969) found populations in sloping upland woods, Benton (1955) in dry woods, and Paul (1970) in hardwood slopes with a close correlation between distribution and amount of ground cover. Soil type has been examined by Benton (1955) and Fisher and Anthony (1980) and they have shown that <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> are associated with light soils containing moderate layers of humus. These factors are important to reduce predation, moderate the effect of rain and temperatures, and permit the excavation of fossorial nests and tunnels. Noffsinger (1976) has demonstrated that the amount of digestible energy and availability of food sources were important factors affecting birth and death rates of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> when abandoned and maintained orchards were compared. Behavioral characteristics of <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> have been associated with decreased meadow <b>vole</b> density as <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> appear to be a more aggressive species (Smith, 1975). Paul (1970) has shown that <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> appear to replace meadow voles when they are sympatric in favorable habitats. Trapping and telemetry methods indicate that <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> have low dispersal capacity and home ranges 100 m 2 or less in size (Gettle, 1975). All these reports are from established <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> populations and not from the initial colonizing event and subsequent development of a local population.

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus pinetorum) and meadow voles (M. pennsylvanicus) co-occur in {{orchards}} but may exhibit mutual avoidance through temporal or spatial isolation. Though <b>pine</b> and meadow <b>voles</b> have exhibited overlapping home ranges, {{individuals of}} the two species seldom occupy the same 2 m area {{at the same time}} (Pagano 2 ̆ 6 Madison, 1981). Differences in habitat use by <b>pine</b> and meadow <b>voles</b> may contribute to their spatial separation in orchards.

40|$|Results from {{previous}} work on <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> populations and habitat interactions (Cengel et a 1. 1978; Noffsinger 1976) suggested that <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> populations were quite sensitive to seasonal {{changes in the}} quantity, species composition, and nutritive value of available forage.

Noffsinger (1976) and Merson (1979) suggested studies be conducted {{to determine the effects of}} a declining photoperiod on reproduction. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of photoperiod and nutrition on food consumption, body condition and reproduction in the <b>pine</b> <b>vole...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{began our}} {{research}} effort in 1968 with a project aimed at determining {{the efficacy of}} endrin treatment for <b>pine</b> <b>vole</b> control. Grower concerns and {{a small amount of}} laboratory data indicated that endrin was no longer as reliable in controlling <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> {{as it was in the}} early sixties. Our initial efforts were twofold. We sought first to determine the existing efficacy of endrin and secondly to evaluate any resistance by <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> to this chemical control procedure. Unfortunately, this entire endrin research effort was dropped by the Cooperative Research Unit when endrin as well as other persistent chlorinated hydrocarbons were banned for use in New York State about 1969. As an outgrowth of this false start we identified two important needs in the control area. The first of these was to gain basic population information about <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> and meadow voles in Hudson Valley orchards. And, secondly, we saw the need to gain further information about the economic impact that these orchard pests were having on the growers...|$|R
40|$|Free-ranging <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus pinetorum) and meadow voles (M. pennsylvanicus) were radio-tracked in a {{maintained}} apple orchard {{environment in}} August and December 1980. Meadow voles maintained larger home ranges than <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> in the summer, but had similar-sized ranges in December. The home ranges for both species decreased {{with the onset}} of winter. <b>Pine</b> and meadow <b>voles</b> showed a strong tendency to remain within rows and to restrict most of their movement to areas beneath the canopy. Despite some overlap in space use between the species, the movements of both vole species suggested mutual avoidance. Differences in habitat utilization between <b>pine</b> and meadow <b>voles</b> was also suggested...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>voles</b> and meadow voles {{exhibited}} differential {{preferences for}} various Malus clones. When damage to dormant stems in a 24 -hr test {{was assessed by}} either a graded damage scale or percentage consumption by weight, <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> preferred Golden Delicious, M. 9, and M. 26 and consistently avoided M. x sublobata PI 286613 (2 ̆ 26132 ̆ 2) and related clones and Robusta 5. Dehydrating stems magnified the disparity among cultivars, as attractive stems continued to suffer extensive damage, while 613 became even less palatable. In the autumn phase all varieties showed increased acceptance. Meadow <b>voles,</b> like <b>pine</b> <b>voles,</b> exhibited differential acceptance of cultivars, but their preferences differed somewhat from <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> in that they extensively damaged Robusta 5. When bark and pulp portions of rootstocks were separately presented to <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> in 1 hr tests, weight consumed followed expected varietal preferences. With dormant stocks, significantly more bark was consumed than pulp in both 613 and Golden Delicious samples, and, in both fractions Golden Delicious was consumed more than 613. In autumn-cut stocks Golden Delicious was preferred to three other varieties overall, as was its pulp fraction. Humans readily detected textural contrasts among rootstocks, some {{of which can be}} measured during the dormant phase as lower densities and higher water content for the extremely preferred rootstocks. Humans also reported taste differences among cultivars, describing rootstocks and fragments as bitter more often for Golden Delicious and 613 than for Robusta 5 and M. 9. Taken together, these rootstock data suggest that stem texture may be a primary factor for rootstock acceptability. Taste probably also plays a role in rootstock preferences. Pine dowels soaked in fruit extract, sucrose, or quinine solutions or water or oil and individually presented to paired <b>pine</b> <b>voles</b> for 24 hr tests were gnawed differentially with enhanced gnawing for oil and extract-treated dowels, and less gnawing of quinine-treated dowels...|$|R
