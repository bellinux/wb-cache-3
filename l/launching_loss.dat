40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe current national economic situation has forced every Department of Defense program {{to find ways}} to accomplish more with fewer resources.

40|$|The biggest {{disadvantage}} of Optical Burst Switching {{lies in the}} high packet losses which are inevitable {{due to the lack}} of adequate optical buffering. Thus, the advantage of avoiding payload translation into the electrical domain comes at the cost of dropping packets contending for the same output port whenever this contention persists formore packets than the limited fiber delay lines can accommodate. A method to avoid these losses is proposed in this paper by sending instead of a burst header a scout header over the control channel to simulate the events that the actual packet will experience. Once the scout message is informed in an intermediate node that a drop is inevitable, it comes back and prevents the sending of the actual packet, a new scout is issued instead. If all is Ok then the packet is <b>launched</b> with no <b>loss</b> certainty. To enable this, a slotted approach is adopted with all the necessary control tools. The penalty is the delay of the indirect reservations and the occasional repetitive attempts limiting the applicability of this approach to a couple of thousand kilometres...|$|R
