25|$|There is no {{one answer}} from modern science to give. What the {{original}} question now means indeed depends on choosing genus or species in the required answer. It is thought that the genus of man {{has been around for}} ten times as long as our species. Currently, fresh examples of (extinct) species of the genus Homo are still being discovered, so that definitive answers are not available. The consensus view is that human beings are one species, the only existing species of the genus. With the rejection of polygenism for human origins, it is asserted that this species had a definite and single origin in the past. (That assertion <b>leaves</b> <b>aside</b> the point whether the origin meant is of the current species, however. The multiregional hypothesis allows the origin to be otherwise.) The hypothesis of recent African origin of modern humans is now widely accepted, and states that anatomically modern humans had a single origin, in Africa.|$|E
500|$|The film {{illustrates}} Rivette's {{view that}} the act of watching cinema involves game-playing, day-dreaming and paranoid fantasy. He <b>leaves</b> <b>aside</b> the usual devices of the horror genre—no music, shock sound effects, special effects, or gore—evoking feelings and scenes verbally rather than showing them, yet he does employ Hitchcockian [...] "MacGuffins" [...] such as chance encounters, [...] "clues," [...] and the blackmail plot-line. The use of oneiric visuals in the opening and closing scenes of the film was influenced by Rivette's earlier film Hurlevent (1985), an adaptation of Wuthering Heights by Emliy Brontë. [...] Some of the dialogue that was in the original notes was read as though quoting.|$|E
500|$|First {{described}} as a variety of what was then known as Embothrium wickhamii by Joseph Maiden and Ernst Betche in 1911 after a collection by J.L.Boorman, the Dorrigo waratah was raised to species status and reclassified as Oreocallis pinnata by Dutch botanist Hermann Otto Sleumer in 1954. The Australian members of the genus Oreocallis were recognised as markedly distinct from the South American species, which saw them allocated to the new genus Alloxylon. Hence, Oreocallis pinnata was given the new combination Alloxylon pinnatum in 1991 by Peter Weston and Mike Crisp of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. The species name refers to the pinnate <b>leaves.</b> <b>Aside</b> from Dorrigo waratah, {{it has also been}} called the Dorrigo oak, red silky oak, tree waratah, pink silky oak, red oak, Queensland waratah, and waratah oak. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek allo-, meaning [...] "other" [...] or [...] "strange", and xylon, meaning [...] "wood". It refers to the genus's unusual cell architecture compared with the related genera Telopea and Oreocallis.|$|E

Color {{he sees as}} a dispositional property, not an objective one, an approach which allows for the facts of difference between person and person, and also <b>leaves</b> <b>aside</b> the claim that external objects are colored. Colors are therefore [...] "virtual properties", {{in that it is}} as if things possessed them; although the naïve view attributes them to objects, they are intrinsic, non-relational inner experiences.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leaves are}} usually large and imposing, often lobed or deeply cut, {{and may be}} more or less pinnate. They can also be oval, spear-shaped, or in many other {{possible}} shape variations. The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. An interesting quality of philodendrons is {{that they do not have}} a single type of leaf on the same plant. Instead, they have juvenile leaves and adult leaves, which can be drastically different from one another. The leaves of seedling philodendrons are usually heart-shaped. Early in the life of the plant, but after it has matured past the seedling stage, the leaves will have acquired the typical juvenile leaf's shape and size. Later in the philodendron's life, it starts producing adult leaves, a process called metamorphosis. Most philodendrons go through metamorphosis gradually; there is no immediately distinct difference between juvenile and adult <b>leaves.</b> <b>Aside</b> from being typically much bigger than the juvenile leaves, the shape of adult leaves can be significantly different. In fact, considerable taxonomic difficulty has occurred in the past due to these differences, causing juvenile and adult plants to mistakenly be classified as different species. The trigger for the transformation to adult leaves can vary considerably. One possible trigger is the height of the plant. Secondary hemiepiphytes start off on the dark forest floor and climb their way up a tree, displaying their juvenile type leaves along the way. Once they reach a sufficient height, they begin developing adult type leaves. The smaller juvenile leaves are used for the darker forest floor where light is in scarce supply, but once they reach a sufficient height in the canopy the light is bright enough that the bigger adult leaves can serve a useful purpose. Another possible trigger occurs in primary hemiepiphytes. [...] These philodendrons typically send their aerial roots downward. [...] Once their roots have reached the ground below, the plant will begin taking up nutrients from the soil, of which it had been previously deprived. As a result, the plant will quickly morph into its adult leaves and gain in size dramatically. Another interesting quality of philodendrons leaves is they are often quite different in shape and size even between two plants of the same species. As a result of all these different possible leaf shapes, it is often difficult to differentiate natural variations from morphogenesis.|$|E
60|$|My eye was {{attracted}} by {{a statue of}} St. Joseph which stood in the corner. There was a wreath of leaves {{along the edge of}} the pedestal, with a lamp burning amidst them. I rushed across to it and tore the <b>leaves</b> <b>aside.</b>|$|E

60|$|The advance {{was more}} rapid now, for Binu Charley placed the captive bushman {{in front of}} him and made him clear the run-way of traps. Once, at a sharp turn where a man's {{shoulder}} would unavoidably brush against a screen of leaves, the bushman displayed great caution as he spread the <b>leaves</b> <b>aside</b> and exposed the head of a sharp-pointed spear, so set that the casual passer-by would receive at the least a nasty scratch.|$|E
60|$|Into this pit {{had drifted}} uncounted generations of {{withered}} leaves, half filling it. Oak, beech, and chestnut, rotten and brown alike, mingled themselves in one fibrous mass. Manston descended into {{the midst of}} them, placed his sack on the ground, and raking the <b>leaves</b> <b>aside</b> into a large heap, began digging. Anne softly drew nearer, crept into a bush, and turning her head to survey the rest, missed {{the man who had}} dropped behind, and whom we have called the first watcher. Concluding that he, too, had hidden himself, she turned her attention to the second watcher, the other woman, who had meanwhile advanced near to where Anne lay in hiding, and now seated herself behind a tree, still closer to the steward than was Anne Seaway.|$|E
60|$|A {{stream of}} light {{suddenly}} broke {{out from the}} door of the homestead and Wandle's hand closed quickly on the match; somebody was crossing from the house to the stable with a lantern. He could see the man's dark figure plainly, though he could not recognize him, and he waited until a door was noisily opened. Then he scraped the <b>leaves</b> <b>aside</b> and laid the brown clothes in the hollow. He stayed beside it until the man with the lantern returned to the house, and then he crept back through the bluff and led his horse toward its end, where he mounted and rode to the next farm. After spending an hour with its owner, arranging for a journey to a bluff where unusually large logs could be found, he rode home content. Everything had gone as he wished; there would, he thought, be snow enough before morning to cover any tracks he had left, and he could, if necessary, account for his having been in the neighborhood of the Prescott farm.|$|E

60|$|But {{the little}} Dwarf cared nothing {{for all this}} magnificence. He would not have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy, nor one white petal of his rose for the throne itself. What he wanted was to see the Infanta before she {{went down to the}} pavilion, and to ask her to come away with him when he had {{finished}} his dance. Here, in the Palace, the air was close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the sunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous <b>leaves</b> <b>aside.</b> There were flowers, too, in the forest, not so splendid, perhaps, as the flowers in the garden, but more sweetly scented for all that; hyacinths in early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens, and grassy knolls; yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the gnarled roots of the oak-trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and irises lilac and gold. There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the foxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled bee-haunted cells. The chestnut had its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its pallid moons of beauty. Yes: surely she would come if he could only find her! She would come with him to the fair forest, and all day long he would dance for her delight. A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he passed into the next room.|$|E
6000|$|WE chanced {{in passing}} by that {{afternoon}} [...] To catch it {{in a sort}} of special picture [...] Among tar-banded ancient cherry trees, [...] Set well back from the road in rank lodged grass, [...] The little cottage we were speaking of, [...] A front with just a door between two windows, [...] Fresh painted by the shower a velvet black. [...] We paused, the minister and I, to look. [...] He made as if to hold it at arm's length [...] Or put the <b>leaves</b> <b>aside</b> that framed it in. [...] "Pretty," [...] he said. [...] "Come in. No one will care." [...] The path was a vague parting in the grass [...] That led us to a weathered window-sill. [...] We pressed our faces to the pane.

Of course the easy way [...] Is to decide it simply isn't true. [...] It may not be. I heard a fellow say so.

[...] Not that she ever had to ask me not to; [...] It never got so far as that; but the bare thought [...] Of her old tremulous bonnet in the pew, [...] And of her half asleep was too much for me. [...] Why, I might wake her up and startle her. [...] It was the words 'descended into Hades' [...] That seemed too pagan to our liberal youth. [...] You know they suffered from a general onslaught. [...] And well, if they weren't true why keep right on [...] Saying them like the heathen? We could drop them. [...] Only--there was the bonnet in the pew.
