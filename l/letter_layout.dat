30|$|In addition, the <b>letter</b> <b>layout</b> of the 8 × 6 {{grid and}} that of the {{character}} keys in ambiguous mode is relatively easy to remember, since they are approximately alphabetic. As far as ambiguous mode is concerned, this choice has been justified in the section on the dictionary size: a frequency-based arrangement results in marginal improvements regarding disambiguation quality, but this does not outweigh the fact that an alphabetic arrangement is much more intuitive. However, remembering the letter to key assignments still requires some practice.|$|E

How could the archeologist explain {{the fact that only}} one type of key <b>letter</b> <b>layout,</b> namely the “QWERTY ” layout, was available in the English speaking world? The explanation for this apparently chaotic (i. e., non-alphabetic) letter disposition is that this arrangement was designed to reduce the probability of physical clashing of metal type-bars by placing commonly used combinations of letters as far as possible from each other.

Participants {{were also asked}} to enter letters on a blank image of a Qwerty keyboard. This was a test of the idea that the automatic eyes-free act of touch typing may weaken touch typists ' mental image of the layout of letters on the Qwerty keyboard, compared to non-touch typists who visually attend to keys and letters as they type. Overall, touch typists correctly placed 16. 7 of 26 letters, about 80 % higher than the 9. 3 of 26 letters correctly placed by non-touch typists. Thus touch typists, despite using a highly learned motor behaviour, seem to have a better mental image of the Qwerty <b>letter</b> <b>layout</b> than nontouch typists. No relationship was found between daily usage of computers and ability to correctly place letters on the keyboard image...|$|E

50|$|A thumb-shift {{keyboard}} is {{an alternative}} design, popular among professional Japanese typists. Like a standard Japanese keyboard, it has hiragana characters marked in addition to Latin <b>letters,</b> but the <b>layout</b> is completely different. Most letter keys have two kana characters associated with them, which allows all the characters to fit in three rows, like in Western layouts. In {{the place of the}} space bar key on a conventional keyboard, there are two additional modifier keys, operated with thumbs - one of them is used to enter the alternate character marked, and the other is used for voiced sounds. The semi-voiced sounds are entered using either the conventional shift key operated by the little finger, or take place of the voiced sound for characters not having a voiced variant.|$|R

The project aimed at not only creating a large annotated database but also to organize a set of evaluation campaigns covering a variety of document recognition tasks which could eventually fit in different industrial applications. The {{first phase of the}} evaluation campaign [63] comprised tasks including document (<b>letters</b> and fax) <b>layout</b> analysis, handwriting recognition (isolated characters, words and blocks of text), writer identification (on words and paragraphs), writer verification, logo recognition and identification of scenario from letters. The second phase of the campaign [214] focused on three themes, document layout analysis, handwriting recognition and writer identification and a total of seven tasks. Five French research labs participated in this second phase of evaluations. After two successful phases of evaluations, the database was employed in a number of International competitions, discussed later in this paper.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dependence}} of the galaxy contents within halos on the halo formation time using two galaxy formation models, one being a semianalytic model utilizing the halo assembly history from a high resolution N-body simulation and the other being a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation including radiative cooling, star formation, and energy feedback from galactic winds. We confirm the finding by Gao et al. that at fixed mass, the clustering of halos depends on the halo formation time, especially for low-mass halos. This age dependence of halo clustering makes it desirable to study {{the correlation between the}} occupation of galaxies within halos and the halo age. We find that, in halos of fixed mass, the number of satellite galaxies has a strong dependence on halo age, with fewer satellites in older halos. The youngest one-third of the halos can have an order of magnitude more satellites than the oldest one-third. For central galaxies, in halos that form earlier, they tend to have more stars and thus appear to be more luminous, and {{the dependence of}} their luminosity on halo age is not as strong as that of stellar mass. The results can be understood through the star formation history in halos and the merging of satellites onto central galaxies. The age dependence of the galaxy contents within halos would constitute an important ingredient in a more accurate halo-based model of galaxy clustering.

40|$|Calceology is {{the study}} of {{recovered}} archaeological leather footwear and is comprised of conservation, documentation and identification of leather shoe components and shoe styles. Recovered leather shoes are complex artefacts that present technical, stylistic and personal information about the culture and people that used them. The current method in calceological research for typology and chronology is by comparison with parallel examples, though its use poses problems by an absence of basic definitions and the lack of a taxonomic hierarchy. The research findings of the primary cutting patterns, used for making all leather footwear, are integrated with the named style method and the Goubitz notation, resulting in a combined methodology as a basis for typological organisation for recovered footwear and a chronology for named shoe styles. The history of calceological research is examined in chapter two and is accompanied by a review of methodological problems as seen in the literature. Through the examination of various documentation and research techniques used during the history of calceological studies, the reasons why a standard typology and methodology failed to develop are investigated. The variety and continual invention of a new research method for each publication of a recovered leather assemblage hindered the development of a single standard methodology. Chapter three covers the initial research with the database through which the primary cutting patterns were identified and the named styles were defined. The chronological span of each named style was established through iterative cross-site sedation and named style comparisons. The technical interpretation of the primary cutting patterns' consistent use is due to constraints imposed by the leather and the forms needed to cover the foot. Basic parts of the shoe patterns and the foot are defined, plus terms provided for identifying the key points for pattern making. Chapter four presents the seventeen primary cutting patterns and their sub-types, these are divided into three main groups: six integral soled patterns, four hybrid soled patterns and seven separately soled patterns. Descriptions of the <b>letter</b> codes, pattern <b>layout,</b> construction principle, closing seam placement and list of sub-types are included in the descriptions of each primary cutting pattern. The named shoe styles and their relative chronology are presented in chapter five. Nomenclature for the named styles is based on the find location of the first published example plus the primary cutting pattern code letter. The named styles are presented in chronological order from Prehistory through to the late 16 th century. Short descriptions of the named styles are given and illustrated with examples of recovered archaeological leather footwear, reconstructions of archaeological shoes and iconographical sources. Chapter six presents documentation of recovered archaeological leather using the Goubitz notation, an inventory and description of style elements and fastening methods used for defining named shoe styles, technical information about sole/upper constructions and the consequences created by the use of lasts and sewing forms for style identification and fastening placement in relation to the instep point. The chapter concludes with further technical information about the implications for researchers about shoemaking, pattern making and reconstructive archaeology. The conclusion restates the original research question of why a group of primary cutting patterns appear to have been used consistently throughout the European archaeological record. The quantitative and qualitative results from the database show the use of these patterns but it is the properties of the leather that imposes the use of the primary cutting patterns. The combined methodology of primary pattern identification, named style and artefact registration provides a framework for calceological research...|$|R
