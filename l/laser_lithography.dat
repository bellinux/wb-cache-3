40|$|<b>Laser</b> thermal <b>lithography</b> {{is a good}} {{alternative}} method for forming small pattern feature size {{by taking advantage of}} the structural-change threshold effect of thermal lithography materials. In this work, the heat-diffusion channels of <b>laser</b> thermal <b>lithography</b> are first analyzed, and then we propose to manipulate the heat-diffusion channels by inserting thermal conduction layers in between channels. Heat-flow direction can be changed from the in-plane to the out-of-plane of the thermal lithography layer, which causes the size of the structural-change threshold region to become much smaller than the focused laser spot itself; thus, nanoscale marks can be obtained. Samples designated as "glass substrate/thermal conduction layer/thermal lithography layer (100 nm) /thermal conduction layer" are designed and prepared. Chalcogenide phase-change materials are used as thermal lithography layer, and Si is used as thermal conduction layer to manipulate heat-diffusion channels. <b>Laser</b> thermal <b>lithography</b> experiments are conducted on a home-made high-speed rotation direct laser writing setup with 488 nm laser wavelength and 0. 90 numerical aperture of converging lens.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of light with {{various types of}} metallic nanostructures reveals unique optical properties originating from the excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonances, {{which can be used}} {{for a wide range of}} spectroscopic and sensing applications. While, precisely defined and tailored nanostructures are essential building blocks for realizing such schemes, the commonly used electron-beam lithography is a cost-intensive and time-consuming method to create well-defined nanostructures over small areas. However, a low-cost and high-throughput fabricationmethod over large areas is crucial to advance plasmonic devices towards life science and technological applications. Building on these concepts, this thesis demonstrates the use of versatile large-area fabrication methods such <b>Laser</b> Interference <b>Lithography</b> (LIL) and Direct Laser Writing (DLW) for the fabrication of different plasmonic devices such as perfect absorber sensors and surface enhanced infrared absorption substrates. Both lithographic techniques allow for fast and homogeneous preparation of various nanoantenna geometries.

Furthermore, both <b>laser</b> interference <b>lithography</b> and direct <b>laser</b> writing allow for the preparation of large-area plasmonics nanoantenna arrays for surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy, enabling the detection of small amounts of vibrationally active molecules. Additionally, both techniques combined with subsequent etching processes are employed for nanostructuring of so-called alternative plasmonic materials namely titanium nitride.
