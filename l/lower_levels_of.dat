40|$|This study {{utilized}} {{employees in}} foreign companies as the study subject {{to analyze the}} relationships between corporate sponsorship, organizational commitment, organizational cohesiveness and turnover intention. The results indicated that: employees with a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> organizational commitment have a <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> turnover intention; organizational commitment can enhance organizational cohesiveness; organizations with a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> organizational cohesiveness will have a <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> turnover intention; for organizations with the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> organizational commitment, employees will have a <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> turnover intention if their corporate sponsorship is higher than their counterpart whose organization has a <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> corporate sponsorship. Our result revealed {{that even though the}} score of organizational commitment is low among the sample, the hypothesis that organizational commitment and organizational cohesiveness both exert positive influences is supported. </p...|$|R

5|$|It was {{determined}} that many Ontario highways no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> government in 1997 and 1998 (downloading), removing {{a significant percentage of}} the provincial highway network.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{remained}} unchanged {{for over three}} decades, {{with the exception of}} a Connecting Link agreement established between the MTO and the City of Barrie. However, during the late 1990s, the MTO transferred many highways to <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> government as a cost-cutting measure. Highway90 was transferred to Simcoe County on January1, 1998.|$|E

5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development are seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Between 2007 and 2010, {{he pitched}} in the <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the Philadelphia Phillies' Minor League system {{initially}} as a starter, and subsequently as a reliever.

At {{the conclusion of}} both 2008 and 2009, he pitched in the Florida Instructional League to continue honing his skills on the mound.|$|E

5|$|In 1945 Ole Lippman, {{leader of}} the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their {{operations}} by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the building.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Lunney became {{manager of}} the space shuttle program, a {{high-level}} position where Lunney found himself responsible for setting the agenda for the developing program. His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning. During the earlier shuttle flights he was even involved in determining whether the weather was suitable for launch, but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Kendrick {{was born}} in Houston, Texas, but {{attended}} high school in Mount Vernon, Washington. While growing up, he was greatly influenced by his father, from whom he developed his composure when pitching. Upon graduation, he turned down a scholarship to play college football, instead signing a contract to begin his professional baseball career in the Phillies' organization. After a slow ascent through the <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the Phillies' minor league system, he made his MLB debut in 2007, {{and was a member}} of the starting rotation of the 2008 World Series Champion team.|$|E

5|$|Research, in 2008, by {{scientists}} from Pennsylvania State University found {{high levels of}} the pesticides fluvalinate and coumaphos in samples of wax from hives, as well as <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> 70 other pesticides. These chemicals {{have been used to}} try to eradicate varroa mites, a bee pest that itself has been thought to be a cause of CCD. Researchers from Washington State University, under entomology professor Steve Sheppard in 2009, confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between it and significantly reduced bee longevity.|$|E
5|$|Territorial {{males are}} very site-faithful; 90% {{return to the}} same lekking sites in {{subsequent}} seasons, the most dominant males being {{the most likely to}} reappear. Site-faithful males can acquire accurate information about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. Such stable relationships reduce conflict and the risk of injury, and the consequent <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> male aggression are less likely to scare off females. Lower-ranked territorial males also benefit from site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting for the top males eventually to drop out.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} {{focal point}} of the Cycle Center is an atrium that introduces the two <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> facilities and provides an aesthetic above-ground presence. The atrium, which has been praised by Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Blair Kamin more than once, has a sloping solar paneled roof. The 120solar panels produce 6.5percent of the electricity supply required for the climate-controlled building. The Cycle Center has an opaque design, with thin steel frames for its main windows. The interior design uses stainless steel and blond wood, and shade is produced by awnings.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} conducted after the fires, a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused fires, are to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> tolerance.|$|E
5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} Netherlands after the central government and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, {{which means that the}} central government is supreme and delegates certain tasks to <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities a certain degree of independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.|$|E
