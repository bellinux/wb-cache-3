5|$|Merrick {{became one}} of 928 {{residents}} in the workhouse. The group was segregated by age and sex, and therefore Merrick was housed with the other men between 16 and 60. On 22 March 1880, only 12 weeks after entering, Merrick signed {{himself out of the}} workhouse and spent two days <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> With no more success than before, he found himself with no option but to return to the workhouse. This time he stayed for four years. Around 1882, Merrick underwent surgery on his face. The protrusion from his mouth had grown to 8–9inches and severely inhibited his speech and made it difficult to eat. He was operated on in the Workhouse Infirmary under the direction of Dr Clement Frederick Bryan and had {{a large part of the}} mass removed.|$|E

5|$|The telenovela was {{produced}} by Pol-ka based on a premise by Adrián Suar, which he formulated nearly {{six months before the}} show's premiere, after discussion with his partner Javier Blanco y Tevah. The premise involves a rich businessman and former Formula 1 racing driver who {{falls in love with a}} poor woman <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in his emporium. Suar requested scripts from Ernesto Korovsky and Sebastian Parrotta, the authors of Gasoleros and El sodero de mi vida, and Hombres de honor and Padre Coraje respectively. The program was directed by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antúnez and produced by César Markus González. Most of the filming was done in the Pol-ka studio at the Colegiales neighborhood, using outdoor scenes unconventional for the genre.|$|E
5|$|A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was {{eaten by}} miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The {{technician}} {{who did the}} research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional fillings have included {{a wide variety of}} locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, {{while still}} {{attending}} high school, Cooper took three art courses at Montana Agricultural College in Bozeman. His interest in art was inspired years earlier by the Western paintings of Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington. Cooper especially admired and studied Russell's Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross' Hole (1910), which still {{hangs in the}} state capitol building in Helena. In 1922, Cooper enrolled in Grinnell College in Iowa to continue his art education. Cooper did well academically in most of his courses, but was not accepted to the school's drama club. His drawings and watercolors were exhibited throughout the dormitory, and he was named art editor for the college yearbook. During the summers of 1922 and 1923, Cooper worked at Yellowstone National Park as a tour guide driving the yellow open-top buses. Despite a promising first eighteen months at Grinnell, he left college suddenly in February 1924, spent a month in Chicago <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> as an artist, {{and then returned to}} Helena, where he sold editorial cartoons to the Independent, a local newspaper.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Mr. Burns fires Homer for his laziness and incompetence. <b>Looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> Homer answers a {{classified}} ad {{to become a}} grave digger. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns is nearing the completion of his giant robotic laborer, which he hopes will eventually replace weak-bodied human workers. The only remaining step is to implant a human brain into the machine's body. Searching a graveyard the following night, Mr. Burns mistakes Homer, snoring in an open grave, for a newly buried corpse and, despite signs that Homer may still be alive, removes Homer's brain with an ice cream scoop and places it in the robot. However, Robo-Homer is just as lazy and incompetent as he was as a human, using his X-ray vision to locate donuts. Mr. Burns declares the experiment a failure and, after restoring the brain to Homer's still-living body, kicks the robot, which topples over and crushes Mr. Burns. Afterward, he tells Smithers to get some surgical tools and ether.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{was born}} in the 600‑person farming {{community}} of Avon, South Dakota. His father, Rev. Joseph C. McGovern, born in 1868, was pastor of the local Wesleyan Methodist Church there. Joseph – the son of an alcoholic who had immigrated from Ireland – had grown up in several states, working in coal mines from the age of nine and parentless from the age of thirteen. He had been a professional baseball player in the minor leagues, but had given it up due to his teammates' heavy drinking, gambling and womanizing, and entered the seminary instead. George's mother was the former Frances McLean, born c. 1890 and initially raised in Ontario; her family had later moved to Calgary, Alberta, and then she came to South Dakota <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> as a secretary. George was the second oldest of four children. Joseph McGovern's salary never reached $100 per month, and he often received compensation in the form of potatoes, cabbages, or other food items. Joseph and Frances McGovern were both firm Republicans, but were not politically active or doctrinaire.|$|E

5|$|On 18 February 1905, he {{was married}} to a divorcee, Frances Jane Wyatt, in London. In 1908, he was brought before the courts in {{bankruptcy}} proceedings, owing some ₤5,500. During the hearing he stated that he had been at sea during the period 1898–1902, and had not been working since he returned, although he had visited Ceylon late the previous year <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> He and his wife had one daughter. He was enlisted in the Royal Horse Artillery in September 1910, having lowered his age and given Auckland as his place of birth. He served as a soldier for a year before leaving his wife and child at their Park Lane home in London and travelling to Sydney, Australia.

During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.|$|E

5|$|Andrei (Anatoly Solonitsyn), Daniil (Nikolai Grinko) and Kirill (Ivan Lapikov) are {{wandering}} monks and religious icon painters, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> The three represent different creative characters. Andrei is the observer, a humanist who {{searches for the}} good in people and wants to inspire and not frighten. Daniil is withdrawn and resigned, and not as bent on creativity as on self-realization. Kirill lacks talent as a painter, yet still strives to achieve prominence. He is jealous, self-righteous, very intelligent and perceptive. The three have just left the Andronikov Monastery, where they have lived for many years, heading to Moscow. During a heavy rain shower they seek shelter in a barn, {{where a group of}} villagers is being entertained by a jester (Rolan Bykov). The jester, or skomorokh, is a bitterly sarcastic enemy {{of the state and the}} Church, who earns a living with his scathing and obscene social commentary and by making fun of the Boyars. He ridicules the monks as they come in, and after some time Kirill leaves unnoticed. Shortly, a group of soldiers arrive to arrest the skomorokh, whom they take outside, knock unconscious and take away, also smashing his musical instrument. As the rain has stopped the three monks thank the villagers for allowing them to shelter and continue on their way. As they walk on the heavy rain starts again.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1892, as the {{aftershock}} of the stand-off was still being felt throughout the county, two alleged horse rustlers were gunned down by range detectives east of the Big Horn River. The killers escaped the law with assistance from Otto Franc, a rancher who had sided with the large cattle company faction. On May 24, 1893, Nate Champion's brother, Dudley Champion, came to Wyoming <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> before he {{was shot and killed}} in cold blood. Fifteen miles from town, Dudley had come across the ranch of Mike Shonsey, who, after seeing the young man, immediately grabbed a gun and fired at him. A coroner's inquiry ruled Shonsey's actions were self-defense and he was acquitted of murder. Afterwards, Shonsey left the country before the officials could continue with the investigation. A year before, Shonsey actually met Nate Champion near the Beaver Creek Canyon, where a fight almost commenced between the two as Nate suspected that Shonsey was one of the five men who had attacked him in his cabin. He further threatened Shonsey and demanded he give up the names {{of the rest of the}} assassins. This event made Shonsey harbor hatred toward Nate and probably toward his brother Dudley as well. Dudley Champion was the last person killed who was associated with the Johnson County War.|$|E
