However, there are few reports {{on the performance of}} such coupled systems. In this study, we determined the optimal configuration of CW-MFCs to characterize their electricity generation performance. Based on the results using different levels of dissolved oxygen among the CW-MFCs, we concluded that a 20 -cm distance between the anode and cathode produced an optimal removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 94. 90 % with a 0. 15 W/m 3 power density, 339. 80 Ω internal resistance, and 0. 31 % coulombic efficiency. In addition, a COD of 200 mg/L provided greater electricity generation (741 mV open circuit voltage, 0. 20 W/m 3 power density, 339. 80 Ω internal resistance, and 0. 49 mA current) and purification ability (90. 45 % COD removal) to meet system COD <b>loading</b> <b>limitations</b> than did higher COD values.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} work in {{free electron laser}} (FEL) physics, and the physics of particle accelerators over the last 10 years has pointed {{to the possibility of}} the generation of MW-level optical beams with laser-like characteristics in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral range. The concept is based on generation of the radiation in the master oscillator–power FEL amplifier (MOPA) configuration. The FEL amplifier concept eliminates the need for an optical cavity. As a result, there are no thermal <b>loading</b> <b>limitations</b> to increase the average output power of this device up to the MW-level. The problem of a tunable master oscillator can be solved with available conventional quantum lasers.

The Gen- 2 project {{objective}} includes flight-testing a dynamic inversion controller augmented by a direct adaptive neural network to demonstrate performance improvements {{in the presence of}} simulated failure/damage. The Gen- 2 objectives as implemented on the NASA NF- 15 B created challenges for software design, structural <b>loading</b> <b>limitations,</b> and flight test operations. Simulated failure/damage is introduced by modifying control surface commands, therefore requiring structural loads measurements. Flight-testing began with the validation of a structural loads model. Flight-testing of the Gen- 2 controller continued, using test maneuvers designed in a sequenced approach.

40|$|A novel {{strategy}} for self-reconfiguration of chain-type unit-modular robots is introduced. The strategy uses a graph representation for modular robots, allowing for compact processing of the robot 2 ̆ 7 s connectivity information. The main {{contributions of the}} research are the incorporation of kinematic and <b>loading</b> <b>limitations</b> {{in the choice of}} reconfiguration steps and the development of new graph-matching techniques which are useful not only in modular robot reconfiguration planning but in other engineering applications as well. This allows for generation of multiple candidate reconfiguration paths and the automatic elimination of infeasible reconfiguration steps. ^ This thesis begins with a discussion {{of the state of the}} art of robotic self-reconfiguration, followed by an overview of the graph theory which underlies the research. Once this foundation is laid, relevant existing methods for robotic reconfiguration are critiqued, and some subproblems preliminary to reconfiguration are discussed. The new reconfiguration algorithm is then outlined and illustrated through a series of examples. Kinematic and force analysis techniques designed for integration with the reconfiguration algorithm are also presented. The focus then returns to the important and broadly applicable combinatoric problem of graph matching, which must be performed preliminary to the actual reconfiguration planning. Finally, the findings of this thesis are summarized, and examples are given demonstrating potential extensions and further applications of the work presented here. ...|$|E

40|$|The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) waste {{management}} strategy revolves around specific treatment of individual {{or groups of}} separated waste streams. A goal for the separations processes is to efficiently manage the waste to be dispositioned as high level radioactive waste. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) baseline technology for immobilization of the lanthanide (Ln) and transition metal fission product (TM) wastes is vitrification into a borosilicate glass. A current interest is to evaluate the feasibility of vitrifying combined waste streams to most cost effectively immobilize the wastes resulting from aqueous fuel reprocessing. Studies showed that high waste loadings are achievable for the Ln only (Option 1) stream. Waste loadings in excess of 60 wt % (on a calcined oxide basis) were demonstrated via a lanthanide borosilicate (LaBS) glass. The resulting glasses had excellent relative durability {{as determined by the}} Product Consistency Test (PCT). For a combined Ln and TM waste stream glass (Option 2), noble metal solubility was found to limit waste loading. However, the measured PCT normalized elemental releases for this glass were at least an order of magnitude below that of Environmental Assessment (EA) glass.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a proof of concept {{implementation}} of a Hyper-Redundent Reconfigurable Modular Manipulator system (RMMS) in an attempt to validate the Modular Decentralized Control (MDC) technique in a real world environment. Hyper-redundancy enables flexibility in configuration space. Decentralized control of manipulators enables modular construction with its attendant ease of design and reduced cost. The need for a full environment reconstruction in one master controller is bypassed by having localized and simpler subgoals for each module. The manipulator has been designed with each clone module a selfcontained structure including mechanical hardware, actuators, microprocessors and motor controllers. Flange interfaces at both ends of a module allowed for ease in system reconfigurability. Each module had two rotational DOFs and formed part of an exemplar serial manipulator allowing for 3 D end effector position and orientation control as determined from a combination of all module’s local actions. Test data from the environment in real time was transmitted to the first module via a stereo vision system. Each module in the system then took pseudo-independant control action, communicating through receiving and transmitting data between adjacent serial modules that formed a robot anthropic structure. The system also had the capability to avoid obstacles in real time by inclusion of bump sensors on each module. The results demonstrated the predicted fault-tolerant, robust nature of the control approach, achieving system flexibility and versatility. The MDC method is capable of extending across an extensive network of interconnected modules that would be limited more by mechanical configuration <b>loading</b> <b>limitations,</b> not communication issues. MDC has a full near world-wide patent covering its intellectual property. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} requirements of turbofan engines demands a stability and transient capability beyond that {{associated with the}} past generations of gas turbine engines. The axial flow fan unit is most vulnerable to <b>loading</b> <b>limitations</b> due to the primary {{problems associated with the}} compression process, its sensitivity to inlet distortion and the difficulty to design for an overall optimum blade duty in a machine of wide radial blade loading distribution. The development of mathematical models with some capability of predicting the stable operating range of an axial flow fan has to overcome the difficulties associated with the modelling of the radially distinct flow regions and their dynamic interaction. ' The current investigation combined the available knowledge of one-dimensional models (based on the principles of conservation of mass, linear momentum and energy) with the assumptions of the parallel compressor theory, in order to develop a linearized system of equations for stability analysis (surge prediction). The stability conditions which emerged from this approach were applied on the experimentally derived characteristics of a low hub to tip ratio split flow fan in a manner which involved the modelling of the dynamic interaction of the inner and outer flow region of the fan. The development of the governing equations was achieved by applying one-dimensional flow analysis to the inner and outer section of the fan. Their interaction was modelled on the experimentally obtained radial movement of the splitter streamline and the discharge,static pressure 'radial distribution. The inner and outer region were treated as a lumped volume element search operating on a local masflow averaged total pressure rise characteristic and alternatively acting in conjunction with a common nozzle and separate nozzles. The experimental investigation was carried out on a low hub totipratio two-stage split flow fan(with the facility of independent bypass and core throttles) in order to examine the localised and overall performance of such a fan(and the staling processes involved) and to enable the application of the stability analysis.
