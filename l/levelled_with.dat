5|$|After {{deciding}} not {{to renew}} the lease on the Four Acres, Albion moved to their fifth ground, Stoney Lane, {{in time for the}} 1885–86 season. The ground was located close to the Plough and Harrow public house, which served as the club's headquarters at the time. Albion took out an initial seven-year lease on the Stoney Lane site, paying an annual rent of £28 to its owner, a local undertaker named Mr Webb. The pitch was returfed and <b>levelled,</b> <b>with</b> ashes spread around the perimeter, and a wooden grandstand was built that {{came to be known as}} 'Noah's Ark'. The ground cost £370 to build, a sum that was offset by a number of friendly matches that took place early in the season.|$|E

500|$|Fielding and Gascoyne {{had each}} issued {{contradictory}} pamphlets on the case, {{but it was}} Virtue Hall's testimony, fundamental in the prosecution of Squires and Wells, which became central to Gascoyne's investigation. [...] Hall had given her testimony to Fielding under threat of imprisonment and when by chance the Grub Street writer John Hill heard from a Magistrate that she had showed signs of remorse, he was presented with a perfect opportunity to settle an old score. [...] A prodigious writer {{and author of a}} renowned newspaper column, The Inspector, Hill had squabbled with several of his peers, notably so in Fielding's case, as Fielding had closed that argument in his Covent Garden Journal by stating that [...] "this hill was only a paltry dunghill, and had long before been <b>levelled</b> <b>with</b> the dirt." ...|$|E

500|$|After the sinking, the {{partially}} buried wreck created a barrier at {{a right angle}} against the currents of the Solent. Two scour pits, large underwater ditches, formed {{on either side of}} the wreck while silt and seaweed was deposited inside the ship. A deep but narrow pit formed on the upward tilting port side, while a shallower, broader pit formed on the starboard side, which had mostly been buried by the force of the impact. The abrasive actions of sand and silt carried by the currents and the activity of fungi, bacteria and wood-boring crustaceans and molluscs, such as the teredo [...] "shipworm", began to break down the structure of the ship. Eventually the exposed wooden structure was weakened and gradually collapsed. The timbers and contents of the port side were deposited in the scour pits and the remaining ship structure, or else carried off by the currents. Following the collapse of the exposed parts of the ship the site was <b>levelled</b> <b>with</b> the seabed and was gradually covered by layers of sediment, concealing most of the remaining structure. During the 16th century a hard layer of compacted clay and crushed shells formed over the ship, stabilising the site and sealing the Tudor-era deposits. Further layers of soft silt covered the site during the 18th and 19th centuries, but frequent changes in the tidal patterns and currents in the Solent occasionally exposed some of the timbers, leading to its accidental rediscovery in 1836 and aided in locating the wreck in 1971. After the ship had been raised it was determined that about 40% of the original structure had survived.|$|E

60|$|The eyes, therefore, {{of a very}} {{considerable}} multitude, were bent on {{the gate}} of the Preceptory of Templestowe, with the purpose of witnessing the procession; while still greater numbers had already surrounded the tiltyard belonging to that establishment. This enclosure was formed on a piece of level ground adjoining to the Preceptory, which had been <b>levelled</b> <b>with</b> care, for the exercise of military and chivalrous sports. It occupied the brow of a soft and gentle eminence, was carefully palisaded around, and, as the Templars willingly invited spectators to be witnesses of their skill in feats of chivalry, was amply supplied with galleries and benches for their use.|$|E
60|$|All this {{confirms}} what I {{have said}} before, namely, that trade in England neither is nor {{ought to be}} <b>levelled</b> <b>with</b> what it is in other countries; nor the tradesmen depreciated as they are abroad, and as some of our gentry would pretend to do in England; but that, as many of our best families rose from trade, so many branches of the best families in England, under the nobility, have stooped so low as to be put apprentices to tradesmen in London, and {{to set up and}} follow those trades when they have come out of their times, and have thought it no dishonour to their blood.|$|E
60|$|Among the Alps are {{few places}} {{that do not}} {{preclude}} this feeling of tranquil sublimity.

Nevertheless, I would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes.|$|E

6000|$|On the {{following}} morning I was awakened by the shrill cries of the Tibetan maidens, calling the yaks to be milked, [...] "Toosh--toosh-- toooosh," [...] in a gradually higher key; to which Toosh seemed supremely indifferent, till quickened in her movements by a stone or stick, <b>levelled</b> <b>with</b> unerring aim at her ribs; these animals were changing their long winter's wool for sleek hair, and the former hung about them in ragged masses, like tow.

60|$|And {{this brings}} me to speak of those ladies, who, though they do, perhaps, for want of better offers, stoop to wed a trade, as we call it, and take up with a mechanic; yet all the while they are the tradesmen's wives, they {{endeavour}} to preserve the distinction of their fancied character; carry themselves as if {{they thought they were}} still above their station, and that, though they were unhappily yoked with a tradesman, they would still keep up the dignity of their birth, and be called gentlewomen; and in order to this, would behave like such all the way, whatever rank they were <b>levelled</b> <b>with</b> by the misfortune of their circumstances.|$|E

Rest, work, solitude, and the frankness of intercourse with his kind were alike forbidden to him. Everything was gone. His existence was a great cold blank, something like the enormous plain of the whole of Russia <b>levelled</b> <b>with</b> snow and fading gradually on all sides into shadows and mists.|$|E

60|$|The {{reader will}} {{remember}} that the bee-elm had stood {{on the edge of}} a dense thicket, or swamp, in which the trees grew to a size several times exceeding those of the oaks in the openings; and le Bourdon had caused it to fall upon the open ground, in order to work at the honey with greater ease to himself. Consequently, the fragments lay in full view of the spot where the halt was made. A little to Gershom's surprise, Ben now produced his spy-glass, which he <b>levelled</b> <b>with</b> much earnestness toward the tree. The bee-hunter, however, well knew his business, and was examining into the state of the insects whom he had so violently invaded the night before. The air was filled with them, flying above and around the tree; a perfect cloud of the little creatures hovering directly over the hole, as if to guard its treasure.|$|E
