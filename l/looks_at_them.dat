5|$|A badly wounded Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) {{returns to}} camp {{and tells the}} others about Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), and that other people live on the island, besides the plane {{survivors}}. Locke looks on from the shadows with his arms crossed. Hurley reveals to Jack {{that one of the}} survivors is not listed on the flight manifest, which means that someone was already on the island when the plane crashed. Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, who <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> ominously.|$|E

25|$|Op art is {{a method}} of {{painting}} concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing. Op art works are abstract, {{with many of the}} better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.|$|E

500|$|Miyamoto's guiding design {{philosophy}} was {{to include more}} details than earlier games, now utilizing the Nintendo 64's power to feature [...] "all the emotions of the characters". He likened the game's style to a 3D interactive cartoon. Some details were inspired by the developers' personal lives; for example, the Boos are based on assistant director Takashi Tezuka's wife, who, as Miyamoto explained, [...] "is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at work." [...] In the game, the Boos shrink when Mario <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> but when he turns away, they grow large and menacing.|$|E
500|$|The {{churches in}} van Eyck's work are {{not based on}} {{historical}} buildings, but were amalgams of different buildings and fictitious spaces. The church might resemble St. Donatian's, which has since been demolished; it seems to share similarities with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, with elements of Romanesque architecture. Van Eyck's paintings [...] are often spatially ambiguous; the more the viewer <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> the more questions are raised. Reflecting a consensus among art historians, Ward interprets the contradictions as [...] "either curiously incoherent or deliberately designed to enact a complex symbolic message." [...] Mary holds a stem that appears to grow from the parrot's feathers, culminating in a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers. A parrot was sometimes used as an emblem for the Virgin, but its juxtaposition with the plant is incongruous. The parrot and plant emphasise the floral background, symbolising the Garden of Eden, accented by the figures of Adam of Eve. The flowers' colours represent purity, love and humility; its petals are {{a symbol of the}} cross and Christ's sacrifice. The narrative of original sin, the expulsion and redemption is thus captured in a single realistic device.|$|E
2500|$|By {{walking to}} the end of a road at night or a hill road, {{something}} the shape of a monk would suddenly appear, and if one looks up, it becomes larger the further one looks up. They are so big that one would look up at them, and thus are given the name [...] "." [...] Sometimes, if one just <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> like that, one might die, but they seem to disappear by saying [...] "." [...] They most frequently appear when walking alone on night paths, but they are also said to appear at intersections, stone bridges, and above trees.|$|E

2500|$|Their mother appears. She is distraught about Edmund's coughing, {{which he}} tries to {{suppress}} {{so as not to}} alarm her, fearing anything that might trigger her addiction again. When Edmund accepts his mother's excuse that she had been upstairs so long because she had been [...] "lying down", Jamie <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> both contemptuously. Mary notices and starts becoming defensive and belligerent, berating Jamie for his cynicism and disrespect for his parents. Jamie {{is quick to point out}} that the only reason he has survived as an actor is through his father's influence in the business.|$|E
2500|$|God created space-time {{along with}} all reality an {{indefinite}} time ago and created out of love {{for those who would}} be His children. Ruling from Heaven on high and [...] "working in mysterious ways", He guides Creation to the ultimate good of His creations. All beings are His creations and He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> all as His children. Indeed, His Christian worshippers refer to Him as Father. However, not all wish to accept His love and even reject Him and His goodness altogether. In the beginning, one of His creations, Lucifer rejected God's wisdom and, thinking that he could be a superior leader than his omniscient Creator, sought to take the throne of Heaven. Lucifer's War of Heaven and rebellion against God and His goodness {{led to the creation of}} evil. To delilver His children whom He so loved of evil, He sent Jesus, His only begotten Son and even sacrificed His life so that whoever believes in Him should not die but have eternal life. Afterwards, God made His will known through the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church that His Son established on Saint Peter.|$|E

40|$|As {{with social}} anxiety, {{people with high}} social {{appearance}} anxiety (SAA) might experience increased perceptions of being <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> by others and elevated levels of self-focussed evaluative attention (SFEA). This study tested whether individuals with high SAA perceive more people <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> than do those with low SAA, and whether SFEA increases this perception. A sample of 52 low SAA and 48 high SAA participants completed questionnaires and experimental tasks online. Participants estimated the proportion of people <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> in numerous matrices of faces. A control task of matrices of clocks was used. SFEA was experimentally manipulated. Those high in SAA estimated more people <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> and reported higher trait self-focussed attention. Increasing SFEA increased these individual’s estimates of faces <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> but did not affect perceptions of non- social stimuli. Implications for clinical interventions and the body image literature are discussed. Future lines of research are recommended...|$|R
