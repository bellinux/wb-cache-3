25|$|The {{panel van}} {{variant of the}} Logan was {{launched}} on 23 January 2007, in Bucharest. It is a small business oriented vehicle, with 2,500 litre <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> and 800kg payload. The Logan VAN {{is more or less}} an MCV without the rear side windows and therefore has the same safety features and uses the same engines as the other models (except the 1.6 16v engine). Production of this model was stopped in August 2012. Since its launch, over 53,000 units were manufactured. The panel van version is still produced at AvtoVAZ.|$|E

50|$|Unimogs were {{developed}} in post-war Germany {{to be used as}} agricultural equipment. The Unimog was designed with equal-sized wheels, a mounting bracket in front, a hitch in the rear, and <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> in the center. This was to make it a multi-purpose vehicle that farmers could use in the field and on the highway.|$|E

50|$|The new Econoline van {{had almost}} 40% more <b>load</b> <b>space</b> {{than the typical}} 1/2-ton panel {{delivery}} truck of the time, featuring an interior load area 54 in high and 65 in wide with over 204 cuft L total <b>load</b> <b>space.</b> These closed van body versions were popular as service vehicles, such as with utilities like the Bell Telephone System.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the accuracy of perceptions of a car <b>load</b> <b>space</b> in a CAVE virtual environment. A total of 46 participants rated <b>load</b> <b>space</b> width, height, depth, usability and overall capacity after viewing either a virtual Range Rover Evoque in the CAVE or the real car. Participants were also asked to estimate how many 100 mm 3 blocks could fit in the <b>load</b> <b>space</b> in width, depth or height. The only significant difference was in usability, which was rated higher in the CAVE. There was no systematic over- or under-estimation of distances in the virtual environment. Equivalence was demonstrated for width and depth in the block estimation task. The results suggest that virtual environments can be used for car <b>load</b> <b>space</b> design, particularly for estimates of size, but further work is required to be confident that subjective ratings of virtual properties are equivalent to those of real vehicles...|$|R
50|$|The Noble has a seating {{capacity}} of four passengers. The rear seats provide {{enough room for}} two adults with plenty of space for their knees, although the low roof-line restricts headroom significantly. The rear seats can fold down to reveal a flat <b>loading</b> <b>space,</b> which otherwise is negligible. A full size spare wheel is housed under the rear seats.|$|E
5000|$|The first Taros {{manufactured}} in Hanover, Germany, from 1989-1994 had a 2.4-litre diesel engine with , torque was 165 Nm at 2,400 rpm, with <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> of 3.4 m2 and a 1125 kg payload. It was only built with two-wheel drive {{and a regular}} cab, although the [...] "Taro" [...] moniker was used for other versions in other European markets.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} closely based on {{contemporary}} covered wagons. Externally the most noticeable feature of these mainly twin-axled livestock vans were the slatted sides guaranteeing good ventilation. Dividing walls on {{many types of}} livestock van enabled a vertical division of the <b>loading</b> <b>space.</b> In the side walls there were feeding and air flaps, the number of which corresponded {{to the number of}} compartments.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the optimization of a frame under uncertain loadings when two design criteria are taken simultaneously into account. The uncertainty {{relates to the}} applied loading and is inherent to the operation of structures since real structures are designed to sustain a large variety of load cases of practical relevance. The design criteria considered {{are two of the}} most important from a practical point of view: buckling load and natural frequency. The technique developed is based in convex modeling where a <b>load</b> <b>space</b> is defined and all the elements of that <b>load</b> <b>space</b> have equal probability of occurrence. The outcome of the technique is an optimal design for which one loading or several loadings of the <b>load</b> <b>space</b> are the most dangerous or harmful to the structure. On the other hand, it is guaranteed that all the other loadings contained in the <b>load</b> <b>space</b> are conservative {{in the sense that they}} are less harmful to the optimal design...|$|R

50|$|Both {{the need}} for {{additional}} <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> and the unaccompanied short-sea shipping demanded a new solution which was found in the Mega Trailer. In this new design, the internal loading height was increased to 3 meters by creating a thinner roof and chassis and lowering the floor. This also meant that a new truck had to be designed with a lower suspension, clutch and power train.|$|E
50|$|The Caddy Maxi {{family is}} 470 mm longer {{version of the}} Caddy with 4.2 m3 <b>loading</b> <b>space,</b> {{this is due to}} {{extensions}} of the wheelbase which measures 3002 mm an extended, rear overhang now 151 mm, plus the growth between the sliding doors and the rear axle now at 319 mm and payload is up to 800 kg to 810 kg on commercial versions.|$|E
50|$|The wagons are {{normally}} reserved for {{one type of}} commodity {{in order to avoid}} having to clean them after use, but also because certain goods require the <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> to be lined in order to avoid them sticking to the walls or, with chemicals, to protect the walls from corrosion. Many Td wagons are exclusively used for the transport of foodstuffs and therefore bear the index letter g.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{whether or}} not equal sub-division and re-distribution of the total load on a beam {{as a series of}} discrete loads enables load ratios (target ratios), similar to those between uniformly loaded and mid-span point loaded simply supported and clamped beams, to be achieved, assuming either equal deflection or strength limits. This is pertinent to the design of pultruded GFRP beams, which behave linear elastically and have inherently low flexural stiffness. Simply supported and clamped beams subjected to four symmetric, equally spaced groups of equal point loads are analysed and formulae for their maximum deflections and moments are presented. These are then converted to load ratios for equal deflection and strength limits. It is shown that load ratios similar to the target ratios are achievable and the corresponding <b>load</b> <b>spacing</b> ratios λ are given. The investigation is then extended to consider whether the effects of varying the load magnitudes and <b>load</b> <b>spacing</b> ratios, whilst keeping the total load constant, allow the target load ratios to be achieved. It is shown that the target ratios can be achieved, and the corresponding <b>load</b> <b>spacing</b> ratios are given for a range of <b>load</b> and <b>spacing</b> factors, δ and γ...|$|R

5000|$|In September 1994 at the IAA Nutfahrzeuge (Commercial Vehicle Fair) in Hanover, Germany, Volkswagen {{released}} the four-wheel drive {{version of the}} Taro which had an extended cabin. The 4x4 Extended Cab Taro was manufactured in Toyota's Tahara plant in Japan, but now the Taro had an updated 2.4-litre diesel engine which produced [...] at 4,000 rpm and torque of 163 Nm at 2,400 rpm. The 4x4 Taro had a 2.9 m2 <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> and 815 kg payload, but could tow 750 kg without brakes, and 2100 kg with brakes.|$|E
5000|$|The leg began where {{teams had}} to fly to Tel Aviv, Israel. Upon {{arriving}} in Tel Aviv, {{they made their way}} to Azrieli Center and went through the tower's penthouse for their next clue. That clue was for the Roadblock asking [...] "Who is your driving force?". Teams must travel by train to Haifa. Once in Haifa, they went to the Port of Haifa where one team had member to rig a container truck, drive it through an obstacle course and back up to its final <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> to get their next clue.|$|E
2500|$|The 1954 {{model year}} brought major changes. The [...] {{wheelbase}} model {{was replaced by}} an [...] wheelbase model, and a [...] "Pick Up" [...] version was introduced. The extra wheelbase was added behind the cab area to provide additional <b>load</b> <b>space.</b>|$|R

50|$|The vehicle's seats {{have also}} been {{redesigned}} with adjustable side bolsters, seat cushion extension and massage. The second row features three individual seats with recline adjustment. A sliding function {{can be used to}} create more legroom for the passengers in the third row or to increase <b>loading</b> <b>space.</b> An integrated child booster cushion in the centre seat is available. The Volvo XC90 seats 5 people or can be available with 3rd row seating which seats 7 people just like the BMW X5, Toyota 4Runner, Kia Sorento, Nissan Rogue, Dodge Journey, Mitsubishi Outlander, and the second generation GMC Acadia.|$|E
50|$|The {{control system}} {{was created for}} being able to analyze, communicate, supervise, direct, record and to {{document}} everything that happens in and around a loading door hole in a modern cargo terminal. Cargo terminals often suffer damage to loading houses and vehicles incurred in connection with drive into and away from the loading house. This is usually not just mistake out of the driver, but lack of communication between driver and loading dock. DockNET solves this lack of communication and secures while running the work environment and cargo handling. The result is increased efficiency where technology makes everything measurable around the <b>loading</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5000|$|By 1916, {{the company}} offered the Model K for $1,150 with a {{capacity}} of 1500 lb and the Model M for $1,350 with {{a capacity of}} 2000 lb. Both trucks had four-cylinder engines with Bosch ignitions and disc clutches. The two-ton model included the same standard parts as the one-ton model. The motor, springs, tires, frame and clutch were larger and the wheelbase considerably longer. <b>Loading</b> <b>space</b> in the truck was 11 ft by 56 in. As with the one-ton models, the new truck came in several body styles including open express, stake, four-post, full panel standard bodies and open express with full panel top. Additionally, [...] "extra long or wide" [...] bodies could be [...] "furnished to order." [...] That same year, Palmer-Moore also manufactured a 3/4-ton truck as well as motor busses and jitneys.|$|E
40|$|Linear {{superposition}} {{of responses}} of a structure to different load cases delivered by linear analysis methods {{can be used}} to obtain its response to any linear combination of those load cases. this way extreme response values can be investigated when the magnitudes of the interacting loads (their load factors) vary within specified ranges. The load factors can be regarded as the co-ordinates of a combined load case in a vectorial <b>load</b> <b>space.</b> In this paper, for the case of correlated load factors in the <b>load</b> <b>space,</b> the Lagrangean Multiplicator method is applied to determine extreme response values and the corresponding load factors. Not only summable response quantities such as components of displacements, stresses, forces and moments, but also the Von Mises stress, the buckling load factor and the modal frequency of a pre-stressed structure are addressed...|$|R

50|$|A bus depot in the Dixie Hotel was in use for 27 {{years before}} it closed in early July 1957. Opening in February 1930 the {{terminal}} handled 350 buses daily during peak summer seasons. The Central Union Bus Terminal had the largest enclosed <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> of any bus terminal in New York. It occupied the main floor of the hotel and was managed separately. It had entrances on 42nd Street and 43rd Street. The loading platform and waiting room were situated five feet below street level. Buses entered and departed utilizing separate ramps. A turntable with a diameter of 35 feet was employed to direct incoming buses toexits. Bus movements were governed by a dispatcher using an electric signaling device. It was called the Short Line Bus Terminal by July 1931. The terminal closed due to an inability {{to compete with the}} Port Authority Bus Terminal at 8th Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets. Another business which was located in the hotel was Max Bachner's laundry. It was given a lease for operation in August 1929.|$|E
5000|$|This Step Van type variant, which {{shares the}} VA chassis code with the low-bodied Life Van, also {{uses the same}} [...] 356 cc, {{two-cylinder}} water-cooled engine as does {{the rest of the}} range. At the time of introduction, its appearance was considered a novel approach, but it had some benefits in that the engine was installed up front and with front wheel drive. The Step Van, while its <b>loading</b> <b>space</b> was shorter, it could offer certain interior space advantages such as a very low and flat floor that competing, rear-wheel drive vehicles couldn't provide at the time. It drew many influences from the DKW Schnellaster produced in Europe. Its appearance, while unique and not appreciated when new, is now the standard approach for current kei products from Japanese manufacturers. The rear gate was of a clamshell style, divided horizontally. The 605 kg Step Van, like the regular Life Van, could carry 300 kg with two occupants, down to 200 kg with the full complement of two more passengers.|$|E
