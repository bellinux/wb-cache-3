40|$|Longitudinal steel <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> {{is always}} {{required}} in reinforced concrete (RC) columns. Normally, in countries having high seismic risk, <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> of longitudinal steel must be located around mid-height of the storey. However, in regions of low-medium seismic risk, including Hong Kong, <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> of longitudinal steel begin right above the beam-column interface to facilitate ease of construction. Such splicing method would undesirably cause the column critical region {{to move away}} from the beam-column interface under inelastic deformation. In this paper, the effects of different <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> locations of longitudinal steel on flexural strength and ductility of RC columns with concrete cube strength around 100 MPa are studied. Four RC column specimens, which contained no <b>lap</b> <b>splice,</b> all <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> within and outside critical region, as well as <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> in staggered manner, were tested under simultaneous compressive axial load and reversed cyclic inelastic displacement. It is evident from the results that the column containing <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> within its critical region had the largest strength but the poorest ductility performance. On the contrary, the column containing <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> outside its critical region had strength and ductility comparable to those of the column without <b>lap</b> <b>splice.</b> Based on these observations, a recommendation is proposed for positioning longitudinal steel <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> in RC columns. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The tensile {{resistance}} of No. 15 <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> reinforcing bars with varying transverse spacing and <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length was evaluated in full-scale concrete block wall splice specimens. The {{range of the}} transverse spacing between bars was limited to that which allowed the bars to remain within the same cell, and included the evaluation of tied spliced bars in contact. Two-and-a-half block wide by three course tall double pullout specimens reinforced with contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> were initially {{used to determine the}} range of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length values to be tested in the wall splice specimens such that bond failure of the reinforcement occurred. The double pullout specimens were tested in direct tension with six replicates per arrangement. Three values of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length: 150, 200, and 250 mm, were selected from the testing of the double pullout specimens and tested in the wall splice specimens in combination with three values of transverse spacing: 0, 25, and 50 mm, with three replicates per configuration. A total of twenty-seven two-and-a-half block wide by thirteen course tall wall splice specimens reinforced with two <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> were tested in four-point loading. Both the double pullout and the wall splice specimens were constructed in running bond with all cells fully grouted. The tensile {{resistance of}} the <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> bars in the double pullout specimens was measured directly. The contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> with a 150, 200, and 250 mm <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length developed approximately 38, 35 and 29 % of the theoretical yield load of the reinforcement, respectively. The difference between the mean tensile resistances of the three reinforcement configurations tested in the double pullout specimens was found to be statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Different than expected, the tensile resistance of the <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> reinforcing bars in the double pullout specimens was inversely proportional to the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length provided. For the short <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> lengths used in this investigation, the linear but not proportional relationship between bond force and <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length known from reinforced concrete is believed to have caused this phenomenon. An iterative sectional analysis using moment-curvature response was used to calculate the tensile resistance of the <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> reinforcement in the wall splice specimens. The calculated mean tensile resistance of the reinforcement increased with increasing <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length, and was greater when the bars were in contact. Securing the bars in contact may have influenced the tensile capacity of the contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> as higher stresses are likely to develop {{as a result of the}} bar ribs riding over each other with increasing slip. Results of the data analysis suggest that the tensile resistance of non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> within the same cell is generally independent of the spacing between the bars. A comparison of the experimental results for the wall splice specimens with the development and splice length provisions in CSA S 304. 1 - 04 and TMS 402 - 11 indicate that both the Canadian and U. S. design standards are appropriate for both contact and non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> located within the same cell given the limited test database included in this investigation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} on <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> failing in side split mode have revealed two important facts : (1) Yield strength of shear reinforcement {{does not affect}} strength of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> much; and (2) Shear reinforcement increases strength of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> linearly at least up to p_w = 2. 4 %. But why? This paper presents a hypothesis {{to answer the questions}} : a stirrup bar and its neighboring concrete constitute a small triangular beam, which covers lapped main bars. Thus, the strength of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> is affected by the flexural strength of the triangular beams, not by the yield strength of shear reinforcement.

The local bond strength between <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> bars and concrete was measured experimentally along the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> region of six full-scale RC columns subjected to cyclic uniaxial flexure under constant axial load. The bond strength of two column specimens tested without retrofitting was found to be in good agreement with the predictions given by two existing bond models. These models were modified to account for the contribution of composite material jacketing to the bond resistance between <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> bars and concrete. The {{effectiveness of}} FRP and TRM jackets against splitting at <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> was quantified as a function of jacket properties and geometry as well as in terms of the jacket effective strain, which was found to depend on the ratio of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length to bar diameter.

40|$|A {{previously}} completed {{study in}} the field of concrete block construction by Ahmed and Feldman (2012) indicated that, on average, the reinforcing bars in non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices,</b> where the <b>lapped</b> bars are located in adjacent cells, only develop 71 % of the tensile resistance of spliced bars which are in contact. An experimental program was therefore initiated to design and evaluate remedial measures which can potentially increase the tensile resistance of non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> to that of contact <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> of the same lap length. Implementation of the proposed measures in various field situations was also analyzed. Six unique remedial splice details, along with standard contact and unaltered non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> were evaluated and compared. The mitigative details included providing additional confinement, installing knock-out webs, placing splice reinforcement between the lapped bars, and combinations of these aforementioned details. Three replicates of each splice detail were constructed for a total of 24 wall splice specimens. Each wall splice specimen was reinforced with No. 15 Grade 400 deformed steel reinforcing bars with 200 mm <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> lengths at located the midspan. The specimens were tested in a horizontal position under a monotonic, four-point loading geometry. Load and deflection data were collected throughout testing and were subsequently used in an iterative moment-curvature analysis to calculate the maximum tensile resistance of the spliced reinforcement. This was then used to compare the structural performance of each remedial splice detail to the standard contact and non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices.</b> The wall splice specimens which contained non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> with knock-out webs, s-shaped, and transverse reinforcement in the splice region achieved similar tensile capacities as the wall splice specimens with standard contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices.</b> Industry professionals have indicated that the installation of the remedial measures evaluated in this study would not affect the constructability of masonry assemblages in field situations. The splice detail with knock-out webs confined within the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length was determined to be the most viable procedure as it can be installed to increase the resistance of non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> in almost all construction situations.

40|$|Current U. S. design {{provisions}} for <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> of deformed bars in tension were developed primarily from tests conducted on beams with lap lengths not exceeding 40 bar diameters.

Recent structural failures have indicated {{the vulnerability of}} <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> with length-to-bar-diameter ratios equal to or exceeding 40. In this study, the tensile strength of unconfined deformed-bar <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> with different lengths is reexamined.

The tensile strength of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> in configurations resembling those observed to have splice failures {{in the field is}} also examined. ^ Three series of tests (with a total of forty-five specimens) were conducted on specimens with lap lengths varying from 20 to 85 bar diameters. In series one, twenty-seven prismatic coupons were tested monotonically to failure in tension. In the second and third series, a total of eighteen beams were tested to failure. The beam <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> were located in a region of constant moment. ^ The results in this study indicated that increasing the length of a <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beyond 45 bar diameters was an inefficient way to increase the strength of the splice.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the rapid}} {{development}} in design of multistory buildings and, because {{of the variation in}} stories height with the fixed length of the steel reinforcing bars, steel is usually wasted particularly in columns. Hence, compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> may be used within the column height in order to avoid such waste in steel reinforcement which necessitates the optimization of this splice length. In the ACI 318 - 11 Provisions, the calculated compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> in members with high strength concrete can be longer than tension splice. Hence, an optimization of compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> would contribute to significant saving particularly in columns. This paper presents an experimental study to investigate the behavior of compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> in circular reinforced concrete columns. The objective of the present investigation is to study the influence of splice length, volume of transverse reinforcement and end bearing condition on the behavior of compression <b>lap</b> <b>splice.</b> The conducted investigation included experimental tests of nine circular columns under uniaxial compression loads. All spliced bars were in contact {{with each other and with}} constant concrete cover. Based on the experimental investigation and test results, concluding remarks have been drawn, based on which a design simplified equation for splice length in compression has been developed. A correlation between the experimental and calculated results of the author specimens and other results available in literature, showed a good agreement.

A total of 32 specimens were tested, consisting of {{an equal number of}} double pullout specimens and full-scale wall splice specimens. Both specimen types had the identical cross-section. Eight replicate specimens for each specimen type were constructed with both contact and non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> arrangements. Grade 400 deformed reinforcing bars with a 300 mm <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length were provided in all specimens. The double pullout specimens were tested applying direct tension to the lapped reinforcing bars. The splice resistance and displacement were recorded during testing. All double pullout specimens with contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> developed, as a minimum, the yield strength of the reinforcing bars and generally displayed evidence of a yield plateau. In contrast, the double pullout specimens with non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> failed when only 46. 1 % of the theoretical yield strength of the reinforcing bars was recorded as the maximum splice resistance. The difference between the average value of the tensile resistance in the contact and non-contact spliced bars was identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Wall splice specimens were tested under a four-point loading arrangement with the lapped bars located in the constant moment region. The applied load and specimen deflection were recorded until failure occurred. A numerical analysis was then performed to calculate the maximum resistance of the spliced bars. The specimens with contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> developed the theoretical yield capacity of the reinforcing bars. In contrast, the wall splice specimens with non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> developed an average tensile resistance of 78 % of the theoretical yield capacity. The difference between the average tensile resistances of the lapped bars in the two splice arrangements was identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. On average, the contact and non-contact <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> bars in the double pullout specimens developed 8. 47 % and 41. 2 % less tensile resistance, respectively, as compared to the wall splice specimens with the identical splice arrangement. Both differences were identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} tensile {{performance}} of unconfined <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> in specimens constructed from interlocking compressed earth block (ICEB) units. All <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> specimens were constructed from hollow ICEB half units with one side grouting channel. ICEB units {{used in this}} research were exclusively produced from the Soeng Thai Model BP 6 block press. The BP 6 block press is currently manufactured in Thailand under the guidance {{and direction of the}} Center of Vocational Building Technologies (CVBT). All ICEB units and grout constructed for this research were created from mix proportions of soil, sand, cement, and water. Rebar bar sizes were restricted to M 10 (# 3) and M 13 (# 4) for all <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> specimens due to the limited area of the hollow 2 -inch diameter rebar cavity of the ICEB unit. The limited size and strength of the ICEB units also made the use of larger bar diameters impractical. Three ICEB unit types of varying strengths (3. 78 MPa, 7. 81 MPa, and 11. 38 MPa) and three grout types of varying strengths (1. 35 MPa, 7. 47 MPa, and 15. 50 MPa) were developed and used to construct all specimens. The measured ICEB <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> specimen strengths were compared against the predicted strength calculated from the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC).

Also, recently proposed design equations for <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> under static loading will permit shorter lap lengths. For these reasons, a study was initiated to investigate the fatigue resistance of reinforced concrete beams with <b>lap</b> <b>splices.</b> A principal variable in this research program was the degree of transverse reinforcement (stirrups) which was provided along the <b>lap</b> <b>splice.</b> The specimens used in this experimental program were seven meters in length, with a cross section 330 mm wide and 508 mm deep, and were reinforced with two No. 30 Grade 400 bars, top and bottom. A <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> was provided in the bottom tension bars situated in a constant moment region created by a symmetrical two point loading system. The <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length and confinement were designed according to ACI Committee 408 recommendations for static loading. Two different <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> configurations were provided for the test specimens. The first used the maximum number of stirrups that were deemed to be effective for static loading, permitting a shorter lap length. In the second configuration nominal stirrups were provided to the splice at a spacing of one half the effective beam depth, requiring a longer lap length. Failure of the specimens with the heavier stirrups occurred from fatigue of the tensile reinforcing steel and showed similar fatigue resistance to beams containing continuous reinforcement. The specimens with nominal stirrups usually resulted in a splice failure after fewer load cycles, after splitting and delamination of the concrete confining the lap had occurred. Both beams had a similar static bond resistance; however, the beams with the heavier stirrup confinement (shorter lap length) displayed a greater fatigue resistance than the beams with lighter stirrups (longer lap length). These results are in agreement with conclusions reached for seismic loading conditions, which found that splice confinement provided by a high degree of transverse reinforcement is required under cyclic loading to offset the rapid deterioration of the concrete cover confinement...|$|R

Current concrete design codes specify <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> should not be placed in beam potential plastic hinge regions where inelastic reversing stresses are possible during seismic events. During testing the transverse steel specified for the confinement of the <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> was unable to prevent bond deterioration between the spliced bars once inelastic bar strains had developed {{at one end of the}} splice. The failure of the <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> led to a loss of lateral load capacity and a low level of ductility from the specimen. Reinforced concrete buildings designed to pre- 1970 s codes may be considered inadequate when viewed in light of the provisions in current codes for seismic design. The testing of beam details taken from one such building indicates insufficient anchorage existed for the plain longitudinal beam bars in the joint.

The maximum applied load for the specimens and their observed failure behaviour are reported. In addition to that, a strain compatibility analysis, average bond stress distribution, and flexural section analysis within the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length of the instrumented specimens are also reported. All of the specimens failed in bond within the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length. The load capacity of two specimens reinforced with plain steel bars was 60 % of the reported load resistance of specimens with identical geometry and reinforced with deformed bars. The CEB-FIP Model Code provisions for average bond stress of plain steel bars underestimated the maximum applied load recorded for the tested specimens by 16 % on average. An empirically derived equation to predict the bond capacity of plain steel bars was determined to be proportional to both the splice length and the nominal bar diameter. Observed cracks in the shear spans remained vertical and suggest the development of arch action within this region. The formation of a large crack at one end of the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length and a review of the load versus deflection behaviour indicated a sudden bond failure of the specimens.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of a novel and cost-effective strengthening technique using Post-Tensioned Metal Straps (PTMS) at enhancing the bond behaviour of short <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> steel bars in reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Twelve RC beams with a short <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length of 10 d b (d b = bar diameter) at the midspan zone were tested in flexure to examine the bond splitting failure. The effect of confinement (no confinement, internal steel stirrups or external PTMS), bar diameter and concrete cover were examined. The results show that, whilst unconfined control beams failed prematurely due to cover splitting, the use of PTMS confinement enhanced the bond strength of the spliced bars by up to 58 % and resulted in a less brittle behaviour. Based on the test results, a new analytical model is proposed to predict the additional bond strength provided by PTMS confinement. The model should prove useful in the strengthening design of substandard <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> RC elements...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a new structural material, namely textilereinforced mortar (TRM), was investigated experimentally in this study {{as a means of}} confining old-type reinforced concrete columns with limited capacity due to bar buckling or due to bond failure at <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> regions. Comparisons with equal stiffness and strength fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) jackets allow for the evaluation of the {{effectiveness of}} TRM versus FRP. Tests were carried out on full scale non-seismically detailed RC columns subjected to cyclic uniaxial flexure under constant axial load. Thirteen cantilever-type specimens with either continuous longitudinal reinforcement (smooth or deformed) or <b>lap</b> <b>splicing</b> of longitudinal bars at the floor level were constructed and tested. Experimental results indicated that TRM jacketing is quite effective as a means of increasing the cyclic deformation capacity of old-type RC columns with poor detailing, by delaying bar buckling and by preventing splitting bond failures in columns with <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> bars. Compared with their FRP counterparts, TRM jackets used in this study were found to be equally effective in terms of increasing both the strength and deformation capacity of the retrofitted columns. From the response of specimens tested in this study, it can be concluded that TRM jacketing is an extremely promising solution for the confinement of reinforced concrete columns, including poorly detailed ones with or without <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> in seismic regions...|$|R
40|$|The bond in a {{reinforcement}} concrete (RC) {{structure is}} represented by the force transfer between the reinforcing bar and the surrounding concrete. All the RC structures are designed to have a perfect bond between the reinforcing bar and the surrounding concrete. However, corrosion of the reinforcing bar in the RC members {{is one of the main}} reasons that affect the bond efficiency in RC member. The deterioration of bond in RC element leads to decrease the service life of the RC structure and may result in sudden failure. Most of the previous research focuses on repairing the corroded RC member with FRP wrapping without cleaning the corroded reinforcing bar. The present research investigated the bond behaviour of cleaned corroded reinforcing bar repaired with partial depth repair concrete, transverse reinforcement or fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets. Thirty-six beam-end specimens and twenty-four <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams were cast and tested under static loading. The beam-end dimensions were 600 mm in length, 500 mm in height and 250 mm in width and reinforced with 20 M bar. The test variables considered for the beam-end specimens were: four corrosion levels (5 %, 7. 5 %, 10 % and 15 % mass loss level) and compared with non-corroded bar. Also, four bonded lengths were studied (200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm, and 350 mm). Moreover, four partial depth repair concrete were used (commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete (SCC 1), another different commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete (SCC 2), self-consolidating concrete that was mixed in place and had similar proportions to the monolithic mixes (SCC 3) and normal concrete (NC) mix design was also cast in place and had exactly the same proportions as the monolithic mixes but was used as a partial depth repair). All of the partial depth repair concretes were compared with monolithic beam-end specimen. The <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams dimensions were 2200 mm in length, 350 mm in height and 250 mm in width and reinforced with two 20 M <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> bars in the tension zone of the constant moment region with 300 mm splice length. Also, the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams were reinforced with two 10 M continuous bars in the compression zone. The test variables considered for the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams were: commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete extended with 50 % of 13 mm coarse aggregate (SCC 50) was used as the main partial depth repair. It should be mentioned that SCC 50 was the same partial depth repair concrete (SCC 2) used for the beam-end specimens. Also, Three <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams repaired with commercial prepackaged self-consolidating concrete without coarse aggregate (SCC 0) were also included to study the effect of coarse aggregate on bond behavior. The <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams repaired with partial depth repair concrete were compared with monolithic <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beam. Moreover, two types of confinements were considered in the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams: transverse reinforcement and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets. Six <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> beams were confined with transverse reinforcement and six were wrapped with CFRP sheets. This research found that the average bond strength increased as the bar mass loss increased for all bonded lengths. As the bonded length increased, the average bond strength decreased and the corresponding bar slip increased. In the beam-end specimens, the average bond strength of monolithic beam-end specimens was higher than the average bond strength of all types of the partial depth repair regardless the compressive strength of concrete. That was mainly because of internal shear cracks at the interface between the partial depth repair and the substrate concrete. However, since there was not shear at the constant moment region in the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams, the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams repaired with partial depth repair concrete with similar properties of monolithic concrete and had higher concrete strength showed higher average bond strength than the monolithic <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams. Although the partial depth repair concrete SCC 0 had higher compressive strength than SCC 50 and the monolithic concrete; it had the lowest average bond strength. That because the absence of the coarse aggregate in SCC 0 led to a decreased splitting strength and reduced fracture energy; and so the average bond strength was decreased. All self-consolidating concrete (SCC) partial depth repairs showed better bonding than the normal concrete (NC) partial depth repair. The bond strength of beams repaired with FRP sheets was higher than that of the beams confined with transverse reinforcement. The transverse reinforcement increased the average bond strength and the corresponding slip by (15 % - 29 %) and (32 % - 62 %) compared to the unwrapped beams, respectively. However, the beams confined with FRP sheets showed an increase in the bond strength and the corresponding slip by (34 - 49 %) and (56 - 260 %) compared to the unconfined beams, respectively. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to predict the effect of mass loss level, bonded length and presence repair concrete on the average bond strength of beam-end specimens. Also, a model was calibrated to predict the average bond strength with increasing the mass loss level of the reinforcing bar of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> beams. Moreover, another model was used to allow the design engineers to estimate the bond stress distribution along the spliced reinforcing bars as the splitting crack propagated...|$|R

40|$|Debonding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} damage forms in fiber-reinforced composite structures. This work was devoted to the debonding damage detection of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> joints in carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) structures, which is based on guided ultrasonic wave signals captured by using fiber optic Doppler (FOD) sensor with spiral shape. Interferometers based on two types of laser sources, namely the He-Ne laser and the infrared semiconductor laser, are proposed and compared in this study for the purpose of measuring Doppler frequency shift of the FOD sensor. Locations of the FOD sensors are optimized based on mechanical characteristics of <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> joint. The FOD sensors are subsequently used to detect the guided ultrasonic waves propagating in the CFRP structures. By taking advantage of signal processing approaches, features of the guided wave signals can be revealed.

40|$|Most {{design codes}} {{encourage}} the staggering of <b>lapped</b> <b>splices</b> in a section, such that {{a portion of}} the bars in the cross section remains continuous throughout the lap zone. A penalty on lap length may be imposed if all bars are lapped at one section. In the literature, however, almost all tested specimens have had all reinforcement lapped at the same section. This paper presents results of tests carried out to shed some new light on the behaviour of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> where only a portion of bars is lapped. To this end, four point bending tests were carried out on 24 full-scale beams with {{all or part of the}} longitudinal reinforcement <b>lap</b> <b>spliced</b> at mid-span. The beams were reinforced with either 16 or 20 mm diameter rebars, included two grades of concrete and various <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> configurations, all confined by links. All the beams were designed with the same concrete cover and with the minimum amount of transverse reinforcement permitted by MC 2010, equal to 50 % of the area of the lapped bars. The resistance and the residual strength of the splices were measured and compared with the results of specimens with continuous bars and with all bars lapped. The results show that lapping only a portion of bars at a section impairs splice strength, although some post-peak strength is maintained by the continuous bars. These outcomes raise questions over the validity of EC 2 and ACI 318 - 11 provisions which allow a reduction in lap-length when splices are staggered...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted into the areas of low cycle high stress loading (seismic loading) and static loading of reinforced concrete beams containing <b>lap</b> <b>splices.</b> The knowledge acquired from this {{research has}} led to recommendations for changes in how seismic and static loading of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> are handled. For splices subjected to high cycle low stress load patterns (fatigue loading) current design of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> is very similar to that used for statically loaded splices, even though little research information is available on performance of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> under high cycle fatigue, particularly for larger size bars and members. With this in mind a testing programme was initiated {{to determine the effects of}} fatigue on the performance of <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> proportioned and confined with transverse reinforcing steel according to the ACI Committee 408 recommendations for tensile static loading. In the test programme described in this report, only short lap lengths with heavy transverse confinement were investigated. Specimens used in this study were 7 m long with a 330 mm x 508 mm cross-section. Equal loading is applied at two points symmetrically placed two meters apart on the simply supported beam. Reinforcement consists of 2 - No. 30 Grade 400 tension reinforcement with either 2 - No. 30 or 3 - No. 25 Grade 400 compression reinforcement. Both tension bars contain 900 mm <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> confined with 7 - No. 10 Grade 300 stirrups. The splices are located at mid-span in the constant moment, zero-shear region. Shear reinforcement consists of No. 10 Grade 300 stirrups placed at 150 mm on centre. Eight specimens were constructed and subjected to either cyclic loads or monotonically increasing loads (static loads) until failure. Cyclic loads were applied to seven specimens with a monotonically increasing load applied to the eighth. Different load ranges were used in the fatigue testing, but stress reversal was not applied. Six of seven cyclically loaded specimens failed when one or both of the main tension bars ruptured, while the seventh specimen failed when the compression zone crushed after the cyclic test was terminated at 3 million cycles and a monotonically increasing load was applied. The one beam subjected to a static load until failure exhibited a bond failure in the splice region. The tests showed that heavily confined splices proportioned according to the guidelines set out in ACI Committee 408 recommendations for static loading are adequate for cyclic fatigue loading, and the splice does not appear to influence the fatigue life of the specimen...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} four shear wall {{specimens}} was tested {{in order to}} evaluate a seismic retrofit that has been proposed for the core wall of an existing building in Berkeley, California. Like many reinforced concrete shear walls that {{were built in the}} 1960 s and early 1970 s, the core wall in this building was constructed with reinforcement details that would result in a non-ductile seismic response. These poor details include <b>lap</b> <b>splices</b> in the longitudinal reinforcement in regions where flexural yielding is expected, inadequate confinement of the boundary regions, and inadequate anchorage of the transverse reinforcement. The proposed seismic retrofit involved the use of headed reinforcement, carbon fibre wrap, and reinforced concrete collars {{at the base of the}} wall. The four shear wall specimens were tested under reversed cyclic loading. Two of these walls had a <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> in the longitudinal steel at the base of the wall and the other two had a <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> 600 mm from the base of the wall.

40|$|In this paper, the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> {{length and}} the {{long-term}} (fatigue) performance of lap-spliced carbon FRP laminates were investigated. Lap-spliced CFRP coupon specimens were fabricated with a splice length of 12. 7, 25. 4, 38. 1, 50. 8, 76. 2, and 101. 6 mm. To eliminate the bending on the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> joint, a symmetric specimen configuration was adopted. The width of the specimens was 38. 1 mm. These specimens were tested to failure under tension. The ultimate load, failure mode, and strain distribution {{on the surface of}} both the non-lapped and lapped areas were monitored. It was found that a length of 38. 1 mm was sufficient to develop the static ultimate strength of the CFRP laminate. Tension-tension fatigue tests were performed on 101. 6 -mm lap-spliced specimens to investigate the long-term performance. A stress ratio versus number of cycles curve was constructed using the test data and compared with theoretical results. It was shown that 101. 6 -mm lap-spliced CFRP laminates can sustain more than 2. 0 million load cycles with no effect on residual strength, if the maximum applied stress does not exceed 40 % of the ultimate static strength.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} program conducted on seventeen simply supported concrete beams to study the effect of transverse reinforcement {{on the behavior of}} the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> of a steel reinforcement in tension zones in high-strength concrete beams are presented. The parameters included in the experimental program were the concrete compressive strength, the <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length, the amount of transverse reinforcement provided within the splice region, and the shape of the transverse reinforcement around the spliced bars. The experimental results showed that the displacement ductility increased and the mode of failure changed from a splitting bond failure to a flexural failure when the amount of the transverse reinforcement in the splice region increased, and the compressive strength increased up to 100 MPa. The presence of the transverse reinforcement around the spliced bars had a pronounced effect on increasing the ultimate load, the ultimate deflection, and the displacement ductility. The prediction of maximum steel stresses for spliced bars using the ACI 318 - 05 building code was compared with the experimental results. The comparison showed that the effect of the transverse reinforcement around spliced bars has to be considered into the design equations for <b>lap</b> <b>splice</b> length in high-strength concrete beams...|$|R
