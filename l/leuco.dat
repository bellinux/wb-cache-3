50|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{oxidation}} being triggered during manufacture of the discs, {{and in order to}} avoid the need for operating in inert atmosphere, the <b>leuco</b> dyes are further chemically modified to their blocked forms. Such blocked <b>leuco</b> dyes are the <b>leuco</b> dye precursors that form the <b>leuco</b> dye by a slow, controlled chemical reaction. Leucomethylene blue can be reacted with triisopropylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, forming triisopropylsilyloxycarbonylleucomethylene blue (TIPSOCLMB), which is stable in presence of air oxygen. In presence of nucleophile reagents, e.g. water, the blocked <b>leuco</b> dye compound undergoes hydrolysis, releasing the unblocked <b>leuco</b> dye. This reaction is slow (several days to a week), and the hydrolytic compound is supplied either as atmospheric moisture, or in the formulation of the resin.|$|E

50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1771, its specific epithet {{derived from the}} Ancient Greek words <b>leucos</b> 'white', and rhynchos 'bill'.|$|R
40|$|By {{combining}} morphology, ecology, biology, and biogeography {{with the}} available molecular (sequence {{variation of the}} entire mitochondrial cytochrome b gene; cyt-b) and karyology data, the taxonomy of several species of the Rutilus complex inhabiting southern Europe is revised. Rutilus stoumboudae, new species, is described from Lake Volvi, Greece. It differs from Rutilus rutilus in possessing more total GR and less branched rays in both dorsal and anal fins and in its placement in the cyt-b based phylogeny of the genus. The resurrected genus <b>Leucos</b> Heckel, 1843 (type species <b>Leucos</b> aula, Bonaparte, 1841), which according to molecular data diverged from Rutilus more than 5 million years ago, during the Messinian salinity crisis, includes five species of small size, without spinous tubercles on scales and head in reproductive males, pharyngeal teeth formula 5 - 5, and all show a preference for still waters. <b>Leucos</b> aula is the Italian species endemic in the Padany-Venetian district: L. basak is widespread in Croatia, Albania, Montenegro and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM); L. albus, recently described from Lake Skadar, Montenegro, {{is also found in}} rivers Moraca and Zeta (Montenegro). L. albus differs from L. basak, its closest relative, in having more scales on the LL and less anal-fin rays; L. panosi is endemic to the western-Greece district, and L. ylikiensis is endemic to lakes Yliki and Paralimni in eastern Greece (introduced in Lake Volvi). Among the nominal species examined, Rutilus karamani, R. ohridanus, R. prespensis and R. prespensis vukovici are all junior synonyms of <b>Leucos</b> basak. Rutilus vegariticus is definitively regarded as junior synonym for R. rutilus. Sarmarutilus n. gen. is a monotypic genus, with Sarmarutilus rubilio as the type species. According to phylogenetic data, Sarmarutilus rubilio is basal to a cluster of species that includes <b>Leucos</b> basak, L. albus, L. aula, L. panosi and L. ylikiensis. Sarmarutilus possibly evolved in pre-Messinian time, in the Lago Mare, entered the Mediterranean area during the Messinian Lago Mare phase of the Mediterranean Sea and survived only in the Tuscany- Latium district. This genus differs from <b>Leucos</b> in having large pearl organs on the central part of head and body scales in mature males and for the habitat preference, being a riverine-adapted species. It differs from Rutilus in pharyngeal teeth formula (5 - 5 in Sarmarutilus and 6 - 5 in Rutilus), size (small in Sarmarutilus and large in Rutilus) and for the preferential habitat (riverine vs. still water). Finally, lectotypes for <b>Leucos</b> basak, <b>Leucos</b> aula, and Sarmarutilus rubilio are designated. Copyright © 2014 Magnolia Press...|$|R

50|$|Exposure to {{ultraviolet}} radiation, solvents {{and high}} temperatures reduce the lifespan of <b>leuco</b> dyes. Temperatures above about 200 - 230 C typically cause irreversible damage to <b>leuco</b> dyes; a time-limited exposure of some types to about 250 C is allowed during manufacturing.|$|E
50|$|An {{application}} of <b>leuco</b> dyes {{is in the}} Duracell battery state indicators. A layer of a <b>leuco</b> dye is applied on a resistive strip to indicate its heating, thus gauging the amount of current the battery is able to supply. The strip is triangular-shaped, changing its resistance along its length, therefore heating up a proportionally long segment {{with the amount of}} current flowing through it. The length of the segment above the threshold temperature for the <b>leuco</b> dye then becomes colored.|$|E

50|$|The <b>leuco</b> dyes used {{in direct}} thermal paper are usually triaryl methane {{phthalide}} dyes, such as Yamamoto Blue 4450, or fluoran dyes, such as Pergascript Black 2C. A third widely used <b>leuco</b> dye is Crystal violet lactone. Red or magenta color {{can be achieved}} with dyes such as Yamamoto Red 40. Yellow can be produced by the protonation of a triaryl pyridine, such as Copikem Yellow 37. These dyes have a colorless <b>leuco</b> form when crystalline or when in a pH neutral environment, but become colored when dissolved in a melt and exposed to an acidic environment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Leuco</b> dyes {{have less}} {{accurate}} temperature response than liquid crystals.

40|$|Between 1999 and 2003 the University of Southampton {{conducted}} excavations on {{the site}} of Quseir al-Qadim (western shores of the Red Sea), a place that had not been examined since the excavations by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago ended in 1982. The new work was prompted by the discovery that the site of Quseir al-Qadim was, in all probability, not that of the minor port of <b>Leucos</b> Limen, as had been previously thought, but none other than Myos Hormos. This port, together with its sister harbour Berenike, articulated Rome’s trade with India and the East. This second volume concentrates on the finds made during the excavation period and the volume concludes with an overview of what we now know of the nature and function of the ports of Myos Hormos and Quseir al-Qadim and a discussion of outstanding problems which can only be resolved by further work...|$|R
50|$|Glory of Heracles {{takes place}} in Ancient Greece {{and other parts of}} the Mediterranean region, with the plot drawing heavily from Greek mythology. The player names and assumes the role of the silent protagonist, though he speaks in battle, an immortal, amnesiac boy who is {{accompanied}} by the characters <b>Leucos,</b> Axios, Heracles and Eris on their journey to remember their pasts and to discover why they are immortal. Throughout the plot, the characters' stories become intertwined with other mythological figures and events such as Achilles and the Trojan war. The Taphus, an invention designed by Daedalus, is a recurring plot device which was punished by Zeus for extracting Ether from the world. Kazushige Nojima, the game's scenario writer, commented that the Japanese subtitle Tamashii no Shoumei ("proof of the soul") was central to one of the game's themes and that the player had to discover its meaning. The theme of an amnesiac cast was explored previously in Heracles no Eikou III, which was also written by Nojima.|$|R
5000|$|Nauplius' son Palamedes {{fought in}} the Trojan War, but was killed by fellow Achaeans {{as a result of}} Odysseus' intrigues. Nauplius went to Troy to demand justice for the death of his son, however no one listened. Consequently, Nauplius swore revenge against King Agamemnon and the other Greek leaders. As the Greeks were sailing home from Troy after the close of the war, Nauplius lit beacon fires along the perilous {{coastline}} of Euboea, and many ships were shipwrecked as a result. [...] Before this point, he also convinced many of the lonely wives of the Greek commanders to be unfaithful to their husbands, and to conspire against them - including Clytemnestra, (Agamemnon's wife) who joined with Aigisthos, Aegiale (wife of Diomedes) who committed adultery with Cometes and others, and Meda (wife of Idomeneus) who was unfaithful with <b>Leucos.</b> Oeax and Nausimedon were apparently killed by Pylades as they arrived to aid Aegisthus.|$|R
