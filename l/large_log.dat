25|$|Different {{pieces of}} wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, {{particularly}} if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late {{in the life of}} a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a <b>large</b> <b>log</b> the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.|$|E
500|$|In Greece, a <b>large</b> <b>log</b> was lit on {{the hearth}} on Christmas Eve and kept burning or {{smoldering}} through the Twelve Days of Christmas. This was {{done as a}} protection against the demons called Kallikantzaroi, believed to be emerging from their dens at night during that period to attack people and damage their property. The fire and smoke from the log was thought to prevent the Kallikantzaroi from entering the house down the chimney. The ritual burning of logs on the Eve was also carried out in Albania. When the buzm, as the log was called there, {{was about to be}} brought into the house, {{a member of the family}} would go out into the yard, shout the name of the household's head, and proclaim that the buzm was coming and bringing all kinds of delicious things. The head of the household would respond by saying [...] "You are welcome!" [...] and the buzm would be ceremonially brought in, greeted by the family and treated with great respect. The log would be placed on the hearth, and often a significant part of all food and drink in the house would be put on the log and burned together with it.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, {{operation}} of the lock ceased permanently when the government received word from logging operators that they {{would no longer be}} using the lock. [...] All commercial boat service through the lock had stopped many years before. [...] After the lock was shut down, a <b>large</b> <b>log</b> drifting down the river floated {{over the top of the}} lock, striking the lock machinery, effectively putting the lock permanently out of operation.|$|E
2500|$|Owing to the {{pronunciation}} of {{the letter}} 'W' {{as if it was}} the letter 'V' alternate spellings are Vaka and Va'a. [...] The traditional Micronesian proa hull consists of a single long keel made of a single <b>large</b> <b>log</b> constructed much like a dugout canoe. [...] It is extended upwards with sewn planks, to provide additional depth to the hull. [...] The windward side of the hull is curved, similar to a typical canoe, while the lee side is straight and flat to minimize leeway while sailing.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the logging {{industry}} was booming, {{due in large}} part to the arrival of the band saw and the logging railroad. As forests in the lower lands were cut down, loggers began moving into the more mountainous areas in search of timber. At Roan Mountain, a steam engine was set up in the gap between Round Bald and Jane Bald (this gap is still called [...] "Engine Gap") to move lumber from the Tennessee side to the mills located on the North Carolina side. A <b>large</b> <b>log</b> flume was built between Burbank (near Hughes Gap) and the village of Roan Mountain. Erosion brought about by excessive logging was believed to be part of the cause of a massive flood that destroyed much of the area in 1901.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Large</b> <b>logs</b> were {{hauled out}} to the Ilwaco dock chained down to flat cars, one log to a car. [...] There, they were dumped in Baker's Bay to be made into rafts for water {{transport}} to sawmills. [...] Feagans also reports that very <b>large</b> <b>logs</b> were hauled on disconnect logging trucks, and provides a photo, but gives no date or location.|$|R

2500|$|As the Civil War began, Kane {{raised a}} mounted rifle regiment, the 42nd Pennsylvania Infantry, also {{referred}} to as the 13th Pennsylvania Reserves. He recruited woodsmen and lumbermen from western Pennsylvania, men who were experienced in the woods, could forage for themselves, and could shoot rifles. As the regiment was forming, one of his recruits ornamented his hat with a tail from a deer's carcass that he found in a butcher shop. Other men in the regiment liked this decoration and copied him, causing the regiment {{to be known as the}} [...] "Bucktails." [...] The men in the regiment built three <b>large</b> <b>log</b> rafts and one smaller one and floated down the Susquehanna River to Harrisburg, where they were mustered in. On June 21, 1861, veteran Charles J. Biddle was named the Union regiment's colonel with Kane as lieutenant colonel.|$|E

60|$|At last, a fish, {{larger than}} any he had seen, came moving slowly along, {{out from a}} deep place under a <b>large</b> <b>log,</b> which lay {{imbedded}} in the bank. Henry made a sudden plunge after him. He drew up his dipper again, confident that he had caught him; but, on looking into the dipper, no fish was to be seen. The bird in the hand, and the bird in the bush, were both gone.|$|E
60|$|Paddy Flinders ruminated on {{the dangers}} and perplexities that might be in store for him that night, as he went swiftly and noiselessly up to the hut. To reach the door he had to pass round from the back to the front. As he did so {{he became aware of}} voices {{sounding}} softly close at hand. A <b>large</b> <b>log</b> lay on the ground. With speed worthy of a redskin he sank down beside it.|$|E

6000|$|So Phonny {{came back}} to the place where Wallace had {{remained}} in the road, holding the horses. Phonny let down the bars, and Wallace went through with the horses. Phonny immediately put the bars up again, took the bridle of his own horse from Wallace's hands, threw it up over the horse's head, and then by the help of a <b>large</b> <b>log</b> which lay {{by the side of the}} road, he mounted. He did all this in a hurried manner, and ended with saying: ...|$|E
60|$|But {{he could}} not, for two reasons: {{none of those}} trees were maple-trees, and then, besides, they were all dry. There was no sap in them of any kind; at least, not enough to ooze out. While Rollo was looking there, one of Farmer Cropwell's large boys came out with an axe in his hand. He rolled out a pretty <b>large</b> <b>log</b> of wood, {{though it was not}} very long, and struck his axe into the end of it, as {{if he was going to}} split it.|$|E
60|$|Jim and {{the others}} looked in {{at the door of}} the <b>large</b> <b>log</b> structure. They saw an immense room, the floor covered with benches, and a raised {{platform}} at one end. A few windows let in the light. Spacious and barn-like was this apartment; but undoubtedly, seen through the beaming eyes of the missionary, it was a grand amphitheater for worship. The hard-packed clay floor was velvet carpet; the rude seats soft as eiderdown; the platform with its white-oak cross, an altar of marble and gold.|$|E

60|$|Jonas {{traveled}} along, {{as well as}} he could, {{through the}} snow, though he found it very laborious walking. In some places, he found hard footing for some distance; but then he would sink down again for several successive steps. After a short distance, {{he got out of the}} deep drift, which had prevented the horse from going on, and then he could advance faster. There was a singular-looking track in the road. It consisted of a smooth groove in the snow, as if the end of a <b>large</b> <b>log</b> had been dragged along.|$|E
60|$|Our second passage out to Curacoa, in the Belle Savage, was pleasant, {{and brought}} about nothing {{worthy of being}} mentioned. At Curacoa we took in mahogany, {{and in so doing}} a {{particularly}} <b>large</b> <b>log</b> got away from us, and slid, end on, {{against the side of the}} vessel. We saw no consequences at the time, and went on to fill up, with different articles, principally dye-woods, coffee, cocoa, &c. We got some passengers, among whom was a Jew merchant, who had a considerable amount of money on board. When ready, we sailed, being thirty souls in all, crew and passengers included.|$|E

Lamb chops, coiled in the covered stew-pan, loudly broiled in their own fat, and to them the peas, heated in their can, were added when the coffee began to foam. He dragged a <b>large</b> <b>log</b> {{to the side of the}} fire, and Ruth, there sitting, gorged shamelessly. Carl himself did not eat reticently.|$|E
