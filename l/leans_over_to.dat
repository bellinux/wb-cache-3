500|$|Cooper retires {{to bed at}} {{his hotel}} room, and {{experiences}} a strange dream featuring the one-armed man, who identifies himself as MIKE, and BOB, who vows to [...] "kill again". Cooper then dreams {{he is in a}} room hung with red curtains. The Man from Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) and Laura Palmer speak to him in a jarring and disjointed manner, before Laura <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> whisper in his ear. Cooper wakes up, telephones Harry, and declares that he knows who the murderer is.|$|E
2500|$|Marcus Miller {{produced}} the original {{score for the}} film, while Antonio [...] "L. A." [...] Reid and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass home last night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> me and goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who we going to get to sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. If you like the demo then we can use her.' And I said 'great, let's use her.' So that was Toni Braxton's debut. And I remember when I finally met Toni at Babyface's wedding, L.A. said, 'you owe your career to this guy, he gave you your big break,' which was really sweet." ...|$|E

6000|$|I sate down {{beneath the}} beech [...] Which <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the lane, [...] And the far sound of your speech [...] Did not promise any pain; [...] And I blessed you full and free, [...] With a smile stooped tenderly [...] O'er the May-flowers on my knee.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} father, [...] "an object that <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the north, {{so as to}} point to the North Star. If you and Jonas could put a post into the ground so as to have it point to the North Star, then you could mark, all around it, the places to which the shadow would come for every hour in the day, and {{afterwards}} it would come to the same places regularly, or nearly so. It would be near enough for your purposes; and I don't know but that it would be quite a respectable dial for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|BURKE--[Peers blinkingly {{about the}} cabin--hoarsely.] Let you not be hiding from me, whoever's here--though 'tis {{well you know}} I'd {{have a right to}} come back and murder you. [He stops to listen. Hearing no sound, he closes the door behind him and comes forward to the table. He throws himself into the rocking-chair--despondently.] There's no one here, I'm thinking, and 'tis a great fool I am to be coming. [With a sort of dumb, uncomprehending anguish.] Yerra, Mat Burke, 'tis a great jackass you've become and what's got into you at all, at all? She's gone out of this long ago, I'm telling you, and you'll never see her face again. [ANNA stands up, hesitating, {{struggling}} between joy and fear. BURKE'S eyes fall on ANNA'S bag. He <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> examine it.] What's this? [Joyfully.] It's hers. She's not gone! But where is she? Ashore? [Darkly.] What would she be doing ashore on this rotten night? [His face suddenly convulsed with grief and rage.] 'Tis that, is it? Oh, God's curse on her! [Raging.] I'll wait 'till she comes and choke her dirty life out. [ANNA starts, her face grows hard. She steps into the room, the revolver in her right hand by her side.] ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now {{these things}} did sound so cool an' {{good to me}} on that br'ilin' deck that I couldn't stand it, an' I <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Andy, an' I says: `Now look-a here; if you don't shut up talkin' about them things what's stowed below, an' what we can't git at nohow, {{overboard}} you go!' `That would make you short-handed,' says Andy, with a grin. `Which is more'n you could say,' says I, `if you'd chuck Tom an' me over'--alludin' to his eleven-inch grip. Andy didn't say no more then, {{but after a while}} he comes to me, as I was lookin' round to see if anything was in sight, an' says he, `I spose you ain't got nothin' to say ag'in' my divin' into the hold just aft of the foremast, where {{there seems to be a}} bit of pretty clear water, an' see if I can't git up somethin'?' `You kin do it, if you like,' says I, `but it's at your own risk. You can't take out no insurance at this office.' `All right, then,' says Andy; `an' if I git stove in by floatin' boxes, you an' Tom'll have to eat the rest of them salt crackers.' `Now, boy,' says I,--an' he wasn't much more, bein' only nineteen year old,--`you'd better keep out o' that hold. You'll just git yourself smashed. An' as to movin' any of them there heavy boxes, which must be swelled up as tight as if they was part of the ship, you might as well try to pull out one of the Mary Auguster's ribs.' `I'll try it,' says Andy, `fur to-morrer is Christmas, an' if I kin help it I ain't goin' to be floatin' atop of a Christmas dinner without eatin' any on it.' I let him go, fur he was a good swimmer an' diver, an' I did hope he might root out somethin' or other, fur Christmas is about the worst day in the year fur men to be starvin' on, an' that's what we was a-comin' to.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the first}} place, the {{enormous}} cutting tackles, among other ponderous things comprising {{a cluster of}} blocks generally painted green, and which no single man can possibly lift--this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck. The end of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting {{a hole in the}} body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and {{the main body of the}} crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nailheads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the [...] "scarf," [...] simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.|$|E
50|$|Toby and Will later {{complete}} a speech {{appropriate to the}} occasion. When Bartlet and Russell begin the press conference, Bartlet realizes that the joke speech has been mistakenly loaded into the Teleprompter; Russell senses Bartlet's momentary hesitation {{at the start of}} his speech, <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> view the Teleprompter, and also realizes what has happened. Bartlet then ad libs a nomination speech of his own and introduces Russell.|$|E

50|$|To {{pass through}} the Maasgeul the ship can not be loaded to {{capacity}} as her draught would then be 23 meters while the minimal depth of the Maasgeul is 24 meters, since if the ship <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> one side at an angle of only 3° then she lies 1.65 meters deeper in the water. For this reason the Berge Stahl can only be loaded with 354,000 tonnes (while she can carry 364,768 tonnes).|$|E
50|$|When a ship or boat <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> one side, {{from the}} action of waves or from the {{centrifugal}} force of a turn or under wind pressure or from the amount of exposed topsides, {{it is said to}} 'heel'. A sailing boat that is over-canvassed and therefore heeling excessively, may sail less efficiently. This is caused by factors such as wind gusts, crew ability, the point of sail, or hull size & design.|$|E
50|$|While {{delivering}} a package, a young postman Toto (Kylan James) discovers an injured man {{lying next to}} an inground pool and tends to his wounds. Mark (Kjord Davis) is {{in trouble with the}} mob and the two men decide to flee together. While resting {{on the side of the}} road, Toto gazes longingly at the handsome fugitive. He touches the sleeping man's hand and <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> kiss him... and is surprised when the kiss is returned.|$|E

5000|$|... "For a {{contemporary}} example, one verse of the naughty kuplét of Money, Love and Shame, sung by a clever comedian in Tel Aviv in 1975, {{makes fun of}} Brezhnev, {{to the delight of}} an audience of recent immigrants from Russia ... Jacob Jacobs <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the audience, {{in the course of a}} kuplét, to commiserate with someone in the first row on his Galician accent - always good for a laugh. Another of his perennial routines is to sing a verse about a man who is cuckolded or impotent, peer out into the audience, and ask someone why his wife is laughing so hard.|$|E
5000|$|Lucy pays a visit Tommy at {{the strip}} club. She intimates that, given {{the timing of}} the birth, there is a chance the baby could be his. [...] "Just ’cause you’ve got some freaky {{offspring}} you wanna pin it on me?" [...] he asks. However his curiosity is aroused and he asks to see the [...] "spooky kid". Once at the house he <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> peer into the baby's cot, only to reel back with a smashed and bloody nose for his trouble. This temporarily pushes the baby up in Lucy's estimation and she gazes lovingly at him, until the face in the cot turns into that of Hercules.|$|E
60|$|There was a silence. Kendricks <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the {{fireplace}} and knocked his pipe against the hearth. Then he suddenly paused.|$|R

50|$|In Bath, {{a middle-aged}} woman's fourth husband falls ill during sex and dies soon after. The wife quickly decides {{to marry a}} young student, {{literally}} running from her late husband's funeral in one wing of a cathedral to her wedding in another wing. On their wedding night, the wife of Bath's fifth husband reads to her from a book denouncing the evils of women. The wife of Bath demands that he not tell her about her own business, and destroys the book. Her husband pushes her away, and she falls onto her back and moans on the floor. When he <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> comfort her, however, she bites his nose. This episode {{is derived from the}} prologue to the Wife of Bath's Tale rather than the tale itself.|$|E
50|$|The video {{starts with}} Swift {{speaking}} in a confessional voice-over. Swift wakes up on an abandoned desert, surrounded by trash and debris, and wearing dark makeup. Flashbacks show Swift and her boyfriend engaging in various stunts, {{along with a few}} tender moments, such as when Swift's boyfriend gives her a necklace as a gift. After a while of {{what seems to be a}} good relationship, she begins to realize something is wrong. While in his parked car, he <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> kiss her when some police pull up for him. He starts a fight in a club, which results in the both of them being injured. There are also scenes of her in a grimy small bathroom, looking at herself in the mirror. While at an outdoor concert, she sees him kissing a large number of different girls. He then looks at her in a nonchalant fashion. She falls asleep in the desert where the party is being held, and wakes up alone the next morning. The video ends with her letting go of the necklace he gave her.|$|E
5000|$|In his review, Mike Grost {{wrote that}} {{although}} the film was no masterpiece, Trail Street contains [...] "fresh visual thinking' and shows [...] "graceful mise-en-scène." [...] Grost continued: One shot shows hero Randolph Scott and friend walking {{down the side of}} a bustling Western street. Another follows a dance hall woman singer through a crowd, up the saloon staircase, and across the balcony, where she <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> address the crowd below. Even when Enright is not moving his camera, many of the visuals have a kinetic quality. People are always moving into or out of the frame. Their motions are graceful and vivid. There is a long sequence of various couples in the plot dancing at a fete. Even Robert Ryan, who I do not think of as the ballroom dancing type, has a rhythmic outing with his girlfriend here. ... Another notable sequence: when Scott rescues the old farmers that had been tied up by bad guys. This sequence ends with an architecturally striking shot. It looks much different from anything I've seen in a Western before. Some fresh visual thinking is at work here.|$|E
