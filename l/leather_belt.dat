25|$|Originally, {{the trophy}} {{presented}} to the event's winner was the Challenge Belt, a red <b>leather</b> <b>belt</b> with a silver buckle. The Challenge Belt was retired in 1870, when Young Tom Morris was allowed to keep it for winning the tournament three consecutive times. Because no trophy was available, the tournament was cancelled in 1871. In 1872, after Young Tom Morris won again for a fourth time in a row, he was awarded a medal. The present trophy, The Golf Champion Trophy, better known by its popular name of the Claret Jug, was then created.|$|E

From 1982 to 1986 the regular M1911A1 was issued. Both {{came with a}} black <b>leather</b> <b>belt,</b> open holster with retaining strap, and a two-pocket magazine pouch. The metal buckle and fittings were similar to the M1916 General Officer's Model except it came in gold metal for the Army and in silver metal for the Air Force. The M15 and M1911A1 were replaced with the M9 pistol in 1986.|$|E

25|$|Browne came up {{with the}} idea of wearing a second belt which went over his right {{shoulder}} and held the scabbard in just the spot he wanted. This would hook into a heavy <b>leather</b> <b>belt</b> with D-rings for attaching accessories. It also securely carried a pistol in a flap-holster on his right hip and included a binocular case with a neck-strap. Other cavalry officers in the Indian Army began wearing a similar rig and soon it became part of the standard uniform. During the Boer War, the rig was copied by Imperial and Commonwealth troops and eventually became standard issue.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2005, Colts coach Tony Dungy was {{notified}} that his eldest son, James Dungy, was found unresponsive {{in his apartment}} in Lutz, Florida by James' girlfriend.

The Operations Manager at the Hillsborough County Medical Examiners Department said {{that the cause of}} death was an apparent suicide. On February 17, 2006, after the autopsy was performed, Dr. Jacqueline Lee of the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner's Office stated that Dungy had hanged himself from a bedroom ceiling fan with a <b>leather</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because several {{articles}} of the clothing the victim had worn {{at the time}} of her murder had been manufactured outside of America, she was theorized to have been a native of a country such as Spain or Canada, as her boots and jacket were made in these respective areas. Other articles of clothing included cutoff shorts from Massachusetts. Other articles of clothing worn by the victim included a <b>leather</b> <b>belt</b> and a sweater. A buckle on the belt was made of brass and the victim wore two metal rings; one white, and one yellow in color. The yellow ring contained a red stone and the white ring bore Native American designs and was created in Mexico.|$|E

25|$|The basic costume of the Mongol {{fighting}} man {{consisted of}} a heavy coat fastened at the waist by a <b>leather</b> <b>belt.</b> From the belt would hang his sword, dagger, and possibly an axe. This long robe-like coat would double over, left breast over right, and be secured with a button a few inches below the right armpit. The coat was lined with fur. Underneath the coat, a shirt-like undergarment with long, wide sleeves was commonly worn. Silk and metallic thread were increasingly used. The Mongols wore protective heavy silk undershirts. Even if an arrow pierced their mail or leather outer garment, the silk from the undershirt would stretch to wrap itself around the arrow as it entered the body, reducing damage caused by the arrow shaft, and making removal of the arrow easier.|$|E
25|$|On 10 June 2002, Fulton, who {{was being}} held on remand in HMP Maghaberry since December 2001, {{was found dead in}} his prison cell with a <b>leather</b> <b>belt</b> around his neck. Fulton was found on his bed rather than hanging from the ceiling, leading to {{speculation}} that he has death had been accidentally caused by autoerotic asphyxiation. Friends claimed he had expressed suicidal thoughts due to both his failure to recover from his close friend Wright's death, as well as fears he had that he was suffering from stomach cancer. Some reports suggested his unstable mental state had seen him stood down as leader several weeks before his death, with the LVF's power base transferred to Belfast. He was also afraid that rival loyalist inmates wished to kill him inside the prison.|$|E
25|$|A {{primitive}} tourniquet can be {{made from}} a stick and a rope (or <b>leather</b> <b>belt).</b> The rope is made into a loop that fits over the damaged limb and the stick is inserted through the loop. The loop is tightened by twisting the stick. The primitive device may stem the flow of blood but side-effects such as soft tissue damage and nerve damage may occur due to the application of unknown, uncontrollable and excessively high pressures and pressure gradients. It is well established by evidence in the clinical literature that higher tourniquet pressures are associated with higher probabilities of tourniquet-related injuries. Modern pneumatic tourniquet systems are microcomputer-based, allowing more accurate and automatic pressure control and many important safety features to minimize the risk of patient injury. Recent trends toward personalized care has increased patient safety by allowing perioperative staff to measure and select a personalized tourniquet pressure based on the patient’s Limb Occlusion Pressure, and select and apply a personalized tourniquet cuff that can adapt the shape of the tourniquet cuff {{to a wide range of}} non-cylindrical limb shapes.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, the Marine Corps had four {{standard}} uniforms. Dress Blues could be worn with a white canvas belt, a <b>leather</b> <b>belt,</b> or a blue cloth belt for officers, but their issue ceased in early 1942 except for recruiters and ceremonial units {{for the duration of}} the war. The green winter service uniform, issued with a coat and a shell cordovan garrison belt for enlisted men with a Sam Browne belt for officers (until a cloth belt of the same material replaced both in 1943), was initially worn as a field uniform (such as the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in Iceland wearing them daily). The garrison cap was reintroduced, originally to be worn overseas, but quickly became standard. The summer khaki service uniform featured pointed pocket flaps, and the trousers had no rear pockets as opposed to the Army's trousers having both front and back pockets. Beginning with a prewar deployment to Guantánamo Bay in early 1941, a fiber pith helmet began to replace the campaign hat worn in tropical areas and by recruits in training, but was eventually phased out as field uniforms were eventually replaced with utilities and helmets in November of that year.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} the {{discovery}} of Mixer's body, on March 25, a surveyor discovered the nude, mutilated body of a teenage girl behind a vacant house on a remote, rural section of Earhart Road, {{just a few hundred}} yards from where the body of Joan Schell had been discovered eight months previous. Investigators called to the crime scene noted a dramatic increase in the savagery exhibited against the victim, with one investigator describing the injuries inflicted upon the victim as being the worst he had seen in 30 years of police work. A subsequent autopsy revealed the victim had died of numerous fractures covering one-third of her skull and one side of her face, all of which had been inflicted with a heavy blunt instrument. These injuries had been inflicted after the victim had been extensively beaten and tortured: her killer had placed a section of her own shirt into her trachea to muffle her screams as she received extensive blunt force trauma to the face, head and body, including several deep lacerations believed to have been inflicted with a leather strap. Welt marks upon the chest and shoulders indicated the killer had also used restraints to hold the victim prone as he whipped her torso and upper legs with a <b>leather</b> <b>belt</b> before tearing a branch from a nearby tree and inserting this instrument eight inches into her vagina. Blood spatterings and churned soil close to the crime scene indicated she had been beaten close to where her body was discovered, and that she may have attempted to escape her attacker.|$|E
