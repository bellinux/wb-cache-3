25|$|Cataño {{also has}} a ferry service known as La Lancha de Cataño, or the Ferry of Cataño. The ferry service, which has been working since 1853, {{operates}} a five-minute harbor route between Cataño and Old San Juan, and vice versa daily. There is a <b>large</b> <b>ferry</b> terminal at Cataño, and tourists can enjoy {{the view of the}} Castillo del Morro and the large cruise ships docked at the old San Juan terminal during this journey.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>large</b> <b>ferry</b> {{boats that}} link islands {{as well as}} fast ferries linking most of the islands. Both types can {{transport}} large numbers of passengers and cargo (including vehicles). Fast ferries are made of aluminium and powered by modern and efficient diesel engines, while conventional ferries have a steel hull and are powered by heavy oil. Fast ferries travel relatively quickly (in excess of 30 knots) and are a faster method of transportation than the conventional ferry (some 20 knots). A typical ferry ride between La Palma and Tenerife may take up to eight hours or more while a fast ferry takes about 2 {{and a half hours}} and between Tenerife and Gran Canaria can be about one hour.|$|E
25|$|In 1905 the Twin City Rapid Transit Company (TCRT) {{extended}} a streetcar {{line to the}} village of Excelsior on Lake Minnetonka's southern shore. The lake saw dramatic change in 1906 as TCRT also opened Big Island Park on Big Island and debuted its Express Boat service. The Express Boats, casually referred to as “streetcar boats,” were essentially floating streetcars that served the lake's summer residents. Six (and later seven) of these steamboats connected 26 landings around the lake to Excelsior, where passengers could transfer onto streetcars bound for the Twin Cities. Many streetcar boat passengers were lakeside residents commuting to their jobs in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Tourists, on the other hand, could board one of three <b>large</b> <b>ferry</b> boats bound for Big Island Park, where they could picnic, enjoy live music, and ride several attractions. Excessive operating and maintenance costs, however, caused TCRT to close Big Island Park only five years after opening it.|$|E

500|$|Tom Fox, the {{president}} of New York Water Taxi from 2001 to 2011, wrote in 2016 that the plan was marred with [...] "an unrealistic time frame, the wrong lead agency, the selection of an inexperienced operator with no ferries, and poor planning". Fox cited the selection of Hornblower Cruises, a California-based cruise operator, despite a bid from three <b>large</b> <b>ferry</b> operators in the New York metropolitan area; the decision to build new boats for the system, instead of buying existing boats from other companies; {{and the fact that}} the new boats could accommodate fewer people than the overcrowded existing East River ferries. He noted that the city bought French motorboat engines that had never been used on passenger boats in the United States; and that since all American shipyards with expertise were not able to take new orders until 2018, the city decided to use a builder with less experience. Additionally, a reporter for DNAinfo.com wrote that Hornblower Cruises had a history of poor relations with its workers' unions. Another writer for that website stated that Hornblower had hired ticket sellers who harangued passersby in order to sell tickets for separate ferries in Lower Manhattan. The aggressive ticket-selling practice was stopped following the latter story.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1994 AS Eminre's {{operations}} {{were divided into}} two companies, one that took care of the traffic to Germany (which was soon closed down) and AS Hansatee which took the Helsinki–Tallinn traffic and the Tallink name. ESCO was clearly the dominant partner in Hansatee, controlling 45% of the shares, whereas Inreko owned only 12.75% (the remaining 42.25% belonging to Eesti Ühispank, Estonia). In 1995 Hansatee brought the first <b>large</b> <b>ferry</b> into Helsinki–Tallinn traffic when they chartered MS Mare Balticum from EstLine and renamed her [...] Following various disputes between ESCO and Inreko (most notably about the charter price of Vana Tallinn), Inreko sold their shares of AS Hansatee to ESCO in December 1996.

2500|$|Many factors {{contributed to}} the village's {{eventual}} decline, but politics played a significant part. The Ratchfords were staunch Conservatives. After Joseph Howe became the Liberal premier of Nova Scotia, {{the post office and}} the customs house moved to Mill Village, site of the present-day Town of Parrsboro, about three kilometres (2 miles) to the northeast. Ratchford's death in 1836 accelerated the shift to the new settlement, even though Conservative Member of Parliament, Sir Charles Tupper, later tried to reinforce Partridge Island's status by successfully pushing {{for the construction of a}} <b>large</b> <b>ferry</b> wharf, which soon became known as [...] "Tupper's Snag." [...] Tupper also purchased the Ratchford home, renaming it Ottawa House, to show his support for Canadian Confederation. Today, there is little left of the Partridge Island settlement, although the historic Ratchford/Tupper home is still there, operating as the Ottawa House By-the-Sea Museum.|$|E
