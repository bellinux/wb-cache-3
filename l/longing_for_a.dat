5|$|Heathen {{influences}} were {{apparent in}} forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed a <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pre-Christian Northern past; {{the mass media}} typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre—which emerged from the fragmentation of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came {{to play an important}} role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world. That decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998.|$|E
25|$|The Hymns to the Night {{display a}} {{universal}} religion with an intermediary. This concept {{is based on}} the idea that there is always a third party between a human and God. This intermediary can either be Jesus – as in Christian lore – or the dead beloved as in the hymns. These works consist of three times two hymns. These three components are each structured in this way: the first hymn shows, with the help of the Romantic triad, the development from an assumed happy life on earth through a painful era of alienation to salvation in the eternal night; the following hymn tells of the awakening from this vision and the <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> return to it. With each pair of hymns, a higher level of experience and knowledge is shown.|$|E
25|$|The Second Great Awakening {{made its}} way across the {{frontier}} territories, fed by intense <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> prominent place for God {{in the life of the}} new nation, a new liberal attitude toward fresh interpretations of the Bible, and a contagious experience of zeal for authentic spirituality. As these revivals spread, they gathered converts to Protestant sects of the time. The revivals eventually moved freely across denominational lines with practically identical results and went farther than ever toward breaking down the allegiances which kept adherents to these denominations loyal to their own. Consequently, the revivals were accompanied by a growing dissatisfaction with Evangelical churches and especially with the doctrine of Calvinism, which was nominally accepted or at least tolerated in most Evangelical churches at the time. Various unaffiliated movements arose that were often restorationist in outlook, considering contemporary Christianity of the time to be a deviation from the true, original Christianity. These groups attempted to transcend Protestant denominationalism and orthodox Christian creeds to restore Christianity to its original form.|$|E

500|$|Children's {{literature}} scholar Patricia Demers {{has referred}} to this connection between {{the family and the}} divine as the Romantic element in Sherwood's writing, arguing that her [...] "characters’ zeal in finding and defining an earthly home prompts their almost automatic <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> heavenly home. Sherwood's is a consciously double vision, glimpsing the eternal in the natural, the sublime in the quotidian." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mariana" [...] is {{a poem by}} Alfred, Lord Tennyson, {{published}} in 1830. The poem follows a common theme in much of Tennyson's work—that of despondent isolation. The subject of [...] "Mariana" [...] {{is a woman who}} continuously laments her lack of connection with society. The isolation defines her existence, and her <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> connection leaves her wishing for death {{at the end of every}} stanza. The premise of [...] "Mariana" [...] originates in William Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, but the poem ends before Mariana's lover returns. Tennyson's version was adapted by others, including John Everett Millais and Elizabeth Gaskell, for use in their own works. The poem was well received by critics, and it is described by critics as an example of Tennyson's skill at poetry.|$|E
5000|$|Klaus-Georg Riegel {{argued that}} [...] "Lenin's utopian {{design of a}} revolutionary {{community}} of virtuosi as a typical political religion of <b>an</b> intelligentsia <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> inner-worldly salvation, a socialist paradise without exploitation and alienation, to be implanted in the Russian backward society at {{the outskirts of the}} industrialised and modernised Western Europe." ...|$|R
50|$|The song is now mainly {{identified}} with Édith Piaf, {{who took it}} up as a central element of her repertoire. It appears in most collections of Piaf's songs.

500|$|Asif had {{initially}} rejected Dilip Kumar {{for the part}} of Prince Salim. Kumar was reluctant {{to act in a}} period film, but accepted the role upon the insistence of the film's producer. According to Kumar, [...] "Asif trusted me enough to leave the delineation of Salim completely to me." [...] Kumar faced difficulty while filming in Rajasthan owing to the heat and the body armour he wore. The part of Anarkali had first been offered to Suraiya but later went to Madhubala, who had been <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> significant role. Madhubala suffered from congenital heart disease, {{which was one of the}} reasons why at times she fainted on set; she also endured skin abrasions while filming the prison sequences, but was determined to finish the film.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Falling Down" [...] {{is said to}} be {{in regards}} to accusations of {{wrongdoing}} and has a sense of <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> non-benefiting relationship. However in an interview, Gomez stated, during an interview that the song ultimately is a ridicule of the Hollywood life and fame, that was the meaning behind [...] "Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya." [...] Gomez further elaborated on the concept of the song on an interview with Just Jared Jr., saying, It's basically about Hollywood and what people think about it and essentially how plastic it is sometimes. It's fun and I think girls can relate to it somewhat, for me it was because of Hollywood but it can really relate to a mean girl, an ex-boyfriend, to whoever.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} five songs, The Revival {{features}} songs at a calmer tempo and more conventional style, with ballads that are more relaxed and low-key. [...] "It Never Rains (In Southern California)" [...] was titled after an oft-repeated phrase from one of Tony! Toni! Toné!'s attorneys, who used it {{in response to the}} group wearing heavy coats after returning from visits on the East Coast. Group drummer Timothy Christian played most of the song's instruments, and bassist Raphael Wiggins wrote its lyrics about a man <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman who was in southern California. The ballads are followed by [...] "Those Were the Days", which features jouncing banjo, trumpet, and wistful lyrics reminiscing about simpler times [...] "when a dollar was worth a dollar, and you didn't have to carry a gun when you left your house." ...|$|E
50|$|Marcher {{may appear}} so {{eccentric}} and unrealistic in his obsession that his fate could seem irrelevant and unconvincing. However, many critics and ordinary readers {{have found that}} his tragedy only dramatizes, with heightened effect, <b>a</b> common <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> exalting experience that will redeem an otherwise humdrum existence, although most individuals will not endure anything like Marcher's final revelation at May's graveside.|$|R

2500|$|At {{about the}} same time a new poetry of [...] "courtly love" [...] became fashionable in Europe. Traveling singers—troubadours and trouvères—made a living from their love songs in French, Spanish, Galician-Portuguese, Catalan, Provençal, and Greek. Germanic culture had its [...] Minnesänger tradition. The songs of courtly love often express unrequited <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ideal woman, but there are also aubades (dawn farewells by lovers) and humorous ditties.|$|R
500|$|Becky Bain of Idolator {{commented on}} the simple {{structure}} and themes of the video, writing [...] "There’s not much to this simple vid, but it does feature Carey doing her usual hand waving theatrics while hitting some absolutely killer high notes." [...] Bain also observed {{that the vast majority}} of the shots of Carey are either long shots, showing the singer from a distance, or close up shots, showing Carey from the shoulders and above, so that the viewer was not able to easily recognise that she was pregnant. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy also praised the content of the video, writing [...] "Of course it wouldn't be a Mariah Carey video without some glitz and glam so the stage and backdrop are covered in (what else?) glitter. Mariah puts on a great show and sings her heart out with that famous eight-octave range... scrooges need not apply, 'Oh Santa!' is fun and festive and has you <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sip of eggnog." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} cited Elita 5, Michael Jackson, The Police, the Bee Gees, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, Tonic, Prince, Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye as influences. Adam Levine has also cited Billy Joel as an influence. Furthermore, guitarist James Valentine {{said he was}} {{influenced}} by guitarists like Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell and John Scofield, {{as well as the}} rock band Queens of the Stone Age. The band's songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied by piano or synthesizer. The theme in most of their songs is love, frequently lost love; songs like [...] "This Love", [...] "Makes Me Wonder" [...] and [...] "Misery" [...] have a very cynical tone, often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship, while their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as [...] "She Will Be Loved" [...] and [...] "Never Gonna Leave This Bed" [...] express a <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship. [...] "Makes Me Wonder" [...] has a secondary theme, in which Levine expresses his disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and the Iraq War.|$|E
500|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{return to the}} band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really amazed at how badly [...] was being viewed... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're {{not trying to be}} difficult... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people... What we're doing isn't that radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E

50|$|The human {{elements}} of the poem (lines 3-4, 7-12, 15-16, 19-20) can read as either a first or third person narrative. If such a reading is taken, the poem begins with a statement of the male persona's <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ideal beloved in the first stanza, depicts the withholding of fulfillment in the second, and concludes with an eventual realisation of these desires in the third stanza.|$|R

500|$|Many critics {{criticized the}} lack of {{reasonable}} challenge for the Underwoods. James Poniewozik notes that [...] "Francis needs a stronger nemesis, {{if not for the}} sake of justice then for the sake of excitement. And House of Cards would be a greater show if it had characters who were people more than game pieces. Still, on its limited terms, it's absorbing to watch". According to Entertainment Weekly Karen Valby, the show's fundamental problem is that [...] "The Underwoods have no worthy opponents." [...] According to Variety Brian Lowry, as conniving as Underwood is, it is unfathomable that [...] "nobody else in a town built on power seems particularly adept at recognizing this or combating him". Valby notes that neither Tusk nor Goodwin is an effective foe, leaving the audience <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> comeuppance in the first four episodes that served as a preview for critics and his hopeful that Sharp provides a good foil as the season progresses. He also wrote that House of Cards overplays its depiction of the edginess of [...] "Washington being venal and corrupt". He describes the show as a [...] "mixed bag".|$|E
500|$|Carmen herself, says Dean, is a {{new type}} of operatic heroine {{representing}} a new kind of love, not the innocent kind associated with the [...] "spotless soprano" [...] school, but something altogether more vital and dangerous. Her capriciousness, fearlessness and love of freedom are all musically represented: [...] "She is redeemed from any suspicion of vulgarity by her qualities of courage and fatalism so vividly realised in the music". Curtiss suggests that Carmen's character, spiritually and musically, may be a realisation of the composer's own unconscious <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> freedom denied to him by his stifling marriage. Harold C. Schonberg likens Carmen to [...] "a female Don Giovanni. She would rather die than be false to herself". The dramatic personality of the character, and the range of moods she is required to express, call for exceptional acting and singing talents. This has deterred some of opera's most distinguished exponents; Maria Callas, though she recorded the part, never performed it on stage. The musicologist Hugh Macdonald observes that [...] "French opera never produced another femme as fatale as Carmen", though she may have influenced some of Massenet's heroines. Macdonald suggests that outside the French repertoire, Richard Strauss's Salome and Alban Berg's Lulu [...] "may be seen as distant degenerate descendants of Bizet's temptress".|$|E
500|$|On 10 January 1893, Marie and Ferdinand {{were married}} at Sigmaringen Castle in three ceremonies: one civil, one Catholic (Ferdinand's religion) and one Anglican. The civil {{ceremony}} {{was performed in}} the Red Hall of the castle by Karl von Wendel, the German Emperor being {{the first of the}} witnesses present to sign the marriage act. At four o'clock, the Catholic ceremony took place at the Town Church, with Marie being led to the altar by her father. The Anglican ceremony was more modest and was conducted in one of the chambers of the castle. Although King Carol granted the couple [...] "Honigtag" [...] (one day of honeymoon), Marie and Ferdinand spent a few days at the Castle of Krauchenwies in Bavaria. From there, they left for the countryside, their journey being interrupted briefly by a stop at Vienna, where they visited Emperor Franz Joseph. Due to growing tensions between Austria and Romania (the visit took place during the ongoing movement of the Transylvanian Memorandum), the couple's visit was brief and they arrived in the border town of Predeal following a nighttime crossing of Transylvania by train. Marie was warmly welcomed by the Romanian people, who were <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more personal monarchy.|$|E
60|$|That same {{evening at}} nine o'clock, sitting {{over the last}} glass of a pint of port, Mr. Barter felt <b>an</b> irresistible <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> enjoyment, <b>an</b> impulse towards {{expansion}} and his fellow-men.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, {{a contest}} {{was held to}} find a poem which could express the {{appreciation}} and inspiration of this struggle for freedom. The winner was Dublin born author Liam Mac Uistín, whose poem [...] "We Saw a Vision", an aisling style poem, is written in Irish, French, and English on the stone wall of the monument. The aisling ( [...] "vision") form was used in eighteenth-century poems <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> end to Ireland's miserable condition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other two}} roommates, Hope and James, both {{have their own}} problems. Hope is <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> upscale job after losing {{her job at the}} {{television}} studio, and James brings in a slapstick sensibility as he takes a delight in watching Mark's attempts to [...] "woo" [...] Katie. The series also includes Thom, Mark's ex-roommate, who feels he is destined to help Mark in his quest to be a unit with Katie.|$|R
500|$|Ideologically, Varg Vikernes's one-man project Burzum helped {{inspire the}} Viking metal scene through his {{strongly}} held racist, nationalistic, and anti-Judeo-Christian beliefs, and his <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> return to paganism. In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had {{culminated in the}} burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, [...] "His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'." [...] They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes [...] "cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation {{of an attempt to}} restore Norse paganism for his church burning". While in prison, Vikernes released the book Vargsmål, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the Hávamál, though with [...] "an eye on Mein Kampf". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, [...] "proving both that {{it is not just the}} early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator".|$|E
500|$|David is an android {{that acts}} as the ship's butler and {{maintenance}} man. It {{is designed to be}} indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop [...] "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, [...] "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do you think about all of this? What's going on? What do you think about these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?" [...] Fassbender said, [...] "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance". In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose [...] "vacancy" [...] and <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> soul interested him. Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in , the [...] "funny walk and economy of movement" [...] of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence. Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast, despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} and their stories {{served as an}} extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child. They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> life she did not feel she was free to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.|$|E
5000|$|Lyrically, [...] "Mercy" [...] {{is about}} [...] "intense <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{attractive}} guy".

50|$|The vessel's unusual name is Portuguese (correctly Saudadões) {{and would}} {{normally}} be written Saudades today. The name was evidently chosen by Queen Catherine herself, and gives an insight into her character expressing as it does feelings of wistful <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> absent person or place left behind. (Strictly, the word saudadões would indicate a great longing.) The spelling of this ship's name in naval documents seems to vary: usually Suadadoes, but sometimes Sandadoe, Sandadoes, Sandados, Sandados, Saudados, Suadades, or Suadadoes.|$|R

The song was reprised by Serge Gainsbourg in the 1980s, the male voice singing the lyrics made famous by Piaf. The new version of [...] "Mon Légionnaire" [...] was a hit on French dancefloors.|$|R
