5|$|Social {{amenities}} were rudimentary {{even before}} {{the formation of the}} Rhondda Urban District Council in 1897. Due to the geographic layout of the valleys, land was a scarce resource, and therefore leisure activities that took up <b>little</b> <b>space,</b> time and money were sought. This saw the popularity of activities such as greyhound races, cockfighting, open air handball courts (often attached to a public house), boxing booths, foot racing and rugby union.|$|E

Among the passengers were the Beatles, {{on their first}} trip to the United States as a band, with their entourage of photographers and journalists, and Phil Spector. When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed JohnF.KennedyAirport, they were greeted by a second large crowd, with Beatles fans again estimated to number four thousand, and journalists, two hundred. From having so many people packed in a <b>little</b> <b>space,</b> a few people in the crowd got injured. The airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd.|$|E

5|$|Morgan's {{department}} always faced financial {{struggles in}} an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, nurses and other participants. These classes ultimately weakened the department's reputation at the university, as school officials viewed the training as vocational and considered it to be beneath {{the standards of the}} university. Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very <b>little</b> <b>space</b> to conduct her research work. Adding to the difficulty of the situation was the fact that university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high for a home economics program.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{including}} guinea pigs, mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils, chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets {{able to live}} {{in small}} spaces, each species with its own qualities. Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage. Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very <b>little</b> <b>space.</b> Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had <b>little</b> <b>space</b> to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{there are}} no {{regulations}} at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with <b>little</b> <b>space</b> between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that {{is close to the}} outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can {{have a significant effect on}} how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.|$|E
