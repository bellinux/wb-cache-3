The National Gallery of Art notes that the source is {{entitled}} Donald Duck <b>Lost</b> <b>and</b> <b>Found,</b> written in 1960 by Carl Buettner and published through Disney Enterprises.

The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} the Good Friday mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section as he looks back on his period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been <b>lost</b> <b>and</b> <b>found</b> and lost again'.|$|E
