500|$|In {{the wake}} of Labour's second defeat at the Scottish Parliament {{election}} of May 2011, which saw the Scottish National Party (SNP) form its first majority government, Gray announced his intention to step down {{as leader of the}} Labour MSPs later that year. A review chaired by Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack into the party's structure in Scotland subsequently concluded that the next leader should lead the entire Scottish Labour Party rather than just its MSPs, as previous leaders had. Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011 and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University. She told delegates that Labour needed to reengage with the electorate if it wanted to govern again: [...] "We must listen and learn, show humility and seek again to talk for and to people's ambitions and concerns. Our real challenge is that we in Labour <b>lost</b> <b>our</b> way, <b>lost</b> <b>our</b> confidence and lost Scotland." ...|$|E

[...] The result was followed with four consecutive draws – three at home against Roma, Valencia and Ajax. Arsenal only needed a draw to progress into the knockout stages, but lost 2–1 to Valencia at the Mestalla on 19 March 2003. Reflecting later on the Champions League campaign, Wenger commented that [...] "we <b>lost</b> <b>our</b> qualification at home".|$|E
500|$|According to drummer Sean Moore, {{the band}} {{felt they had}} been [...] "going a bit astray" [...] with their {{previous}} album, 1993's Gold Against the Soul, and so the approach to the follow-up was for the band {{to go back to}} their [...] "grass roots" [...] and rediscover [...] "a little bit of Britishness that we lacked". Singer and guitarist James Dean Bradfield recalls the band feeling they had become [...] "a bit too rockist [...] we had <b>lost</b> <b>our</b> direction". The band stopped listening to American rock music and returned to influences that had inspired them when they first formed, including Magazine, Wire, Skids, PiL, Gang of Four and Joy Division.|$|E

The mayor of Miami along with seven other politicians began a fund-raising campaign for medical needs and clothing and coordinated the distribution of [...] of Rexall drugs. Several nearby countries sent airplanes carrying medicine and food. A local fund-raising effort collected 250,000Ecuadorian sucres (approximately US$14,815 1949) within twohours of its launch.

500|$|The {{extensive}} use of forest roads through conifer plantations has been another criticism: {{the authors of the}} Lonely Planet guidebook, Walking in Ireland, found, [...] "The Way's one shortcoming is the character of the walking [...] you'll become all too familiar with forest tracks and roads through conifer plantations [...] where they're surrounded by tall, dense forest they're not particularly interesting". Similarly, Paul Gosling, who walked the Way for The Independent, found that, [...] "While the long distance path is, on occasion, very attractive, {{it is not so much}} hazardous as unadventurous. [...] Over the next four and a half days, we <b>lost</b> <b>our</b> enthusiasm for conifers [...] The views were restricted and there was little sign of wildlife". In The Irish Times John G.

500|$|The {{first episode}} of the season, [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today", {{gathered}} 10.6 million viewers, whereas the second part gathered only 9.4 million viewers.

When talking about {{the beginning of the}} ninth season, Chris Carter said, [...] "We <b>lost</b> <b>our</b> audience on the first episode. It's like the audience had gone away, and I didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back." [...] "The Truth" [...] received the highest Nielsen household rating and viewership numbers of the season. It earned a 7.5 rating and gathered 13.25 million viewers in the United States. The loss of viewers resulted in this season seeing a 30 percent ratings drop when compared to the eighth season.|$|E

In the financial sphere of the campaign, Thompson acknowledged that he could not compete with funds being raised by the upper-tiered candidates, but he stated that he did not intend to do so because his campaign was [...] "different" [...] than the others; according to Thompson, his was more centered around a strong ground organization in Iowa.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} series finale, [...] "The Truth", attracted 13.25 million viewers, the series' lowest rated season finale. The ninth {{season was}} the 63rd most-watched {{show for the}} 2001–02 season, tying its season two rank. On May 19, 2002, the finale aired and the Fox network confirmed that The X-Files was over.

It's like the audience had gone away and I didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back." [...] While news outlets cited declining ratings because of lackluster stories and poor writing, The X-Files production crew blamed September 11 terrorist attacks as the main factor. At the end of 2002, The X-Files had become the longest-running consecutive science fiction series ever on U.S. broadcast television. This record was later surpassed by Stargate SG-1 in 2007 and Smallville in 2011.|$|E

With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in our Democracy, and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become a part of our political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't <b>lost</b> <b>our</b> capacity to be horrified. ...
