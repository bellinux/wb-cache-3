40|$|Support <b>looseness</b> <b>fault</b> {{is a type}} {{of common}} fault in aeroengine. Serious <b>looseness</b> <b>fault</b> would emerge under larger {{unbalanced}} force, which would cause excessive vibration and even lead to rubbing fault, so it is important to analyze and recognize <b>looseness</b> <b>fault</b> effectively. In this paper, based on certain type turbofan engine structural features, a rotor-support-casing whole model for certain type turbofan aeroengine is established. The rotor and casing systems are modeled by means of the finite element beam method; the support systems are modeled by lumped-mass model; the support <b>looseness</b> <b>fault</b> model is also introduced. The coupled system response is obtained by numerical integral method. In this paper, based on the casing acceleration signals, the impact characteristics of symmetrical stiffness and asymmetric stiffness models are analyzed, finding that the <b>looseness</b> <b>fault</b> would lead to the longitudinal asymmetrical characteristics of acceleration time domain wave and the multiple frequency characteristics, which is consistent with the real trial running vibration signals. Asymmetric stiffness looseness model is verified to be fit for aeroengine <b>looseness</b> <b>fault</b> model...|$|E

The {{dynamic model}} of {{nonlinear}} stiffness rotor-bearing system with pedestal <b>looseness</b> <b>fault</b> was set up, taking the linearity and cube item as the physics nonlinear factors. The periodic solution of system was analyzed by continuation-shooting algorithm for periodic solution of nonlinear non-autonomous system, and {{the stability of}} system periodic motion and unsteady law are discussed by Floquet theory. The unstable form of it is Hopf bifurcation. In the region of critical rotate speed, the main motion {{of the system is}} periodic- 4; and it of ultra critical rotate speed, the main motion of the system is periodic- 3 and chaotic motion. The conclusions provide theoretic basis reference for the fault diagnosis of the rotor-bearing system...|$|E
40|$|The {{demountable}} disk-drum aero-engine rotor is {{an important}} piece of equipment that greatly impacts the safe operation of aircraft. However, assembly <b>looseness</b> or crack <b>fault</b> has led to several unscheduled breakdowns and serious accidents. Thus, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis technique are required for identifying abnormal conditions. Customized ensemble multiwavelet method for aero-engine rotor condition identification, using measured vibration data, is developed in this paper. First, customized multiwavelet basis function with strong adaptivity is constructed via symmetric multiwavelet lifting scheme. Then vibration signal is processed by customized ensemble multiwavelet transform. Next, normalized information entropy of multiwavelet decomposition coefficients is computed to directly reflect and evaluate the condition. The proposed approach is first applied to fault detection of an experimental aero-engine rotor. Finally, the proposed approach is used in an engineering application, where it successfully identified the crack fault of a demountable disk-drum aero-engine rotor. The {{results show that the}} proposed method possesses excellent performance in fault detection of aero-engine rotor. Moreover, the robustness of the multiwavelet method against noise is also tested and verified by simulation and field experiments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{induction}} motor {{is the most}} common driver in industry and has been previously proposed as a means of inferring the condition of an entire equipment train, predominantly through the measurement and processing of power supply parameters. This has obvious advantages in terms of being non-intrusive or remote, less costly to apply and improved safety. This paper describes the use of the {{induction motor}} current to identify and quantify a number of common faults seeded on a two-stage reciprocating compressor. An analysis of the compressor working cycle leads to current signal the components that are sensitive to the common faults seeded to compressor system, and second- and third-order signal processing tools are used to analyse the current signals. It is shown that the developed diagnostic features: the bispectral peak value from the amplitude modulation bispectrum and the kurtosis from the current gives rise to reliable fault classification results. The low feature values can differentiate the belt <b>looseness</b> from other <b>fault</b> cases and valve leakage and inter-cooler leakage can be separated easily using two linear classifiers. This work provides a novel approach to the analysis stator current data for the diagnosis of motor drive faults...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} the induction motor current to identify and quantify common faults within a two-stage reciprocating compressor. The theoretical basis is studied to understand current signal characteristics when the motor undertakes a varying load under faulty conditions. Although conventional bispectrum representation of current signal allows the inclusion of phase information and the elimination of Gaussian noise, it produces unstable results due to random phase variation of the sideband components in the current signal. A modified bispectrum based on the amplitude modulation feature of the current signal is thus proposed to combine both lower sidebands and higher sidebands simultaneously and hence describe the current signal more accurately. Based on this new bispectrum a more effective diagnostic feature namely normalised bispectral peak is developed for fault classification. In association with the kurtosis of the raw current signal, the bispectrum feature gives rise to reliable fault classification results. In particular, the low feature values can differentiate the belt <b>looseness</b> from other <b>fault</b> cases and discharge valve leakage and intercooler leakage can be separated easily using two linear classifiers. This work provides a novel approach to the analysis of stator current for the diagnosis of motor drive faults from downstream driving equipment...|$|R
40|$|For the {{diagnosis}} of looseness-rubbing coupling fault of rotor-sliding bearing system caused by bolt <b>looseness</b> <b>fault,</b> the mechanical model and finite element model of dual-disc rotor system with looseness-rubbing coupling fault are established based on the nonlinear finite element method, nonlinear oil film force, looseness stiffness model, and Hertz contact theory. With the augmented Lagrange method, contact constraint conditions are dealt with {{to ensure that the}} rotary disk and casing contact with each other meeting boundary penetrating depth within the prescribed tolerance range. And then the dynamics characteristics of the health rotor system supported by sliding bearing are studied. Combined with experimental study and simulation analysis, it is found that the looseness-rubbing coupling fault is often characterized by rubbing fault, {{the lower part of the}} time-domain fluctuated shape is denser, while the upper part is relatively loose, and multiple nested half ellipse is shown in orbit diagram. Because of the loosing stiffness and rubbing force, the phenomenon of unstable oil film is depressed. The appearance of the first- and second-order oil film oscillation phenomenon is delayed. It could be used as a theoretical basis for diagnosing looseness-rubbing coupling fault of rotor-sliding bearing system...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{finite element model}} of dual-rotor system with pedestal looseness stemming from loosened bolts. Dynamic model including bearing pedestal looseness is established based on the dual-rotor test rig. Three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar rigid motion of loose bearing pedestal is fully considered and collision recovery coefficient is also introduced in the model. Based on the Timoshenko beam elements, using the finite element method, rigid body kinematics, and the Newmark-β algorithm for numerical simulation, dynamic characteristics of {{the inner and outer}} rotors and the bearing pedestal plane rigid body motion under bearing pedestal looseness condition are studied. Meanwhile, the looseness experiments under two different speed combinations are carried out, and the experimental results are basically the same. The simulation results are compared with the experimental results, indicating that vibration displacement waveforms of loosened rotor have “clipping” phenomenon. When the bearing pedestal <b>looseness</b> <b>fault</b> occurs, the inner and outer rotors vibration spectrum not only contains the difference and sum frequency of the two rotors’ fundamental frequency but also contains 2 X and 3 X component of rotor with loosened support, and so forth; low frequency spectrum is more, containing dividing component, and so forth; the rotor displacement spectrums also contain fewer combination frequency components, and so forth; when one side of the inner rotor bearing pedestal is loosened, the inner rotor axis trajectory is drawn into similar-ellipse shape...|$|E
40|$|Rotating {{machines}} and reciprocating machines like turbines, combustion engines and electric motor {{are the most}} widely used in industry. These machine consist of components which generate vibration dan heat during operation. Excessive vibration and heat can be indicators of fault in the machine. Therefore, machine condition monitoring is needed to monitor the real time machine condition with proper devices and methods. One of those being developed now is using infrared thermography. This method is categorized in the nondestructive testing (NDT) or inspection without damage. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the patterns of digital image thermography by means image clustering and image features for machine condition monitoring. Image features used in this study are area, perimeter and central moments of hotspots region. This study was conducted by capturing thermal image of bearing from machine fault simulator by varying the conditions which are common in rotating machinery such as, mass unbalance, misalignment, <b>looseness,</b> and bearing <b>faults.</b> Self Organizing Map (SOM) method was used to pattern recognition of machine condition based on extracted image features. Using this method, the fault in the machine can be diagnosed. There are several factors that affect the accuracy of diagnosis such as the size of data image, clustering process and image features. The small data image leads the low accuracy of diagnosis process. ...|$|R

This paper presents the use of the {{induction motor}} current to identify and quantify a number of common faults on a two-stage reciprocating compressor which produces varying load to the driving motor. Bispectrum representation of current allows the inclusion of phase information and the elimination of Gaussian noise. It will provide more details of the machine conditions. Moreover, a modified bispectrum based the amplitude modulation feature of the current signal produces more accurate presentation than the conventional bispectrum. Based on this new bispectrum, a more effective diagnostic feature - averaged bispectral peak is developed for fault classification. In conjunction with the kurtosis from the current the bispectrum feature gives rise to reliable fault classification results.
