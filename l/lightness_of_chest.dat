40|$|It {{is obvious}} that {{perceived}} <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> a surface depends on the surrounding luminance distribution in 2 D and 3 D. These effects are usually explained by the mechanisms at relatively low level of visual system. However, {{there seems to be}} a relation between the illuminance and spatial layout of the scene regardless of the surrounding luminance distribution. If this is valid, perceived <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> a surface in the scene could be influenced by the spatial layout in the scene. In this research, we investigated the relation between the perceived <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> surface and the spatial layout of the scene. The subject matched the <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> test patch presented on a natural picture with various spatial layout to that of comparison stimulus presented on a uniform gray background. The mean luminance of the surround stimuli were the same and the local contrast between the text patch and the surround was kept constant. Results showed that the perceived <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> a stimulus depended on the spatial structure presented in the background. This result indicates that the spatial layout of the scene is related to the illuminance of that and influenced on perceived lightness...|$|R

40|$|The {{unbearable}} <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> différance is {{in reference}} to Milan Kundera’s famous book, The unbearable <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> being. Being is unbearably light, if interpreted as Heidegger did as either the meaning of Being or the truth of Being, yet in Derrida’s response to Heidegger he argues that différance is ‘older’ than the meaning of Being, even older than the truth of Being, and thus {{one could argue that}} différance is even lighter than Being and thus even more unbearable. What possibilities does such an unbearable <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> différance offer to human being-with (Mitsein) in a global village faced with so many socio-economic and environmental challenges? The unbearable lightness could be absolute relativism and particularism as Rawls has interpreted it or it could be the unbearable <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> auto-deconstruction. The unbearable <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> différance opens a socio-political space with an ethos of deconstruction and thereby response or ibility towards the other. This <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> différance can be interpreted as a difficult liberty (difficult liberty as Levinas interprets it) or even an unbearable liberty of infinite broken chains of signifiers and yet a freedom that is held to account (that responds) to the other. This liberty is an infinite responsibility towards the other and therefore infinite responsibility towards justice (diké). Différance is liberty as all there is, is text, but this liberty is not licentiousness of absolute disconnection, but the difficult liberty of being only responsible towards the other. The question this article will grapple with is: what ethical implications can be gathered from this state of being-with, this unbearable <b>lightness</b> <b>of</b> différance in the global village? INTRADISCIPLINARY AND/OR INTERDISCIPLINARY IMPLICATIONS : Philosophy and philosophy of religion. The article focusses on the conversation between Heidegger and Derrida, with regards to différance and Austrag. [URL] Theolog...|$|R
