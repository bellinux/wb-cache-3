30|$|Analysis {{of natural}} <b>landscapes</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the}} same {{boundaries}} as those of present-day landscapes (Grondin et al. 2014, Fig. 1). These boundaries were defined from data collected by the Quebec Ministry of Forests, Fauna and Parks (MFFP) in the form of forest maps and forest inventory plots. Most of these data were elaborated during the 1970 s and 1980 s. The data were used to develop two matrices on which redundancy analysis was conducted (RDA), followed by Kmeans grouping (Borcard et al. 2011). For the purposes of simplification, the original codes of the present-day <b>landscapes</b> <b>were</b> modified. Although <b>landscapes</b> <b>are</b> coded from 1 to 9, a total of 14 are included in the study because some <b>landscapes</b> <b>are</b> similar in forest composition and age structure yet are geographically distinct (e.g. 8 a, 8 b, 8 c).|$|R

5|$|The road follows Bluewater Highway {{along the}} river, passing {{to the north}} of Saranac.

In town, M-66 runs concurrently along M-21 for a few blocks in the central business district. Bluewater Highway leaves town and continues along the Grand River to Muir, and the trunkline crosses the Maple River on east side of town. M-21 follows the course of the Maple briefly before turning east through farms along the Stony Creek to Pewamo. The highway bypasses the village to the south and crosses into Clinton County near the eastern edge of town. Western Clinton County's <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> dominated by farms, interrupted by the community of Fowler. The highway enters the county seat, St. Johns on State Street, passing through a residential section of town. In the middle of downtown, M-21 intersects 2nd Street, which carries Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US127). East of downtown, M-21 passes back into agricultural land and under the US127 freeway. The <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> once again dominated by these farms through the western side of the county.|$|E
5|$|The serial expands on Austen's metaphorical use of landscapes, {{reinforcing}} {{beauty and}} authenticity. Elizabeth takes {{every opportunity to}} enjoy nature and to escape exposure to Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine. The most symbolic use of nature in the novel is Elizabeth and the Gardiners' visit to Pemberley in Derbyshire, where Elizabeth becomes conscious of her love for Darcy. The story makes nature integral {{in the form of}} Old England. Elizabeth's appreciation of the beauties of Derbyshire elevates Darcy in her and her relatives' opinion. Darcy's gaze through the window works as a movie screen, projecting Elizabeth's actions for him and the viewer. His participation in the English <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> his redemption.|$|E

5|$|Before the 13th century, {{the direct}} {{route to the}} sea at Highbridge was blocked by gravel banks and peat near Westhay. The course of the river {{partially}} encircled Glastonbury from the south, around the western side (through Beckery), and then north through the Panborough-Bleadney gap in the Wedmore-Wookey Hills, to join the River Axe just north of Bleadney. This route {{made it difficult for}} the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the Abbey, and when the valley of the river Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Sometime between 1230 and 1250, a new channel was constructed westwards into Meare Pool north of Meare, and further westwards to Mark Moor.

In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000acres (20km²) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of High Wycombe, and Humphrey Repton completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared much as they do today.|$|E

5|$|The Holderness <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> {{dominated}} by deposits of till, boulder clays and glacial lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form {{a more or}} less continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial landscape features such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area. The well drained glacial deposits provide fertile soils that can support intensive arable cultivation. Fields are generally large and bounded by drainage ditches. There is very little woodland in the area and this leads to a landscape that is essentially rural but very flat and exposed.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the factors affecting landscape perception, with particular {{reference to the}} agrarian historical landscapes of the plains in the Veneto region of Italy. The main historical agrarian <b>landscapes</b> <b>were</b> identified, and their aesthetic value was {{compared with that of}} more modern <b>landscapes.</b> Surveys <b>were</b> conducted on three groups of inhabitants: children, university students and adults and three approaches were used to analyze the landscape preferences. First, the appreciation of each <b>landscape</b> <b>was</b> compared; second the effects of the various elements on <b>landscape</b> preferences <b>were</b> determined by means of photomontages; and finally, the visual impact of these elements, in improving or worsening the aesthetic quality of the <b>landscape,</b> <b>was</b> quantified using a statistical model. This made it possible to determine if, and to what extent, some aesthetic and cultural values are shared among the three generations of individuals included in this study. The results have demonstrated that some elements of the historical landscapes (villas and traditional farm buildings in particular) can increase the appreciation for the agrarian landscape in the three groups of interviewees. However, not all historical agrarian <b>landscapes</b> <b>are</b> appreciated. This suggests a need for landscape education programmes, especially for the young, so that future generations will favour interventions in the preservation of the historical and cultural agrarian landscapes...|$|R
