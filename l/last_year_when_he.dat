60|$|The late {{hours of}} Christmas Eve {{was the time}} when he had most to suffer. The day had been gloomy and snowy, and he had spent it almost entirely in solitude, with no {{companion}} or diversion to restore the tone of his mind, when he had tried it with hard study. He tried to read, but it would not do; and he was reduced to sit looking at the fire, recalling this time <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had been cutting holly, helping the sisters to deck the house, and in the evening enjoying a merry Christmas party, full of blitheness and glee, where there were, of course, special recollections of Amabel.|$|E

50|$|Ulstadius {{and two of}} {{his most}} impassioned {{followers}} were sentenced to death, but the conviction was changed to life in prison.

6000|$|On {{the morning}} of the 27th, Mrs. Hanson {{appeared}} with the milk as usual, in her sun-bonnet. The time would be out on Tuesday, she reminded us, and bade me be in readiness to play my part, though I had no idea what it was to be. And suppose Ronalds came? we asked. She received the idea with derision, laughing aloud with all her fine teeth. He could not find the mine to save his life, it appeared, without Rufe to guide him. <b>Last</b> <b>year,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> came, they heard him [...] "up and down the road a hollerin' and a raisin' Cain." [...] And at last he had to come to the Hansons in despair, and bid Rufe, [...] "Jump into your pants and shoes, and show me where this old mine is, anyway!" [...] Seeing that Ronalds had laid out so much money in the spot, and that a beaten road led right up {{to the bottom of the}} clump, I thought this a remarkable example.

"One day, his {{regiment}} the 20th being paraded in St. James's Park, {{a friend}} of mine, Mr. Wolfe, did me the honour to present me to his Royal Highness the Captain-General, who was most gracious; a fat, jolly Prince, if I may speak so without disrespect, reminding me in his manner of that unhappy General Braddock; whom we knew to our sorrow <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> heard my name, and how dearest George had served and fallen in Braddock's unfortunate campaign, he talked a great deal with me; asked why a young fellow like me did not serve too; why I {{did not go to}} the King of Prussia, who was a great General, and see a campaign or two; and whether that would not be better than dawdling about at routs and card-parties in London? I said, I would like to go with all my heart, but was an only son now, on leave from my mother, and belonged to our estate in Virginia. His Royal Highness said, Mr. Braddock had wrote home accounts of Mrs. Esmond's loyalty, and that he would gladly serve me. Mr. Wolfe and I have waited on him since, at his Royal Highness's house in Pall Mall. The latter, who is still quite a young man, made the Scots campaign with his Highness, whom Mr. Dempster loves so much at home. To be sure, he was too severe: if anything can be top severe against rebels in arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Colonel and I went to dine at the Cafe de Paris, and {{afterwards}} to the opera. Ask for huitres de Marenne when you dine here. We dined {{with a tremendous}} French swell, the Vicomte de Florac, officier d'ordonnance {{to one of the}} princes, and son of some old friends of my father's. They are of very high birth, but very poor. He will be a duke when his cousin, the Duc d'Ivry, dies. His father is quite old. The vicomte was born in England. He pointed out to us no end of famous people at the opera--a few of the Fauxbourg St. Germain, and ever so many of the present people:--M. Thiers, and Count Mole, and Georges Sand, and Victor Hugo, and Jules Janin--I forget half their names. And yesterday we went to see his mother, Madame de Florac. I suppose she was an old flame of the Colonel's, for their meeting was uncommonly ceremonious and tender. It was like an elderly Sir Charles Grandison saluting a middle-aged Miss Byron. And only fancy! the Colonel has been here once before since his return to England! It must have been <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was away for ten days, whilst I was painting that rubbishing picture of the Black Prince waiting on King John. Madame de F. is a very grand lady, and must have been a great beauty in her time. There are two pictures by Gerard in her salon--of her and M. de Florac. M. de Florac, old swell, powder, thick eyebrows, hooked nose; no end of stars, ribbons, and embroidery. Madame also in the dress of the Empire--pensive, beautiful, black velvet, and a look something like my cousin's. She wore a little old-fashioned brooch yesterday, and said, 'Voila, la reconnoissez-vous? Last year when you were here, it was in the country;' and she smiled at him: and the dear old boy gave a sort of groan and dropped his head in his hand. I know what it is. I've gone through it myself. I kept for six months an absurd ribbon of that infernal little flirt Fanny Freeman. Don't you remember how angry I was when you abused her? ...|$|E
