5|$|By 1877, {{differences}} with the Republican party <b>leadership</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> money question led him to consider other options. After initially supporting the Republican candidate for governor that year, Weaver joined the Greenback Party in August. In 1878, Weaver accepted the Greenback nomination for Iowa's 6th congressional district. Although Weaver's political career up to then had been as a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district considered that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Ezekiel S. Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Despite objections from some hard-money Democrats, the Greenback-Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E

5|$|Gascoigne {{was then}} given a {{significant}} opportunity {{that became the}} focus of the remainder of his paid academic career: to help establish one of the world's largest optical telescopes, at Siding Spring. In the early 1960s, the Australian and British governments proposed a partnership to build a joint optical telescope facility, and Gascoigne was among the experts involved. Former Mount Stromlo director and now head of the Greenwich observatory, Richard Woolley, was prominent in supporting the project from the British end. In 1967, the two governments formally agreed to collaborate on the construction of a large telescope, {{to be known as the}} Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Given the existing infrastructure of the ANU's Siding Spring Observatory, the site was readily agreed as the location for the AAT. Gascoigne was one of the four members of the Technical Committee established to guide the telescope's development. He provided <b>leadership</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> design and optics of the new telescope, and was made the chief commissioning astronomer in 1974.|$|E

5|$|When the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I succeeded to {{the throne}} there were changes in the <b>leadership</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Wight and the castle. Worsley was {{dismissed}} in favour of a Roman Catholic appointee in 1553 and Udall was executed in 1555 {{for his role in}} the Dudley conspiracy to overthrow the Queen. When the Protestant Elizabeth I came {{to the throne}} in 1558, however, peace was made with France and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to England. Elizabeth reappointed Worsley to his post and he carried out an extensive redevelopment of the castle. Worsley filled in half of the castle's courtyard to produce a solid artillery platform able to hold eight heavy guns with an uninterrupted field of fire over the sea, and he probably also constructed the Master Gunner's House on the other side of the castle. Nonetheless, an inspection in 1586 showed that the fortification was in poor condition. Work costing £50 was done in 1587, including the erection of an earth bulwark alongside the castle to mount additional guns. The next year saw the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish Armada, after which further repairs were carried out on the castle. By 1599 the Crown was informed that the castle, which was still considered an important defence for the Solent, needed expensive repairs.|$|E

25|$|The First Battle of Petersburg {{occurred}} on June 9, 1864, when Maj. Gen.

The Confederates, under the overall command of Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, numbered only 2,500, {{many of whom}} were teenage boys and elderly men. Timid <b>leadership</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of Union Maj. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore and Brig. Gen.

25|$|In 1946, Jean-Félix Tchicaya, grand slayer of Colonialism at the French National Assembly, {{where he}} sits {{throughout}} the fourth Republic, founded his party the PPC.

The latter, right arm of the founder, will be the main animator of the party in Pointe-Noire and Kouilou. He rallies around him, all the railwaymen of the Congo-Ocean Railway. In 1956, he scrambled with his mentor and joined Abbé Youlou to found the UDDIA (Democratic Union for the Defence of African interests). The latter party, by politically mobilizing the Laris (inhabitants of Pool district and Brazzaville), takes political <b>leadership</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PPC and allows Stéphane Tchitchelle to become the first indigenous mayor of Pointe-Noire. He later held several ministerial positions.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 2006, Michael Ignatieff led the {{leadership}} {{candidates on the}} first ballot, garnering 29% support. The subsequent ballots were cast the following day, and Ignatieff managed a small increase, to 31% on the second ballot, good enough to maintain his lead over Bob Rae, who had attracted 24% support, and Stéphane Dion, who garnered 20%. However, due to massive movement towards Stéphane Dion by delegates who supported Gerard Kennedy, Ignatieff dropped to second on the third ballot. Shortly before voting for the third ballot was completed, {{with the realization that}} there was a Dion-Kennedy pact, Ignatieff campaign co-chair Denis Coderre made an appeal to Bob Rae to join forces and prevent Dion from winning the Liberal Party <b>leadership</b> (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis that Stephane Dion's ardent federalism would alienate Quebecers), but Rae turned down the offer and opted to release his delegates.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} {{remained in}} the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony {{was held at the}} airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, {{the first of its kind}} in some thirty years, marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. That the smooth proceedings of this event had been derailed by the student movement embarrassed the <b>leadership</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path. The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the Great Hall of the People amidst the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square. When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told the Soviet leader, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. The statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.|$|E
