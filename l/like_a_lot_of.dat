She felt that the episode had saving graces in a sequence which she felt acted as an homage to films Dead Alive and Evil Dead and the fact it made her believe [...] "that Rhys and Gwen care about each other." [...] Ian Berriman of SFX magazine wrote that the episode {{was one of the}} weakest of the second series and was hampered by [...] "limp gags and thuddingly obvious characterisation". IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode five out of ten and criticised it as [...] "flat out bad television". He felt the comedic style to be at odds with Torchwoods science fiction and horror storytelling and criticised some of the character moments as [...] "preposterous" [...] and [...] "insipid". Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair was more mixed stating that the [...] "episode feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> ideas have been thrown into a pot and mixed with all the Torchwood goodness". He felt that the episode held together [...] "by luck more than skill" [...] but still [...] "provided a lot of laughs and some wild fun". Den of Geek's Andrew Mickel felt that the episode exaggerated and stereotyped the Welsh characters in the overall scenario parodying them collectively as [...] "the Welshest people on television". He also criticised the focus on Gwen and the ridiculousness of her plan to marry Rhys despite her being pregnant. He felt however, that the episode played out [...] "like a fun episode of Buffy" [...] and that Rhys continued to be [...] "Gwen’s one redeeming feature", praising the scenes between him and his mother.|$|E
