40|$|Background Problem {{alcohol use}} is common and {{associated}} with considerable adverse outcomes among patients who attend primary care in Ireland and other European countries for opiate substitution treatment. Aims This paper aims {{to describe the}} development and content of clinical guidelines {{for the management of}} problem alcohol use among this population. Methods The guidelines were developed in three stages: (1) identification of key stakeholders, (2) development of evidence-based draft guidelines, and (3) determination of a modified ‘Delphi-facilitated’ consensus among the group members. Results The guidelines incorporate advice for physicians on all aspects of care, including (1) definition of problem <b>lcohol</b> <b>use</b> among problem drug users, (2) alcohol screening, (3) brief intervention, and (4) subsequent management of patients with alcohol dependence. Conclusions Primary care has an important role to play in the care of problem alcohol use among problem drug users, especially opiate substitution patients. Further research on strategies to inform the implementation of these guidelines is a priority...|$|E
40|$|A <b>lcohol</b> <b>use</b> is {{associated}} with tremendous costs to the drinker,those around him or her, and society as a whole. These costsresult from the increased health risks (both physical and mental) associated with alcohol consumption {{as well as from}} the social harms caused by alcohol. This issue of Alcohol Research: Current Reviews examines the public health impact of alcohol consumption, looking at the full burden of disease that can be attributed to drinking. The attempt to measure the impact of alcohol use on various disease categories is relatively new to the alcohol research field. In fact, much of our understanding of how alcohol affects health and disease in society is rooted in work from the 1980 s and 1990 s. This research reflects a truly international perspective. A group of Australian authors, led by Dr. Dallas English, were some of the first to look at the issues involved in attributing mortality and morbidity to substance abuse (English et al. 1995). Dr. James Shultz and his colleagues conducted other seminal research for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They developed the Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI) software t...|$|E
