50|$|The first {{networks}} in economics were discovered {{prior to the}} development of network science. Károly Polány, Claude Levi-Stratuss or Bronislaw Malinowski studied such tribes where complicated gift exchange mechanisms constructed networks between groups, families or islands. Although modern trade systems differ fundamentally, such systems based on reciprocity can still survive and reciprocity-based or personalised exchange deals persists even when a market would be more efficient. According to Kranton, informal exchange can exist in networks if transactions are more reciprocal than market-based. In this case, market exchange is hard to find and associated with high search costs, therefore yields low utility. Personalised exchange agreements ensure the possibility of <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|E

50|$|Prices of {{polysilicon}} {{are often}} {{divided into two}} categories, contract and spot prices, and higher purity commands higher prices. While in booming installation times, price rally occurs in polysilicon. Not only spot prices surpass contract prices in the market; {{but it is also}} hard to acquire enough polysilicon. Buyers will accept down payment and <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>agreements</b> to acquire a large enough volume of polysilicon. On the contrary, spot prices will be below contract prices once the solar PV installation is in a down trend. In late 2010, booming installation brought up the spot prices of polysilicon. In the first half of 2011, prices of polysilicon kept strong owing to the FIT policies of Italy. The solar PV price survey and market research firm, PVinsights, reported that the prices of polysilicon might be dragged down by lack of installation {{in the second half of}} 2011. As recently as 2008 prices were over $400/kg spiking from levels around $200/kg, while seen falling to $15/kg in 2013.|$|E

5000|$|The {{notion that}} {{regional}} jet aircraft are less expensive (per seat mile) than traditional jets {{is a common}} misconception. On a seat-mile basis the RJ's cost is in fact higher. Regional jets are operated in the USA under a fee-per-departure payment structure. In this payment structure, a traditional airline contracts with a regional airline company on a per departure or per flight basis regardless {{of the number of}} passengers or the length of the flight. The traditional airline gets to keep all the revenue from the ticket sale and only pays the regional partner the agreed to amount. These contracts tend to be <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>agreements,</b> typically 10 year terms. The regional airline partner can then be relatively sure of the revenue side and only has to control cost in order to earn a modest return. However, these [...] "regional airlines," [...] now really [...] "small jet providers" [...] of contracted aircraft, have been squeezed by U.S. airline bankruptcies, fleet reductions and increasing operating costs. U.S. Legacy carriers have no longer been willing to shoulder burdensome losses from guaranteed-profit contracts with their small jet providers, and accordingly have played carrier against carrier in a low-bid game that has left hundreds of RJs idle and others potentially on their way to being laid up.|$|E

In March 2009 SensorDynamics launched MEMS gyroscopes for industrial, medical and consumer applications. In November 2009 Chipworks selected SensorDynamics' MEMS product SD755 as product of the year 2009. In November 2010 SensorDynamics announced XY angular rate and an XYZ angular rate devices in 6x6x1.8 mm3 QFN40-packages.

40|$|Abstract. Checking {{whether the}} agreed service quality {{attributes}} are fulfilled or maintained during the service life-cycle {{is a very}} important task for SLA (Service Level Agreement) enforcement. In this paper, we leverage conformance checking techniques developed for computational services to automate the conformity checking of transport & logistics services. Our solution extends the WS-Agreement metamodel to support the definition of frame and specific SLAs. With this extension, we define a new validation operation for the conformity check of transport & logistics SLAs based on CSPs solvers. The key contribution of our work is that, as far as we know, it is the first definition of an automated conformity check solution for <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>agreements</b> in the transport & logistics domain. Nonetheless, other domains in which similar SLAs are defined can also benefit from our solution. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{one aspect of}} {{long-term}} labor contracts [...] employer-provided pensions [...] {{in order to develop}} {{a better understanding of how}} such contracts affect employment patterns of older workers. Pensions are one of the few elements of the employment package which explicitly describe <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>agreements</b> between workers and their employers; consequently they offer a unique opportunity to study these agreements. The present paper combines labor supply and contract theory to examine pension responses to changes in taxes, Social Security benefits, and the federal government's recent decision to lift the age of mandatory retirement. Evidence on a longitudinal sample of pension plans from 1960 to the present suggests:(1) During the 1960 - 70 period, Social Security increases generated changes in pensions favoring early retirement; and (2) During the 1970 - 80 period, some plans reduced private pension benefits in response to the raising of the mandatory retirement age. ...|$|E
