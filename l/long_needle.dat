500|$|After Kamo {{was arrested}} in Berlin and {{awaiting}} trial, he received a note from Krasin through his lawyer Oscar Kohn telling him to feign insanity {{so that he would}} be declared unfit to stand trial. To demonstrate his insanity, he refused food, tore his clothes, tore out his hair, attempted to hang himself, slashed his wrists, and ate his own excrement. To make sure that he was not faking his condition, German doctors stuck pins under his nails, struck him in the back with a <b>long</b> <b>needle,</b> and burned him with hot irons, but he did not break his act. After all of these tests, the chief doctor of the Berlin asylum wrote in June 1909 that [...] "there is no foundation to the belief that [...] is feigning insanity. [...] He is without doubt mentally ill, is incapable of appearing before a court, or of serving sentence. It is extremely doubtful that he can completely recover." ...|$|E

He was playing at 'puff the dart,' which is played with a <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> inserted in some worsted, and blown at a target through a tin tube. He placed the needle at {{the wrong end of}} the tube, and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force, drew the needle into his throat. It entered the lungs, and in a few days killed him." ...|$|E

'I {{am sorry}} to tell you, because I know it will be so disheartening after my last letter, that I am not so well as I was then, and {{that there has been}} a sort of hitch in the proceedings. After I had been treated for {{rheumatism}} a few days longer (in which treatment they pricked the place with a <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> several times,) I saw that Dr. Chestman was in doubt about something, and I requested that he would call in a brother professional man to see me as well. They consulted together and then told me that rheumatism was not the disease after all, but erysipelas. They then began treating it differently, as became a different matter. Blisters, flour, and starch, seem to be the order of the day now--medicine, of course, besides.|$|E

60|$|Godfrey did so, {{and then}} {{shut his eyes}} as he saw the doctor about to use the knife, expecting to hear a {{piercing}} scream from the child. There was no sound, however, and in a very few seconds he heard Alexis utter a low exclamation of satisfaction. He looked now; the flesh was already cut through and no cry had escaped the child. Another moment the foot and the lower portion of the leg came away {{at the point where the}} bone was crushed; then Alexis pushed the flesh upwards so as to expose another inch of the shin-bone, and then took the saw and cut through it. Some strands of silk lay close to his hand; with a <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> he took up the ends of the arteries and tied them with the silk; then he took hold of the stick of the tourniquet and loosened it a little. The result was satisfactory; the arteries were securely tied. Then he tightened it again and gave it to the Buriat to hold, wiped the wound with the damp rag, drew down the flesh over the end of the bone, brought up the flap of flesh from behind, and with a few stitches sewed it in its place.|$|E

50|$|The first {{types of}} needle-gun made by Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse were muzzle-loading, the novelty {{lying in the}} <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> driven by a coiled conchoidal spring which fired the {{internal}} percussion cap {{on the base of}} the sabot. It was his adoption of the bolt-action breechloading principle combined with this igniter system which gave the rifle its military potential, allowing a much faster rate of fire.|$|E

40|$|Container {{designed}} for safe retention of discarded blood-collecting hypodermic needles and similar sharp objects used in life-science experiments aboard spacecraft. Needles inserted through self-closing lid and retained magnetically. They are inserted, sharp end first, through spring-loaded flap. <b>Long</b> <b>needles</b> and needles on syringes cannot turn around in container. Can be emptied, cleaned, and reused. Used on Earth to provide unusually secure containment of sharp objects...|$|R
50|$|Wide-bore needles {{of similar}} gauge are often used. Unlike hypodermic-type needles {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} chemistry laboratory, these needles tend to be reused due to cost. <b>Long</b> <b>needles</b> may be flexible enough to be bent in U-shapes; shorter needles often are not.|$|R
5000|$|A 25 to 31 gauge thick, 3/8" [...] to 1" [...] <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> can be used. The size is {{determined}} by the amount of subcutaneous tissue present, which is based on patient build. The 3/8" [...] and 5/8" [...] needles are most commonly used. Usually, no more than 1 mL of solution is given, compared to intradermal injections, where no more than 0.5 mL is usually given.|$|E
5000|$|The cloak {{was entirely}} hand made, and sewn with a <b>long</b> <b>needle.</b> Four yards of heavy black cloth (melton) {{went into the}} making and the {{trimmings}} included satin for lining, jet and beaded braid. Fastened by a single hook and eye near the neck, {{the folds of the}} garment were relieved by a pair of mock pockets faced with jet, which covered the hand slits.|$|E
50|$|A thin, <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> {{is driven}} into the wood. The {{electric}} power consumption of the drilling device is measured, recorded and printed. Resistograph devices are different from other resistance drills because they provide a high linear correlation between the measured values and {{the density of the}} penetrated wood. They are used for inspecting trees and timber in order to find internal defects, and to determine wood density and growth rates.|$|E

Reports of pressure or intense heat being experienced within {{one or both}} ears {{are the most common}} given during the hypnotic retrieval of memories. Experiencers have compared these sensations to the insertions of <b>long</b> <b>needles</b> and to having a high powered laser aimed into the ear.|$|R
50|$|Used with a <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> or cannula, {{syringes}} {{are also}} useful for transferring fluids through rubber septa when atmospheric oxygen or moisture are being excluded. Examples include {{the transfer of}} air-sensitive or pyrophoric reagents such as phenylmagnesium bromide and n-butyllithium respectively. Glass syringes are also used to inject small samples for gas chromatography (1 μl) and mass spectrometry (10 μl). Syringe drivers may be used with the syringe as well.|$|E
5000|$|The {{algorithm}} performs {{best with}} <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> strings, when it consistently hits a non-matching character {{at or near}} the final byte of the current position in the haystack and the final byte of the needle does not occur elsewhere within the needle. For instance a 32 byte needle ending in [...] "z" [...] searching through a 255 byte haystack which does not have a 'z' byte in it would take up to 224 byte comparisons.|$|E
50|$|The first {{practical}} {{solution for the}} problem of handling percussion caps in battle was the Prussian 1841 (Dreyse needle gun), which used a <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> to penetrate a paper cartridge filled with black powder and strike the percussion cap that was fastened {{to the base of}} the bullet. While it had a number of problems, it was widely used by the Prussians and other German states in the mid-nineteenth century and was a major factor in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War.|$|E

5000|$|The tree's {{extremely}} <b>long</b> <b>needles</b> make {{a significant}} contribution to the islands water supply, trapping large amounts of condensation from the moist air coming off the Atlantic with the prevailing north eastern wind (locally called [...] "alisios"). The condensation then drops to the ground and is quickly absorbed by the soil, eventually percolating down to the underground aquifers.|$|R
50|$|Example: A {{task is to}} sew a patch onto a pair of jeans. The best needle to do the {{threading}} is a 4 inch <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> with a 3 millimeter eye. This needle {{is hidden}} in a haystack along with 1000 other needles varying in size from 1 inch to 6 inches. Satisficing claims that the first needle that can sew on the patch {{is the one that}} should be used. Spending time searching for that one specific needle in the haystack is a waste of energy and resources.|$|E
50|$|Amniotic fluid {{is removed}} from the mother by an {{amniocentesis}} procedure, where a <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> is inserted through the abdomen into the amniotic sac, using ultrasound guidance such that the fetus is not harmed. Amniocentesis is an abnormal procedure, and is only performed if there is a suspicion of health defects in the fetus, or if an early delivery of the fetus may be necessary, since there can be complications from the procedure. If warranted, fluid is collected between 16-42 weeks of fetal development, and 20-30ml of fluid are removed.|$|E
5000|$|Welles {{thought that}} the film had been cursed. Speaking about the {{production}} in the second episode of his 1955 BBC-TV series Orson Welles' Sketch Book, Welles said that a voodoo doctor who had been preparing a ceremony for It's All True was deeply offended at the film being terminated. Welles found his script pierced completely through with a <b>long</b> <b>needle.</b> [...] "And to the needle was attached a length of red wool. This was {{the mark of the}} voodoo," [...] Welles said. [...] "And the end of that story is that {{it was the end of}} the film. We were never allowed to finish it." ...|$|E

50|$|The first {{settlers}} to Emery {{came from}} Sanpete County, Utah. This is unusually notable as the settlers headed east, instead of west (like most settlers at the time), {{even if it}} was over a mountain range. The first attempt at settlement was made at Muddy Creek, a stream following down a wide canyon, and eventually emptying into the Dirty Devil River. The Muddy Creek vegetation included tall grass, sage, greasewood, rabbit brush, tender shadscale or Castle Valley clover, prickly pear cacti, and yucca. Growing along the creek banks were giant cottonwood trees and patches of huge thorny bushes with <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> sharp spines called bull berry bushes. These berries, when beaten off onto a canvas could be dried, made into jams, jellies, or even eaten raw.|$|E
50|$|In such an incident, {{both the}} warp and the weft of fabric {{may have been}} damaged. Invisible mending is the {{reconstruction}} of both the warp and weft using a <b>long</b> <b>needle.</b> The mender garners the material for the repair by picking all the necessary weft from the hem, and the warp from the extra fabric {{on the inside of}} longitudinal seams. The mender will reconstruct the warp and weft to match the original weave exactly. After this is done and the garment has been pressed, the mended part will be undetectable {{on the outside of the}} fabric, though on the reverse side the restored area will be marked by long hanging threads where the re-weaving was done. These hanging threads occur because (unlike in darning work) invisible mending is done without tacking, in case it deforms the fabric.|$|E
50|$|Aari work {{involves}} a hook, plied {{from the top}} but fed by silk thread from below with the material spread out on a frame. This movement creates loops, and repeats of these lead to a line of chain stitches. The fabric is stretched on a frame and stitching is done with a <b>long</b> <b>needle</b> ending with a hook such as a crewel, tambour (a needle similar to a very fine crochet hook but with a sharp point) or Luneville work. The other hand feeds the thread from the underside, and the hook brings it up, making a chainstitch, but it is much quicker than chainstitch done in the usual way: looks like machine-made and can also be embellished with sequins and beads - which are kept on the right side, and the needle goes inside their holes before plunging below, thus securing them to the fabric.|$|E
50|$|Some {{ornamental}} {{plants are}} grown for showy foliage. Their foliage may be deciduous, turning bright orange, red, and yellow before dropping {{off in the}} fall, or evergreen, in which case it stays green year-round. Some ornamental foliage has a striking appearance created by lacy leaves or <b>long</b> <b>needles,</b> while other ornamentals are grown for distinctively colored leaves, such as silvery-gray ground covers and bright red grasses, among many others.|$|R
