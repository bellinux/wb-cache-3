500|$|The mariachi-influenced [...] "Ciega, Sordomuda" [...] ("Blind, Deaf, and Dumb") was {{performed}} using a Stroh violin, {{which was used}} to replace the horn sections of the original recording. David Hardwick from SpinningPlatters.com said {{the use of the}} instrument was [...] "impressive". She then sang the power ballad [...] "Underneath Your Clothes". A large animated face resembling that of Residente, the lead singer of Puerto Rican band Calle 13, was projected onto the screen behind the stage during the performance of [...] "Gordita" [...] ("Chubby"), a hip hop and rap track in which the artist was featured. The face was used to cover Residente's portions of the song through prerecorded vocals. Shakira then sang the [...] "Sale el Sol," [...] a song which was originally said to be dedicated to Argentine musician Gustavo Cerati, Shakira's close friend and frequent collaborator, who had been in a coma. Shakira then changed into a pair of neon leopard-print pants and performed [...] "Loca" [...] ("Crazy") with more [...] "intricate and urban choreographies". Shakira then <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> howl, signaling the start of the performance of [...] "She Wolf". The performances of [...] "Loca" [...] and [...] "She Wolf" [...] marked the first time back-up dancers were featured in the show. Dave Simpson from The Guardian commented that Shakira was [...] "howling like a banshee" [...] during the performance. The performance of the Middle Eastern music-flavoured [...] "Ojos Así" [...] ("Eyes Like Yours") was the final one on the setlist of the concert. Shakira incorporated belly dancing steps into her choreography during the performance.|$|E

It is not a little to his credit that he performed these rites with so much composure, for almost before he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun to revolve, first slowly, and then rapidly, as if at an insane seance.|$|E
60|$|I saw him--huge, brown, wide, weaving {{after my}} bait. Then he hit {{it with his}} sword. I {{imagined}} I could feel him cut it. Winding in, I found the bait cut off neatly back of the head. While Dan hurried with another bait I watched for the swordfish, and saw {{him back in the}} wake, rather deep. He was following us. It was an intensely exciting moment. I let the bait drift back. Almost at once I felt that peculiar rap at my bait, then another. Somehow I knew he had cut off another flying-fish. I reeled in. He had severed this bait in the middle. Frantically we baited again. I <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> line, and we drifted. Hope was almost gone when there came a swift tug on my line, and then the reel whirred. I thumbed the pad lightly. Dan yelled for me to let him have it. I was all tingling with wonderful thrills. What a magnificent strike! He took line so fast it amazed me.|$|E
500|$|On 14 February 2010, Shakira {{performed}} [...] "She Wolf" [...] and [...] "Give It Up to Me", {{the third}} single off the album, during the halftime of the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. She wore a low-cut leotard and a sparkling fur gilet for the performance. At the 2010 Rock in Rio festival held in Madrid, Spain, Shakira performed [...] "Loba", the Spanish-language {{translation of the}} song. On 10 June, at the 2010 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony, Shakira performed [...] "She Wolf", [...] "Hips Don't Lie", and the official 2010 FIFA World Cup song, [...] "Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)". On 26 June, Shakira performed the song at the Glastonbury Festival, {{which took place in}} Pilton, Somerset. The song was also included on the setlist of The Sun Comes Out World Tour in 2010 and 2011. The tour performance began with Shakira <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> howl and proceeding to dance with two female back-up dancers. The performance marked the first time back-up dancers were featured in the show.

50|$|While Sarah {{is in the}} house, Manny {{talks to}} Sarah's daughter, Chrissy. Expecting her to be impressed, he {{demonstrates}} several of his powers, inadvertently frightening her with his compass-erection, which Hank quickly slaps down. Sarah is alerted by her daughter's crying and calls the police {{at the sight of}} Hank and Manny's once-again inanimate corpse. Hank is soon patched up, but the cops discover the photos of Sarah on his phone and become suspicious. Hank's father also appears, mistaking Manny's corpse for Hank when asked by the paramedics to confirm his identity. After being interviewed by the local television news and deliriously professing on air his gratitude for Manny and his magical powers, Hank runs away with Manny's body. Hank's pursuers discover the structures he built which in actuality seem to be quite close to Sarah's house, {{as if he had been}} there some time instead of journeying through the forest. The police, Sarah, her husband, her daughter, a reporter, a camera man, and Hank's father all follow him to the beach. Cornered, Hank <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> fart as he is taken away by the police. Shortly after, to everyone else's shock, horror, and in Chrissy's case, glee, Manny begins violently farting until he floats back into the ocean and skims quickly away, propelled by his own flatulence, he and Hank sharing one last smile.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the strike}} came, so {{tremendous}} in its energy that it almost pulled {{me from my}} seat; so quick, fierce, bewildering that I {{could think of nothing}} but to hold on. Then the water split with a hissing sound to <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> great tarpon, <b>long</b> as <b>a</b> door, seemingly as wide, who shot up and up into the air. He wagged his head and shook it like a struggling wolf. When he fell back with a heavy splash, a rainbow, exquisitely beautiful and delicate, stood out of the spray, glowed, paled, and faded.|$|R
60|$|This appeal evidently touched Moze, for he barked, {{and plunged}} in. He made the water fly, and when carried off his feet, breasted the current with energy and power. He made shore almost even with me, and wagged his tail. Not to be outdone, Jude, Tige and Don {{followed}} suit, and first {{one and then}} another was swept off his feet and carried downstream. They landed below me. This left Ranger, the pup, alone on the other shore. Of all the pitiful yelps ever uttered by a frightened and lonely puppy, his were the most forlorn I had ever heard. Time after time he plunged in, and with many bitter howls of distress, went back. I kept calling, and at last, hoping to make him come by a show of indifference, I started away. This broke his heart. Putting up his head, he <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> melancholy wail, which for aught I knew {{might have been a}} prayer, and then consigned himself to the yellow current. Ranger swam like a boy learning. He seemed to be afraid to get wet. His forefeet were continually pawing the air in front of his nose. When he struck the swift place, he went downstream like a flash, but still kept swimming valiantly. I tried to follow along the sand-bar, but found it impossible. I encouraged him by yelling. He drifted far below, stranded on an island, crossed it, and plunged in again, to make shore almost out of my sight. And when at last I got to dry sand, there was Ranger, wet and disheveled, but consciously proud and happy.|$|E
5000|$|Each show {{began with}} the {{spectral}} image of the wasp-waisted Vampira gliding through knee-deep fog down a dark corridor toward the viewer. At {{the end of her}} trance-like walk she would suddenly <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> piercing scream as the camera zoomed in on her face. She would then smile and coyly remark, [...] "Screaming relaxes me so." [...] After that Nurmi would sit on a Victorian double-ended sofa decorated with skulls and introduce the movie of the night, sometimes pausing to play with her pet spider Rolo, talk with off-camera ghosts, torment her advertiser, Fletcher Jones, in amusing commercials, or drink a Vampira Cocktail at her poison bar. The show's theme music was from the Adagio movement in Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta by Béla Bartók and excerpts from Uranus from The Planets by Gustav Holst. Nurmi's salary for the show was $75 per week.|$|E

5000|$|On top {{of changes}} in {{available}} ingredients, the 1980s also witnessed a wholescale liberalisation in attitude towards the formerly 'foreign muck' cooking styles and segmentation of lifestyles according to income and socio-economic status. New Zealand had by this time developed a largely distinct cultural outlook away from the British Isles, and this also made foreign cooking styles more acceptable among the general public. The same era also saw the moneyed populations feeling free to openly emulate the luxurious eating and drinking habits of upper and upper middle classes overseas, as the traditional New Zealand preference of egalitarianism, manifested in widespread prejudice against any deviation from lower middle class lifestyles, waned in influence. In the words of New Zealand-based anthropologist David Veart, this period of seachange in New Zealand's culinary culture was akin to [...] "being <b>let</b> <b>out</b> after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> school detention".|$|R
5000|$|Lois {{attends the}} premiere, {{but to her}} surprise, the show is a hit. She then scolds the {{audience}} for applauding the show, claiming that the show {{is an example of}} pure trash. She seemingly embarrasses Peter, but Peter then <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> astonishingly <b>long</b> fart on stage that everyone hears, and they clap again, completely ignoring Lois, and making Peter {{one of the most popular}} people in Quahog. Later, Peter comes back from a celebration party, but thanks Lois for giving him the chance to express himself and making the show possible (as if she had quit to make him popular, though it is clear that she did this to get him humiliated). Lois, feeling a bit guilty for the way she acted, admits she was not supportive of Peter's work, and also admits that the show must have been good in the way that people found it entertaining. Peter is touched by her words and promises to get her the job as director again next year, then immediately asks, [...] "Hey, were you there when I farted?" ...|$|R
50|$|Back in {{the gorilla}} troop's nesting ground, Kala {{continues}} to worry over her son. Just then, one of Tarzan's friends gallops {{up to her}} and alerts her to Tarzan's homecoming and the fact he has apparently taken a mate during his time away. Tarzan happily embraces his friends and family and introduces Jane to Kala, who is overjoyed at her son's choice in a female. Unfortunately, the happy reunion is cut short by Tublat, who is enraged at Tarzan's return. Finally having enough of Tublat's selfish and bullying behavior toward the family, Tarzan challenges him for the right to lead, and willingly forgoes his knife. At first, Tublat dominates the fight with his brute strength, but Tarzan demonstrates quick thinking and catches the tyrant by surprise, bringing Tublat to the flat of his back, defeated. Rather than kill the rogue, Tarzan allows Tublat to live with his humiliation and exiles him from the troop. His long-time enemy defeated, Tarzan ascends to the high rocks overlooking the nesting grounds and beats his chest, <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> loud, <b>long</b> cry of victory (the famous ape man cry). That night, under the stars, Jane and Tarzan admit to their love.|$|R
5000|$|The final Huainanzi {{context is}} a {{well-known}} story about Duke Mu of Qin, Bole, Bole's sons, and Jiufang Gao 九方皋.Duke Mu of Qin addressed Bo Le saying: [...] "You are getting on in years. Is anyone in your family who can take over for you and find me a good steed?" [...] Bo Le replied; [...] "A good horse may be judged by his physique, countenance, sinews, and bones. But in judging the best horse in the world, {{it seems as if}} it is not there at all, as if it has disappeared, as if it had lost its singular identity. A horse like that raises no dust and leaves no tracks. All my sons are lesser talents. They can judge a good horse, but they lack the talent to judge the best horse in the world. However, there is a man who is my porter and firewood gatherer who is called Nine-Cornered Hillock. In judging horses, he is not inferior to my abilities. I respectfully request that you grant him an audience."Duke Mu granted him an audience and commanded him to search out a fine steed. After three months Nine-Cornered Hillock returned and reported: [...] "The horse has been located. It is in Shaqiu." [...] Duke Mu replied: [...] "What kind of horse is it?" [...] "It is a yellow mare," [...] answered Nine-Cornered Hillock. Thereupon Duke Mu sent men to Shaqiu to obtain the horse. The horse, however, {{turned out to be a}} black stallion. Duke Mu was quite displeased. Summoning Bo Le, he inquired of him saying: [...] "What a loss! The man you sent to find me a good steed cannot distinguish the color of one coat from another nor a female from a male, what could he possibly know about horses?" [...] Bo Le <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> sigh and replied: [...] "It always comes to this! This is precisely why he surpasses me by a thousand or ten thousand fold and is infinite in his capabilities. What Hillock observes is dynamism of Heaven. He recognizes the refined essence and discards the dross. He focuses on the internal and disregards the external. He looks at what is to be seen and does not look at what is not to be seen. He scrutinizes what is to be scrutinized and disregards what is not to be scrutinized. It appears that what he has judged is quality more precious than just a horse." [...] The horse arrived and ultimately proved to be an excellent horse. Therefore the Laozi says: [...] "Great straightness is as if bent; great skill is as clumsy." [...] (12, tr. Major et al. 2010:458)The (c. 3rd-4th century CE) Daoist Liezi (tr. Giles 1912:66) repeats this story about Bole recommending Jiufang Gao to Duke Mu. For comparison, [...] "A good horse can be picked out by its general build and appearance. But the superlative horse—one that raises no dust and leaves no tracks—is something evanescent and fleeting, elusive as thin air." ...|$|E
