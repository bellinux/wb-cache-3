Student loans may be offered as part of a total financial aid package that may also include grants, scholarships, and/or work study opportunities.

The loan performance indices estimated reveal that over 75 % of the loans disbursed by AKSALB in the period under review were still held by 59 percent of the loan beneficiaries. This situation {{is an indication of}} high level of loan defaulting among the benefiting farmers. Certain personal and facility factors are estimated to determine the probability of default among the beneficiaries. Notably among these include sex, household size, farm size, loan from other sources, primary occupation of the beneficiary, time lapse between loan application and disbursement, total farm expenditure and duration of the granted loans. With such high level of default, the Board outreach and sustainability capacity is questionable thus putting a caveat on the relevance of the Board as agricultural micro financing institution...|$|R

Century's financing of housing developments is typically early-stage, relatively high risk capital provided to borrowers to acquire property, perform necessary predevelopment studies and analyses, line up construction and permanent capital from public agencies and other private lenders, and acquire needed permits from public agencies. For some developers, Century also provides construction capital. The entitlement and financing process may require two or more years, and Century's loans are usually repaid from the construction or permanent financing the developer acquires from others.|$|R

40|$|Credit markets {{allocate}} {{a limited}} supply of loanable funds among alternative uses. In the process, some firms and invesunents are judged too risky and {{are excluded from}} receiving "affordably priced" credit Other firms may experience credit rationing because of market imperfections. Over the years, a number of Federally <b>sponsored</b> <b>loan</b> programs have evolved to address perceived problems with the credit delivery system. Several Federal programs are targeted at rural firms, in particular, because of their dependence on fairly small, geographically segmented capital markets. This paper examines the use of one Federal program {{in an attempt to}} determine how the delivery mechanism influences credit availability within rural communities. The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), an agency of the U. S. Deparunent of Agriculture, provides credit to farmers and other rural businesses, homeowners, and communities through direct loans and by guaranteeing privately originated loans. The underlying principle guiding FmHA is that the assisted entity must not be able to obtain credit from usual commercial sources at reasonable rates and terms, but is judged economically viable or capable of becoming so in the future. This paper examines FmHA' s farmer loan guarantee program operations during fiscal 1988 in an attempt to determine the characteristics of participating lenders and how lender behavior affects the guaranteed loan programs' impact on local credit markets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As more {{countries}} {{are planning to}} inaugurate or enlarge student loan schemes, much of the debate is over {{the question of the}} optimal form of the repayment obligation: specifically, whether it should be according to a fixed schedule of payments or a percentage or earnings or income. This paper argues that the current fascination with income contingency is frequently based on a set of supposed advantages, some of which are mistakenly attributed to income contingency either out of misunderstanding on the part of advocates or for political purposes of overcoming resistance to the underlying notion not of loans, per se, but of cost-sharing itself. The paper goes on to advocate a hybrid loan scheme, which can offer the best of both forms of repayment obligation. Student loan schemes have become widespread throughout the world; Shen and Ziderman (2007) reported some 75 in 2007. By the term loan scheme, we mean a program, in most cases involving governmental sponsorship, that covers some portion of instructional or student maintenance costs or both and that results in a repayment obligation, whether this obligation is actually called a loan or by some euphemism (such as a graduate tax) and whether the obligation is to a fixed schedule of payments or is expressed as some percentage of the borrower’s future income or earnings. Some schemes are small: severely rationed by limited <b>loan</b> capital, or <b>sponsored</b> only by a single institution or consortium of institutions (generally private), or focused only on low-risk borrowers such as advanced professional students or borrowers who can produce multiple, credit-worthy co-signatories. A few schemes, including several in Africa, are financially fragile and have little record as yet of repayment recovery. The largest schemes, found in advanced industrialized countries like the United States...|$|R
50|$|Students {{often use}} scholarships, student loans, or grants to {{supplement}} their tuition costs, rather than paying all tuition out-of-pocket. Several states offer scholarships that allow students to attend free of tuition or at lower cost, for example the HOPE Scholarship in Georgia and the Bright Futures Scholarship Program in Florida. A considerable number of private liberal arts colleges and universities offer full need-based financial aid, which means that admitted students will only have to {{pay as much as}} their families can afford (based on the university's assessment of their income). This can turn some of the most prestigious institutions into the cheapest options for low-income students. In most cases, the barrier of entry for students who require financial aid is set higher, a practice called need-aware admissions. Universities with exceptionally large endowments may combine need-based financial aid with need-blind admission, in which students who require financial aid have equal chances to those who do not. Financial assistance comes in two primary forms: Grant programs and loan programs. Grant programs consist of money the student receives to pay for higher education that {{does not need to be}} paid back, while loan programs consist of money the student receives to pay for higher education that must be paid back. Public higher education institutions (which are partially funded through state government appropriation) and private higher education institutions (which are funded exclusively through tuition and private donations) offer both grant and loan financial assistance programs. Grants to attend public schools are distributed through federal and state governments, as well as through the schools themselves; grants to attend private schools are distributed through the school itself (independent organizations, such as charities or corporations also offer grants that can be applied to both public and private higher education institutions). Loans can be obtained publicly through government <b>sponsored</b> <b>loan</b> programs or privately through independent lending institutions.|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Over the past few decades, the cost of tuition, room, and board for undergraduate students has increased, {{making it more difficult}} for some students and families to afford the cost of college. While students have historically relied on federal loans and grants and family contributions to pay for college, a growing number have turned to private education loans to help them cover the cost. In 2007 - 08, private loan volume, including private sector and state <b>sponsored</b> <b>loans,</b> totaled $ 19 billion, up from $ 3 billion in 1997 - 98, according to the 2008 College Board report on student aid. Unlike federal loans, private education loans are not guaranteed by the federal government and are typically more costly for students than loans offered through federal programs. Despite their generally higher cost, about 26 percent of students who obtained private education loans in 2007 - 08 did not obtain Federal Stafford loans, and more than one-half of these students did not apply for Federal financial aid, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. In 2007 - 08, 14 percent of undergraduate students obtained private education loans, according to the Institute for College Access and Success, and the average private loan amount was $ 6, 533. This letter discusses GAO's work under the mandated study in section 1122 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (HEOA) directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{to assess the impact of}} private lenders' use of nonindividual factors [...] factors other than the borrower's own credit worthiness, such as the cohort default rate or graduation rate of the school the student attends [...] in making loan decisions. To address the issues raised in the mandate, GAO framed its study around three key questions: (1) What are the key characteristics of private education loan borrowers and the types of schools they attend?; (2) How do lenders use nonindividual factors [...] including cohort default rate, graduation rate, and accreditation [...] in making lending decisions for private education loans?; and (3) What is the impact of using these factors on loan products and rates students pay and their access to loans, by gender, race, income, and institution type?...|$|R
