Outdoor tanks hold turtle species of different ages and include both natural and artificial incubators for turtle eggs. The installation also contains a multipurpose room, gift shop and a cactus garden.

When Pedro Menéndez de Avilés visited in 1566, the Calusa served only fish and oysters to the Spanish. An analysis of faunal remains at one coastal habitation site, the Wightman site (on Sanibel Island), showed that more than 93 percent of the energy (kilocalories) from animals in the diet came from fish and shellfish, less than 6 percent of the energy came from mammals, and less than 1 percent came from birds and reptiles. By contrast, at an inland site, Platt Island, mammals (primarily deer) {{accounted for more than}} 60 percent of the energy from animal meat, while fish provided just under 20 percent.|$|E

50|$|Rainforest areas {{subdivide}} into {{a number}} of types which include perennial tall tree rainforest, semi perennial tall tree rainforest, deciduous medium height tree rainforest, semi deciduous medium height tree rainforest, deciduous low height tree rainforest and semi perennial low height tree rainforest. Away from the coast, these rainforests are interspersed with savannah areas and along the coast are accompanied by areas with sand dunes, mangrove wetlands and estuaries. Species that {{can be found in the}} various rainforests include huapaque, cedar (cedrela Mexicana), pukte (bucida buceras), sapote, dyewood (Haematoxylum campechianum), dzalam (lysiloma bohamensis) and more. It also includes a number of precious tropical hardwoods such as red cedar, mahogany, ciricote (cordia dodecandra) and guayacán (guialum sanctum). Along the coastal areas, palms dominate such as the coconut and royal palm. The main wildlife species in the state are the jaguar, ocelot, puma, deer, wild boar, raccoon, hare, ring-tailed cat and spider monkey. There are many bird species including the chachalaca, ducks, quail, pelican, toucan, buzzard and many more. Reptiles include rattlesnakes, coral snakes, boa constrictors, various species of sea and <b>land</b> <b>turtles,</b> iguanas and crocodiles. While still rich in wildlife, much has been decimated because of agriculture and exploitation of forest resources destroying habitat as well as uncontrolled hunting. Off the coast is most of the state aquatic life including many species of fish, crustaceans and mollusks. Many of these are exploited commercially.|$|E

30|$|For {{individuals}} that remain within a fire perimeter, {{the questions of}} interest are: Do they actively seek refuge, or do they remain in their pre-fire location?

Studies on exposures suggest {{a wide range of}} risk, depending on the location of the refuge and its configuration. Clearly, the outcome for fauna exposed to flames is not in question, with the exception, perhaps, of <b>land</b> <b>turtles.</b> One can imagine increasing vulnerabilities to smoke for fauna occupying deep burrows (gopher tortoises, Guelta and Balbach 2005), tree cavities (red-cockaded woodpeckers [Picoides borealis] and bats; Guelta and Checkai [1997]; Guelta and Balbach [2005]), shallow burrows (Bahama parrots [Amazona leucocephala bahamensis]; O’Brien et al.
