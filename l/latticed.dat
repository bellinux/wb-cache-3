5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{a species}} of fungus in the stinkhorn family, and the type species of the genus Clathrus. It is {{commonly}} known as the <b>latticed</b> stinkhorn, the basket stinkhorn, or the red cage, alluding to the striking fruit bodies that are shaped somewhat like a round or oval hollow sphere with interlaced or <b>latticed</b> branches. The fungus is saprobic, feeding off decaying woody plant material, and is often found alone or in groups in leaf litter on garden soil, grassy places, or on woodchip garden mulches. Although considered primarily a European species, C.ruber has been introduced to other areas, and now has a wide distribution that includes northern Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America. The species was illustrated in the scientific literature during the 16th century, but was not officially described until 1729.|$|E
5|$|The fort complex, {{accessed}} from an arched causeway, {{leads to}} a large gateway followed by a large quadrangular open space which is surrounded by palaces such as Raja Mahal or Raja Mandir, Sheesh Mahal, Jahangir Mahal, a temple, gardens and pavilions. The fort walls have battlements, which have ornamentation. Notable architectural features seen in the fort complex consist of projected balconies, open flat areas and decorated <b>latticed</b> windows.|$|E
5|$|The Hachisuka scroll {{contains}} paintings {{which are}} not associated with any text sections of the scroll. The fifth painting of the scroll corresponds to a scene described in the second text section of the Hinohara scroll, where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed tsumado (hinged plank door) and shitomido (<b>latticed</b> shutters). Next to her is an old-fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick {{on top of it}} (tōdai).|$|E
5|$|There are {{grotesque}} {{figures of}} vetalas (ghosts) on the pilasters of jaga mohan {{and on the}} faces of vimana of the temple. The figures of nagas (snake-man) and their female counterparts nagins and other females show many graceful but chaste poses. Pilgrimage is the theme of many of the scenes on the vimana. The other notable descriptive representation on the vimana is the hunting scene above the central niche on the south side, where stags are depicted running away from a hunter. On the outermost frame around the <b>latticed</b> window of the jaganamohana, delightful scenes of monkeys playing all manners of pranks are depicted. The vimana of the temple is a triratha with a distant semblance of a Pancharatha as evident from the projecting niches flanking the central projection. The bada of the vimana abruptly starts from the talapatna or pavement which consists of three elements instead of the usual five and encloses a parallelepiped instead of the usual cubic sanctum.|$|E
25|$|The Brontё biographer Winifred Gérin {{believed}} that the original of Wildfell Hall was Ponden Hall, a farmhouse near Stanbury in West Yorkshire. Ponden shares certain architectural details with Wildfell, including <b>latticed</b> windows and a central portico with a date plaque above.|$|E
25|$|Pressed pu'er {{is removed}} from the cloth bag and placed on <b>latticed</b> shelves, where they are allowed to air dry, which may take several weeks or months, {{depending}} on the wetness of the pressed cakes. The pu'er cakes are then individually wrapped by hand, and packed.|$|E
25|$|In the Haeckel’s work, Collodaria {{was named}} {{the first order of}} Radiolaria, and defined as “Spumellaria without <b>latticed</b> shell.” This {{definition}} of Collodaria was further expanded to include organisms that either completely lack the skeleton or have numerous spicules that loosely scatter throughout the calymma around the central capsule. In recent literature, the definition of Collodaria has been altered with molecular phylogenetic characteristics. In Haeckel’s phylogeny, the second order in Radiolaria, Sphaerellaria, includes all Radiolaria with any trace of <b>latticed</b> or fenestrated shell. In the last decade, Radiolarians are reclassified in five taxonomic orders as characterized by the composition and morphology of the mineral skeletons which include Acantharia with strontium sulphate skeleton, Taxopodida with silica skeleton, Collodaria, Nassellaria and Spumellaria with polycystine silica skeleton. Hence, in the current classification Collodaria now has four sister orders instead of having one sister order as in Haeckel’s original tree. Collodaria, Nassellaria and Spumellaria are sometimes called the Polycystines for their shared skeleton composition character.|$|E
25|$|Ganesh Pol, or the Ganesh Gate, {{named after}} the Hindu god Lord Ganesh, who removes all {{obstacles}} in life, is the entry into the private palaces of the Maharajas. It is a three-level structure with many frescoes that was also built at the orders of the Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1621–1627). Above this gate is the Suhag Mandir where ladies {{of the royal family}} used to watch functions held in the Diwan-i-Aam through <b>latticed</b> windows.|$|E
25|$|Pomeranian rural {{economy was}} based on small, open settlements. Their {{livestock}} included horses and many dogs. Plowing was done with all wooden (bare) spatula-plows, which required multiple runs. The Pomeranians cultivated several different grains and practiced fishery. Bronze and iron processing became very highly developed. Of the weapons, tools, decorative items and jewelry manufactured, the large bronze necklaces made of many rings, running around the neck and upper chest area, connected by a <b>latticed</b> buckle in the back (600–450 BC) are especially impressive. Advanced bronze metallurgy facilities were found at Juszkowo near Pruszcz Gdański. At Pruszcz itself an amber processing workshop was found – the material used was imported from Sambia. At the iron works material obtained from the local ore deposits (Góry Świętokrzyskie) was most likely used. Another highly developed craft was pottery, which found its highest expression in the above described face-urns.|$|E

500|$|Tafl {{games are}} {{a family of}} ancient Germanic and Celtic {{strategy}} board games played on a checkered or <b>latticed</b> gameboard with two armies of uneven numbers, representing variants of an early Scandinavian board game called tafl or hnefatafl in contemporary literature.|$|E
500|$|The jagamohana is {{rectangular}} {{in shape}} and has a two-element sloping roof with clerestory windows between them. The jagamohana [...] measures [...] from the inside and [...] from the outside. The <b>latticed</b> windows are classified as pata jali where perforations are square or rectangular in shape. In addition, there are trellised windows with slabs of stone sculptures depicting dancers and musicians. Light enters the interior through doors and the <b>latticed</b> windows. The junction of the vimana and the jagmohana is not cleanly built, leading some scholars to postulate that the porch was added at a much later date; however, the primitive connection is attributed to the building technique. The temple was constructed by burying completed portions in inclined layers of earth up which heavy pieces of stone were dragged.|$|E

Bathrooms and shower bathrooms are fitted with hot and cold showers that are controlled from the lavatory. The laundry is [...] with copper and tubs; the laundry also has a heater that supplies the whole building with hot water. The block which contains the sanitary requirements for the building is connected by a covered way and is well ventilated by air shafts, <b>latticed</b> doors, and louvres. Underground, a brick, cemented tank was built to collect and store rainwater.|$|E
500|$|Lysurus periphragmoides, {{commonly}} known as the stalked lattice stinkhorn or chambered stinkhorn, is a species of fungus in the stinkhorn family. It was originally described as Simblum periphragmoides in 1831, and has been known as many different names before being transferred to Lysurus in 1980. The saprobic fungus has a pantropical distribution, and has been found in Africa, Asia, Australasia, and the Americas, where it grows on fertile ground and on mulch. The fruit body, which can extend up to [...] tall, consists of a reddish <b>latticed</b> head (a receptaculum) placed on top of a long stalk. A dark olive-green spore mass, the gleba, fills the interior of the lattice and extends outwards between the arms. Like other members of the Phallaceae family, the gleba has a [...] odor that attracts flies and other insects to help disperse its spores. The immature [...] "egg" [...] form of the fungus is considered edible.|$|E
500|$|In September 1893, a major theft at the Philadelphia Mint {{had been}} discovered. [...] Henry Cochran, {{weighing}} clerk, had been surreptitiously extracting gold bars from a vault sealed in 1887, {{not with a}} solid door but with a <b>latticed</b> one that was somewhat loose. [...] Bosbyshell, in taking custody of the Philadelphia Mint's assets from his predecessor, Daniel Fox, had not asked for the gold to be weighed. [...] When the gold was taken out to be converted into coin in 1893, the shortage was discovered. [...] Although some of the gold was recovered, {{there was still a}} shortage of $12,810.82, and the government brought suit against Bosbyshell after he left office in 1894, securing judgment against him and the sureties on his bond. [...] Bosbyshell appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which ruled against him. [...] The district court had ruled for Bosbyshell on the matter of 733 silver dollars said to be missing, leaving only the question of the gold. [...] Bosbyshell asked for review by the Supreme Court, but also sought legislative relief, and on February 2, 1899, Congress absolved him of the debt, making the court case moot.|$|E
500|$|The egg {{eventually}} ruptures as {{the stalk}} expands and breaks through, creating a volva {{at the base}} of the stipe. In maturity, the fruit bodies, are up to [...] tall, with a <b>latticed</b> spherical cap (the receptaculum) atop a long yellow or reddish stipe. In general, Old World specimens tend to be yellow, while New World specimens are reddish, although exceptions have been noted in the literature. The receptaculum is typically [...] in diameter and forms a red or orange lattice, or mesh. There are typically between 20 and 100 small pentagonal to hexagonal meshes in the receptaculum; the arms of the mesh have sharp ridges on the outer surface, [...] on the sides, and are flat to weakly ridged on the inner surface. The internal surfaces of the receptaculum are covered with an olive-green spore-bearing gleba, which sometimes seeps through the mesh holes. Like most stinkhorn species, the gleba has a foul odor, comparable to rotten meat, but it is [...] "less-offensive" [...] than most. The smell of fresh, newly exposed gleba has been reported to be sweet, similar to amyl acetate; the foul odor forming only after it has been exposed to air for some time. The stipe is [...] by [...] thick, and is hollow and spongy. The walls of the stipe are made of an inner layer of large tubes and two or three outer layers of small tubes. Specimens may occasionally be found with fused heads on two separate stipes arising from a single volva.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} was also Japanese-influenced. The hall's {{walls and ceiling}} were paneled in dark, mahogany coffering, with a narrow, <b>latticed</b> stair {{in the center of}} the room rising steeply like a ship's gangway. Surrounding this are blue-and-white, Delft-tile murals and a Jacobean chimneypiece [...] gifts from the Queen of the Netherlands, in gratitude for one of Griscom's ships helping to rescue a Dutch ship that was sinking. The hall's ceiling has a large rectangular cut-out, framed by a <b>latticed</b> railing, that allows natural light to stream down from second-story windows.|$|E

2500|$|A yett (from the Old English and Scots {{language}} {{word for}} [...] "gate") is a gate or grille of <b>latticed</b> wrought iron bars used for defensive purposes in castles and tower houses.

"If Fieldhead had {{few other}} merits as a building, it might {{at least be}} termed picturesque: its {{irregular}} architecture, and the grey and mossy colouring communicated by time, gave it a just claim to this epithet. The old <b>latticed</b> windows, the stone porch, the walls, the roof, the chimney-stacks, were rich in crayon touches and sepia lights and shades. The trees behind were fine, bold, and spreading; the cedar on the lawn in front was grand, and the granite urns on the garden wall, the fretted arch of the gateway, were, for an artist, as the very desire of the eye."

2500|$|The 16th-century forework, or [...] "spur", which {{provides}} additional {{protection for the}} main gate, is largely the work of Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, and contains numerous defensive features. Originally a rock ditch ran {{in front of the}} entrance, and was crossed by a drawbridge. The original 1693 yett, a <b>latticed</b> iron gate, is still in place. Once through the entrance, any attacker would have had to negotiate a dog-leg passage, exposing his back to fire from the caponier. Part of this passage was also exposed to attack from the parapet walk on the upper storey. In the late 17th century, the spur was heightened, and gun batteries added above.|$|E
2500|$|The Palace {{is divided}} into four main {{sections}} {{each with its own}} entry gate and courtyard. Main entry is through the Suraj Pol (Sun Gate) which leads to Jalebi Chowk, the first main courtyard. This was the place where armies would hold victory parades with their war bounty on their return from battles, which were also witnessed by the Royal family's women folk through the <b>latticed</b> windows. This gate was built exclusively and was provided with guards as it was the main entry into the palace. It faced east towards the rising sun, hence the name [...] "Sun Gate". Royal cavalcades and dignitaries entered the palace through this gate.|$|E
2500|$|Significant {{differences}} {{in the construction of}} the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets belie significant similarities in their designs. The Scandinavian helmets that are capable of restoration were constructed more simply than the Sutton Hoo helmet. None has a face mask, solid neck guard, or cap made from one piece of metal, and only two have distinct cheek guards. The neck guards [...] "seem without exception to have [...] either iron strips or protective mail curtains." [...] The helmets from Ultuna, Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 all used iron strips as neck protection; five strips hung from the rear of the Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 brow bands, and though only two strips survive from the Ultuna helmet, others would have hung alongside them. Camail was used on the remaining helmets, from Valsgärde 6, 7 and 8, and from Vendel 1 and 12. Fragmentary remains from Vendel 10 and 11, and from Solberga, likewise suggest camail. In terms of cheek protection, only two helmets had something other than continuations of the camail or iron strips used to protect the neck. The Vendel 14 helmet had cheek guards, but of [...] "a differing version well forward on the face" [...] of those on the Sutton Hoo helmet. Though [...] "difficult to reconstruct," [...] fragments from the Broa helmet suggest a configuration similar to those on the Vendel 14 helmet. Finally, the widely varying caps on each Scandinavian helmet all share one feature: None is similar to the cap on the Sutton Hoo helmet. The basic form of the helmets from Vendel, Valsgärde, Ultuna and Broa all started with a brow band and nose-to-nape band. The Ultuna helmet had its sides filled in with <b>latticed</b> iron strips, while each side on the Valsgärde 8 helmet was filled in with six parallel strips running from the brow band to the nose-to-nape brand. The remaining four helmets—excepting those from Vendel 1 and 10, and Broa, which are too fragmentary to determine their exact construction—all employed two lateral bands and sectional infills. The Vendel 14 helmet had eight infill plates, one rectangular and one triangular per quadrant; that from Valsgärde 7 helmet used four infill plates, one for each quadrant; the one from Valsgärde 6 also used identical infills for each quadrant, but with [...] "elaborate" [...] Y-shaped iron strips creating a <b>latticed</b> effect; and the Valsgärde 5 example filled in the back two quadrants with <b>latticed</b> iron strips, and the front two quadrants each with a rectangular section of lattice work and a triangular plate.|$|E

Additional elements discovered the following year include bracket arms, rainbow beams, rafters and purlins. Traces of red paint on the timbers and fragments of plaster were also uncovered. Further discoveries in 1984 included better-preserved windows and ground plates and pivot blocks for doors.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, the {{old city}} of Peshawar was a heavily guarded citadel that {{consisted}} of high walls. In the 21st century, only remnants of the walls remain, but the houses and havelis continue to be structures of significance. Most of the houses are constructed of unbaked bricks, with the incorporation of wooden structures for protection against earthquakes, with many composed of wooden doors and <b>latticed</b> wooden balconies. Numerous examples of the city's old architecture can still be seen {{in areas such as}} Sethi Mohallah. In {{the old city}}, located in inner-Peshawar, many historic monuments and bazaars exist in the 21st century, including the Mohabbat Khan Mosque, Kotla Mohsin Khan, Chowk Yadgar and the Qissa Khawani Bazaar.
