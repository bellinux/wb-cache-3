50|$|Although {{the design}} {{engineer}} {{can use the}} material {{of his or her}} own choice, the normal selection is SA516 Grade 70 PVQ (Pressure Vessel Quality) carbon steel. This steel is particularly well suited for use in pressure vessels by virtue of having an exceptional spread between its comparatively <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> of 38 ksi and its tensile strength of 70 to 90 ksi. Elongation in 2 in plate is 21%. This means that the metal stretches considerably under over-stress before failing. In the event of excessive pressure, parts will deform before breaking, causing a gradual rather than a catastrophic loss of sealing. This loss of pressure then acts to relieve the critical overload on the pressure vessel structure. This failure mode presumes the absence of significant cracks in the over-stressed metal.|$|E
50|$|The {{morphology}} of {{lava flows}} can indicate {{properties of the}} lava when molten, such as its rheology and flow volume. Together, these properties can provide clues to the lava’s composition and eruption rates. For example, lava tubes on Earth only form in lavas of basaltic composition. Silica-rich lavas such as andesite are too viscous for tubes to form. Early quantitative analysis of Alba's lava flows indicated that the lavas had <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> and viscosity and were erupted at very high rates. Alba's unusually low profile suggested to some that extremely fluid lavas {{were involved in the}} volcano's construction, perhaps komatiites, which are primitive ultramafic lavas that form at very high temperatures. However, more recent work on the tube- and channel-fed flows indicates lava viscosities within the range of typical basalts (between 100 and 1 million Pa s−1). Calculated flow rates are also lower than originally thought, ranging from 10 to 1.3 million m3 per second. The lower range of eruption rates for Alba Mons is within therange of the highest terrestrial volcanic flows, such as the 1984 Mauna Loa, North Queensland (McBride Province), and the Columbia River basalts. The highest range is several orders of magnitude higher than the effusive rates for any terrestrial volcano.|$|E

The effect of alloying on the aqueous corrosion and mechanical behaviour of iron aluminides has been examined. It was found that the corrosion behaviour of intermetallic FeaAI- 5 M (M =Cr, Me, Ta and Ti) was superior compared to that of binary FeaAI in electrolytes of pH 4 (H 2 SO 4) and pH 8 (NaOH). The relative corrosion behaviour of these intermetallics in these electrolytes was comparable. The possible reasons for passivity enhancement have been discussed. FeaAI- 5 M 1 (M 1 = Me, Ta, V, Nb and Si) intermetallics could not be processed thermomechanically at 1000 ~ because they cracked during deformation processing.

The basic principle of strain-hardening for austenitic stainless steel pressure vessels and two common models of strain hardening, including Avesta Model for ambient temperature and Ardeform Model for cryogenic temperature, were briefly introduced. However, it was fully established by experiments, the lack of a necessary theoretical foundation and the safety concern affect its widespread use. In this study, we investigated the load carrying capacity of strain-hardening austenitic stainless steel pressure vessels under hydrostatic pressure, based on the elastic-plastic theory. To understand the effects of strain hardening on material behavior, the plastic instability loads of a round tensile bar specimen were also derived under two different loading paths and validated by experiments. The results of theoretical, experimental and finite element analyses illustrated, considering the effect of material strain hardening and structural deformation, at ambient temperature, the static load carrying capacity of pressure vessels does not relate to the loading paths. To calculate the plastic instability pressures, a method was proposed so that the original dimension and original material parameters prior to strain hardening can be used either by the theoretical formula or finite element analysis. The safety margin of austenitic stainless steel pressure vessels under various strain hardening degrees was quantitatively analyzed by experiments and finite element method.

40|$|Abstract. Combining {{the loading}} {{conditions}} {{of two different}} classes of forming operations, in sheet bulk metal forming processes, contact pressures ranging from a few hundred MPa up to loads exceeding 2, 500 MPa are experienced. With the additional need for an enhanced control of the material flow, which is best implemented by locally adapted frictional properties of the contact tool/workpiece, sheet bulk metal forming represents a challenge to tribology. As a consequence, {{the evaluation of the}} friction and wear properties of different surface modifications and lubricants within a variety of loading conditions is required. The load-scanning test is a universal tribological model test. Its most distinctive feature is the ability to assess the friction and wear behaviour of a tribological pairing within a whole range of contact loads in a single test run. The simple and quick test method also allows the investigation of plastic contacts. Due to these features, the load-scanning test is of particular interest with regard to the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the application potentials and limits of use of tribological measures intended for sheet bulk metal forming. Like any model test, the load-scanning test has also specific drawbacks. In some test setups, the stress distribution in the contact area may be non-uniform. Further, the maximum realizable contact pressure may be limited by <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> of the tested materials in combination with the insufficient flow restriction of the contact geometry and/or the moderate machine force.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose and investigate a new replaceable hysteretic damper having a basic form of the art of building, minimally architecturally invasive, consisting of two or more dissipative steel columns directly connected to two consecutive floors linked to each other with X-shaped low/mild steel plates. The proposed Dissipative Column (DC) models are shown in Fig. 1 for two different end cases (models A, B). The elements can be considered as a sort of framed bi-pendulum, connected in parallel to the primary structure, able to react to the story drift D with a lateral force QD adding stiffness, strength and damping. The design concept of the DC element aims to obtain a lever mechanism by which a small inter-storey drift provides an amplified vertical drift in the Xplate ends reacting with shear forces, (Fig. 1 c)). X-shaped steel plates made of mild or <b>Low</b> <b>Yielding</b> <b>Strength</b> (LYS) steel [4] are also used as shear links between coupled elements. The top ends of two models are linked to upper floor through slotted bolted connections to allow vertical displacements. By yielding a large volume of steel, the shear devices dissipate substantial input energy under earthquake or strong wind also increasing damping in the entire system. The great advantages of DC elements, if compared with classical dissipative brace, are the reduced architectural invasiveness so that they are able to be integrated in any building, the ease of installation everywhere, their replacement after earthquakes and the stable behavior in cyclic reversal deformation.

The results of sample for different times in laboratory experiments were compared with production samples. The results for these experiments showed that at lower heating rates (12 °C/h) recrystallization occurred at a lower annealing temperature. This effect is attributable to the longer time available to initiate nucleation at the lowest heating rate. However, for all three heating rates (12 °C/h, 24 °C/h and 36 °C/h), the aluminium and nitrogen combine to form atmospheres or pre-precipitation clusters at polygonized subgrains and as rolled boundaries, modiflying {{the development of the}} recrystallized structure. Different amounts of AIN were precipitated prior to recrystallization for each heating rate resulting in different final recrystallized grain sizes, mechanical properties and drawabilities. The heating rate strongly influences recrystallization with a lower heating rate reducing both the temperature of the start of recrystallization and the recrystallized grain size. It is inferred that the lower rate promotes nucleation of recrystallization over growth of recrystallized. The effect of holding time on mechanical properties was to : (i) decrease tensile <b>strength,</b> <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> and hardness and (ii) increase elongation and grain size.
