25|$|The record-breaking XB-42 {{prototype}} {{had been}} destroyed in a crash at Bolling Field. The second of two prototypes of the Douglas XB-42, 43-50225, on a routine flight out of Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., suffered in short order, a <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extension</b> problem, failure of the port engine, and as coolant temperatures rose, failure of the starboard engine. Maj. Hayduck bailed out at 1,200 feet, Lt. Col. Haney at 800 feet, and pilot Lt. Col. (later Major General) Fred J. Ascani, after crawling aft to jettison the pusher propellers, at 400 feet â€“ all three survived. The aircraft crashed at Oxen Hill, Maryland. Classified jettisonable propeller technology caused a problem for authorities in explaining what witnesses on the ground thought was the aircraft exploding. Possible fuel management problems were speculated, but this hypothesis was never proven by subsequent investigation. The remaining prototype was used in flight test programs, including fulfilling a December 1943 proposal by Douglas to fit uprated engines and underwing Westinghouse 19XB-2A axial-flow turbojets of 1,600lbf (7.1kN) thrust each, making it the XB-42A.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the design, development, test, {{and evaluation of}} a prototype Extended Nose <b>Landing</b> <b>Gear</b> (ENLG) for NASA's Space Shuttle orbiters. The ENLG is a proposed orbiter modification developed in-house at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) by a joint government/industry team. It increases the orbiter's nose <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> (NLG) length, thereby changing the vehicle's angle of attack during rollout, which lowers the aerodynamic forces on the vehicle. This, in combination with a dynamic elevon change, will lower the loads on the orbiter's main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> (MLG). The <b>extension</b> is accomplished by adding a telescoping section to the current NLG strut that will be pneumatically extended during NLG deployment...|$|R

50|$|September 21, 1992 KORL, CESSNA 210L, N2013S, Injuries: 1 Uninjured: Pilot {{stated that}} while {{attempting}} to extend the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> the gear hydraulic motor operated but the gear did not extend. After several seconds of gear motor operation the circuit breaker for the gear motor popped. Further attempts to extend the gear by normal and emergency procedures were unsuccessful. A <b>gear</b> up <b>landing</b> was made. After the accident the aircraft was raised and the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was extended by use of the manual <b>gear</b> <b>extension</b> emergency hydraulic pump. According to maintenance personnel a wire to the nose <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> squat switch was chafed and grounded which caused the system to be signaled for gear up at all times. They further stated the pilot could not extend the gear by use of the backup hydraulic pump because the gear down solenoid had overheated during attempts to lower the gear and froze in the gear up position. After the solenoid cooled after landing {{they were able to}} manually lower the gear. Probable cause(s): Undetected chafing and grounding of a wire to the nose <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> squat switch which resulted in the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> being signaled at all times for gear up when electrical power was applied to the system. Contributing to the accident was the overheating of the gear down solenoid which caused it to stick in the gear up position and prevented the gear from being manually extended.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} the Group Design Project (GDP) work and Individual Research Project (IRP) work. The target of this GDP was {{to design a}} long range flying wing passenger aircraft to meet the increasing global aircraft demand. The name of this flying wing aircraft is FW- 11. This is a project cooperated between Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and Cranfield University. The writer {{was involved in the}} conceptual design stage of this project. The author {{was in charge of the}} engine market, engine selection, engine sizing and performance. The target of the IRP is to build a set of health management methods including system real-time monitoring, accurate fault diagnosis and prognosis of major components which are suitable for the aircraft <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extension</b> and retraction control system. These technologies have the capability to improve mission reliability of the aircraft and the maintenance costs could be reduced. Simultaneously, aircraft <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extension</b> and retraction control system, as one of the most important aircraft systems on-board, could directly affect the flight safety. Consequently, diagnostic, prognostic and health management (DPHM) technology is necessary for the system. Based on the FHA, FMEA and FTA of the aircraft <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extension</b> and retraction control system, each of the catastrophic events, all the root causes and their effects were identified. Synchronously, all the components which are related to the catastrophic events were found.

500|$|KAL007 {{had four}} {{redundant}} hydraulic systems of which systems one, two, and three were damaged or destroyed. There {{was no evidence}} of damage to system four. The hydraulics provided actuation for all the primary flight controls; all secondary flight controls except leading edge slats; and <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> retraction, <b>extension,</b> <b>gear</b> steering, and wheel braking. Each primary flight control axis received power from all four hydraulic systems. Upon missile detonation, the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations (yawing) as the dual channel yaw damper was damaged. Yawing would not have occurred if hydraulic systems one or two were fully operational. The result is that the control column did not thrust forward upon impact (it should have done so as the plane was on autopilot) to bring down the plane to its former altitude of [...] This failure of the autopilot to correct the rise in altitude indicates that hydraulic system number three, which operates the autopilot actuator, a system controlling the plane's elevators, was damaged or out. KAL007's airspeed and acceleration rate both began to decrease as the plane began to climb. At twenty seconds after missile detonation a click was heard in the cabin, which is identified as the [...] "automatic pilot disconnect warning" [...] sound. Either the pilot or co-pilot had disconnected the autopilot and was manually thrusting the control column forward in order to bring the plane lower. Though the autopilot had been turned off, manual mode did not begin functioning for another twenty seconds. This failure of the manual system to engage upon command indicates failure in hydraulic systems one and two. With wing flaps up, [...] "control was reduced to the right inboard aileron and the innermost of spoiler section of each side".|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise of aircraft on {{approach has been}} a focus of the aerospace community for many years. The present paper describes a method that predicts the noise from the <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> accounting for local flow variations due to the wing ge-ometry, {{the interaction of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with high-lift devices, and a method for approximating the shielding of noise caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometry. The prediction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise is performed using the <b>Landing</b> <b>Gear</b> Model and Acoustic Pre-diction code (LGMAP) developed at The Pennsylvania State University. A line of sight algorithm based on scattering by a two-dimensional cylinder approximates the effect of acoustic shielding caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> Two-dimensional FLUENT calculations of approximate wing cross-sections are used by LGMAP to compute the noise change due to the change in local flow velocity {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> A three-dimensional immersed boundary CFD calculation of isolated LGMAP representations of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometries provides relatively quick estimates of the mean flow features caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> for the prediction of trailing edge noise associated with the interaction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with the high lift devices.

40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items.

40|$|Recent {{progresses}} of {{the aviation}} industry toward the More Electric Aircraft {{have increased the}} demand for high performance Electro-Mechanical Actuators. In this context, extensive research is being conducted {{for the design of}} high torque density electrical machines able to meet the high reliability standards required. For low-rate duty applications (e. g. <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extension,</b> retraction and steering; flight control surfaces), this can be achieved also by exploiting the characteristic that the motor does not reach a thermal equilibrium. In this work, the principal aim is to investigate the main limits in the design of low-rate duty, high torque density electrical machines and to propose methods for the improvement of the performance and reliability of such machines. This is achieved through detailed analysis of the motor design issues, of its thermal performance, {{as well as of the}} most critical ageing phenomena during operations. A structured design procedure for surface mounted permanent magnet machines is presented. A novel thermal model which features high accuracy and low computational cost is presented. A novel winding insulation lifetime consumption model which relates the winding time to failure to its temperature profile during operations is proposed. As vessel to address the thesisâ€™ objectives, a fault tolerant electrical machine, which is an integral part of an actuator for the extension and retraction of a helicopter landing gear, is designed, built and experimentally tested. The tests are aimed at validating the design procedure and the thermal model accuracy. A series of accelerated ageing tests is conducted on samples of the motor windings, which serve to analyse the insulation degradation processes under different stress levels and to validate the proposed lifetime consumption model...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study of active flow control applied at the engine-wing junction of a generic full scale {{wind tunnel model}} representing a landing configuration to increase the high-lift performance. The use of UHBR (Ultra High Bypass Ratio) engines is currently {{one of the most}} promising approaches to further increase the efficiency of transport aircraft. However their large engine diameter also compromises the aerodynamic efficiency of airliners with engines mounted under backward swept wings. In order to keep a low ground clearance to avoid a heavy <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extension</b> the large UHBR engine nacelles have to be closer coupled to the wing. This prevents the mounting of leading edge high-lift devices at the nacelle-wing junction such as slats, Krueger flaps or droop noses at the junction and leads to a local flow separation on the wing suction side in the wake of the nacelle which may trigger the total wing stall. This reduces the maximum lift coefficient which is a sizing parameter of the high-lift system. In order to reduce the size of the high-lift system and hence increase the overall aircraft efficiency this local flow separation has to be suppressed. Within the European project AfloNext (Active Flow - Loads and Noise control) the use of AFC (Active Flow Control) for the suppression of this flow separation is studied with high-fidelity numerical simulations and experimental studies with a full scale wind tunnel model. At the German Aerospace Center (DLR) numerical studies with steady and pulsed jet blowing are performed to determine working operation parameters of the actuators. In this contribution the first results of this study are presented...|$|E
