5|$|By {{introducing}} {{a distinction between}} diachronic and synchronic analyses of language, he laid {{the foundation of the}} modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing <b>language</b> <b>as</b> an abstract system (langue), from <b>language</b> <b>as</b> a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).|$|E

5|$|Continuity-based {{theories}} {{are held by}} a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see <b>language</b> <b>as</b> being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition, whereas those who see <b>language</b> <b>as</b> a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation. Other continuity-based models see <b>language</b> <b>as</b> having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen. Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years and that: Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|In the {{conclusion}} of his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified by experience, and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious <b>language</b> <b>as</b> unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it.|$|E
5|$|Scholars however concur {{that the}} rulers of the {{imperial}} dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the Kannada <b>language</b> <b>as</b> important as Sanskrit. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use both Kannada and Sanskrit (historians Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben claim they are mostly in Kannada), and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages. The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty. Though these Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas, they were conversant in a northern Deccan <b>language</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
2500|$|Often, the European {{words on}} which Interlingua is based gain {{extensive}} currency in non-Western languages.

5|$|While {{some see}} {{speaking}} their native <b>language</b> <b>as</b> {{an important part}} of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by Alexander Stubb MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from €118,000 per day (for 21 languages then—Romanian, Bulgarian and Croatian having not yet been included) to €8,900 per day. Some see the ideal single <b>language</b> <b>as</b> being English due to its widespread usage, although there has been a small-scale campaign to make French the reference language for all legal texts, {{due to the fact that}} it is more clear and precise for legal purposes.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{languages}} the prototypical accent {{is reflected}} in East Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian) as stress position, in South Slavic <b>languages</b> <b>as</b> pitch accent (Slovene and Serbo-Croatian) or stress position (Bulgarian), and in West Slavic <b>languages</b> <b>as</b> vowel length.|$|R

50|$|Another usage regards {{programming}} <b>languages</b> <b>as</b> theoretical constructs {{for programming}} abstract machines, and computer <b>languages</b> <b>as</b> the subset thereof {{that runs on}} physical computers, which have finite hardware resources. John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification <b>languages</b> are just <b>as</b> much programming <b>languages</b> <b>as</b> are the <b>languages</b> intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect {{the behavior of a}} computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.|$|R

5|$|Also {{during his}} time in Africa, after his expeditions to Kilimanjaro and around the Great lakes, he learned to speak several native languages, and wrote the first {{dictionary}} of the (Chichewa) (Kiniassa) <b>language,</b> <b>as</b> well as completing a dictionary (started by his colleague Ludwig Krapf) of the Nika (Mijikenda) language, and a dictionary of Swahili (now lost, but of which some material may have been incorporated into Krapf's Dictionary of the Suaheli Language (1882)). He also translated the Gospel of Luke into Swahili.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} sees <b>language</b> <b>as</b> {{a formal}} {{system of signs}} governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E

5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use <b>language</b> <b>as</b> a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight {{is one of}} {{the four}} most-spoken Berber languages, in {{addition}} to Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff, and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Differentiating these dialects is {{complicated by the fact that}} speakers of other languages may also refer to their <b>language</b> <b>as</b> 'Tamazight'. The differences between all three groups are largely phonological and lexical, rather than syntactic. Tamazight itself has a relatively large degree of internal diversity, including whether spirantization occurs.|$|E
5|$|English (American English) is the {{de facto}} {{national}} language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, {{is the second most}} common language and the most widely taught second language.

5|$|English is a North Sea Germanic {{language}} that was first spoken in early medieval England {{and is now}} a global lingua franca. Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea.

5|$|GR is {{the better}} known of the two romanization systems which {{indicate}} the four tones of Mandarin by varying the spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling"). These tones are as fundamental to the Chinese <b>language</b> <b>as</b> vowels are to English; their presence lets speakers discriminate between otherwise identical syllables and words. Other systems indicate the tones with either diacritics (for example Pinyin: āi, ái, ǎi and ài) or numbers (Wade–Giles: ai1, ai2, etc.). GR spells the same four tones ai, air, ae and ay. These spellings, which follow specific rules, indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable ai.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious <b>language,</b> <b>as</b> well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
