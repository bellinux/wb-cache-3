40|$|The {{mission of}} the Small Spacecraft Systems Virtual Institute (S 3 VI) is to advance the field of small {{spacecraft}} systems and allied sciences by promoting innovation, exploring new concepts, identifying emerging technology opportunities, and establishing effective conduits for the collaboration and the dissemination of research results relevant to small spacecraft systems and subsystems. The S 3 VI will be the common portal for NASA related small spacecraft activities, and will host the Small Spacecraft Body of Knowledge (SSBK) as an online resource for the Small Spacecraft Technology State of the Art report, a small spacecraft lessons <b>learned</b> <b>library,</b> systems test data repository, and reliability processes and practices as examples. The S 3 VI will also serve as the front door for other governmental and non-governmental agencies that wish to collaborate or interact with NASA small spacecraft organizations. Initiated in January 2017, the S 3 VI commenced a series of activities to develop the infrastructure to support its goals of facilitating clear communications, coordination, consistent guidance for NASA small spacecraft activities across the Agency, as well as serving to provide the small spacecraft research community with access to mission enabling information. To this end, the first year activities focused on development of the NASA Small Spacecraft Web Portal, which hosts the SSBK and other resources; investment in collaborative tools and capabilities to host and support working groups formed to concentrate {{on a variety of}} small spacecraft topics such as reliability and access to space. Recently, the S 3 VI introduced an Agency resource for small spacecraft systems experts to serve as reviewers, panelists, and in other capacities requiring this unique knowledge. Plans for 2018 include continued support and development of working groups and studies; lessons learned and best practices capture, and a new online seminar series...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the policies and procedures of selected education libraries in the two German states and to describe collection development, instruction in library use, and reference and information service in libraries serving German teacher training institutions. ^ The education libraries studied were the library of the teachers college in Erfurt, German Democratic Republic (GDR), the central library of the Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), and the education branch library in Nurnberg, FRG. ^ In the area of collection development, German education librarians decide how they will divide acquisitions funds for scholarly and practical school literature, for monographic titles and serial subscriptions, for German-language and foreign language materials, and for single copies of many titles or multiple copies of fewer titles. Neither the teachers college library in Erfurt nor the education branch library in Nurnberg has a written collection development policy. The central university library in Erlangen is the national subject specialty library for educational research materials and follows a detailed collection development plan which is a model for library networks. ^ Instruction in library use is mandated by a Ministry-level regulation in the GDR, and the objectives, content, and methods employed in Erfurt provide exemplars from which much can be <b>learned</b> <b>Library</b> education in Erlangen and Nurnberg is accorded a somewhat lower priority than in Erfurt but is regarded as a multi-faceted undertaking which involves the use of detailed library guides, elaborate sign systems, and library tours as well as formal classroom instruction. ^ Reference and information service in Erfurt is provided primarily by subject specialists, members of academic departments, whose work is coordinated and supervised by a professional librarian. In Erlangen and Nurnberg, reference and information service is the responsibility of professionally trained librarians. Computer literature searching as a component of reference service has commenced in the libraries in Erlangen and Nurnberg but not in the Erfurt library. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} library formed by a Scottish clergyman, James Bairn (1629 - 1678), and bequeathed by him to Edinburgh University Library. Comprising over {{nineteen}} hundred items in some eighteen hundred and forty volumes, {{it was one}} of the largest Scottish libraries of the day, and the variety of the contents, make it an important source for the examination of the scholarly interests of Scots in the Restoration period. Contemporary libraries formed by eight other Scottish clergymen are also studied in detail, to give added depth. These eight are: Robert Leighton (1611 - 1684), Bishop of Dunblane and Archbishop of Glasgow; Patrick Scougal (1607 ?- 1682), Bishop of Aberdeen, and his son Henry Scougal (1650 - 1678) Professor of Divinity at King's College, Aberdeen; William Woore (c. 1640 - 1684), Archdeacon of St Andrews; Villiarn Annand (1633 - 1689) Dean of Edinburgh; James Wemyss (c. 1630 - 16961, Principal of St Leonard's College, St Andrews; and two other parish ministers, Jams Lundie (c. 1646 - 1696) of Edinburgh and John Gray (1646 - 1717) of Aberlady. The acquisitions of several other Scottish contemporary libraries, public and private, are also discussed when apposite. An analysis of these libraries,subject by subject, with Bairn's library its corner-stone, comprises part two of this thesis (chapters four to seven). The first part begins with a chapter outlining the nature and extent of the sources available for study and the various interrelated aims of the thesis. Chapter two is a biography of James Nairn. Nairn exemplified important traits within the episcopal church in Scotland as well as being and Bishop of Salisbury. This chapter ends with an examination of the an important influence on the young Gilbert Burnet, statesman, historian book purchasing power of Nairn and his clerical colleagues in theory and practice, which serves as an introduction to chapter three, an investigation of tastes and techniques in book collecting in later seventeenth-century Scotland. Bairn's library is used here as a casestudy to discover patterns in imprints and languages found in a later seventeenth-century Scottish <b>learned</b> <b>library.</b> In cumulo, the contents of Bairn's library and those of his contemporaries cast new light on the intellectual preoccupations of Scots in the highly important period immediately before the Enlightenaent. and Bishop of Salisbury...|$|E

40|$|Objective –To {{demonstrate}} {{the effectiveness of}} interactive multimedia tutorials in delivering library educational content, and to evaluate librarian experiences of developing multimedia tutorials, both aspart of the LUMENS (Drabenstott) project. Design – User study (questionnaire and interviews) using pretest‐posttest design. Setting – Four academic libraries in the United States. One library dropped out {{during the course of}} the project. Subjects – Ninety university students from the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), Purdue University, and the University of Notre Dame participated in the main study to evaluate three of the tutorials: “Doing research an introduction to the concepts of online searching,” “How to read a scientificp aper,” and “Hungry for information?” Another group of 15 subjects from UIC, consisting of 10 graduate students, 2 faculty, 2 librarians, and one fellow, assessed a fourth tutorial “Keeping current in your field. ” Librarians were interviewed about their experiences producing the interactive multimedia tutorials. Methods – The 90 students were given a pretest containing questions about library educational content and five demographic questions. The students used the multimedia tutorial for 15 ‐ 30 minutes and immediately afterward were given a posttest containing comparable questions to the pretest in terms of content and difficulty. The students were also asked to rate their experiences of using the tutorials in various ways on a scale from 0 ‐ 10. At UIC, the experiences of the subjects using the multimedia tutorial were assessed by personal interviews. Librarians producing the multimedia tutorials were asked about their experiences of developing multimedia tutorials through e‐mail, listserv discussion, phone calls, and face‐to‐face personal and group interviews. Main results – All three libraries measured a significant increase (using a one sample t test, p 75 %) of students were familiar with tutorial content before start. Despite this, most of the students found the tutorials useful and enjoyable, and the majority were fairly likely to recommend the tutorial to a friend. Interviews with subjects at UIC revealed similar experiences, except that the subjects were less familiar with the tutorial content at the beginning, and they were more likely to return to the tutorial for a refresher. The tutorial with the highest amount of interactivity was the most popular. The librarians found it difficult to find time to learn Macromedia Flash and to work within the LUMENS project generally. Eight out of 15 librarians remained with the project over the entire period. Conclusion – Students <b>learned</b> <b>library</b> educational content by using multimedia tutorials and seemed to enjoy the experience, and educational librarians should lead multi‐expert project teams in tutorial production. Finally, the educational value of multimedia tutorials must be offset from the time and effort needed to produce them...|$|E

30|$|The Google Brain team created TensorFlow {{to solve}} their need for very {{large-scale}} models. Its predecessor is DistBelief [1], a software library used for training neural networks internally at Google. DistBelief was designed for large scale distributed training of neural networks which had two algorithms that were asynchronous in nature and were well suited for a shared memory system. DistBelief, and now TensorFlow, has been used at Google {{for a wide range}} of research problems such as unsupervised learning, language representation, image recognition, speech recognition, models for playing Go [24], and reinforcement learning among others [25 – 30]. They have deployed models for practical use in widely used Google products like YouTube, Google Maps, and others [23]. TensorFlow is the second generation machine <b>learning</b> <b>library</b> and it improved upon DistBelief by being more flexible, more performant, and being able to train a wider gamut of models all while being used on heterogeneous systems. TensorFlow is not only the standard machine <b>learning</b> <b>library</b> in use at Google, it is also one of the most popular Deep <b>Learning</b> <b>libraries</b> in the community [31]. Thus, it is the machine <b>learning</b> <b>library</b> used in our work.|$|R
