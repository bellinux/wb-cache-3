40|$|This letter {{presents}} a novel implementation of {{pulse width modulation}} that improves {{the quality of the}} <b>line-to-line</b> output <b>voltages</b> in interleaved multiphase voltage-source inverters (VSIs). In multiphase VSIs with n interleaved parallel-connected legs, the best single-phase output voltage is achieved when the carriers are evenly phase shifted. However, switching among nonadjacent levels can be observed at regular intervals in the <b>line-to-line</b> <b>voltages,</b> causing bad harmonic performance. With the proposed method, switching in the <b>line-to-line</b> <b>voltages</b> happens exclusively between adjacent levels. The modulator utilizes two sets of n evenly phase-shifted carriers that are dynamically allocated. Because of its generality, the proposed implementation is valid for any number of phases and any number of legs in parallel. A MATLAB/Simulink model has been set up for simulation purposes.

Mainly this scheme is implemented based on phase voltages of the wye connected configuration. Under unbalanced and distorted grid-condition, the online conversion of line-to-line values into the phase values is unworkable.

40|$|Grid-connected {{inverters}} utilizing {{renewable energy}} sources (e. g., photovoltaic, wind, fuel cell, etc.) are growing rapidly in recent years along with the constantly growing global demand for electricity. The utility is subjected to imbalance and distortion caused by unbalanced and nonlinear loads. Critical and random voltage disturbances could be established by time-varying loads like arc furnaces, the fluctuating output power {{of the wind and}} photovoltaic generation, voltage transients caused by line-start induction motors, and voltage transients associated with capacitor switching. These kind of voltage disturbances are stochastic in nature, with durations that differ from a small fraction of a cycle to some cycles. The two-level three-phase three-wire voltage-sourced inverter {{has become one of the}} main building blocks of renewable energy systems. In spite of weak grid condition; a grid-connected inverter must inject a synchronously regulated sinusoidal current to the utility grid with required low total harmonic distortion (THD) and high power factor. To overcome these challenges grid-connected inverters should provide unbalanced and distorted voltages. Hence, a new scalar implicit zero-sequence discontinuous pulse width modulation (IZDPWM) technique for three-phase three-wire two-level grid-connected voltage source inverters under the weak grid condition is presented. The proposed technique is the first scalar method that uses <b>line-to-line</b> <b>voltages</b> as reference signals. IZDPWM-based feedforward control strategy is proposed for current regulated grid-connected voltage source inverters under unbalanced and distorted condition. The feedforward control strategy is chosen because it can reject a large number of grid voltage harmonics simultaneously, while providing a clean sinusoidal current waveform to the grid. Regardless the grid topology, the compatible IZDPWM exactly copies the distorting harmonics of the grid voltage. Hence, a sinusoidal current is injected to the grid. IZDPWM-based closed loop controller minimizes low order harmonics in the grid current, and compensate for dc-link voltage ripple, deadtime delays, and semiconductor device voltage drops. For straightforward and significant current control using PI, the three-phase ac current is transferred into the synchronous d–q rotating frame whereas the feedforward compensation of the grid voltage is implemented in abc frame. Appling IZDPWM-based controller; pure sinusoidal current is injected to the grid under balanced, unbalanced, and distorted conditions. Moreover, under weak grid condition in spite of phase <b>voltages,</b> <b>line-to-line</b> <b>voltages</b> are measured by two sensors only. Thus, overall system cost is reduced and reliability of control system is increased. IZDPWM-based feedforward control was extensively tested under balanced, unbalanced, and distorted conditions in both simulation and experimental testes. The compatibility IZDPWM with the <b>line-to-line</b> <b>voltages</b> feedforwarding leads to an adequate control performance with robustness against dynamic voltage disturbances.

40|$|The {{usage of}} {{renewable}} energy sources is growing. These sources, such as photovoltaic devices and wind turbines, {{are connected to the}} power grids via inverters. Power electronic inverters produce non-sinusoidal voltages and increase the amount of unwanted distortion in the grids. Standards define the quality of the electricity in the power grids. Therefore, it is sensible to study the phenomena and methods to reduce the harmonic distortion in the outputs of different inverter topologies. LCL filters are used to suppress the harmonic components in the output waveforms of the grid connected inverters. The filter {{is one of the most}} expensive component in drive systems. The amount of harmonics can also be decreased by adding voltage levels to the inverter’s DC bus, optimizing the switching sequences and increasing the switching frequency. Therefore, better output harmonic performance can be achieved with the same LCL filter by using three-level inverter instead of two-level inverter. Three-level inverter also enables higher switching frequency. However, some additional costs are created, such as more semiconductor switches are needed, and the device requires more complex control system. The main issue in this thesis is to compare output harmonics between two- and three-level inverters. The studied topologies are two-level voltage source inverter and three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter. A detailed space vector modulation method is explained for these inverters. Requirements for a well implemented space vector modulator are also discussed. Space vector pulse width modulators are created using MATLAB® and Simulink®.
