500|$|The musicologist Suzanne Cusick {{writes that}} Monteverdi [...] "creat the lament as a {{recognizable}} genre of vocal chamber music {{and as a}} standard scene in opera... that would become crucial, almost genre-defining, to the full-scale public operas of 17th-century Venice". Cusick observes how Monteverdi is able to match in music the [...] "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" [...] {{in the text of}} [...] Ottavio Rinuccini. The opening repeated words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] (<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>die)</b> are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as [...] "an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain". Ringer suggests that the lament defines Monteverdi's innovative creativity {{in a manner similar to}} that in which the Prelude and the Liebestod in Tristan und Isolde announced Wagner's discovery of new expressive frontiers.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Faith No More's {{previous}} albums, initial reception to King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime was mixed. Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a grade of C− {{and called it}} an [...] "archaic progressive-rock fusion, oddly {{out of step with}} the times". Al Wiesel of Rolling Stone gave it a rating of two stars out of five, saying [...] "one hopes that that last song's moving chorus– 'Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>die</b> with this silly look in my eyes'– doesn't prove to be Faith No More's epitaph". Metal Hammer acknowledges that the album was met with [...] "crushing disappointment", but praised its diversity. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, was more favourable, calling it [...] "an utter triumph", adding that it was [...] "enigmatic, sarcastic, provocative and incisive". Spin magazine's Jonathan Gold rated the album 6 out of 10, praising its [...] "deftness" [...] and its [...] "burnished, jackhammer-sheathed-in-a-lubricated-condom presence", but feeling that its multiple genres were a distraction.|$|E
500|$|In its operatic context the lament {{takes the}} form of an {{extended}} recitative of more than 70 vocal lines, delivered in five sections divided by choral comments. Some of the wording is prefigured in the immediately preceding scene in which the First Envoy describes Arianna's plight to a sympathetic chorus of fishermen. The lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Cusick draws attention to the manner in which Monteverdi is able to match in music the [...] "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" [...] in Rinuccini's text. The opening repeated words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] (<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>die)</b> are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as [...] "an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain"; Monteverdi {{was one of the first}} users of this musical device. What follows, says Ringer, has a range and depth [...] "comparable to Shakespeare's most searching soliloquies". The words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] are followed by [...] "O Teseo, O Teseo mio" [...] (O Theseus, my Theseus"); the two phrases represent Arianna's contrasting emotions of despair and longing. Throughout the lament indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until the final iteration of [...] "O Teseo", after which a descending line brings the lament to a quiet conclusion.|$|E

2500|$|Islam, as {{with other}} Abrahamic religions, views suicide {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} sins and utterly detrimental to one's spiritual journey. The Islamic view is that life and death are given by God. Life is sacred, and a gift from God; and it is only God, and not the human beings, who has the right to take it back. Thus willful taking of one's own life is considered a major sin in Islam. Committing suicide to save oneself from suffering is discouraged. It is reported that a wounded Muslim soldier in the battlefield killed himself because of his suffering, upon which Muhammad (swt) commented that he would not be allowed into Paradise. Islam teaches that in the face of hardship, one should not directly pray for death. Instead, one should say: [...] "Oh Allah! Let me live as long as life is good for me, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>die</b> if death is good for me." [...] Euthanasia is considered one form of suicide and has the same ruling as that of suicide. Unjust killing of any human being is one of the most heinous and the cardinal sins in Islam.|$|E
