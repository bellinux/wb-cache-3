50|$|Mod 4, {{the twelve}} guns from , relined in 1921-1923, had a conical {{one-step}} liner and uniform rifling {{with a new}} chase locking hoop and locking ring. With the Mod 5 {{an attempt was made}} to reline a Mod 1 with a uniform twist rifling, but it was dropped. Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a uniform twist rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling, and added a tube and <b>liner</b> <b>locking</b> ring. Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling that was secured by a tube and <b>liner</b> <b>locking</b> ring with a <b>liner</b> <b>locking</b> collar at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and <b>liner</b> <b>locking</b> ring and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearance at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and <b>liner</b> <b>locking</b> ring and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band seating slope and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12. Mod 12 used a Mod 10 and lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope with Mod 13 being similar but of a Mod 8, Mod 14 used a Mod 9, Mod 15 used a Mod 7, Mod 16 used a Mod 10, Mod 17 used a Mod 8, and Mod 18 a Mod 9. Mod 19, the last modification, used a Mod 2 with its breech modified for the Smith-Asbury Breech Mechanism and the forward end of the chamber modified similar to the Mod 18, lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope. The breech end was further modified by being machined out so that it could accommodate a gas check seat <b>liner</b> <b>locking</b> ring. The Mod 19 could also be used right or left handed by cutting a new slide keyway that was 180° from the original keyway.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to investigate which lower limb amputees are using Alpha polyurethane gel liners {{and the effects of}} these on comfort and suspension of their prosthesis. A retrospective study was carried out of case records of all patients issued with Alpha cushion and <b>locking</b> <b>liners</b> between 1997 and the end of January 1999. The type of liner used was compared with age, sex, level and cause of amputation, time since amputation, comfort and suspension. Modified Stanmore/Harold-Wood mobility grades; duration of use and number of liners issued per patient were recorded. Sixteen (16) patients were identified who had been prescribed Alpha cushion liners. Improved comfort was reported by all. Forty (40) patients were identified who had been prescribed Alpha <b>locking</b> <b>liners.</b> Twenty (20) of these reported improved comfort and 10 improved suspension.

Qualitative {{study of}} {{prosthetic}} suspension systems on transtibial amputees' satisfaction and perceived {{problems with their}} prosthetic devices. Objective To investigate the effects of 3 dissimilar suspension systems on participants' satisfaction and perceived problems with their prostheses. Design Questionnaire survey. Setting A medical and engineering research center and a university biomedical engineering department. Participants Persons with unilateral transtibial amputation (N= 243), using prostheses with polyethylene foam liner, silicone <b>liner</b> with shuttle <b>lock,</b> and seal-in <b>liner.</b> Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Descriptive analyses were performed on the demographic information, satisfaction, and prosthesis-related problems of the study participants. Results The results showed {{significant differences between the}} 3 groups regarding the degree of satisfaction and perceived problems with the prosthetic device. Analyses of the individual items revealed that the study participants were more satisfied with the seal-in liner and experienced fewer problems with this liner. The silicone <b>liner</b> with shuttle <b>lock</b> and seal-in <b>liner</b> users reported significant differences in maintenance time compared with the polyethylene foam liner. Users of the silicone <b>liner</b> with shuttle <b>lock</b> experienced more sweating, while those who used the seal-in liner had greater problems with donning and doffing the device. Conclusions The results of the survey provide a good indication that prosthetic suspension is improved with the seal-in liner as compared with the polyethylene foam liner and silicone <b>liner</b> with shuttle <b>lock.</b> However, further prospective studies are needed to investigate which system provides the most comfort and the least problems for participants...|$|R

50|$|Most modern {{artificial}} limbs {{are attached}} to the stump of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by suction. The stump either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (suction sockets) or a pin <b>lock.</b> <b>Liners</b> are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other stump shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the stump (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the stump. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the stump or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the stump, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.|$|R
40|$|Background: Good {{suspension}} lessens the pistoning (vertical displacement) of {{the residual}} limb inside the prosthetic socket. Several methods are used for measuring the pistoning. Study Design: Clinical trial. Objectives: To introduce and evaluate a new simple method for measuring the pistoning between the soft liner and socket in transtibial prostheses. Methods: Five transtibial prostheses with Iceross silicone <b>liner</b> and shuttle <b>lock</b> were made for the subjects. The pistoning was measured between the liner and socket by a photographic method in single limb support on the prosthetic limb (full weight bearing), non-weight bearing and under three static axial loading conditions (30, 60 and 90 N). Results: This new method enabled us to measure the pistoning between the liner and prosthetic socket. The reproducibility of measurements in different trials of one session and between two sessions by two observers was shown to be high. The average of displacement between the liner and socket was about 9 mm in non-weight bearing compared with full weight bearing. Furthermore, as we expected, the average of pistoning increased consistently by adding the loads. Conclusions: This new method provides for easy and inexpensive determination of pistoning between the liner and socket by every prosthetist in clinical settings.

40|$|Each year, roughly 750, 000 {{patients}} in the US receive a total joint replacement (TJR), or a synthetic medical device that serves to replace the natural joint to restore function and relieve pain. TJRs have {{had a long history}} of use in the hip, knee and shoulder, yet still retain the same standard design of a hard-on-soft bearing coupling. Today, those bearings are primarily composed of hard cobalt chrome (CoCr) surface articulating against ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), a polymer with notable mechanical toughness and biocompatibility that have driven its 50 -plus years of use in vivo. TJRs have seen tremendous success for older patient cohorts for whom these devices were designed. However, increasing demand from younger patients has motivated the need for more durable materials that can sustain higher, more variable loading for a longer time. UHMWPE has become central to this mission, with limitations in its long-term wear resistance, oxidative stability and fracture/fatigue properties coming under the limelight in recent years. Explanted devices that have been retrieved from patients following failure have provided significant insight into the vulnerabilities of different UHMWPE formulations currently in the market, especially with respect to component fracture. Three cases examined in this work describe fracture failures of UHMWPE components seen in the knee, hip and shoulder to demonstrate existing tradeoffs in material sterilization and processing. Irradiation crosslinked blends, initially introduced to the orthopedic market to improve wear resistance, exhibits reduced resistance to both oxidation and fatigue crack propagation. Such tradeoffs are shown to contribute to the failure of two fractured knee tibial inserts, a single fractured hip acetabular cup, and a series of severely fractured glenoid components used in the shoulder. The former two cases exhibit an additional precursor to fracture that has been recognized but largely ignored in the fatigue characterization of crosslinked UHMWPE: the existence of stress concentrations (notches). Incidences of component fracture like the three reviewed in this work have motivated significant study of UHMWPE’s mechanical deformation as a function of microstructural changes. In addition, computational studies have sought to establish how changes in design may reduce local stresses in UHMWPE components to mitigate failure. Material and design influences have thus predominantly been studied in isolation. The latter half of this work demonstrates how previous methodologies using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and theoretical approaches to notch fatigue can been merged to elucidate the influence that notch geometry (notch-root radius) has on crack behavior in UHMWPE formulations. A robust computational analysis of existing theories regarding LEFM notch stress intensity and notch plasticity is presented, lending credibility {{to the use of the}} Dowling (1979) approach in characterizing the crack driving force in the vicinity of the notch. Standard compact tension (CT) specimens were modified to include one of five notch geometries: a sharp (0. 13 mm) radius (control specimen), two crack-like radii (0. 75 and 1 mm) and two blunt keyhole-type radii (2 and 3 mm). All radii were chosen to reflect geometries seen in modern TJR features, such as a tibial post in the knee or a <b>liner</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism in a hip. Cracks from 0. 1 to 1 mm in length were created at each notch root using a sharp razor blade. Cyclic tensile loading (stress ratio, R = 0. 1) was applied to impose an increasing cyclic stress intensity (ΔK), and crack growth was monitored optically. The fatigue crack propagation (FCP) behavior was mapped using the Paris law to compare the relative crack speeds at a given applied ΔK for each notch geometry and material formulation. Crack growth ahead of each notch was found to overlap with sharp crack data, further supporting the use of the Dowling approach in characterizing near-notch crack growth. This overlap in data implied that mechanisms of crack growth near the notch were similar to those further away from the notch (outside the “notch-affected zone”, as calculated for each notch radius using the Dowling approach). The congruency of all notch-emanating crack data also revealed microstructure-driven trends between each material cohort that have been noted in previous sharp crack studies. Highly crosslinked and remelted UHMWPE (RXLPE) was found to display the least resistance to FCP, while highly crosslinked and Vitamin E blended (VXLPE) formulations demonstrated a notable improvement. Virgin UHMWPE consistently demonstrated the best resistance to FCP. The reduction in FCP resistance seen in highly crosslinked materials was associated with reduced local plasticity in amorphous regions that otherwise serves to mitigate crack advance. Above-melt annealing (“remelting”) in RXLPE has been shown to minimize oxidation and subsequent embrittlement in vivo through free radical elimination, but can result in reduced percent crystallinity and lamellae quality that can further diminish FCP resistance. Blending Vitamin E similarly serves to reduce oxidation for VXLPE, but retains the crystalline quality and quantity of virgin UHMWPE. However, blended Vitamin E also diminishes crosslinking efficiency, thereby improving VXLPE’s resistance to FCP relative to RXLPE but with a tradeoff in optimal wear resistance. This study demonstrated that fatigue crack growth in UHMWPE primarily defers to microstructural influences, even when considering varying notch geometries within the vicinity of a crack. This work demonstrates that this methodology of investigating notch effects on crack behavior can be leveraged for polymeric materials, despite its primary origin from crystalline metals. Furthermore, by mimicking previous specimen types, sample dimensions and loading conditions, the methodology used in this work is easily translatable to orthopedic manufactures or research groups seeking to evaluate notch effects in novel UHMWPE formulations. Results shown here reveal that blunter notches do serve to mitigate catastrophic failure by reducing local driving forces (lower ΔK) within a larger notch-affected zone than sharp notches. However, this reduction may not offset the tradeoff in fatigue properties exhibited by highly crosslinked UHMWPE and a focus on optimizing the microstructure of this polymer may be more prudent for increasing its durability in vivo...|$|R
