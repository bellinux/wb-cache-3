25|$|To be incorporated, {{the area}} of the {{proposed}} village must have at least 500 inhabitants and not be part of an existing city or village. Additionally, the proposed village can be no more than 5 square miles (13km²) in area unless its boundaries are to be coterminous with a school, fire, improvement or other district, or the entire town. The process of incorporation begins with a petition by either 20% of residents or owners of 50% of assessed real property. If deemed <b>legally</b> <b>sufficient,</b> incorporation is then voted upon by the qualified voters living in the proposed village only.

40|$|Following Title VII 2 ̆ 7 s enactment, group-based {{employment}} discrimination actions flourished due to disparate {{impact theory}} and the class action device. Courts recognized that subordination that defined a group 2 ̆ 7 s social identity was also <b>sufficient</b> <b>legally</b> to bind members together, even when relief had to be issued individually. Woven through these cases was a notion of panethnicity that united inherently unrelated groups into a common identity, for example, Asian Americans. Stringent judicial interpretation subsequently eroded both legal frameworks {{and it has become}} increasingly difficult to assert collective employment actions, even against discriminatory practices affecting an entire group. This deconstruction has immensely disadvantaged persons with disabilities. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), individual employee claims to accommodate specific impairments, such as whether to install ramps or replace computer screens, have all but eclipsed a coherent theory of disability based disparate impact law. Moreover, the class action device has been virtually nonexistent in disability discrimination employment cases. The absence of collective action has been especially harmful because the realm of the workplace is precisely where group-based remedies are needed most. Specifically, a crucial but overlooked issue in disability integration is the harder-to-reach embedded norms that require job and policy modifications. The Article argues that pandisability theory serves as an analogue to earlier notions of panethnicity and provides an equally compelling heuristic for determining class identity. It shows that pandisability undergirds ADA public service and public accommodation class actions in which individualized remedy assessments have been accepted as part of group-based challenges to social exclusion. The Article also demonstrates that this broader vision of collective action is consistent with the history underlying the class action device. Taking advantage of the relatively blank slate of writing on group-based disability discrimination, it offers an intrepid vision of the ADA 2 ̆ 7 s potential for transforming workplace environments. In advocating for a return to an earlier paradigm of collective action in the disability context, the Article also provides some thoughts on challenging race- and sex-based discrimination...|$|R
500|$|When police {{conduct a}} search, the {{amendment}} {{requires that the}} warrant establish probable cause {{to believe that the}} search will uncover criminal activity or contraband. They must have <b>legally</b> <b>sufficient</b> reasons to believe a search is necessary. In Carroll v. United States (1925), the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible, common-sense standard. To that end, the Court ruled in Dumbra v. United States (1925) that the term probable cause means [...] "less than evidence that would justify condemnation", reiterating Carrolls assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would [...] "warrant a man of reasonable caution" [...] in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime. It does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.

500|$|Even {{with the}} {{armistice}} in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and {{had also been}} raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal [...] "to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" [...] about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved {{for a change of}} venue away from Landis's courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that [...] "f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is worse than I have said, I would like to hear it so I could use it myself." [...] Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the affidavit in support of the motion [...] "perjurious", and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and pointing at the jury box as he noted, [...] "the country was then at war". At one point, Landis leapt out of his seat, twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal; but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. [...] The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6–3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was <b>legally</b> <b>sufficient,</b> leaving it for another judge to decide whether it was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court's decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.|$|E
2500|$|In Olins v Walters [...] 2 WLR 1 C.A. the Court of Appeal {{has held}} that {{although}} it is {{a necessary condition for}} mutual wills that there is clear and satisfactory evidence of a contract between the testators, it is a <b>legally</b> <b>sufficient</b> condition that the contract provide that, in return for one testator agreeing to make a will in a particular form and not to revoke it without notice to the other testator, the latter would also make a will in a particular form and agree not to revoke it without notice to the first testator.

50|$|Typically, the {{defendant}} {{in a case}} will demur to the complaint, {{but it is also}} possible for the plaintiff to demur to an answer. The demurrer challenges the legal sufficiency of a cause of action in a complaint or of an affirmative defense in an answer. If a cause of action in a complaint does not state a cognizable claim (for example, the claim is nonsense) or if it does not state all the required elements, then the challenged cause of action or possibly the entire complaint can be essentially thrown out (informally speaking) at the demurrer stage as not <b>legally</b> <b>sufficient.</b> A demurrer is typically filed near the beginning of a case, in response to the plaintiff filing a complaint or {{the defendant}} answering the complaint.|$|E
