500|$|The pisco sour's initial recipe {{was that}} of a simple cocktail. According to Peruvian {{researcher}} Guillermo Toro-Lira, [...] "it is assumed that it was a crude mix of pisco with <b>lime</b> <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> sugar, as was the whiskey sour of those days." [...] As the cocktail's recipe continued to evolve, the bar's registry shows that customers commented on the continuously improving taste of the drink. The modern Peruvian version of the recipe was developed by Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian from Chincha Alta who worked under the apprenticeship of Morris starting on July 16, 1924. Bruiget's recipe added the Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix. Journalist Erica Duecy writes that Bruiget's innovation added [...] "a silky texture and frothy head" [...] to the cocktail.|$|E

500|$|The pisco sour {{has three}} {{different}} methods of preparation. The Peruvian pisco sour cocktail {{is made by}} mixing Peruvian pisco with Key lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, Angostura bitters (for garnish), and ice cubes. The Chilean pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Chilean Pisco with Pica lime juice, powdered sugar, and ice cubes. Daniel Joelson, a food writer and critic, contends that the major difference between both pisco sour versions [...] "is that Peruvians generally include egg whites, while Chileans do not." [...] The version from the International Bartenders Association, which lists the pisco sour among its [...] "New Era Drinks," [...] {{is similar to the}} Peruvian version, but with the difference that it uses lemon juice, instead of <b>lime</b> <b>juice,</b> <b>and</b> does not distinguish between the two different types of pisco.|$|E
500|$|The term sour {{refers to}} mixed drinks {{containing}} a base liquor (bourbon {{or some other}} whiskey), lemon or <b>lime</b> <b>juice,</b> <b>and</b> a sweetener. Pisco refers to the base liquor used in the cocktail. The word as applied to the alcoholic beverage comes from the Peruvian port of Pisco. In the book Latin America and the Caribbean, historian Olwyn Blouet and political geographer Brian Blouet describe the development of vineyards in early Colonial Peru and how {{in the second half}} of the sixteenth century a market for the liquor formed owing to the demand from growing mining settlements in the Andes. Subsequent demand for a stronger drink caused Pisco and the nearby city of Ica to establish distilleries [...] "to make wine into brandy", and the product received the name of the port from where it was distilled and exported.|$|E
