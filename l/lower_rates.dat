40|$|AbstractThe authors {{present a}} case {{report of a}} patient with an {{implanted}} VDD pacemaker whose postoperative ECG revealed sinus bradycardia, showing the heart <b>rate</b> remarkably <b>lower</b> than the programmed <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> limit. Upon assessing some pacemaker manufacturers' mechanisms to set the <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> limit in VDD mode, {{it was found that}} they can be classified into four types. The mechanisms are based on keeping atrioventricular (AV) synchronous pacing in VDD mode or maintaining the <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> limit in VVI mode. AV synchronous pacing results in producing an actual heart <b>rate</b> which is <b>lower</b> than the programmed <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> limit. The classification also depends on whether the pacemakers are operating on either atrial-based or ventricular-based <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> timing. Therefore, the actual heart <b>rate</b> can be <b>lower</b> than the programmed <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> limit, depending on the VDD pacemaker model...|$|R

5|$|In 2015, acne was {{estimated}} to affect 633 million people globally, making it the 8th most common disease worldwide. Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80–90% of teenagers in the Western world. <b>Lower</b> <b>rates</b> are reported in some rural societies. Children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty. Although acne becomes less common in adulthood, it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties and a smaller group continue to have difficulties into their forties.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, with the possible exception of syphilis.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the Luftwaffe had {{subjected}} the UK {{to a major}} {{air campaign}} and caused {{an enormous amount of}} destruction and displacement of civilians. However, it failed to bring the UK to peace talks, nor had any obvious effect on economic output. At the end of May the Germans called off The Blitz, and from then on the UK would be subject to dramatically <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> of bombing. How much of this was due to the effects of the night fighter force has been a matter of considerable debate among historians. The Germans were turning their attention eastward, and most of the Luftwaffe was sent to support these efforts. Even in May, the losses represent only 2.4% of the attacking force, a tiny number that was easily replaceable by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
40|$|A 15 -sec {{stimulus}} {{followed by}} unavoidable monetary loss {{was presented to}} human subjects who were avoiding loss on a free-operant schedule. As has been observed in studies where shock is the aversive event, initial reactions to the pre-loss stimulus were transient increases in overall and stimulus rates. Unlike shock studies, continued training produced decreased rates, {{in the presence of}} the 15 -sec stimulus, which were maintained in two of three subjects. Subsequent observations indicated that <b>lowered</b> <b>rates</b> were a function of the subject's rate of avoidance responding, the duration of the stimulus, and the scheduling of avoidable losses. Increasing the duration of the stimulus eliminated <b>lowered</b> <b>rates</b> {{in the presence of the}} stimulus and subsequent exposures to conditions which previously produced <b>lowered</b> <b>rates</b> did not result in recovery of the phenomenon. Introduction of the pre-loss stimulus on an extinction baseline (avoidable losses were omitted), however, reinstituted <b>lowered</b> <b>rates.</b> It is proposed that the pre-loss stimulus assumed discriminative control over low rates because responding in the presence of the stimulus was ineffective in avoiding the unavoidable loss. Recovery from <b>lowered</b> <b>rates</b> is attributed to the occurrence of avoidable losses during the stimulus period, and maintenance of <b>lowered</b> <b>rates</b> on the extinction schedule to the omission of such avoidable losses...|$|R

5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> of labour productivity.|$|E
5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> of efficacy.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E
