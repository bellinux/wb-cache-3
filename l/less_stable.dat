5|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} has a crystal {{structure}} analogous {{to that of}} diamond. Consistent with diamond being <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> than graphite, the cubic form is <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate {{between the two is}} negligible at room temperature, as it is for diamond. The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, {{the same as that of}} diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN.|$|E
5|$|For most bikes, {{depending}} on geometry and mass distribution, capsize is stable at low speeds, and becomes <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> as speed increases {{until it is}} no longer stable. However, on many bikes, tire interaction with the pavement is sufficient to prevent capsize from becoming unstable at high speeds.|$|E
5|$|Iron(II) {{complexes}} are <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> than iron(III) complexes but {{the preference}} for O-donor ligands is less marked, so that for example 2+ is known while 3+ is not. They {{have a tendency to}} be oxidized to iron(III) but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used.|$|E

5|$|Nitrite is also {{a common}} ligand that can {{coordinate}} in five ways. The most common are nitro (bonded from the nitrogen) and nitrito (bonded from an oxygen). Nitro-nitrito isomerism is common, where the nitrito form is usually <b>less</b> <b>stable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Kuiper belt was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the source of the Solar System's ecliptic comets. However, studies of the region since 1992 have shown that the orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and that ecliptic comets originate from the scattered disc, where orbits are generally <b>less</b> <b>stable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The least stable {{ground state}} isotope is francium-215, with a {{half-life}} of 0.12μs: it undergoes a 9.54MeV alpha decay to astatine-211. Its metastable isomer, francium-215m, is <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> still, with a half-life of only 3.5ns.|$|E

2500|$|... α-Alane is {{the most}} {{thermally}} stable polymorph. β-alane and γ-alane are produced together, and convert to α-alane upon heating. δ, ε, and θ-alane are produced in still other crystallization conditions. Although they are <b>less</b> thermally <b>stable,</b> δ, ε, and θ polymorphs do not convert into α-alane upon heating.|$|R
5|$|While DNA {{contains}} deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose (in deoxyribose {{there is}} no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> than DNA {{because it is more}} prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Astatine is an {{extremely}} radioactive element; all its isotopes have short half-lives of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, bismuth, polonium or radon. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only francium is <b>less</b> <b>stable,</b> and all the astatine isotopes more stable than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|In the second, mild {{protection}} scheme, A and dA {{are protected}} with isobutyryl or phenoxyacetyl groups (PAC). C and dC bear acetyl protection, and G and dG are protected with 4-isopropylphenoxyacetyl (iPr-PAC) or dimethylformamidino (dmf) groups. Mild protecting groups are removed {{more readily than}} the standard protecting groups. However, the phosphoramidites bearing these groups are <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> when stored in solution.|$|E
30|$|Dissolved organic C and N (i.e. {{extracted}} from unfumigated soil during {{the determination of}} microbial biomass) behaved differently from P (Table 1). Extractable C and N were significantly greater in the 0 _ 0 treatment and <b>less</b> but <b>stable</b> with added P, whereas extractable P was least in the 0 _ 0 treatment and increased with increasing P.|$|R
50|$|Contract issuers {{can become}} <b>less</b> financially <b>stable.</b> This risk is most {{pronounced}} in funds with non-synthetic GICs because a single guarantor is backing the fund {{with the full}} faith and credit of the company. Most stable value funds mitigate this risk by purchasing contracts from multiple issuers, and stable value contract providers are generally strong financial institutions.|$|R
50|$|Pheomelanin is more bio-chemically {{stable than}} black eumelanin, but <b>less</b> bio-chemically <b>stable</b> than brown eumelanin, so it breaks down more slowly when oxidized. This is why bleach gives darker hair a reddish tinge during the {{artificial}} coloring process. As the pheomelanin continues to break down, the hair will gradually become red, then orange, then yellow, and finally white.|$|R
5|$|Silver {{complexes}} tend to {{be similar}} to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes {{tend to be}} rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate 5− and tellurate 5− complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow diamagnetic − is much <b>less</b> <b>stable,</b> fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.|$|E
5|$|Technetium, with {{atomic number}} (denoted Z) 43, is the lowest-numbered {{element in the}} {{periodic}} table of which all isotopes are radioactive. The second-lightest exclusively radioactive element, promethium, has an atomic number of 61. Atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons are <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> than those with even numbers, even when {{the total number of}} nucleons (protons + neutrons) is even, and odd numbered elements have fewer stable isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The diamond allotrope {{of carbon}} is clearly nonmetallic, being {{translucent}} {{and having a}} low electrical conductivity of 10−14 to 10−16S·cm−1. Graphite has an electrical conductivity of 3 × 104S·cm−1, a figure more characteristic of a metal. Phosphorus, sulfur, arsenic, selenium, antimony and bismuth also have <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> allotropes that display different behaviours.|$|E
50|$|The {{properties}} of ammonium polyphosphate {{depend on the}} number of monomers in each molecule and to a degree on how often it branches. Shorter chains (n<100) are more water sensitive and <b>less</b> thermally <b>stable</b> than longer chains (n>1000), but short polymer chains (e.g. pyro-, tripoly-, and tetrapoly-) are more soluble and show increasing solubility with increasing chain length.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} ichthyofauna from Rosu-Puiu lake-complex was {{undertaken}} in May 2005, using two complementary methods of sampling: electric fishing for shoreline and gillnet fishing for deep water zone. Thepaper presents the actual {{situation of the}} fish communities from the Rosu-Puiu lake-complex, part of “marine delta” from Danube delta. In this lake-complex there were catched 29 species of fish (5 exotic species and 24 native species. The most abundant fish species are Alburnus alburnus (bleak), Abramis bjoerkna (silver bream),Clupeonella cultriventris (Black Sea sprat), Carassius gibelio (Prussian carp) and Rutilus rutilus (roach) with slight differences for those two complementary methods of sampling. The biodiversity index and equitability indices were calculated per lake and methods. The lake-complex has a stable ecosystem, with shoreline (1. 155 Shanon-Wiener index and 0. 437 equitability indices) <b>less</b> <b>stables</b> than open water (1. 878 Shanon-Wiener index and 0. 576 equitability indices) ...|$|R

5|$|The harbour and {{the mouth}} of the River Esk are on a {{geological}} fault. On the east side the cliff is tall, , and consists of alternating layers of shale, sandstone and clay. On the west side the cliff is much lower and has a deep capping of boulder clay over a sandstone base making it <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> and liable to slippage. Both cliffs are being eroded quite rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The iron {{compounds}} {{produced on}} the largest scale in industry are iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl3). The former {{is one of}} the most readily available sources of iron(II), but is <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> to aerial oxidation than Mohr's salt ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O). Iron(II) compounds tend to be oxidized to iron(III) compounds in the air.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium has {{at least}} 20 {{metastable}} ("excited") isomers ranging in mass number from 78 to 102. Multiple excitation states have been observed for 80Y and 97Y. While most of yttrium's isomers {{are expected to be}} <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> than their ground state, 78mY, 84mY, 85mY, 96mY, 98m1Y, 100mY, and 102mY have longer half-lives than their ground states, as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than isomeric transition.|$|E

40|$|Data for roughhead {{grenadier}} (Macrourus berglax), thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata) and white hake (Urophycis tenuis) from the Spanish Spring survey are presented. Abundance and biomass were estimated for {{roughhead grenadier}} and thorny skate {{for the period}} 1997 - 2013 and for white hake for the period 2001 - 2013. The length distribution is presented as numbers per haul stratified mean catches {{for the last five}} years (2009 - 2013). The roughhead grenadier indices show no trend during the entire period, reaching a maximum in 2004 - 2006 and afterwards stabilised at levels slightly higher than in the early years. Thorny skate indices follow a large oscillating trend, dropping in 2007 and being since then more or <b>less</b> <b>stables</b> at a low level. White hake biomass index was highest in 2001 and showed an overall decreasing trend since then to 2008, reaching almost the level of 2002 in 2013, although at very low levels compared with the 2001 one. A small recruitment event was detected in 2004 and in 2013, with individuals between 16 - 26 cm...|$|R

5|$|After {{the death}} of Henry, however, the {{political}} situation in England became <b>less</b> <b>stable,</b> with both Stephen of England and the Empress Matilda laying claim to the throne. Brien had originally been considered a supporter of Stephen, but in 1139 Matilda travelled to England and Brien announced his allegiance to her, joining forces with Miles of Gloucester and other supporters in the south-west. Wallingford Castle was now the most easterly stronghold of the Empress's faction – it was either the closest base to London, or the first in line to be attacked by Stephen's forces, depending on one's perspective.|$|E
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 state will be <b>less</b> <b>stable</b> than those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E
5|$|Globally, pelican {{populations are}} {{adversely}} affected by four main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and lastly the presence of pollutants such as DDT and endrin. Most species' populations are more or <b>less</b> <b>stable,</b> although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.|$|E
25|$|The {{gasoline}} {{produced in}} the FCC unit has an elevated octane rating but is <b>less</b> chemically <b>stable</b> compared to other gasoline components due to its olefinic profile. Olefins in gasoline {{are responsible for the}} formation of polymeric deposits in storage tanks, fuel ducts and injectors. The FCC LPG is an important source of C3-C4 olefins and isobutane that are essential feeds for the alkylation process and the production of polymers such as polypropylene.|$|R
50|$|A {{small cap}} company {{typically}} has under $1 billion {{under control and}} are hence considered small companies. Small companies generally {{are not able to}} secure the best (prime) borrowing rates and wield reduced power, including a smaller market share.

However, they do generally have more growth potential and over time have greater but more volatile expected returns.|$|R
50|$|In many cases, liquids and {{solutions}} can be cooled down or concentrated up to conditions where the liquid or solution is significantly <b>less</b> thermodynamically <b>stable</b> than the crystal, but where no crystals will form for minutes, hours, weeks or longer. Nucleation {{of the crystal}} is then being prevented by a substantial barrier. This has consequences, for example cold high altitude clouds may contain large numbers of small liquid water droplets that are far below 0C.|$|R
