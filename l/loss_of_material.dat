5|$|At Bremerton, on {{the east}} side of the Olympics, the {{measured}} rotations are less, and within the statistical error bounds of being zero; while further north, near Port Townsend, the rotation is slightly counter-clockwise. On Vancouver Island the paleorotations are counter-clockwise, and other evidence shows that the tip of the island has been bent, presumably as a result of the collision of Siletzia. The northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula also shows counter-clockwise rotation, of around 45 degrees. This raises a question of how much of the arcuate shape of the Crescent Formation is due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> from the center after uplift by the Olympic Mountains, and how much reflects oroclinal bending.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{implementation}} of this particular ISO {{it is helpful to}} understand the difference with the traditional cost accounting. MFCA makes a record <b>of</b> <b>material</b> flow in physical and monetary terms and puts emphasis in the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> (or in other words, the waste produced). Although traditional cost accounting recognizes <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> waste management costs are not separated but integrated in the total cost of production. This practice makes difficult to identify easily and clearly which part of production is due to losses or waste generation. MFCA highlights waste management costs and inefficiency of processes therefore making easier to identify room for improvements. Many losses produce environmental impact (air pollution, water pollution, health problems, etc) therefore identifying losses, the framework aims to make easier to also reduce some environmental impacts. It is worth saying that this framework does not identify environmental impact that is not linked with any material cost.|$|R
25|$|Tubes may be tagged (reduced in {{diameter}} {{to enable the}} tube to be initially fed through the die to then be pulled from the other side) using a rotary swager, which allows them to be drawn on a draw bench.

25|$|Once {{they have}} {{exhausted}} their supply of hydrogen through nuclear fusion, medium- to low-mass stars shed their outer layers {{to form a}} planetary nebula and evolve into white dwarfs. While most clusters become dispersed before {{a large proportion of}} their members have reached the white dwarf stage, the number of white dwarfs in open clusters is still generally much lower than would be expected, given the age of the cluster and the expected initial mass distribution of the stars. One possible explanation for the lack of white dwarfs is that when a red giant expels its outer layers to become a planetary nebula, a slight asymmetry in the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> could give the star a 'kick' of a few kilometres per second, enough to eject it from the cluster.|$|E

40|$|While {{substantial}} {{work has}} been performed in the Russian MPC&A Program, much {{more needs to be}} done at Russian nuclear facilities to complete four necessary steps. These are (1) periodically measuring the physical inventory <b>of</b> nuclear <b>material,</b> (2) continuously measuring the flows <b>of</b> nuclear <b>material,</b> (3) using the results to close the material balance, particularly at bulk processing facilities, and (4) statistically evaluating any apparent <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>material.</b> The periodic closing <b>of</b> <b>material</b> balances provides an objective test of the facility's system <b>of</b> nuclear <b>material</b> protection, control and accounting. The statistical evaluation using the uncertainties associated with individual measurement systems involved in the calculation <b>of</b> the <b>material</b> balance provides a fair standard for concluding whether the apparent <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>material</b> means a diversion or whether the facility's accounting system needs improvement. In particular, if unattractive flow material at a facility is not measured well, the accounting system cannot readily detect the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> attractive <b>material</b> if the latter substantially derives from the former...|$|R
50|$|ISO 14051 was {{published}} {{as a standard}} on the 2011, and provides a standard on the implementation <b>of</b> <b>material</b> flow cost accounting (MFCA). In MFCA energy can be accounted {{as part of the}} cost <b>of</b> flow <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> or separated. Many organizations are unaware of the real cost <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> due to incomplete recording in traditional cost accounting. This norm aims to fulfill a gap providing a tool to use an integrate accounting perspective that helps to reduce environmental impact and financial costs.|$|R

60|$|Why was Jenkin {{an amateur}} in my eyes? You think because not amusing (I think he often was amusing).

If there is anywhere a thing said in two sentences {{that could have been}} as clearly and as engagingly and as forcibly said in one, then it's amateur work. Then you will bring me up with old Dumas. Nay, the object of a story is to be long, to fill up hours; the story-teller's art of writing is to water out by continual invention, historical and technical, and yet not seem to water; seem on the other hand to practise that same wit of conspicuous and declaratory condensation which is the proper art of writing. That is one thing in which my stories fail: I am always cutting the flesh off their bones.|$|E
6000|$|For {{some years}} more, Mr. Stephenson (he is now fairly {{entitled}} to that respectable prefix) went on still further experimenting {{on the question}} of locomotives and railways. He was now beginning to learn that much unnecessary wear and tear arose on the short lines of rail down from the pit's mouths to the loading-places on the river by the inequalities and roughnesses of the joints; and he invented a method of overlapping the rails which quite got over this source of loss--loss of speed, loss of power, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> at once. It was in 1819 that he laid down his first considerable piece of road, the Hetton railway. The owners of a colliery at the village of Hetton, in Durham, determined to replace their waggon road by a locomotive line; and they invited the now locally famous Killingworth engine-wright to act as their engineer. Stephenson gladly undertook the post; and he laid down a railway of eight miles in length, on the larger part of which the trucks were to be drawn by [...] "the iron horse," [...] as people now began to style the altered and improved locomotive. The Hetton railway was opened in 1822, and the assembled crowd were delighted at beholding a single engine draw seventeen loaded trucks after it, at the extraordinary rate of four miles an hour--nearly as fast as a man could walk. Whence it may be gathered that Stephenson's ideas up{{on the question of}} speed were still on a very humble scale indeed.|$|E

Five CAD/CAM polymeric materials were examined: Vipi Block Monocolor (VBM), Yamahachi polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (YAP), Mazic Duro (MZD), Vita Enamic (ENA), and Pekkton (PEK).
