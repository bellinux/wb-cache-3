40|$|The {{influence}} of oxide etch backs done in LOCOS based isolation technologies {{on the low}} level leakage and reliability of tunnel oxide capacitors has been studied. Tunnel oxide structures are part of nonvolatile memory devices such as Flash EEPROMs and are critical to their overall performance. Locos isolated, area and edge intensive capacitors with 94 A tunnel oxide have been manufactured and tested. Test {{results indicate that the}} extent of the etch back and the use of HF instead of buffered HF as chemical etchants do not adversely affect the low level <b>leakge</b> of the tunnel capacitors. However, oxide endurance analysis based on constant current charge to breakdown tests show a significant degradaton if an aggressive etch back is adopted...|$|E
40|$|Android 系统占据智能移动终端市场 81. 9 %的份额,预计还会持续增长. 同时,针对 Android 系统的恶意应用日益增多,Android 恶意应用程序检测技术已经成为安全领域研究的热点问题. 本文提出一种基于有向信息流的针对Android 隐私泄漏类恶意应用的检测方法. 该方法首先反编译应用程序,分析配置文件中的权限申明; 基于隐私点数据集构建隐私数据有向信息流模型; 通过在信息流模型中对隐私点的跟踪分析,检测隐私数据是否被发送出去而导致信息泄漏. 该方法在对Android 第三方市场的 7 985 个应用程序检测中,发现 357 个恶意应用. 通过实验方式验证了检测结果的准确性. 结果表明该方法对Android 隐私泄露类恶意应用具有很好的检测效果. Android devices occupy 81. 9 % of {{the total}} smart phone market. However,the {{malicious}} applications of Android system are increasing,and the detection technology has become the hot topic in security research. We propose a new Android detection approach of privacy leakage malicious application based on directed information flow. This approach first decompiles the application and analyzes the permissions. Then,it builds directed information flow model according to the privacy points. By tracking the flows of the points,the information flows are monitored and the privacy leakages are detected. We tested 7 985 applications and detected 357 privacy leakage ones. We analyzed one of the results and confirmed that it was indeed a privacy <b>leakge</b> appliction. The results show that this new approach has good detection capacity...|$|E
40|$|Microscopic, histochemical and ultrastructural {{techniques}} {{were used to}} define characteristics of high endothelial venules (HEV) in rat lymphatic tissues. This endothelium contained acetyl esterase and acid hydrolase activities which were not altered by lymphocyte depletion. No immunoglobulins were detected on luminal surfaces of HEV by fluorescent antibody staining. Only minor structural differences were seen between HEV within lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. At both sites, high endothelial cells were linked together by macular junctional complexes and interlocking basal foot processes. Endothelial cell cytoplasm moulded about surfaces of lymphocytes migrating through the venular wall, and flocculant deposits of basement membrane formed over lymphocytes penetrating the basal lamina. The endothelium was ensheathed by three to five layers of overlapping reticular cell plates and connective tissue. Each plate {{was linked to the}} reticular meshwork of the node by collagen bundles and anchoring filaments which inserted into the plate's external limiting membrane. This permitted individual paltes to separate or approximate each other as tissue and intravascular pressure varied, and lymphocytes moved across the sheath by insinuating themselves into gaps between overlapping plates. This composite structure of the HEV wall appeared to facilitate lymphocyte entry into the node and minimized vascular <b>leakge...</b>|$|E
