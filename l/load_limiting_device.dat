40|$|Signatures are on file in the Graduate School iii This thesis {{describes}} an analytical and experimental {{investigation into the}} energy absorption performance of textile-based <b>load</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>devices.</b> The primary technology considered is the stitch ripping device (SRD). Development of analytical models for predicting SRD behavior is presented. The models account for energy absorption due to webbing stretch, thread rupture and stitch slippage. The models predict the force-displacement behavior of the device, {{the total amount of}} energy absorption, and the amount of absorption due to frictional losses from stitch slip. Experimental testing conducted to validate model results exhibits close agreement for the applied load and displacement required to induce thread rupture. Over multiple stitch breaks, the models slightly over estimate the amount of absorbed energy. It is predicted that a lower amount of stitch slip decreases activation force as well as fluctuation of force in the plateau region of the force-displacement curve. Decreasing slip increases the amount of energ...|$|R

General aviation aircraft have fuselage subfloors of a built up structure which are generally very stiff perpendicular {{to the floor of}} the cabin. The subfloor structure, designed to crush at an appropriate force level, can be used to advantage in a crash by dissipating energy through plastic buckling of the floor beams and frames. Simple closed form solutions to predict the mean crushing force levels of subfloor designs is useful in engineering practice. The crushing process of thin walled, plate formed, open structures with particular emphasis on L and cruciform shapes was analyzed. Lower and upper bound solutions for the mean crushing strength of cruciforms are obtained by considering modes of deformation which account for both bending and extensional deformation. It is the importance of extensional deformation to the energy absorption process, representing at least one third of the dissipated energy is shown. Previously announced in STAR as N 82 - 3376...|$|R
40|$|Cascade {{failure of}} {{electrical}} transmission lines {{can be caused}} by a number of reasons. Dynamic forces like equipment failure, conductors rupture in any span, heavy wind loads, snow accumulation on conductors and structural members or ice shedding are known to be the main reasons for such a collapse. The primary objective of this investigation was to study the dynamic behavior of supporting towers, collapse of supporting towers and longitudinal dynamic maximum forces that were induced on the adjacent supporting towers due to conductors rupture in any span. The study was performed on transmission lines, whose supporting towers were modeled with (a) Linear elastic truss and beam elements, (b) Moment-Curvature beam elements, with elastic-plastic material properties, and (c) Towers with <b>load</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>devices</b> or tower <b>load</b> controllers (TLC). The transmission lines modeled with linear elastic truss and beam elements were used to perform the free vibration analysis to calculate the damping properties of the towers and the transmission lines. Each of these models was used to conduct static and transient dynamic analyses due to broken conductors in the middle span. The transient dynamic analyses were carried out with bare conductor (no-ice-loads) loading and 25 -mm (1 -inch) radial ice loading conditions. The linear material models do not predict the failure or cascading of the transmission line towers, however considering the elements as moment-curvature beam models with elasto-plastic materials showed that the towers adjacent to the span, where conductors are ruptured, experienced large impact forces causing the adjacent towers to collapse. And the use of TLCs was able to limit the length of this cascade failure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€“ A force <b>limiting</b> <b>device</b> ideally {{possesses}} rigid-plastic force/shortening characteristics. When such {{a device}} is introduced in a compression member, {{and if the}} <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> of the <b>device</b> is set somewhat below the buckling load of the member, the member will behave in an elastic-plastic manner. The present paper outlines the non-liner behaviour of a novel multi-tubular, ductile compression member which exhibits an initial axial stiffness, followed by a steady load plateau and subsequent enhanced stiffness and strength, before the final failure. The multi-tubular member acts as an energy absorber and force redistributor. The theoretical cyclic response of the device, obtained using ABAQUS, is presented. For {{a comparison of the}} energy absorbing characteristics, two X braced frameworks have been considered, one with conventional tubular bracing, and one with the force <b>limiting</b> <b>devices</b> used for bracing. For relatively large horizontal displacements, the framework incorporating the force <b>limiting</b> <b>devices</b> exhibited greater ductility and energy absorbing characteristics than the conventionally braced framework...|$|R

40|$|The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine offers diesel-like {{efficiency}} {{with very}} low soot and NOx emissions. In a HCCI engine, a premixed charge of air, fuel and burned gas is compressed to achieve autoigntion. Combustion occurs throughout the chamber volume resulting in short overall burn duration. This short burn duration can cause excessively high pressure rise rates {{which lead to}} unacceptable engine noise and potentially reduced engine life. To combat this high pressure rise rate the engine must be operating with significant diluent, either excess air or burned exhaust gas. However this high level of dilution limits the specific output of the HCCI engine to levels far below spark ignition or diesel engines. The high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> is a major challenge for the HCCI engine. This study utilized a single cylinder research to examine the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> and possible methods to extend it. The details of the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> were first explored {{across a range of}} intake temperatures, boost pressures, trapped residual fractions, equivalence ratios and external EGR ratios for a gasoline fueled HCCI engine. A significant finding was that the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> always occurs at the misfire limit and that for a given pressure rise rate constraint, the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> occurs at lowest possible intake pressure and trapped residual fraction needed to prevent misfire. A possible means to allow operation at higher boost pressures is to utilize cooled external EGR or to reduce the intake temperature. For a given burn fraction, increasing the EGR rate or reducing the intake temperature provided reduced MPRR. (cont.) However with these changes, the misfire limit also shifted such that the value of the maximum load does not materially change. Thus boosting coupled with EGR or intake temperature reduction {{can not be used to}} significantly extend the high <b>load</b> <b>limit.</b> A correlation was developed for the burn duration. Multi-zone combustion simulations were used to confirm the form of this correlation. The multi-zone based correlations were then used to quantitatively examine the potential of thermal stratification as a means to extend the high <b>load</b> <b>limit.</b> It was shown that for a doubling of the width of the in-cylinder temperature distribution, a 30 % increase in the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> is possible. by Robert J.
