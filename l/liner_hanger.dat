50|$|In 1929, Cicero C. Brown {{organized}} Brown Oil Tools in Houston, and patented {{the first}} <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> in 1937. Liner hangers enable drillers to lengthen their casing strings {{without having the}} liner pipe extend {{all the way to}} the surface. This saves capital cost and reduces weight borne by offshore platforms. Hughes Tool Company acquired Brown Oil Tools in 1978. In 1970, Baker Oil Tools acquired Lynes, Inc., which produced liner hangers and other completion equipment. In 1978, Baker Oil Tools introduced the Bakerline casing <b>liner</b> <b>hanger.</b> In 1985, the FlexLock <b>Liner</b> <b>Hanger</b> was introduced, extending the performance range and functionality of <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> systems. In 1987, the Brown <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> technology was merged into Baker Oil Tools. In 1992, BOT introduced the ZXP <b>Liner</b> <b>Hanger</b> Packer, with expandable metal seals, which set the stage for development of expandable screens, casing systems and liner hangers.|$|E

The expandable <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> is basically an evolution of existing equipment currently {{used in the}} oil industry, a product with better thru bore and envisaged higher reliability. The Case hole clad provide a casing patch across a damaged section of casing, or to close off previously perforated casing. This product has two main advantages - minimal through bore loss two times the wall thickness of tubular being expanded and high pressure integrity performance.|$|E

40|$|This thesis has {{proposed}} a slender well concept for exploration drilling with 15000 psi pressure rating based on enabling technologies. The main findings relates {{to the use of}} expandable liner hangers to reduce the required radial clearance between consecutive casing sections. Finite element analysis of the <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> expansion is performed in Ansys Workbench, a platform for advanced engineering simulations. The background for the thesis relates to the high cost of constructing offshore wells. There is a potential for considerable cost reduction by starting the well with a substantially smaller diameter, without compromising the final pipe size across the zone of interest. The topic builds on ongoing research in SBBU – Centre for drilling and wells for improved recovery, a joint project between NTNU, Sintef, University in Stavanger and IRIS. The slender well concept renders the possibility to use modified 3 rd or 4 th generation semi-submersible rigs. These rigs have significantly lower day-rates compared to new 5 th and 6 th generation rigs. Cost reduction is also expected with respect to consumption of steel for casing, drilling fluids and cement. Additional savings in steel is obtained by basing the casing program mainly on liners. The expandable <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> of choice is based on the XPak <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> developed by TIW. Finite element analysis indicated that a pressure rating of 15000 psi is feasible with the proposed <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> system. To avoid reduction in burst and collapse rating, the expansion mandrel is retained in the <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> after expansion. The mandrel is designed such that it creates an internal flush design with the liner string. It is recommended to use metal-to-metal sealing to avoid communication around the liner top. The slender well is constructed with limited radial clearance between consecutive casing sections. The problem of high surge pressures during running in hole is overcome by introducing a surge protection system with an artificial inner annulus to displace drilling fluids. The concept of pre-installing a liner string in the surface casing is introduced to render the possibility of an additional casing section and reduction in riser ID. The concept is untested and further evaluation is recommended. For further work on the topic proper field testing is recommended to validate the reliability of the concept. An assessment of slender well production drilling is also recommended to fully exploit the potential in slender well design. More detailed analysis and testing is necessary to qualify the expandable <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> for 15000 psi. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn liner cementing, {{the upper}} cement plug and inner {{components}} of a common hanger needs to be drilled out after cementing, which {{will result in a}} poor cementing quality or even gas leakage at the flare opening. Therefore, a new packer-type drilling-free <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> has been developed, and a hydraulic setting-control packer, a flexible drilling-free seal box, and an auxiliary bearing back-off mechanism that go with the line hanger have been designed at the same time. Specific operation procedures include: (1) run in the liner string to the designed depth, then fully circulate the drilling fluid, finally drop the ball. When the tripping ball gets into the seat, the pressure will go up to cut off the hanging control pin and set the hanger; (2) continue to hold the pressure and cut off the ball seat pin to form circulation; (3) trip in the drill pipe to exert pressure on the hanger, back off to release the hanger from the running tool; (4) lower the drill pipe plug upon the completion of cement injection, cut off the releasing control pin of hollow casing plug, and run down further to bump with the bumping assembly; (5) remove the cementing head and connect the kelly driver, hold pressure again, then slowly pull up the drill tools, exert hydraulic pressure on the setting hydraulic cylinder of the packer assembly to cut off the setting control pin and set the packer; and (6) pull up the tools to the flare opening and wash out excessive cement slurry by circulating to realize free drilling of the whole hole. The successful application of the <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> in 127  mm diameter liner in Well BQ 203 -H 1 indicates that the packer-type <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> has such advantages as easy hanging and back-off, accurate bumping, simple setting, and sound sealing performance...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{foremost}} goal {{of primary}} cementing {{is to provide}} zonal isolation in a well. Cementing of the casing/liner set right above the reservoir on the Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields {{are associated with a}} lot of challenges. Depletion and water flooding of a reservoir makes drilling and cementing increasingly difficult. At the Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields, the operational window above the reservoir is very narrow and difficult to predict due to the regression of fracture pressure the last 200 ft above the reservoir. This coupled with the natural faults and fractures in this area makes lost circulation a hindrance to provide zonal isolation. Cement history on the two fields shows that there is a very low chance of achieving required casing cement isolation. Historical practices within the last two years have been analysed trying to find the root causes of any failure to meet the company requirements. A review of potential solutions to solve the issue has been presented. Different studies have been made, including hydraulic simulations, to come up with suggestions on how to reach the cement target for the two fields. In addition, simulations on how to cement the entire Miocene section were performed. A study performed in WellPlanTM-Opticem revealed that there still exist some challenges before the cement design and real time jobs can be properly imported and analysed in the software. During the work lack of cement job data storage system was discovered. A new way of cement data storage was suggested and established. Collection and analyses of cement jobs during the last two years on the M-wells was performed in order to investigate if there was a trend between lost circulation and different parameters. No clear trend was found. Hydraulic simulations were performed to investigate how different parameters impact the equivalent circulating density. A colloidal light weight cement was utilized in the simulations. The main results from the simulations showed that; Warp OBM is superior to Versatec OBM system from a well cementing perspective, the expandable <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> imposed a very high ECD and the <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> dimensions needs {{to be taken into account}} in hydraulic simulations. The overall outcome of the simulations indicates a possible solution on how to cement back to the previous casing shoe...|$|E
30|$|The casing {{program is}} the most crucial feature that {{influences}} successful drilling operations and the longevity of the future geothermal fluid production. It implies assessing casing setting depths, a number of casing strings, nominal casing weight, casing material, type of connections and well completion. The main functions of casing programs are preventing casing deformation, supporting blow-out preventers and permanent wellhead, containing drilling and production fluids, preventing groundwater contamination, mitigating drilling fluid losses, protecting wells from corrosion, fracturing and erosion, preventing inter-zonal cross-contamination of geothermal fluids, defining a production zone and providing access to the reservoir (New Zealand Standard 2015). Conventional high-temperature (also called high-enthalpy) geothermal wells consist usually of three–four cemented casing strings. The typical casing program for most geothermal wells incorporates a conductor pipe, a surface casing, an intermediate casing which may serve as an anchor casing (i.e., casing string to which wellhead is attached), a production casing and an optional perforated liner (holed or slotted). All of these casing strings mentioned are cemented from casing shoe to top of casing string to prevent corrosion resulting from migration of reservoir fluids and to control thermal expansion during fluid production. A liner pipe, which is either suspended from a <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> or set at the well bottom, is usually left uncemented in the production section of the well. The completion is finalized by assembling a permanent wellhead {{at the top of}} the well. In most cases, it includes an expansion spool placed directly below the first master valve, which allows for expansion of the uppermost parts of the production casing string with respect to the anchor casing to which the permanent wellhead is attached.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringFoam {{cementing}} {{the reservoir}} liner {{has proven to}} be a good solution for achieving zonal isolation due to its low permeability and high compressive strength. However, out of the 32 reservoir liners cemented on the Ekofisk M platform only 16 were defined as 100 % successful. In this thesis foam cement and liner string components are introduced before evaluating the outcome of the different jobs. A success criterion for the outcome is established, incorporating liner centralization, zonal isolation and liner movement. The criterion regards the outcome a success if liner manipulation is maintained throughout the job and no remedial job is needed, a semi-success if manipulation is maintained for most of the job and no remedial job is needed, and a failure if none of the previously mentioned. Data from all the reservoir liner cementing operations are gathered and the outcome of each is evaluated based on the above criterion. 16 of the liners were cemented successfully, 6 were semi-successfully, and the last 10 were failures. Failing to reestablish rotation after setting the <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> is the most common reason for failure, 7 out of 10 failures can be related to this. Wellbore inclination and liner length are both parameters which seems to contribute to the outcome of foam cementing the reservoir liner. 13 of the 32 wells have an inclination above 80 º at the liner shoe. Out of these 13 wells only 4 are regarded as successful, the rest are either semi-successful, 4, or failures, 5. Even though failures are observed for all inclinations, this happens more frequently at higher inclination. The success rate also seems to be influenced be the length of the liner. For shorter liners, i. e. with a length below 2000 ft, nearly 78 % of the cement jobs were successful, whereas the same percentage for liners with a length between 5000 ft and 6000 ft is 25 %. In fact, a near linear trend is observed for the success rate as the length increases...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{difficult}} Venezuelan cementing challenges occur when zones with low fracture gradients or lost circulation problems are encountered. As more wells are drilled through depleted reservoirs, these problems are becoming more common. For PDVSA GAS Anaco in Venezuela, managed-pressure drilling (MPD) is of value when drilling through formations of this type, such as Merecure and San Juan sands in the San Joaquin field. MPD demonstrates its value by minimizing the loss of expensive oil-based mud and by increasing the typical drilling penetration rates up to three-fold. Formation damage may be further minimized when cementing these production strings with special zonal isolation procedures and cementing materials. With MPD, the intent is to apply proven underbalanced (UB) drilling technology and tools to precisely manage and control the annular fluid pressures safely within the wellbore to fit the given mud window. Before cementing, the well is typically close to balanced or slightly underbalanced and must be controlled with a UB choke manifold. The cementing fluid densities and pumping rates are designed so {{that at the end of}} the job, the resulting equivalent circulating density (ECD) is also near-balanced or slightly underbalanced. The <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> packer is set as soon as possible after checking the valves on the cementing float system to reduce the time any gas could migrate up through this specially designed new light or ultra-lightweight cement system. With these new light and ultra-lightweight cementing techniques, MPD-drilled wells can now be cemented with minimal formation damage, providing useful zonal isolation when subsequent well intervention is required. PDVSA Anaco is committed to continuing to drill MPD wells in San Joaquin. This paper will present the G- 92 well case study showing the effectiveness of the new 10 ppg lightweight cement for this particular 7 -in. liner job. The liner was cemented at 9, 304 ft with a final equivalent gradient of 0. 5449 psi/ft...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} development in logging tools designed to acquire information of the downhole events during drilling operations. This development has not been as significant in completion operations, making it difficult to analyze successes and failures that occur downhole {{due to the lack of}} data. The i-Con Drill String Dynamics Logging Tool has been developed by Trican Completion Solutions to be used for downhole data acquisition in wells during completion operations. It contains sensors that measure downhole parameters such as pressure inside the installation string, annular pressure, torque, temperature and axial loads. As of June 2016, the i-Con tool has been run during the installation of lower completion in five wells at the Ivar Aasen Field. The wells are all long, horizontal oil producers from 4600 m MD to 6200 m MD, completed with sand screens. During the installation, the tool was located directly above the <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> running tool as this was the main point of interest in the well. The downhole data acquired by the tool in the five oil producers was analyzed, with particular attention payed to five specific downhole events: 1 - Installation of the lower completion 2 - Anchoring the lower completion 3 - Circulation through the lower completion 4 - Isolating the lower completion 5 - Pressure testing the lower completion The goal of this analysis was to determine the typical fingerprint behavior for each event, and to evaluate areas of improved visibility that appear when using downhole data in addition to surface data. In order to achieve this, plots were made in Microsoft Excel. Some plots show all data from the lower completion installations, while others only display relevant data for each downhole event. The main findings based on the analysis include that there are clear fingerprint behaviors for several variables in many of the downhole events. The acquired downhole data provides new information to draw a more complete picture of the downhole events taking place in the five oil producers at Ivar Aasen. Another more general conclusion is that downhole data sets like these can be used to adjust and optimize future completion operations. It also provides documentation and verification that tools have run through their intended cycles and operations. Verification like this have become more demanded post Macondo...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of horizontal drilling {{in recent years has}} shown that horizontal wells can be successfully used both at the initial and late stages of development. This {{is due to the fact}} that horizontal wells, in contrast to vertical wells, contact a larger area of ​​the productive formation, while the surface of drainage of the oil-saturated layer, productivity of the wells due to the formation of cracks, and also the influence on thin layers increases. One of the methods of impact on the reservoir is the steam-thermal method. The main advantage of the use of the heat wave method in horizontal wells is a significant increase in the well production rate, a decrease in the water cut of the reservoir, a decrease in the oil viscosity, an increase in the injectivity of the injection well, and an increase in the inflow in producing wells. As a result of the total effect, a significant increase in production is obtained throughout the entire deposit. Enhanced oil recovery from the injection of steam is achieved by reducing the viscosity of oil, covering the reservoir with steam, distilling oil and extracting with a solvent. All this increases the displacement coefficient. One of the most effective ways to increase oil recovery at a late stage of field operation is sidetracking in emergency, highly watered and low-productive wells. This leads to the development of residual reserves in weakly drained zones of reservoirs with a substantial increase in well productivity in low-permeable reservoirs. This approach assumes that the initial drilling of wells is a ‘pilot’ stage, which precedes the development of oil reserves in the late stages of deposit development. In the fields of Western Siberia, multiple hydraulic fracturing of the reservoir has been improved due to a special stinger in the <b>liner</b> <b>hanger</b> of multi-packer installation, which excludes the influence of high pressures on the production column under the multiple hydraulic fracturing. Employees of BelNIPIneft RUPPO Belorusneft have developed equipment and technologies for creating a network of deep permeable radial filtration channels under the SKIF trademark, which is based not just on multiple hydraulic fracturing of a formation, but on hydraulic fracturing in each of the interlayers creating a network of deeply penetrating radial channels. The calculations show that the technology of deeply penetrating radial channels significantly increases the production rates in comparison with the multiple hydraulic fracturing technology. In China and other countries, deep-seated, low-permeability carbonate reservoirs are operated with the use of an acid fracturing in open horizontal trunks with two technological innovations at the final stage of drilling: reorientation of the fracture and retraction of the fluid...|$|E
40|$|Slender well {{drilling}} {{is a method}} that drills smaller holes and is more economical than conventional drilling due {{to the use of}} smaller equipment and rigs. Using the different tools for drilling slender wells, such as expandable reamers and expandable liners means that very deep wells can be drilled. If unexpected problems such as lost circulation or over pressured zones are faced, an expandable liner can be set. This type of solution imply very little or non- loss in diameter of the section. Reducing the amount of drill cuttings, steel, mud and cement means that less storage space is needed on the rig. Less storage needs means that a smaller and lower cost rig can be used. Using smaller equipment will also reduce the risk of the operations because the equipment is easier to handle during drilling and lifting operations. Avoiding the largest hole sizes and drilling more holes in the optimum range for ROP will reduce drilling time. There can also be some disadvantages with drilling slender wells. The equipment will be weaker if small holes are drilled, {{this is due to the}} small size of the equipment. In addition to this, hole cleaning can be a problem if mostly liners are used in the well and the well thereby have an upper sections with diameter that is significantly larger than the lower sections, since this will cause a large difference in the annular velocity of mud. The main objective with the thesis is to investigate the potential of using slender wells for exploration and production, as well as giving an overview of slender wells and how they are drilled. The work includes well construction, casing design and hydraulic calculations. The slender well designs are then to be compared with the conventional well design by looking at material savings. Pressure data from a high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) field in the North Sea was used. One of the objectives was to design a slender exploration well for 15 000 psi pressure rating. In addition to this a slender exploration well and a slender production well were designed using a water depth of 360 m. Based in the investigation slender well designs are feasible. The slender exploration wells are drilled in 5 sections, using a riser with an ID of 8 5 / 8 ” and an 11 ” wellhead (WH) and BOP. A 20 ” conductor casing is set, followed by an 11 3 / 4 ” surface casing with an 8 5 / 8 ” PIL. Then a 7 ” liner is set, before the well is drilled through the reservoir using a 5 7 / 8 ” drill bit. In the slender production well, an extra casing point is added to the well compared to the conventional well design, this allows more complicated wells to be drilled, or to cope with unexpected drilling problems. For drilling the slender exploration well, a riser with an ID of 12 1 / 2 " is used together with an 11 ” WH and BOP. The surface casing has a diameter of 20 ”, followed by a 14 ” surface casing with a 10 3 / 4 ” PIL. An 8 5 / 8 ” liner is set below the 10 3 / 4 " PIL. To maintain pressure integrity we install an 8 5 / 8 x 6 5 / 8 ” casing in the next section to isolate the liners, before the well is drilled to target depth (TD) where a 4 1 / 2 " liner is set. The volume of drill cuttings from drilling the slender exploration well was reduced by 61, 1 % compared to the conventional well. For the slender production well, the reduction was 53, 5 %. The volume of steel for casings and liners in the well was reduced by 59, 1 % for the exploration well and 20, 1 % for the production compared to conventional well design. The mud volume needed in the well was reduced by 53, 2 % for the slender exploration well compared to the conventional well, for the slender exploration well, the reduction in mud volume was 45, 2 %. Further focus should be on well completion equipment for 15 K pressure rating. This include expandable <b>liner</b> <b>hanger,</b> wellhead, BOP etc. A comparison of equipment for 10 K versus 15 K would have been of interest. Another important aspect is the time and cost saving from drilling slender wells. </p...|$|E
