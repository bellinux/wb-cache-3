30|$|The {{traditional}} protection {{methods for}} {{the mold of}} the injection molding machine mainly include the <b>low-voltage</b> <b>protection,</b> setting the limit parameters, the current monitoring, setting the upper limit of the time, and so on [6, 7]. This type of methods requires the addition of sophisticated equipment, which will increase the cost {{and at the same}} time make the injection molding process complicated [8]. The machine vision inspection technology has the characteristics of non-contact, high precision, high efficiency, and so on. And its application to the protection of the injection molds has become the research hotspot at present [9, 10]. The integrated development environment for the image processing based on the machine vision is generally composed of an industrial personal computer for the operation of the integrated development environment model for the image processing and a set of image acquisition and control equipment which is used as the bridge between the industrial personal computer and the injection molding machine [11]. In the aspect of the integrated development environment model for the image processing, the host computer interactive interface is used to set the region of interest. And the difference image of the image to be measured and the template image is obtained by the background subtraction method. Subsequently, threshold segmentation and binarization are carried out. And then the statistics of the black points in the binary image is carried out to determine whether there is residue. In the same way, the host computer interactive interface is used to set the region of interest. Subsequently, the light compensation and the image alignment algorithm are used to perform the preprocessing. And then differential operation is carried out on the binary image of the image to be measured and the binary image of the background image. Finally, in accordance with the threshold value, it is determined whether there is residue. Through the gray feature matching algorithm, filter preprocessing is carried out on the image. And the canny operator is used to extract the geometric contour features of the mold and then carry out the template matching. Image background subtraction detection algorithm is used to carry out the similarity calculation through the template matching algorithm [12, 13]. The region of interest is identified by means of template matching. And the similarity judgment is carried out on the template of the gray level co-occurrence matrix and the detection image. The above algorithm in the literature requires an industrial personal computer hardware environment with relatively large memory and high main frequency to meet the real-time and precision requirements of the image detection. The cost of such equipment is high, and there is certain limitation in the popularization and application. The visualized mold protection based on image processing has become a new direction of exploration. In the literature, TQ 2440 is used to build a visual mold protection platform. The mold protection algorithm makes use of the background subtraction method, which, however, does not take into consideration the error caused by the image shift that is generated due to the mechanical vibration in the actual applications. The mold monitoring system based on TMS 320 DM 6473 adopts the basic anomaly detection algorithm and the template matching algorithm based on the dual detection of the local binary pattern anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm is complicated and the setting conditions are excessively ideal [14]. In recent years, the digital image technology has attracted great attention and achieved considerable development. It has been widely used in various fields. The research on the image technology has been carried out in universities, research institutes, and companies, which is increasingly deepened and carried out in a systematic manner. Great attention is paid to the inheritance of knowledge and algorithm reuse [15 – 21], the pursuit of high efficiency, and low cost. Therefore, it is necessary to provide an environment with powerful support for the learning, research, and development of the image algorithm.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Lightning {{protection}} for power supply of electronic equipment {{is an important}} problem of <b>low-voltage</b> lightning <b>protection</b> systems. In this paper, lightning characteristics of electronic equipment’s power supply are studied. Firstly impulse generator is developed. Then lightning characteristics tests for different powersupply, such as switch model power supply, are done. Test results show: different power supply has different lightning impulse characteristics. Usually two different models are used for lightning performance evaluation: common and different model. Both impulse current and impulse voltage withstand capability in common model are stronger than those in different model. Flashover often occurs in the AC-DC conversion part inside of the switch power supply when there is lightning stroke. The manufacturing technology of the power supply has definite effect on withstand capability. The switch model power supply ha...|$|R

40|$|We propose {{an input}} {{protection}} scheme composed of thyristor devices only without using a clamp NMOS device {{in order to}} minimize the area consumed by a pad structure in CMOS RF ICs. For this purpose, we suggest <b>low-voltage</b> triggering thyristor <b>protection</b> device structures assuming usage of standard CMOS processes, and attempt an in-depth comparison study with a conventional thyristor protection scheme incorporating a clamp NMOS device. The comparison study mainly focuses on robustness against the HBM ESD in terms of peak voltages applied to gate oxides in an input buffer and lattice heating inside protection devices based on DC and mixed-mode transient analyses utilizing a 2 -dimensional device simulator. We constructed an equivalent circuit for the input HBM test environment of the CMOS chip equipped with the input ESD protection devices. And by executing mixed-mode simulations including up to four protection devices and analyzing the results for five different test modes, we attempt a detailed analysis on the problems which can occur in real HBM tests. We figure out strength of the proposed thyristor-only protection scheme, and suggest guidelines relating the design of the protection devices and circuits...|$|R
