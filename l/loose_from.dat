5|$|August 24, 1827– Two {{people are}} killed when the Diamond Shoals Lightship becomes <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> its moorings, {{due to a}} landfalling {{hurricane}} along the state's coastline. Damage is reported across the eastern portion of the state.|$|E
5|$|On lap 48, Michele Alboreto {{came in for}} a pit stop, but as he left, the rear-right wheel came <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> the Minardi as it {{left the}} pit lane, {{striking}} two Ferrari and two Lotus mechanics, who were left needing hospital treatment.|$|E
5|$|As James and Scamper {{entered the}} arena that night, Scamper caught his bridle {{on the side}} of the gate, dislodging the Chicago screws. With no screws, the headstall broke <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> the bridle after she made the turn around the first barrel. When she strove for the second barrel, the bridle was hanging from the horse's mouth to down under his foot. Meanwhile, she is trying to hold that bit in his mouth. But coming to the third barrel, she has to turn his head loose.|$|E

60|$|The lama {{fell back}} on Urdu, remembering {{that he was in}} a strange land. 'Hear the tale of the Arrow which our Lord <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> the bow,' he said.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere, several {{ships were}} {{caught off guard}} by the late arrival of Jeanne. The cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico, and two barges broke <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> towing vessels via strong winds and high waves. One barge was an oil rig tender that {{contained}} 16people; it was carried several hundred miles across the central Gulf of Mexico. All crew members survived, {{and there were no}} maritime deaths related to the hurricane. Jeanne produced a prolonged period of rough surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast. Tides reached 2 to 4feet (1.20m) above normal. The hurricane caused coastal flooding; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston.|$|E
5|$|On one occasion, the Cable Junction Island set, {{which was}} built on a barge, broke <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> its {{anchorage}} {{and had to be}} rescued. Szwarc was contacted one night and told that his island was drifting towards Cuba. Real hammerhead sharks circled the teen actors during the filming of one shot. Because the characters they were playing were meant to be in distress, the crew (filming from a distance) did not realize that the actors were genuinely calling for help.|$|E
5|$|She was {{assigned}} to the Channel Fleet in mid-1889 as a flagship for the fleet's second-in-command. Two years later, Anson accidentally sank a passenger ship when the latter broke <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> her anchors during a strong storm and collided with her. The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in mid-1893 and returned home in 1900 when she {{was assigned}} to the Reserve Fleet. She recommissioned for the Home Fleet in early 1901. Anson was paid off three years later and then sold for scrap in 1909.|$|E
60|$|This threat put {{a sudden}} end to Rokoff's brutality, {{for he had}} no craving to see Tarzan <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> his bonds while he was within reach of those {{powerful}} hands.|$|R
50|$|This might {{refer to}} Angrboda as {{mother of the}} three monsters. The seeress states that she will never be charmed from the dead again until Loki is <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> his bonds.|$|R
60|$|Every hand {{seemed to}} be {{forwarding}} the pursuivant and the child, and it was Giles Headley, who, <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> the hold of the executioner, stared wildly about him, like one distraught.|$|R
5|$|The {{drift of}} the Antarctic {{exploration}} vessel SY Aurora was an ordeal which lasted 312days, during the Ross Sea chapter of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–17. It {{began when the}} ship broke <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> its anchorage in McMurdo Sound in May 1915, during a gale. Caught in heavy pack ice and unable to manoeuvre, Aurora, with eighteen men aboard, was carried into the open waters of the Ross Sea and Southern Ocean, leaving ten men stranded ashore with meagre provisions.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{itself is}} {{four and a}} half minutes long but {{original}} footage for the ride {{can be seen in the}} queue, and there is also a pre-show video. In the ride, patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. Sideshow Bob, however, is <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. At least 24 regular characters from the series make an appearance, all voiced by their original actors. Along with the attraction is a gift shop modeled after the Kwik-E-Mart, which opened in late 2007.|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E

6000|$|When the boat, creaking, and groaning, and puffing, had <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> the wharf, and was {{beginning}} slowly to strain herself along, the woman {{returned to her}} old seat. The trader was sitting there,--the child was gone! ...|$|R
5|$|During the night, Sideshow Bob {{reaches the}} {{houseboat}} and cuts it <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> the dock. Sideshow Bob then ties up Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, and Santa's Little Helper {{to ensure they}} will not interfere with his plan. Sideshow Bob enters Bart's room, ready to kill him. Bart flees {{out the window and}} tries to escape, but he cannot jump off the boat. Sideshow Bob catches up to Bart and offers him a last request. Having noticed a sign saying that Springfield is fifteen miles away, Bart gets an idea; he compliments Sideshow Bob on his beautiful voice and asks him to sing the entire score of the H.M.S. Pinafore, to stall for time as the houseboat floats to Springfield. After the performance, Sideshow Bob advances on Bart again, but the boat runs aground, interrupting Sideshow Bob before he can finish him off. Sideshow Bob is arrested, and the Simpsons return home.|$|E
5|$|Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{was built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{dockyard}} in Trieste. She was laid down on 12 September 1907 and launched from the slipway on 8 September 1908. The teak used on her deck was the only material Austria-Hungary purchased abroad to build her. A {{month and a half}} after her launch, she was towed to the harbor in Muggia for completion. During a severe storm that night, she broke <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> her moorings; with no crewmen aboard, Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand drifted for several hours before running aground just off Izola. The following morning, the navy located her and started to refloat her. Completion was delayed by a welders' strike in 1908 and a riveters' strike in 1909. Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was the first ship of the class to be completed, and she was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 5 June 1910.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} that The Simpsons Ride, a simulator ride, would be implemented into the Universal Studios Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood. It officially opened May 15, 2008 in Florida and May 19, 2008, in Hollywood. In the ride, patrons {{are introduced to}} a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. However, Sideshow Bob is <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. It features more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features {{the voices of the}} regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer did not participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts.|$|E
60|$|Without {{saying a}} word to his friend, he {{tightened}} his belt, and started off like a hound <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> the leash. Little Tim ran {{a few hundred yards}} after him at top speed, but suddenly pulled up.|$|R
60|$|She {{returned}} to her room to wait for Ursula and Birkin. She wanted to get away, only to get away. She could not think or feel until she had got away, till she was <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> this position.|$|R
60|$|Eva's {{clear blue}} eye looked earnestly {{from one to}} the other. It was the calm, comprehending gaze of a soul half <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> its earthly bonds; it was evident she saw, felt, and appreciated, the {{difference}} between the two.|$|R
5|$|Now at his wit's end, Presto storms {{backstage}} {{to catch}} Alec, but he accidentally releases a weight holding down some stage props, and his foot gets {{caught in a}} rope that lifts {{him up to the}} fly space above the stage. When his foot comes <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> the rope, he falls, along with suspended scenery (including a piano). Alec, realizing that Presto will be crushed, uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the apparently restored carrot, as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show, and they are rewarded for each show they do, with roses for Presto and carrots for Alec.|$|E
5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Indiana class included bilge keels, but with keels they would not fit {{in any of the}} American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana, when both main turrets broke <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.|$|E
60|$|The {{morning of}} the {{eleventh}} day dawned, and there returned no Deesa, Moti Guj was <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> his ropes for the daily stint. He swung clear, looked round, shrugged his shoulders, {{and began to walk}} away, as one having business elsewhere.|$|R
6000|$|She {{described}} how Amada had appeared, clad as a priestess, {{how she had}} put up her prayer to the four high priests seated in state, demanding to be <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> her vow [...] "for the sake of her heart and of Egypt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What is {{the fate}} of {{discovered}} traitors, friend?' {{he said in a}} voice that, quiet though it was, sounded very terrible; and, as he spoke, he <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> his side the war club set with spikes of glass that hung there by a thong.|$|R
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Häkkinen {{said that he was}} happy with his race victory which he believed would help his confidence throughout the remainder of the season. Häkkinen added that his team displayed pit boards which instructed him not to over rev his engine during the race's first half. Coulthard said that he was satisfied with the outcome of the first lap as it allowed him to drive a conservative race. He added that his strong finish would not mean that he would think about his potential to clinch the Drivers' Championship. Barrichello explained that his car was <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> contact with Trulli during the race's early stages which prevented him from challenging de la Rosa.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the first}} Persian {{invasion}} of Greece effectively {{began in the}} following year, 492 BC, when Mardonius was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible. Thrace was re-subjugated, having broken <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> Persian rule during the revolts and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster. A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the Cyclades, before arriving off Euboea. Eretria was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto Attica. Landing at the Bay of Marathon, they were met by an Athenian army and defeated in the famous Battle of Marathon, ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves <b>loose</b> <b>from</b> the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E
40|$|Environmental and {{economic}} {{aspects of the}} mineral resources use into balanced development of society have been considered. It is impossible fully to compensate all <b>looses</b> <b>from</b> production activity and reworking of minerals.

60|$|And then Lou looked, and {{saw that}} {{something}} better than prosperity had descended upon Nancy--something that shone brighter than gems {{in her eyes and}} redder than a rose in her cheeks, and that danced like electricity anxious to be <b>loosed</b> <b>from</b> the tip of her tongue.|$|R
