50|$|It is {{suspected}} that in 1951, mercury(II) hydride was synthesised {{for the first}} time by Wiberg et al, by the ethereal reaction of mercury(II) iodide and <b>lithium</b> <b>tetrahydroaluminate.</b> In 1993 Legay-Sommaire announced HgH2 production in cryogenic argon and krypton matrices with a KrF laser. In 2004, solid HgH2 was definitively synthesised and consequentially analysed, by Xuefeng Wang and Lester Andrews, by direct matrix isolation reaction of excited mercury with molecular hydrogen.In 2005, gaseous HgH2 was synthesised by Alireza Shayesteh et al, by the direct gas-phase reaction of excited mercury with molecular hydrogen at standard temperature; and Xuefeng Wang and Lester Andrews determined the structure of solid mercury HgH2, to be a molecular solid.|$|E
40|$|The aza crown, sym- 1, 2 -benzo-aza- 17 -crown- 5, was {{synthesized}} from 6 -aza- 3, 9 -dioxa- 1, 11 -undecanediol, and, -dibromo-o-xylene in {{the presence}} of potassium tert-butoxide. This new crown ether was reacted with 4 -bromobenzyl bromide and chloroacetyl chloride to form the N-substituted 4 -bromobenzyl and chloroacetyl derivatives, respectively. The aza crown and its derivatives were identified with spectroscopic data. The bidentate phosphine amine, Ph 2 P(CH 2) 3 NH 2, was prepared via reduction of 3 -(diphenylphosphino) propionitrile by <b>lithium</b> <b>tetrahydroaluminate.</b> Schiff-base reactions between the amine group in Ph 2 P(CH 2) 3 NH 2 and the aldehyde group in benzaldehyde and 4 -formyl-benzo- 15 -crown- 5 provided the respective phosphine derivatives. These products were identified with spectroscopic and analytical data. Finally, palladium derivatives of these phosphine-Shiff base ligands (Ph 2 P(CH 2) 3 NCHR; R = Ph, benzo- 15 -crown- 5) were synthesized from the reactions between (Ph 2 CN) 2 PdCl 2 and the ligands.

40|$|The hyperbranched {{aliphatic}} polyester grafted {{activated carbon}} (HAPE-AC), was successfully {{prepared by the}} simple "one-pot" method. The surface functional groups of commercial activated carbon particles were homogenized to hydroxyl groups by being oxidized with nitric acid and then reduced with <b>lithium</b> <b>tetrahydroaluminate</b> (LiAlH 4) at first. Secondly, the surface hydroxyl groups were used as the active sites for the solution polycondensation of the AB 2 monomer, 2, 2 -bis(hydroxymethyl) propionic acid (bis-MPA), with the catalysis of p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA). The homogenization of the surface groups of the activated carbon particles and the graft polymerization of the hyperbranched aliphatic polyester were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique. The products were also characterized with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The competitive adsorption properties of the products toward the heavy metal ions (Cu(II), Hg(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II)) also proved the translations of the surface groups.

40|$|The {{well-defined}} poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA) brushes were grafted {{from the}} surfaces of the activated carbon (AC) powder with the controlled/"living" radical polymerization technique. First, surface functional groups of the AC powder were homogenized to hydroxyl groups by oxidizing with nitric acid and then reducing with <b>lithium</b> <b>tetrahydroaluminate</b> (LiAlH 4) at first. Second, the surface hydroxyl groups were treated with bromoacetylbromide, and the bromoacetyl groups were introduced. And in the third step, the bromoacetyl activated carbon (BrA-AC) powder were used as macro-initiators for the surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) of hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) {{in the presence of}} 1, 10 -phenanthroline and Cu(I) Br as catalyst in a water system. The graft parameters calculated from the elemental analyses (EA) results, conversion of monemer (C%) and percentage of grafting (PG%) were 5. 74 % and 28. 7 %, respectively, after polymerizing for 5 h. The graft polymerizations exhibited the characteristics of a controlled/"living" polymerization, and no homopolymer was found in the proposed polymerizing process. The preparation procedure of the poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate) grafted activated carbon (PHEA-AC) powder was also investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The PHEA-AC powder is expected to be used as selective adsorbents because of their abundant homogenized surface hydroxyl groups.
