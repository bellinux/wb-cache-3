5|$|Ascension was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reception. Critics recommended it as a party game favorable to Super Smash Bros. and praised its balance. However, some felt that its single-player mode was a low point, and lamented the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> online multiplayer mode.|$|E
5|$|Ng {{notes that}} her children's {{stories have been}} {{generally}} well received. However, some educators disagree with the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explicit moral message; Ng argues that her books have multiple interpretations: those by children and those by adults.|$|E

5|$|Despite his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{extensive}} formal education, Brock appreciated its importance. As an adult, {{he spent}} much time reading {{in an attempt to}} improve his education. He read many works on military tactics and science, but he also read ancient history and other less immediately practical topics. At the time of his death, he owned a modest library of books, including classic works by Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Samuel Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Game critics praised Giants for {{state-of-the-art}} graphics, humorous story, {{and success}} in blending in one genre with another. Criticisms of the game centered on crippling software bugs and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> in-game save feature. The console version rectified some of the flaws found in the PC versions, {{at the cost of}} removing several features. Giants sold poorly initially for both Windows and PlayStation2; however, it sold well afterwards and the game has gained a cult following.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson {{formed a}} {{committee}} to resolve the ongoing issue of the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official Canadian flag, sparking a serious debate about a flag change to replace the Union Flag. Out of three choices, the maple leaf design by George Stanley, based on {{the flag of the}} Royal Military College of Canada, was selected. The flag made its first official appearance on February 15, 1965; the date is now celebrated annually as National Flag of Canada Day.|$|E

Although some species can tolerate relatively low salinity, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> osmoregulation system probably explains why starfish are not found in fresh water or even in many estuarine environments.|$|E

5|$|The stamps {{were sold}} from post-offices {{across the country}} but some were also issued to postmen for sale. Sales started on 25 June 1849, however their use only became legal on 1 July. Because of the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{infrastructure}} of post boxes, particularly in rural areas, letters could be given directly to the postman in person rather than delivered to post offices to be sent.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Fallout Shelter {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Critics {{enjoyed the}} game's {{extension of the}} Fallout universe, the core gameplay, and its visual style. Common criticisms included the game's lack of depth, its use of unnecessary microtransactions, and its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ending. The game grossed $5.1 million in microtransaction sales {{in the first two}} weeks after its release.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} a Milankovitch cycle {{in the range of}} 100,000 years, related to Earth's orbital eccentricity, its {{contribution}} to variation in insolation is much smaller than those of precession and obliquity. The 100,000-year-problem refers to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> obvious explanation for the periodicity of ice ages at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not before, when the dominant periodicity corresponded to 41,000 years.|$|E

5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as a writer. He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the current}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Olympic stadium, Chicago has dozens of {{existing}} sport venues: Soldier Field, United Center, U.S. Cellular Field, Wrigley Field, Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, and Toyota Park in Bridgeview. Venues at Loyola University Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago State University, Northern Illinois University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, among others, were also available {{and had been}} mentioned in early news reports as possibilities. Northerly Island and the lakefront along Lake Michigan would have hosted all beach and water events. The McCormick Place convention center, the second largest in the world, was the planned venue for indoor events like judo and weightlifting, as well as hosting all press offices, while Archery and the medals podium were slated for Grant Park.|$|E

5|$|Emergency centers were prepped {{across the}} {{northern}} Cook Islands on February8. The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February9. Volunteers {{from the organization}} assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki. Anticipating high winds, residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters. Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue.|$|E
5|$|Following a final {{appearance}} at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions {{were removed from the}} Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee. Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions {{during the course of the}} Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars {{received}} generally positive reviews. Reviewers lauded the game's pre-rendered cinematics, {{attention to}} detail in replicating the Halo universe, and intuitive control scheme. Complaints against the game included the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> option to play as the Covenant faction in campaign mode {{as well as the}} lack of strategic options during play. Critics from GameSpot and USA Today wrote that experienced RTS players would find the strategic elements of the title shallow. The game sold one million units worldwide through March 2009, making it the best-selling console real-time strategy game to date. An enhanced version of the game—Halo Wars: Definitive Edition—was released for Windows and Xbox One. Halo Wars 2, a sequel developed by 343 Industries and Creative Assembly was released in February 2017.|$|E
