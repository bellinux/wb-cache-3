40|$|An {{improved}} {{ability to}} predict dilution for narrow vein deposits enables more accurate economic comparisons between mechanised <b>longhole</b> <b>stoping</b> and other narrow vein mining methods, {{as well as}} reducing uncertainty surrounding dilution estimates for deposits at the prefeasibility/ feasibility stage. This paper proposes narrow vein dilution prediction and minimisation strategies for both greenfield sites and operating mines, respectively. The narrow vein dilution method (NVD method) is a tool for more accurately predicting longhole narrow vein dilution. The method {{is based on a}} new concept called benchmark stoping width. Benchmark stoping width is based on probabilistic analysis of overbreak distributions from a typical longhole narrow vein mine. The premise for the NVD method is that dilution associated with <b>longhole</b> <b>stoping</b> can be predicted using the benchmark stoping width. In addition to dilution prediction, the NVD method also includes strategies for narrow vein dilution minimisation generally, including; filling, cablebolting, stress relaxation, extraction sequencing and blast overbreak...|$|E
40|$|Unplanned {{dilution}} and ore loss directly influence {{not only}} the productivity of underground stopes, but also the profitability of the entire mining process. Stope dilution {{is a result of}} complex interactions between a number of factors, and cannot be predicted prior to mining. In this study, unplanned dilution and ore loss prediction models were established using multiple linear and nonlinear regression analysis (MLRA and MNRA), as well as an artificial neural network (ANN) method based on 1067 datasets with ten causative factors from three underground <b>longhole</b> <b>stoping</b> mines in Western Australia. Models were established for individual mines, as well as a general model that includes all of the mine data-sets. The correlation coefficient (R) was used to evaluate the methods, and the values for MLRA, MNRA, and ANN compared with the general model were 0. 419, 0. 438, and 0. 719, respectively. Considering that the current unplanned dilution and ore loss prediction for the mines investigated yielded an R of 0. 088, the ANN model results are noteworthy. The proposed ANN model can be used directly as a practical tool to predict unplanned dilution and ore loss in mines, which will not only enhance productivity, but will also be beneficial for stope planning and design...|$|E
50|$|In November 2006 a {{feasibility}} study {{confirmed that the}} mine could be reopened at relatively low cost given its capacity.The required work included purchase of a new trackless equipment fleet, upgrades to pumping and ventilation equipment and some maintenance of the other infrastructure. The plan was to {{use a combination of}} the traditional room-and-pillar system and the more modern and effective <b>longhole</b> retreat <b>stoping</b> technique. The concentrator and Luilu metallurgical plant would be progressively upgraded as increasing amounts of ore became available.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based on {{confidential}} case studies collected from a Western Australian gold mine, known from here on in as ‘Mine X’. The primary mining method used at Mine X is <b>longhole</b> retreat open <b>stoping</b> with paste backfill. The main objective of this research project is to investigate which method/s is the most appropriate to develop the initial void for stope blasting at Mine X. Two methods were investigated during this research; conventional longhole rising and slashing against paste. Rising is a very common method, used frequently at Mine X {{as well as in}} the broader mining industry as determined through a literature review. Because of the common use of rising, it was expected to be a more reliable option resulting in a higher success rate. Slashing against paste, however, is a new method to the industry and not well documented, but was trialled as a possible cheaper option. These two methods were compared in terms of: success rate; drill and blast costs; limitations for their use; and benefits derived from combining the two methods. The analysis of the case studies revealed several key points. Firstly, the success rate estimated by comparing stope design geometry and final surveyed shape showed that both methods achieved the same success rate of 78 per cent. The cost analysis determined that the average rise required more than double the costs per tonne of rock than slashing against paste. Slashing against paste was found to be a much more restrictive option, requiring new stopes to be situated next to paste filled stopes of specific dimensions. Rising does not have these restrictions; however, more often required slot drives to be developed prior to stoping than slashing against paste. Combining the two methods proved to be a beneficial option having the advantages of both methods. Overall this study recommends, for Mine X, the use of slashing against paste over rising in situations where slashing against paste is permitted. All other situations should consider the use of rising or a combination of rising and slashing against paste. Upprättat; 2014; 20140919 (adrhal...|$|R
