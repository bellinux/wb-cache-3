Future capability may include tube-launched cruise missiles.|$|R
40|$|The {{multimode}} fiber bandwidth enhancement techniques {{to meet the}} Gigabit Ethernet standards for local area networks (LAN) of the Kennedy Space Center and other NASA centers have been discussed. Connector with lateral offset coupling between single mode <b>launch</b> <b>fiber</b> cable and the {{multimode fiber}} cable has been thoroughly investigated. An optimization of connector position offset for 8 km long optical fiber link at 1300 nm with 9 micrometer diameter single mode fiber (SMF) and 50 micrometer diameter multimode fiber (MMF) coupling has been obtained. The optimization is done in terms of bandwidth, eye-pattern, and bit pattern measurements. It is simpler, is a highly practical approach and is cheaper as no additional cost to manufacture the offset type of connectors is involved...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{fluorescence}} microscopy requires software-controlled illumination sources with high power {{across a wide}} range of wavelengths. Diode lasers meet the power requirements and combining multiple units into a single <b>fiber</b> <b>launch</b> expands their capability across the required spectral range. We present the NicoLase, an open-source diode laser combiner, <b>fiber</b> <b>launch,</b> and software sequence controller for {{fluorescence microscopy}} and super-resolution microscopy applications. Two configurations are described, giving four or six output wavelengths and one or two single-mode fiber outputs, with all CAD files, machinist drawings, and controller source code openly available...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a novel nonintrusive technique based on tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy to investigate human sinuses in vivo. The technique {{relies on the}} fact that free gases have spectral imprints that are about 10. 000 times sharper than spectral structures of the surrounding tissue. Two gases are detected; molecular oxygen at 760 nm and water vapor at 935 nm. Light is <b>launched</b> <b>fiber</b> optically into the tissue in close proximity to the particular maxillary sinus under study. When investigating the frontal sinuses, the fiber is positioned onto the caudal part of the frontal bone. Multiply scattered light in both cases is detected externally by a handheld probe. Molecular oxygen is detected in the maxillary sinuses on 11 volunteers, of which one had constantly recurring sinus problems. Significant oxygen absorption imprint differences can be observed between different volunteers and also left-right asymmetries. Water vapor can also be detected, and by normalizing the oxygen signal on the water vapor signal, the sinus oxygen concentration can be assessed. Gas exchange between the sinuses and the nasal cavity is also successfully demonstrated by flushing nitrogen through the nostril. Advantages over current ventilation assessment methods using ionizing radiation are pointed out...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of 405 -nm fiber-coupled diode laser systems {{with more than}} 50 mW power was investigated in detail with focus on the effects occurring at the input end. The coupling and transmission loss of the laser light {{were associated with the}} growth of a projection and a periodic structure on the input surface. To avoid this degradation, a short <b>launch</b> <b>fiber</b> with a good surface quality was used at the input end. In this way, the power transmission was stabilized for at least one month. However, structural degradation was noticed on the output surface of the single-mode fiber. To investigate this effect, the damaged samples were measured after different periods of time and examined with a scanning electron microscope and with an atomic force microscope. Reproducible spherical projections with a submicron periodic structure were found in the core region. Additionally, the spectral loss of the fiber was measured, showing the formation of color centers in the deep ultraviolet {{along the length of the}} fiber. These investigations were accompanied by simulations of the growth of the structure on the output surface. The influence of the structure was mainly on the divergence angle of the emitted laser beam, reducing the beam quality for applications...|$|R
40|$|Stimulated Raman {{scattering}} (SRS) in ultrahigh-Q (UHQ) surface-tension-induced spherical and chip-based toroid microcavities {{is considered}} both theoretically and experimentally. These microcavities are fabricated from silica, exhibit small mode volume (typically 1000 /spl mu/m/sup 3 /) and possess whispering-gallery type modes with long photon storage times (in {{the range of}} 100 ns), significantly reducing the threshold for stimulated nonlinear optical phenomena. Oscillation threshold levels of less than 100 /spl mu/W of <b>launched</b> <b>fiber</b> pump power, in microcavities with quality factors of 100 million are observed. Using a steady-state analysis of the coupled-mode equations for the pump and Raman whispering-gallery modes, the threshold, efficiencies and cascading properties of SRS in UHQ devices are derived. The results are experimentally confirmed in the telecommunication band (1550 nm) using tapered optical fibers as highly efficient waveguide coupling elements for both pumping and signal extraction. The device performance dependence on coupling, quality factor and modal volume are measured and found {{to be in good}} agreement with theory. This includes analysis of the threshold and efficiency for cascaded Raman scattering. The side-by-side study of nonlinear oscillation in both spherical microcavities and toroid microcavities on-a-chip also allows for comparison of their properties. In addition to the benefits of a wafer-scale geometry, including integration with optical, electrical, or mechanical functionality, microtoroids on-a-chip exhibit single mode Raman oscillation over a wide range of pump powers...|$|R
50|$|Note that a polarization-maintaining fiber {{does not}} {{polarize}} {{light as a}} polarizer does. Rather, PM fiber maintains the linear polarization of linearly polarized light provided that it is <b>launched</b> into the <b>fiber</b> aligned {{with one of the}} <b>fiber's</b> polarization modes. <b>Launching</b> linearly polarized light into the fiber at a different angle will excite both polarization modes, conducting the same wave at slightly different phase velocities. At most points along the fiber the net polarization will be an elliptically polarized state, with a return to the original polarization state after an integer number of beat lengths. Consequently, if visible laser light is <b>launched</b> into the <b>fiber</b> exciting both polarization modes, scattering of propagating light viewed from the side, is observed with a light and dark pattern periodic over each beat length, since scattering is preferentially perpendicular to the polarization direction.|$|R

50|$|In fiber optics, polarization-maintaining {{optical fiber}} (PMF or PM fiber) is a {{single-mode}} optical fiber in which linearly polarized light, if properly <b>launched</b> into the <b>fiber,</b> maintains a linear polarization during propagation, exiting the fiber {{in a specific}} linear polarization state; {{there is little or}} no cross-coupling of optical power between the two polarization modes. Such fiber is used in special applications where preserving polarization is essential.|$|R

In optical power budget attenuation is specified in decibels (dB) and optical power in dBms.|$|R

50|$|Since <b>launching</b> its <b>fiber</b> to {{the home}} service FiOS, {{industry}} insiders and experts have noted that Verizon has neglected its copper local loop infrastructure footprint-wide, including in areas yet to receive FiOS. Verizon's copper network maintenance and upgrade budget (which includes DSL and POTS services) {{was estimated to be}} roughly $3.50 per access line by the Communications Workers of America. The CWA filed a letter of concern with 11 public utility regulators regarding Verizon's lack of concern for the copper local loop and associated infrastructure. Rural communities in New Jersey filed a joint petition of complaint with the NJ Board of Public Utilities in order to investigate Verizon's apparent discontinuation of copper local loop maintenance; issues reported by the towns residents include loss of service during poor weather, static on the line, lack of audible voice transmission, and interruption or loss of DSL service.|$|R
