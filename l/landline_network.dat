50|$|Although {{the system}} is said to ensure a high {{probability}} of call completion, it is not without serious limitations. The WPS will not preempt calls in progress, so the user {{will have to wait}} for bandwidth to open. It is also not yet supported by all carriers. In order for a call to work, telephone infrastructure must be powered and functioning. Finally, a call that receives priority using WPS does not automatically get priority on <b>landline</b> <b>networks.</b> Therefore, congestion on the Public Switched Telephone Network may prevent the call from completion unless the user makes additional steps to access the GETS service for landline calls as well. Because of these and other limitations, the WPS explicitly does not guarantee call completion.|$|R

Currently, primacom is able to supply more than 90% of connected households with digital cable TV.From 1 May 2012 (i.e. after the nationwide shutdownAO1 of the analog satellite TV signal, see also www.klardigital.de or www.digitale-initiative.de) primacom will continue to offer all kinds of television signals including analog transmission. This is possible without any problems due to the modern backbone structure. Nevertheless, primacom stands for the digital future in television and claims {{to do everything possible to}} ensure that customers can enter the world of digital TV as quickly as possible. In the field of digital television primacom feeds among others the Eutelsat bouquet in the SD area. Beside the public and private television channels this provides access to new special-interest channels for family, film, sports, language, entertainment. Public and private high-definition channels of the RTL media group and ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG as well as the full SKY package are also available. primacom has been the first cable network operator in Germany, transmitting digital television already in 2000. This was also made possible because of the company's television signal that can be transmitted via IP in the backbone. This also means that primacom was one of the first IPTV provider in Germany and that the company is already prepared for a change to IPTV in the near future.• Primacom offers Internet speeds of up to 120MBit / s in its upgraded cable networks. By the end of 2011, all households that are connected to the backbone will be upgraded via the DOCSIS3.0 technology by the company in order to be able to offer 120MBit / s to all of these households.• Primacom offers a <b>landline</b> <b>network</b> product which operates via IP signal.

40|$|Mobile {{technology}} is currently {{emerging as the}} first extensive form of electronic communication system in many regions of Africa and Asia. This article analyses the appropriation of mobile phones in rural India by exploring what new social alternatives mobile phones enable and how these new social constellations relate to culture and cultural change. The ethnographic description relates phone usage to other communication patterns and ongoing processes of transformation. The article shows how the appropriation of phones draws from the local cultural and social context, but also that phones facilitate new patterns that show great similarity with social processes in other places where phones have been introduced as the first form of communication technology, such as the increased multiplicity of social contacts and the greater efficiency of market relationships. I argue that mobile technology amplifies ongoing processes of cultural change but does so selectively, so that it brings about the homogenization of ‘social logistics’. This article presents an ethnographic analysis of the appropriation of mobile technol-ogy in rural India, where, as in many regions of Africa and Asia, mobile phones are the first form of electronic communication technology to be widely used.
