5|$|Antlion larvae require <b>loose</b> <b>soil,</b> not {{necessarily}} but often sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself.|$|E
5|$|Forensic archaeologists {{can help}} {{determine}} potential grave sites {{that might have}} been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave. The <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it. The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.|$|E
5|$|At Valdez, {{construction}} was two-thirds complete by September as 4,200 workers hurried {{to complete the}} marine terminal. Because of <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> found at the job site, enormous retaining walls had to be constructed to secure the ground below some of the 58 structures that were completed {{by the end of}} the year. During the first week of November, the first ship docked at the newly built Valdez quays. It was not a tanker but a ship bringing more construction material. In December, the first signal was sent from the Valdez operations center—where two new control computers had been installed—to Pump Station 2 on the North Slope.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{covers the}} {{technology}} of stabilization of <b>loose</b> <b>soils</b> through the employment of silt-cement piles, or the so-called deep soil stabilization technology. It is applicable to various types of <b>loose</b> <b>soils,</b> including clay, sapropel, silt and peat. However, geotechnical and chemical properties of soils surely affect the stabilization efficiency and the choice for the stabilization material. The authors provide {{a brief overview of}} the soil stabilization technology employing silt-cement piles and based on the principle of dry mixing of water-saturated natural soil with cement. Thus, dry powder enters into the chemical reaction with the stream of water to reduce the content of water in the soil. The research into the bearing capacity of siltcement piles and the stabilized territory of moorings was performed in the Temryuk port. The co-objective of the research was to identify the operating conditions of cargo moorings in the Temryuk port constructed on <b>loose</b> <b>soils.</b> All conclusions were based on the field data, seismometric and laboratory tests. The analysis of and research into the operating conditions of moorings demonstrate the efficiency of the long-term operation of berthing facilities constructed on the soils stabilized by silt-cement piles. This methodology can be used to stabilize port territories, road beds of railways and highways constructed on <b>loose</b> <b>soils.</b> The authors also elaborate on the potential upgrade of categories of cargo moorings constructed on <b>loose</b> <b>soils</b> and stabilized by silt-cement piles. Calculation results and researches demonstrate that it is quite difficult to significantly upgrade loading categories in respect of open warehouse spaces, as silt-cement piles of the pre-set diameter cannot provide for the bearing capacity corresponding to the first category loading. The solution may consist in the change of the stabilization design with account for the thixotropic properties of clay soils. Structural solutions may consist in the selection of the pile foot designs that may stabilize <b>loose</b> clay <b>soils,</b> on the one hand, and meet the loading requirements, on the other hand.

5|$|Sandgrouse are principally seed eaters. Other {{food items}} eaten include green shoots and leaves, bulbs and berries. Insect food such as ants and {{termites}} may be eaten {{especially during the}} breeding season. The diet of many sandgrouse is highly specialised, with the seeds of {{a small number of}} plant species being dominant. This may depend on local availability but in other cases it reflects actual selection of favoured seeds over others by the sandgrouse. Seeds of leguminous plants are usually {{an important part of the}} diet. In agricultural areas oats and other grain are readily taken. Seeds are either collected from the ground or directly from the plants. Foraging techniques vary between species that coexist which reduces competition; in Namibia, double-banded sandgrouse feed slowly and methodically whilst Namaqua sandgrouse feed rapidly, exploring <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> with their beaks and flicking it away sideways. Grit is also swallowed to help grind up food in the gizzard.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges. The female chooses a nest site, where she scrapes a shallow hollow in the <b>loose</b> <b>soil,</b> sand, gravel, or dead vegetation {{in which to}} lay eggs. No nest materials are added. Cliff nests are generally located under an overhang, on ledges with vegetation. South-facing sites are favoured. In some regions, as in parts of Australia and {{on the west coast}} of northern North America, large tree hollows are used for nesting. Before the demise of most European peregrines, a large population of peregrines in central and western Europe used the disused nests of other large birds. In remote, undisturbed areas such as the Arctic, steep slopes and even low rocks and mounds may be used as nest sites. In many parts of its range, peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost all}} Coraciiformes the bee-eaters are cavity nesters. In {{the case of}} the bee-eaters the nests are burrows dug into the ground, either into the sides of earth cliffs or {{directly}} into level soil. Both types of nesting site are vulnerable, those on level ground are vulnerable to trampling and small predators, whereas those in cliffs, which are often the banks of rivers, are vulnerable to flash floods, which can wipe out dozens or hundreds of nests. Many species will nest either on cliffs or on level ground but prefer cliffs, although Böhm's bee-eater always nests on level ground. The burrows are dug by both birds in the pair, sometimes assisted by helpers. The soil or sand is loosened with jabs of the sharp bill, then the feet are used to kick out the <b>loose</b> <b>soil.</b> It has been suggested that riverine loess deposits that do not crumble when excavated may be favoured by the larger bee-eaters. There may be several false starts where nests are dug partway before being abandoned; in solitary species this can give the impression of colonial living even when that is not the case. The process of nest building can take as long as twenty days to complete, during which time the bill can be blunted and shortened. Nests are generally used only for a single season and are rarely used twice by the bee-eaters, but abandoned nests may be used by other birds, snakes and bats as shelter and breeding sites.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Roosevelt County, New Mexico in the Great Plains {{was found to}} be a {{particularly}} good place to find meteorites. After the discovery of a few meteorites in 1967, a public awareness campaign resulted in the finding of nearly 100 new specimens in the next few years, with many being by a single person, Ivan Wilson. In total, nearly 140 meteorites were found in the region since 1967. In the area of the finds, the ground was originally covered by a shallow, <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> sitting atop a hardpan layer. During the dustbowl era, the <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> was blown off, leaving any rocks and meteorites that were present stranded on the exposed surface.|$|E
25|$|Sediment (<b>loose</b> <b>soil)</b> washed off fields is {{the largest}} source of {{agricultural}} pollution in the United States. Farmers may utilize erosion controls to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include contour plowing, crop mulching, crop rotation, planting perennial crops and installing riparian buffers.|$|E
25|$|A <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> will {{contract}} in volume on shearing, {{and may not}} develop any peak strength above critical state. In this case 'peak' strength will coincide with the critical state shear strength, once the soil has ceased contracting in volume.

50|$|Imprinting is {{best suited}} for seeding on <b>loose</b> <b>soils,</b> and where there is either no {{existing}} plant cover - or light to moderate brush cover - before planting. Haferkamp and colleagues compared seed drill planting to imprinting on loose and firm seedbeds on a Wyoming big sagebrush and needlegrass habitat. Drilling produced more seedlings on firm seedbeds, whereas imprinting produced two times more seedlings on <b>loose</b> <b>soils,</b> compared to drilling. Haferkamp and colleagues used brushbeating plus disking to create the loosened soil treatment in that study. Ripping or chisel plowing {{can be used as}} alternatives to disking when soil is deeply compacted, as they are less destructive to soil components than disking.|$|R

25|$|Female adults lay up to 100 eggs at a {{time into}} wet or <b>loose</b> <b>soil,</b> 10–15 days after mating. Eggs are small, white, oval shaped and around 1.5mm in diameter. 3–4 days after being laid, the eggs turn smooth, spherical, and start to swell by {{absorbing}} moisture. Once the eggs are mature they turn a dark brown/black colour.|$|E
25|$|The term 'cyclic mobility' {{refers to}} the {{mechanism}} of progressive reduction of effective stress due to cyclic loading. This may occur in all soil types including dense soils. However, on reaching a state of zero effective stress such soils immediate dilate and regain strength. Thus shear strains are significantly less than a true state of soil liquefaction whereby a <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> exhibits flow type phenomena.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of the South Fork watershed is mountains, with the only level land found in the Hyampom Valley at the confluence of the river and Hayfork Creek, along the Hayfork valley, and along narrow river terraces. There are large parts of the watershed where the ground is composed of stable bedrock, while large portions of hillsides are composed of <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> and rock. Historically, riverbeds in the watershed were narrow and rocky, but due to vast amounts of silt washed down by poor logging practices, streambeds have become wide, braided, elevated and shallow.|$|E
50|$|Coniophanes snakes are secretive burrowers. They {{spend most}} of their time digging into <b>loose</b> <b>soils,</b> forest leaf litter, or under rotting cactus.

It prefers high humidity and lower temperatures, and needs <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> for burrowing to hibernate and lay its eggs. It lives up to 2100 m above sea level in the Alps, but usually below 2000 m. In the south of England, it is restricted to undisturbed grassy or bushy wastelands, usually not in gardens; it has a low reproduction rate and low powers of dispersal.|$|E
25|$|Birds use a {{combination}} of their beaks and feet to excavate burrow nests. The tunnel is started with the beak; the bird either probes at the ground to create a depression, or flies toward its chosen nest site on a cliff wall and hits it with its bill. The latter method is not without its dangers; there are reports of kingfishers being fatally injured in such attempts. Some birds remove tunnel material with their bills, while others use their bodies or shovel the dirt out with one or both feet. Female paradise-kingfishers are known to use their long tails to clear the <b>loose</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
25|$|In May, June or July, females {{normally}} lay {{a clutch}} of 1 to 11 eggs into a flask-shaped nest excavated {{in a patch of}} sandy or loamy soil. After 70 to 80 days of incubation, the eggs hatch, and the small hatchlings emerge from the nest in late summer. In the northern parts of its range, the common box turtle may enter hibernation in October or November. They burrow into <b>loose</b> <b>soil,</b> sand, vegetable matter, or mud at the bottom of streams and pools, or they may use a mammal burrow, and will remain in their chosen shelter until the cold winter has passed. The Common box turtle has been known to attain the greatest lifespan of any vertebrate outside of the tortoises. One specimen lived to be at least 138 years of age.|$|E
30|$|Liquefaction is {{developed}} in <b>loose</b> sandy <b>soils</b> in saturated condition. Almost all area of Babol city have <b>loose</b> sandy <b>soils</b> and in saturated condition, because of Babolroud River.

50|$|It {{is found}} in forested and open areas with dry <b>loose</b> <b>soils</b> in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States.

50|$|Amegilla quadrifasciata are solitary {{bees and}} do not form colonies.

25|$|A {{state of}} 'soil liquefaction' {{occurs when the}} {{effective}} stress of soil is reduced to essentially zero, which corresponds to a complete loss of shear strength. This may be initiated by either monotonic loading (e.g. single sudden occurrence {{of a change in}} stress – examples include an increase in load on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (e.g. repeated change in stress condition – examples include wave loading or earthquake shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant pore water pressure on a change in load are the most likely to liquefy. This is because a <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess porewater pressure as load is transferred from the soil skeleton to adjacent pore water during undrained loading. As pore water pressure rises a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as effective stress is reduced.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, 25,000 shield-shovels {{were ordered}} {{and shipped to}} Europe {{for use by the}} 1st Canadian Division. Preliminary tests, however, {{revealed}} that the shovel’s blade was incapable of stopping even small caliber bullets. Its value as a digging tool was also questioned as soldiers commented against the shovel’s weight, its inability to be easily carried, {{and the fact that the}} blade was poor for shoveling <b>loose</b> <b>soil</b> as it contained a large sight-hole. With such a reputation, several high-ranking Canadian and British military officials refused to press the instrument into service. With these developments, an executive order was eventually issued for the shovels to be reduced to scrap. A total sum of $1,400 was recovered in the salvage; a figure far less than the original contract price, which tagged each MacAdam shield-shovel at $1.35. Despite being condemned by the military, a small following of Canadian snipers continued to use the shovel. Aware of the tool’s limitations, they preferred to use them in a collective series for added protection.|$|E
25|$|Most snakes move using lateral {{undulation}} where {{a lateral}} wave travels down the snake's {{body in the}} opposite direction to the snake's motion and pushes the snake off irregularities in the ground. This mode of locomotion requires these irregularities to function. Another form of locomotion, rectilinear locomotion, is used at times by some snakes, especially large ones such as pythons and boa. Here large scales {{on the underside of the}} body, known as scutes are used to push backwards and downwards. This is effective on a flat surface and is used for slow, silent movement, such as when stalking prey. Snakes use concertina locomotion for moving slowly in tunnels, here the snake alternates in bracing parts of its body on it surrounds. Finally the caenophidian snakes use the fast and unusual method of movement known as sidewinding on sand or <b>loose</b> <b>soil.</b> The snake cycles through throwing the front part of its body in the direction of motion and bringing the back part of its body into line crosswise.|$|E
40|$|The use of soil mixing for {{providing}} stabilization of soft or <b>loose</b> <b>soils</b> {{is considered a}} fairly new technology in the United States. Soil mixing has been successfully applied for liquifaction mitigation, steel reinforced retaining walls, groundwater cutoff walls, and stabilization of contaminated soils. Applications of this technology have recently been further expanded. Such applications have included settlement control of soils, slope stabilization {{and the formation of}} composite gravity structures. To design for these applications, the unconfined compressive strength, elastic modulus and shear strength of the soil and soil-cement columns must be determined or estimated. Settlement control of soft or <b>loose</b> <b>soils</b> under service loads can be sufficiently controlled with treatment ratios in the 20 % to 35 % range. On a recent project in Honolulu, Hawaii, <b>loose</b> <b>soils</b> were sufficiently stabilized with a 23 % treatment ratio, and at a site in Lakeland, Florida, a very soft and compressible clay layer was sufficiently stabilized with only a 12 % treatment ratio. In slope stability applications, soil mixing improves the overall shear strength of the soil formation to adequately increase the factor of safety, and also the soil-cement columns can force the potential failure surface deeper. Lastly, soil mixing has been applied to construct in-situ gravity structures where its composite action design assumption was confirmed with an instrumented test wall, and used in two recent commercial applications...|$|R
