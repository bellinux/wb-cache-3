40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new inversion algorithm for retrievals of stratospheric BrO from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder. This version {{is based on}} the algorithm described by Livesey et al. (2006 a) but designed to reduce a large bias presented in the previous MLS BrO datasets in the lower stratosphere and, therefore, to increase its useable pressure range. In this new version, vertical profiles of BrO were obtained in the 100 to 4. 6 hPa pressure range extending the <b>lower</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>limit</b> of the MLS retrievals. A description of the retrieval methodology and an error analysis are presented. Single daily profile precision, when taking the ascending-descending (day-night) difference, was found to be up to 40 pptv while systematic error biases were estimated to be less than about 3 pptv. Monthly mean comparisons show broad agreement with other measurements as well as with state-of-the-art numerical models. We infer total inorganic Br y using the measured MLS BrO to be 20. 3 ± 4. 5 pptv, which implies a contribution from Very Short Lived Substances to the stratospheric bromine budget of ∼ 5 ± 4. 5 pptv...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Hydrothermal {{processes}} and the regimes of frozen soil formed in alpine regions with glaciers and lake area {{are complex and}} important for ecological environment but have not been studied in Tibet. Based on soil temper-ature and moisture data from October 2005 to September 2006 collected in the Nam Co lake basin, Tibetan Plateau (TP), those questions were discussed. The mean annual air temperature was- 3. 4 C with 8 months below 0 C. Air and soil temperature varied between- 25. 3 * 13. 1 C and- 10. 3 * 8. 8 C, respectively. Soil moisture variations in the active layer were small with the minimum value of 1. 4 %, but were influenced greatly by snowmelt, rainfall and evaporation, varying up to 53. 8 %. The active layer froze later, thawed earlier and was thinner, however, the <b>lower</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>limit</b> of permafrost is higher than that in most areas of TP. The effects of soil moisture (unfrozen water content) on soil temperature, which were estimated through proposed models, were more significant near ground sur-face than the other layers. The surface soil temperature decreased with snowcover, the effect of cold snow melt-water infiltration on soil thermal conditions was negligible, however, the effect of rainfall infiltration was evident causing thermal disruptions...|$|E
40|$|Rayleigh lidar {{systems have}} {{historically}} made ground-based {{observations of the}} upper atmosphere (stratosphere and mesosphere) from 35 - 90 km. This technology has helped fill the data collection gap between the troposphere and space. Recently our Rayleigh lidar group at the Atmospheric Lidar Observatory {{on the campus of}} Utah State University (42 ° N, 112 ° W) upgraded the original lidar system in order to extend the measurement range for neutral densities and temperatures to higher altitudes and has increased the upper limit, so far, from 90 to 110 km. Next, we will extend the <b>lower</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>limit</b> downward to 15 km. This will enable us to connect densities, temperatures, and their fluctuations in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere to the drivers in the lower portions of the atmosphere. Extending measurements downward will lead to signals, not only from Rayleigh scatter off of small particles (N 2 and O 2), but also from Mie scatter off of much larger particles (aerosols). In order to separate the Rayleigh and Mie signals we will take advantage of the system’s greater sensitivity to measure Raman scatter from N 2, between 15 and 35 km, thus making the system a Rayleigh-Mie-Raman (RMR) lidar. We can then apply the Klett Inversion algorithm to separate these signals in the data reduction. Such an extended altitude range will enable us to make observations of atmospheric processes and phenomena, such as disturbances, waves and sudden stratospheric warmings, which can ripple up from the ground throughout the atmosphere. This range will also enable an absolute calibration of densities with data from radiosondes and assimilative models like NCEP. The absolute calibration of atmospheric densities can provide a starting point for neutral models of the thermosphere, which are often used to predict satellite drag. In addition, the RMR lidar extended altitude range will provide significant overlap with satellite remote sensing measurements, which will help with calibration and validation efforts and in the extension of satellite measurements towards the ground. The RMR lidar will provide complementary measurements to those made by satellites by providing data that can measure the time evolution of atmospheric processes in one location, while satellite instrumentation gives global measurements of atmospheric processes. This talk will focus on a description of the system and the latest results as well as a discussion of the full upgrade design and how it impacts NASA efforts...|$|E
40|$|We compare {{measurements}} of integrated water vapour (IWV) over a subarctic site (Kiruna, Northern Sweden) from five different sensors and retrieval methods: Radiosondes, Global Positioning System (GPS), ground-based Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, groundbased microwave radiometer, and satellite-based microwave radiometer (AMSU-B). Additionally, we compare also to ERA-Interim model reanalysis data. GPS-based IWV data {{have the highest}} temporal coverage and resolution and are chosen as reference data set. All datasets agree reasonably well, but the ground-based microwave instrument only if the data are cloud-filtered. We also address two issues that are general for such intercomparison studies, the impact of different <b>lower</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>limits</b> for the IWV integration, {{and the impact of}} representativeness error. We develop methods for correcting for the former, and estimating the random error contribution of the latter. A literature survey reveals that reported systematic differences between different techniques are study-dependent and show no overall consistent pattern. Further improving the absolute accuracy of IWV measurements and providing climate-quality time series therefore remain challenging problems...|$|R
5000|$|During the interwar {{years the}} rapid {{development}} of aircraft and aviation technology {{drew the attention}} of imaginative military planners. The idea of inserting {{a large body of}} troops inside enemy territory was first proposed during World War I by commander of the U.S. Air Corps in France—Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. However the Allied High Command was forced to abandon the idea as it was wholly unprepared for such an undertaking, both logistically and in materiel. Among the first to recognize the potential of airborne forces were Italy and the Soviet Union. The first effective means of supporting massed infantry airborne operations came with the development of the static-line parachute in Italy in the 1920s, whereby parachutes are attached {{to the inside of the}} aircraft and deployed automatically upon departure. This technique allowed the jumps to occur at <b>lower</b> <b>altitudes,</b> <b>limiting</b> exposure to enemy fire, and providing a tighter drop zone grouping than individually deployed rip-cord type parachutes. The word Fallschirmjäger is from the German Fallschirm [...] "parachute" [...] and Jäger [...] "hunter", the elite light infantry of the Prussian army.|$|R

40|$|A Visual Sensor Network (VSN) is a {{distributed}} system of a largenumber of camera sensor nodes. The main {{components of a}} camera sensornode are image sensor, embedded processor, wireless transceiver and energysupply. The major difference between a VSN and an ordinary sensor networkis that a VSN generates two dimensional data {{in the form of}} an image, whichcan be exploited in many useful applications. Some of the potentialapplication examples of VSNs include environment monitoring, surveillance,structural monitoring, traffic monitoring, and industrial automation. However, the VSNs also raise new challenges. They generate large amount ofdata which require higher processing powers, large bandwidth requirementsand more energy resources but the main constraint is that the VSN nodes arelimited in these resources. This research focuses on the development of a VSN model to track thelarge birds such as Golden Eagle in the sky. The model explores a number ofcamera sensors along with optics such as lens of suitable focal length whichensures a minimum required resolution of a bird, flying at the highestaltitude. The combination of a camera sensor and a lens formulate amonitoring node. The camera node model is used to optimize the placementof the nodes for full coverage of a given area above a required <b>lower</b> <b>altitude.</b> The model also presents the solution to minimize the cost (number of sensornodes) to fully cover a given area between the two required extremes, higherand <b>lower</b> <b>altitudes,</b> in terms of camera sensor, lens focal length, camera nodeplacement and actual number of nodes for sky surveillance. The area covered by a VSN can be increased by increasing the highermonitoring altitude and/or decreasing the <b>lower</b> monitoring <b>altitude.</b> However, it also increases the cost of the VSN. The desirable objective is toincrease the covered area but decrease the cost. This objective is achieved byusing optimization techniques to design a heterogeneous VSN. The core ideais to divide a given monitoring range of altitudes into a number of sub-rangesof altitudes. The sub-ranges of monitoring altitudes are covered by individualsub VSNs, the VSN 1 covers the <b>lower</b> sub-range of <b>altitudes,</b> the VSN 2 coversthe next higher sub-range of altitudes and so on, such that a minimum cost isused to monitor a given area. To verify the concepts, developed to design the VSN model, and theoptimization techniques to decrease the VSN cost, the measurements areperformed with actual cameras and optics. The laptop machines are used withthe camera nodes as data storage and analysis platforms. The area coverage ismeasured at the desired <b>lower</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>limits</b> of homogeneous as well asheterogeneous VSNs and verified for 100 % coverage. Similarly, the minimumresolution is measured at the desired higher <b>altitude</b> <b>limits</b> of homogeneous aswell as heterogeneous VSNs to ensure that the models are able to track thebird at these highest altitudes...|$|R

40|$|The Space Station Freedom (SSF) {{altitude}} strategy provides {{guidelines and}} assumptions to determine an altitude profile for Freedom. The process for determining an altitude profile incorporates several {{factors such as}} where the Space Shuttle will rendezvous with the SSF, when reboosts must occur, and what atmospheric conditions exist causing decay. The altitude strategy {{has an influence on}} all areas of SSF development and mission planning. The altitude strategy directly affects the micro-gravity environment for experiments, propulsion and control system sizing, and Space Shuttle delivery manifests. Indirectly the altitude strategy influences almost every system and operation within the Space Station Program. Evolution of the SSF altitude strategy has been a very dynamic process over the past few years. Each altitude strategy in turn has emphasized a different consideration. Examples include a constant Space Shuttle rendezvous altitude for mission planning simplicity, or constant micro-gravity levels with its inherent emphasis on payloads, or lifetime altitudes to provide a safety buffer to loss of control conditions. Currently a new altitude strategy is in development. This altitude strategy will emphasize Space Shuttle delivery optimization. Since propellant is counted against Space Shuttle payload-to-orbit capacity, <b>lowering</b> the rendezvous <b>altitude</b> will not always increase the net payload-to-orbit, since more propellant would be required for reboost. This altitude strategy will also consider altitude biases to account for Space Shuttle launch slips and an unexpected worsening of atmospheric conditions. Safety concerns will define a <b>lower</b> operational <b>altitude</b> <b>limit,</b> while radiation levels will define upper altitude constraints. The evolution of past and current SSF altitude strategies {{and the development of a}} new altitude strategy which focuses on operational issues as opposed to design are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{data from}} the pollen {{analysis}} diagrams, an attempt {{has been made to}} represent in a synoptic man-ner the vegetation history of Epirus during the phases of Pleistocene and Holocene. In general, open steppe vegetation dominated during the glacial periods. Concurrently, though, forest vegetation was constantly present, especially in the mountainous regions of Epirus. Many woody species of the current temperate zone withdrew to and have survived in these regions. During the last interglacial, dense forest vegetation, which consisted mainly of mixed broadleaves, had developed, comprising many woody species that are now extinct. The vegetation development during the Early Holocene was influenced by the climate and resulted in the growth of forests in the plains {{as well as in the}} mountainous regions. Anthropogenic interference in Epirus has been traced back as early as the mid 6 th millennium BC. Sooner or later, depending on the location, hu-man interference, which mostly included pastoral activities, resulted in degradation and even extinction of the forest vegetation. Major events in the vegetation development of the last millennia were transformation of the deciduous oak forests to pseudomaquis or maquis vegetation mainly in the low and middle altitudes, and disappearance or withdrawal of the mountainous forest vegetation to <b>lower</b> <b>altitudes,</b> where forest <b>limits</b> have been formed as a result of human impact...|$|R
