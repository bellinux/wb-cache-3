500|$|The modern {{understanding}} of planetary motion {{arose from the}} combined efforts of astronomer Tycho Brahe and physicist Johannes Kepler in the 16th century. Tycho is credited with extremely accurate measurements of planetary motions, from which Kepler was able to derive his laws of planetary motion. [...] According to these laws, planets move on ellipses (not epicycles) about the Sun (not the Earth). Kepler's second and third laws make specific quantitative predictions: planets sweep out equal areas in equal time, and the square of their orbital periods equals a fixed constant times the cube of their semi-major axis. Subsequent observations of the planetary orbits showed that the long axis of the ellipse (the so-called <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>apsides)</b> rotates gradually with time; this rotation is known as apsidal precession. The apses of an orbit are the points at which the orbiting body is closest or furthest away from the attracting center; for planets orbiting the Sun, the apses correspond to the perihelion (closest) and aphelion (furthest).|$|E
2500|$|A {{straight}} line connecting the periapsis and apoapsis is the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>apsides.</b> This {{is the major}} axis of the ellipse, its greatest diameter. [...] For a two-body system the center of mass of the system lies on this line {{at one of the}} two foci of the ellipse. When one body is sufficiently larger than the other it may be taken to be at this focus. [...] However {{whether or not this is}} the case, both bodies are in similar elliptical orbits each having one focus at the system's center of mass, with their respective lines of apsides being of length inversely proportional to their masses. [...] Historically, in geocentric systems, apsides were measured from the center of the Earth. However, in the case of the Moon, the center of mass of the Earth–Moon system, or Earth–Moon barycenter, as the common focus of both the Moon's and Earth's orbits about each other, is about 75% of the way from Earth's center to its surface.|$|E

5000|$|In {{models of}} the {{universe}} that precede Ptolemy, generally attributed to Hipparchus, the eccentric and epicycles were already a feature. The Roman Pliny in the 1st century CE, who apparently had access to writings of late Greek astronomers, and not being an astronomer himself, still correctly identified the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>apsides</b> for the five known planets and where they pointed in the zodiac. [...] Such data requires the concept of eccentric centers of motion. Most {{of what we know}} about Hipparchus comes to us through mentions of his works by Ptolemy in the Almagest. Hipparchus' models' features explained differences in the length of the seasons on Earth (known as the [...] "first anomaly"), and the appearance of retrograde motion in the planets (known as the [...] "second anomaly"). But Hipparchus was unable to make the predictions about the location and duration of retrograde motions of the planets match observations; he could match location, or he could match duration, but not both simultaneously. Ptolemy's introduction of the equant resolved that contradiction: the location was determined by the deferent and epicycle, while the duration was determined by uniform motion around the equant.|$|R

This is the reason that an anomalistic month (the period of time that the Moon moves from the perigee to the apogee and to the perigee again) is longer than the sidereal month (the period of time when the Moon completes one revolution with respect to the fixed stars).

40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamical evolution of coplanar, hierarchical, two-planet systems where {{the ratio of}} the orbital semimajor axes α = a 1 /a 2 is small. Hierarchical two-planet systems are likely to be ubiquitous among extrasolar planetary systems. We show that the orbital parameters obtained from a multiple-Kepler fit to the radial velocity variations of a host star are best interpreted as Jacobi coordinates and that Jacobi coordinates should be used in any analyses of hierarchical planetary systems. An approximate theory that can be applied to coplanar, hierarchical, two-planet systems {{with a wide range of}} masses and orbital eccentricities is the octopole-level secular perturbation theory, which is based on an expansion to order α 3 and orbit averaging. It reduces the coplanar problem to 1 degree of freedom, with e 1 (or e 2) and ω̄ 1 - ω̄ 2 as the relevant phase-space variables (where e 1, 2 are the orbital eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits, respectively, and ω̄ 1, 2 are the longitudes of periapse). The octopole equations show that if {{the ratio of the}} maximum orbital angular momenta, λ = L 1 /L 2 ≈ (m 1 /m 2) α 1 / 2, for given semimajor axes is approximately equal to a critical value λcrit, then libration of ω̄ 1 - ω̄ 2 about either 0 ° or 180 ° is almost certain, with possibly large amplitude variations of both eccentricities. From a study of the HD 168443 and HD 12661 systems and their variants using both the octopole theory and direct numerical orbit integrations, we establish that the octopole theory is highly accurate for systems with α≲ 0. 1 and reasonably accurate even for systems with α as large as 1 / 3, provided that α is not too close to a significant mean-motion commensurability or above the stability boundary. The HD 168443 system is not in a secular resonance, and its ω̄ 1 - ω̄ 2 circulates. The HD 12661 system is the first extrasolar planetary system found to have ω̄ 1 - ω̄ 2 librating about 180 °. The secular resonance means that the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>apsides</b> <b>of</b> the two orbits are on average antialigned, although the amplitude of libration of ω̄ 1 - ω̄ 2 is large. The libration ω̄ 1 - ω̄ 2 and the large amplitude variations of both eccentricities in the HD 12661 system are consistent with the analytic results on systems with λ ≈ λcrit. The evolution of the HD 12661 system with the best-fit orbital parameters and sin i = 1 (i is the inclination of the orbital plane from the plane of the sky) is affected by the close proximity to the 11 : 2 mean-motion commensurability, but small changes in the orbital period of the outer planet within the uncertainty can result in configurations that are not affected by mean-motion commensurabilities.

40|$|Tidal {{dissipation}} in late-type {{stars is}} presently poorly understood {{and the study}} of planetary systems hosting hot Jupiters can provide new observational constraints to test proposed theories. We focus on systems with F-type main-sequence stars and find that the recently discovered system CoRoT- 11 is presently the best suited for such a kind of investigation. A classic constant tidal lag model is applied to reproduce the evolution of the system from a plausible nearly synchronous state on the ZAMS to the present state, thus putting constraints on the average modified tidal quality factor of its F 6 V star. Initial conditions with the stellar rotation period longer than the orbital period of the planet can be excluded {{on the basis of the}} presently observed state in which the star spins faster than the planet orbit. It is found that is approximately between 4. 0 E+ 06 and 2. 0 E+ 07 if the system started its evolution on the ZAMS close to synchronization with an uncertainty related to the constant tidal lag hypothesis and the estimated stellar magnetic braking within a factor of about 5 - 6. Moreover, we discuss how the present value of Q'_s can be measured by a timing of the mid-epoch and duration of the transits as well as of the planetary eclipses to be observed in the infrared with an accuracy of about 0. 5 - 1 s over a time baseline of about 25 yr. CoRoT- 11 is an highly interesting system potentially allowing us a direct measure of the tidal dissipation in an F-type star as well as the detection of the precession of the orbital plane of the planet that provides us with an accurate upper limit for the obliquity of the stellar equator.

The apsides are the two points of closest and furthest distance of the orbit (the periapsis and apoapsis, respectively); apsidal precession corresponds to {{the rotation of the}} line joining the apsides.

According to their argument, Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from the center) to be a smooth, continuous function of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on the same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation <b>of</b> the <b>apsides</b> <b>of</b> planetary orbits suggest that {{the force of gravity}} is an inverse-square law.|$|R
