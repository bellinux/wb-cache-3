It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stay</b> retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he wanted {{to come back to the}} team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E

It features Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt dancing to [...] "Why Do You <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Stay</b> Here?", a song by Deschanel's folk group She & Him. Webb remarked, [...] "when we didn't include Zooey {{in the dance}} sequence , {{she was a little}} heartbroken and I felt like I needed to remedy that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kobolds bring {{good luck}} and help their hosts {{as long as the}} hosts take care of them. The kobold Heinzelmann found things that had been lost. He had a rhyme he liked to sing: [...] "If thou here wilt <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stay,</b> / Good luck shalt thou have alway; / But if hence thou wilt me chase, / Luck will ne'er come near the place." [...] Three famous kobolds, King Goldemar, Heinzelmann, and Hödekin, all gave {{warnings}} about danger to the owners of the home in which they lived. Heinzelmann once warned a colonel to be careful on his daily hunt. The man ignored the advice, only to have his gun backfire and shoot off his thumb. Heinzelman appeared to him and said, [...] "See, now, you have got what I warned you of! If you had refrained from shooting this time, this mischance would not have befallen you." [...] The kobold Hödekin, who lived with the bishop of Hildesheim in the 12th century, once warned the bishop of a murder. When the bishop acted on the information, he was able to take over the murderer's lands and add them to his bishopric.|$|E

2500|$|As a boy, Burroughs {{lived on}} Pershing Ave. in St. Louis's Central West End. He {{attended}} John Burroughs School in St. Louis where his first published essay, [...] "Personal Magnetism", was {{printed in the}} John Burroughs Review in 1929. He then attended the Los Alamos Ranch School in New Mexico, which was stressful for him. The school was a boarding school for the wealthy, [...] "where the spindly sons of the rich could be transformed into manly specimens". Burroughs kept journals documenting an erotic attachment to another boy. According to his own account, he destroyed these later, ashamed of their content. He kept his sexual orientation concealed from his family well into adulthood, due to {{the context in which}} he grew up and from which he fled—that is, a [...] "family where displays of affection were considered embarrassing". He became a well-known homosexual writer after the publication of Naked Lunch in 1959. Some [...] say that he was expelled from Los Alamos after taking chloral hydrate in Santa Fe with a fellow student. Yet, according to his own account, he left voluntarily: [...] "During the Easter vacation of my second year I persuaded my family to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stay</b> in St. Louis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Westbrook did {{not return}} and made her final {{appearance}} as Sam on 24 January 2000. She has since confessed that her drug taking was the reason why she was written out. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "I wasn't fired this time, but let's just say when they {{gave me the opportunity}} to walk I took it. I was no longer interested in acting and that had become blatantly obvious to everyone on set. The soap was now being shown four times a week and it was impossible to balance the workload with my addiction [...] Not only had [...] destroyed my nose, but it was about to destroy my career again as well [...] The producers were tiring of my behaviour [...] When I did leave the production at the end of 1999 it was in fact a fairly mutual decision. I admit that had I begged the producers to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>stay</b> this time I doubt if they would have allowed me to. But I was happy to go [...] Looking back to that point now it fills me with shame that I could have behaved in that way and let down so many people". Following her axing, Westbrook's eroded nasal septum was revealed to the public by the press, after she was photographed at the 2000 British Soap Awards.|$|E

40|$|To Jennifer, {{the love}} of my life. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This is the part where I get to thank all the people who helped me get through this. And {{there were a lot of}} them. Chief among them are my parents, Prasun and Chumkie, who were always there to cheer me on through successes, {{encourage}} me after failures, and generally just listen to me ramble on about things that they likely neither understood nor cared about. My fiancée, Jennifer Wass, did all those things as well, and I also need to thank her for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>stay</b> up until stupid o’clock working on this document for night after night after night. My committee, of course, have been very important to this entire process.
