25|$|Another {{source of}} illicit {{morphine}} {{comes from the}} extraction of morphine from extended-release morphine products, such as MS-Contin. Morphine can be extracted from these products with simple extraction techniques to yield a morphine solution that can be injected. As an alternative, the tablets can be crushed and snorted, injected or swallowed, although this provides much less euphoria but retains some of the extended-release effect, and the extended-release property is why MS-Contin is used in some countries alongside methadone, dihydrocodeine, buprenorphine, dihydroetorphine, piritramide, <b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM), and special 24-hour formulations of hydromorphone for maintenance and detoxification of those physically dependent on opioids.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and approval of <b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM) as a pharmacotherapeutic agent in opioid agonist therapy provided {{an alternative to}} methadone. Clinicians recognized the potential benefits that LAAM, a synthetic mu agonist with pharmacological properties which {{differ from those of}} methadone, could have in the treatment management of addicts in opioid agonist therapy. We report our experience utilizing LAAM from 1995 to 1999 at the Hines VA opioid agonist therapy clinic. The addition of LAAM to the clinic’s treatment armamentarium has resulted in management options that have improved the areas of patient recruitment, patient retention, patient traffic, take-home medication, detoxification, and treatment outcomes.

40|$|A gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) {{method is}} presented {{which allows the}} simultaneous determination of the plasma concentrations of the <b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM) and of its active metabolites (NorLAAM and DiNorLAAM), after derivatization with the reagent trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA). No interferences from endogenous compounds were observed following the extraction of plasma samples from 11 different human subjects. The standard curves were linear over a working range of 5 - 200 ng/ml for the three compounds. Recoveries measured at three concentrations ranged from 47 to 67 % for LAAM, from 50 to 69 % for NorLAAM and from 28 to 50 % for DiNorLAAM. Intra- and interday coefficients of variation determined at three concentrations ranged from 5 to 13 % for LAAM, from 3 to 9 % for NorLAAM and from 5 to 13 % for DiNorLAAM. The limits of quantitation of the method {{were found to be}} 4 ng/ml for the three compounds. No interference was noted from methadone. This sensitive and specific analytical method could be useful for assessing the in vivo relationship between LAAM's blood levels, clinical efficacy and/or cardiotoxicit...|$|E
40|$|Mated Crl:CD VAF/Plus female rats, in a range- nding study (n = 5 – 6 per dose) and a {{subsequent}} de nitive study (n = 30 per dose) {{were used to}} determine the developmental toxicity, includ-ing the teratogenic potential of <b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM) hydrochloride, in tolerant rats. Tolerance was induced by initially administering the drug by gavage (10 ml/kg) at 2 mg/kg/day and increasing the dose every 2 weeks for 12 weeks until the doses of 2, 6, 9, 12, and 15, or 2, 6, and 12 mg/kg/day were achieved in the range- nding or de nitive study, respectively. Females were then mated to stock males and treated throughout mating and gesta-tion. Controls received distilled water on a similar regimen. The range- nding experiment was used for initial clinical evaluations and to determine tissue concentrations of LAAM and metabolites. In plasma, liver, and brain collected from dams and fetuses pooled by litter on gestation day 20, LAAM and its two N-demethylated metabolites, norLAAM and dinorLAAM, showed dose-dependent increases in concentration and in tissue to plasma ratios. Tissue to dam plasma ratios were highest in dam liver (17 – 60), interme-diate in fetal liver (3 – 16), and fetal brain (3 – 14), and lowest in dam brain (0. 8 – 5. 6) and fetal plasma (0. 3 – 2. 1).

40|$|Methadone {{is widely}} used as a {{replacement}} for illicit opioid use such as heroin in medically-supported opioid substitution maintenance programmes. Two other drugs have been used to help reduce illicit opioid use, specifically buprenorphine and LAAM (<b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol).</b> LAAM is not used in current clinical practice. Buprenorphine is currently used and can reduce illicit opioid use compared with placebo, although it is less effective than methadone. Buprenorphine is an opioid drug that is not as potent as heroin and methadone, although the effects of buprenorphine may last longer. Buprenorphine can be taken once every two days. The trials include different formulations of buprenorphine: sublingual solution, sublingual tablets, combined buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet and an implant. Key results The review of trials found that buprenorphine at high doses (16 mg) can reduce illicit opioid use effectively compared with placebo, and buprenorphine at any dose studied retains people in treatment better than placebo. Buprenorphine appears to be less effective than methadone in retaining people in treatment, if prescribed in a flexible dose regimen or at a fixed and low dose (2 - 6 mg per day). Buprenorphine prescribed at fixed doses (above 7 mg per day) was not different from methadone prescribed at fixed doses (40 mg or more per day) in retaining people in treatment or in suppression of illicit opioid use...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if substitution of daily methadone with second daily <b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM) would convert non-holders on methadone into holders on LAAM, and to compare plasma concentration–time profiles of (R) -methadone with LAAM and its two metabolites. Sixteen stable methadone maintenance treatment participants (non-holders, n= 8) were randomly allocated to continue methadone for 3 months or switch to LAAM for 3 months, and then crossed over to the alternative drug for 3 months. At steady state, there were two testing sessions (24 h for methadone and 48 h for LAAM), during which opioid withdrawal severity, respiration rate and pupil diameter were measured 10 – 11 times and venous blood was collected 13 – 15 times. Ten age- and gender-matched controls underwent one 48 -h test session. Areas under the withdrawal severity score versus time curve (AUC 0 – 47 hours for LAAM and controls; AUC 0 – 24 × 2 for methadone) were similar in holders on methadone and LAAM (P= 0. 62), but were greater in non-holders when they were taking methadone than LAAM (P< 0. 001). Respiratory depression and pupillary constriction were similar for LAAM and methadone. In comparison to (R) -methadone, plasma nor- and dinor-LAAM concentrations fluctuated little over the dosing interval. LAAM converted methadone non-holders into LAAM holders. LAAM may therefore be useful in selected MMT non-holders and improve retention in opioid treatment programs. David A. L. Newcombe, Felix Bochner, Jason M. White and Andrew A. Somogyi[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Aims To {{compare the}} effects of <b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM) and {{methadone}} maintenance (MM) on treatment retention and abstinence from opiate use. Design A two-group experimental design with patients randomly assigned (2 : 1 LAAM : MM) to receive LAAM (three doses per week) or methadone (daily dosing). Setting A community clinic in Los Angeles, California. Participants A total of 315 patients seeking LAAM or methadone maintenance. Interventions LAAM or methadone maintenance, plus ancillary services available to all patients. LAAM and methadone dose levels varied according to clinical judgement. Electrocardiograms were administered to LAAM patients monthly. Measurements Treatment status at 26 -week follow-up and number of days retained in treatment, weekly clinical urine tests and 26 -week research urine test. Findings LAAM and methadone patients did not differ on treatment retention. LAAM patients {{were less likely to}} test positive for opiate use during treatment (40 % versus 60 %) and at 26 -week follow up (39. 8 % versus 60. 2 %). Benefits of LAAM were confined to patients (n = 204) still in treatment at 26 weeks (33 % positive in patients receiving LAAM and 61 % in patients receiving methadone). No adverse events, cardiological or otherwise, were observed with LAAM administration. Conclusions LAAM is an effective medication for the treatment of opiate dependence with clinical advantages due not only to the reduction of opiate use but also to the alternate-day dosing schedule. LAAM may be more effective than methadone in promoting abstinence from opiate use among patients for whom LAAM is an acceptable alternative to methadone...|$|E
40|$|Aims The {{present study}} aimed {{to compare the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM) and methadone, as measured by retention in treatment and heroin use, in a randomized trial conducted under naturalistic conditions. Setting This study is the first randomized trial comparing LAAM with methadone in the primary care setting. Participants were recruited through 29 medical practitioners working in specialist and generalist settings in Australia. Participants Existing methadone maintenance patients, aged 18 years and over and able to give informed consent, were randomized to receive either LAAM or methadone. A total of 93 patients participated. Intervention After being trained {{in the use of}} LAAM, existing methadone prescribers were then able to determine an individually tailored treatment regimen for each patient. The trial was an open-label study. Methadone and LAAM dosing was supervised through local community pharmacies. Participation in ancillary services (e. g. counselling) was optional for all patients. The treatment period for the trial was 12 months. Measurements Baseline, 3 -, 6 - and 12 -month interviews were conducted. Outcome measures were retention in treatment, self-reported heroin use and serious adverse events. Findings There {{were no significant differences between}} LAAM and methadone on retention in treatment, nor heroin use. There was a trend for LAAM patients to have lower heroin use than methadone patients. of the seven serious adverse events in the LAAM group, three were not drug-related. There were two dosing errors. Conclusions This study demonstrates (a) the efficacy of LAAM as a treatment for heroin dependence, and (b) the capacity for LAAM to be effectively delivered in primary care settings by trained general practitioners and pharmacists. The next challenge is to resolve outstanding safety concerns with LAAM...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. Studies of {{relative}} LAAM–methadone preference {{have indicated that}} {{a significant proportion of}} patients prefer <b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM). The present study was designed to determine whether this preference is associated with better treatment outcomes. Sixty-two stable methadone patients participated in a randomised crossover clinical trial. They received LAAM (alternate days) and methadone (daily) for 3 months each, followed by a further 6 -month period during which they were free to choose between the drugs. LAAM maintenance was associated with a lower rate of heroin use than methadone maintenance based on analysis of morphine concentration in hair and equivalent health outcomes. The majority of subjects showed a preference for LAAM (n= 27, 69. 2 %) rather than methadone (n= 12, 30. 8 %). The main reasons given for the LAAM preference were that it produced less withdrawal (39. 3 %), fewer side effects (28. 5 %), less craving for heroin (17. 9 %), and entailed fewer pick-up days (14. 3 %). Those who chose LAAM had lower levels of heroin use during LAAM maintenance, significantly better outcomes on two sub-scales of the SF- 36 (Vitality and Mental Health), and reported that they felt more normal and that they were ‘held’ better when on LAAM. For those who chose methadone, there were no differences in outcomes between the LAAM and methadone maintenance periods. Preference for LAAM is associated with treatment outcomes as good or better than those with methadone. Jason M. White, Cath Danz, Joanne Kneebone, Sophie F. La Vincente, David A. L.

40|$|Buprenorphine {{is a new}} and {{attractive}} medication option for many opioid-addicted adults and their physicians. Before initiating buprenorphine treatment, providers {{must be aware of}} such critical factors as how the medication works, its efficacy and safety profile, how it is used in opioid withdrawal as well as maintenance treatment, and how patients can best be selected, educated about buprenorphine, and monitored throughout treatment. This article reviews these important issues as well as requirements for physician and staff training and needs for additional research on this unique medication. bB uprenorphine was approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2002 as a Schedule III narcotic for use in treating opioid-dependent men and opioid-dependent women who are not pregnant. The new medication’s unique pharmacological characteristics provide for less respiratory depression or overdose risk than opioids such as morphine, heroin, methadone, and oxycodone, as well as milder manifestations of withdrawal upon cessation. This wide safety margin makes buprenorphine suitable for use in new treatment settings, such as office practices, as well as more traditional opioid treatment programs. Further supporting this versatility, buprenorphine can be effective when taken every other day or less frequently, and it is supplied in a combined formulation with naloxone that is designed to reduce its potential for abuse. The medication is therefore a welcome addition to a restricted treatment armamentarium, especially now that LAAM (<b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol</b> hydrochloride), another widely used medication, is being discontinued by the manufacturer because of safety concerns (U. S. Food and Drug Administration, 2003). This article reviews buprenorphine’s pharmacology and clinical use, including appropriate dosing; patient selection, education, and monitoring; and physician and staff training; and it identifies important questions for research.

40|$|Background: There are {{increasing}} concerns regarding pharmaceutical opioid harms including overdose and dependence, with an associated increase in treatment demand. People dependent on pharmaceutical opioids appear to differ {{in important ways}} from people who use heroin, yet most opioid agonist treatment {{research has been conducted}} in people who use heroin. Objectives: To assess the effects of maintenance agonist pharmacotherapy for the treatment of pharmaceutical opioid dependence. Search methods: The search included the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 5); PubMed (January 1966 to May 2015); EMBASE (Ovid) (January 1974 to May 2015); CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (1982 to May 2015); ISI Web of Science (to May 2014); and PsycINFO (Ovid) (1806 to May 2014). Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials examining maintenance opioid agonist treatments that made the following two comparisons: 1. full opioid agonists (methadone, morphine, oxycodone, <b>levo-alpha-acetylmethadol</b> (LAAM), or codeine) versus different full opioid agonists or partial opioid agonists (buprenorphine) for maintenance treatment and 2. full or partial opioid agonist maintenance versus placebo, detoxification only, or psychological treatment (without opioid agonist treatment). Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Main results: We identified six randomised controlled trials that met inclusion criteria (607 participants). We found moderate quality evidence from two studies of no difference between methadone and buprenorphine in self reported opioid use (risk ratio (RR) 0. 37, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 08 to 1. 63) or opioid positive urine drug tests (RR 0. 81, 95 % CI 0. 56 to 1. 18). There was low quality evidence from three studies of no difference in retention between buprenorphine and methadone maintenance treatment (RR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 39 to 1. 22). There was moderate quality evidence from two studies of no difference between methadone and buprenorphine on adverse events (RR 1. 10, 95 % CI 0. 64 to 1. 91). We found low quality evidence from three studies favouring maintenance buprenorphine treatment over detoxification or psychological treatment in terms of fewer opioid positive urine drug tests (RR 0. 63, 95 % CI 0. 43 to 0. 91) and self reported opioid use in the past 30 days (RR 0. 54, 95 % CI 0. 31 to 0. 93). There was no difference on days of unsanctioned opioid use (standardised mean difference (SMD) - 0. 31, 95 % CI - 0. 66 to 0. 04). There was moderate quality evidence favouring buprenorphine maintenance over detoxification or psychological treatment on retention in treatment (RR 0. 33, 95 % CI 0. 23 to 0. 47). Authors’ conclusions: There was moderate quality evidence favouring buprenorphine maintenance over detoxification or psychological treatment on adverse events (RR 0. 19, 95 % CI 0. 06 to 0. 57). The main weaknesses in the quality of the data was the use of open-label study designs. There was low to moderate quality evidence supporting the use of maintenance agonist pharmacotherapy for pharmaceutical opioid dependence. Methadone or buprenorphine appeared equally effective. Maintenance treatment with buprenorphine appeared more effective than detoxification or psychological treatments. Due to the overall low to moderate quality of the evidence and small sample sizes, there is the possibility that the further research may change these findings.
