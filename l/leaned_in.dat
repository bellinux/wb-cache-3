5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and <b>leaned</b> <b>in</b> the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
5|$|One {{study has}} shown {{theoretically}} that, while a bike <b>leaned</b> <b>in</b> a turn, road undulations can excite the weave mode {{at high speed}} or the wobble mode at low speed if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.|$|E
40|$|After the {{economic}} {{reforms of the}} 1980 s and 1990 s, Chinese women have dealt with new forms of gender-based restrictions in their career advancements. <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN,</b> a community inspired by Sheryl Sandberg’s book «Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead» published in 2013, offers professional development, support and assistance to help women deal with these challenges. It has been claimed that the American- inspired women’s groups has brought {{a new kind of}} feminism to the country. However, there has not been conducted any research to prove this statement. In this thesis, I have looked at Chinese <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> groups in comparison with both Sandberg’s <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> concept and feminist theory. Based on participant observations and interviews conducted with <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> participants, core members and guest speakers from September 2015 to January 2016, I found that Chinese <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> groups have made some changes to their work away from the original <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> concept in order to adapt to national conditions. Chinese <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> groups’ perspectives on feminism were different from the original <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> concept based on Sheryl Sandberg’s book, but had similarities with the American <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> organisation’s views. With {{a review of the literature}} on feminism in China, I discovered that the American <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> organisation’s concept is corresponding with the governmental organisation All-China Women’s Federation discourse on women’s development. The <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> activities also resemble women’s group meetings which occurred in the early years of the reform era. <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> in China cooperates with All- China Women’s Federation, who could decide to prohibit <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> in China if they step out of their discourse. I argue that this puts Chinese <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> groups in a dependent relation to the All-China Women’s Federation. This research shows how a certain group of people working on women’s issues in China define feminism. It is important to understand the organisations working on women’s issues in order to learn more about the Chinese feminist situation. Studying <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> as an important part of a potential Chinese feminist movement could give an indicator to where the movement is heading...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} lean from nine {{wholesale}} cuts {{in relation to}} the total <b>lean</b> weight <b>in</b> carcass side were evaluated with three allometric equations for 18 Najdi male camels slaughtered at 8, 16 and 26 months of age. The allometric growth coefficients indicated that as camels grew, weights of lean from brisket and flank cuts increased relatively more rapidly than the total <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> carcass side (β > 1. 1) and that weights of lean from wholesale shoulder and rump cuts increased relatively less rapidly (β > 0. 9) than the total lean weight from carcass side. The growth coefficients for the <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> the thoracic limb and pelvic limb showed a dorsoventral rise in the growth impetus, with coefficients for the thoracic limb correspondingly higher than those of pelvic limb. The growth coefficients for the lean from shoulder, rib, flank and leg cuts increased (P< 0. 01) with increased weight of total <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> carcass side, whereas it decreased with increased total <b>lean</b> weight <b>in</b> carcass side for the <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> neck, brisket, plate, loin and rump cuts. At constant weight of total <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> carcass side, older camels had larger coefficients for <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> neck, brisket, rump, flank and leg cuts, but had smaller coefficients for <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> shoulder, rib, plate and loin cuts...|$|R
25|$|Motorcycles must be <b>leaned</b> <b>in</b> {{order to}} make turns. This lean is induced by the method known as countersteering, in which the rider {{momentarily}} steers the handlebars in the direction opposite of the desired turn. This practice is counterintuitive and therefore often confusing to novices and even many experienced motorcyclists.|$|E

2500|$|Countersteering {{is used by}} {{single-track}} vehicle operators, such as cyclists and motorcyclists, {{to initiate}} a turn toward a given direction by momentarily steering counter to the desired direction ("steer left to turn right"). To negotiate a turn successfully, the combined center of mass of the rider and the single-track vehicle must first be <b>leaned</b> <b>in</b> {{the direction of the}} turn, and steering briefly in the opposite direction causes that lean. The rider's action of countersteering is sometimes referred to as [...] "giving a steering command".|$|E

[...] Phillipps later admitted that Daniel and Imogen were better suited than Daniel and Amber.

2500|$|He {{had faced}} 282 balls for an elegant 148, which {{featured}} 18 fours. His innings {{was full of}} orthodox and stylish shots, notable of which were his cover drives through mid-off and extra cover, which saw him open the full face of the bat without an exaggerated follow-through. He <b>leaned</b> <b>in</b> on his drives for the spinners, while he played close to the body for the pacers, {{with little or no}} bending of his back. He moved his feet well, and used his wrists to play the ball fine, whenever the ball would stray down to middle-and-leg line. He would also flick the deliveries with no effort at all. For the off-side deliveries, Laxman would either utilize the ball's pace and send it scorching to the boundary, or he would open the face of the bat late enough to cut it. On some occasions he back-cut the ball intentionally over the slips. His innings was even appreciated by the Australian fielders. On one occasion, when Laxman drove Stuart MacGill through cover, Adam Gilchrist, exclaimed, [...] "Aw, nice..." [...] and then clapped his hands in acknowledgment of the shot, as it sped away to the boundary.|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court {{has been}} criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by {{engaging}} in judicial activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology. An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, which {{has been criticized}} by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts, and which was reversed in the 1930s. [...] An often cited example of liberal judicial activism is Roe v. Wade (1973), which legalized abortion in part {{on the basis of the}} [...] "right to privacy" [...] inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous. Legal scholars, justices, and presidential candidates have criticized the Roe decision. The progressive Brown v. Board of Education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater. More recently, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations. Lincoln warned, referring to the Dred Scott decision, that if government policy became [...] "irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have ceased to be their own rulers." [...] Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: [...] "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up." [...] During different historical periods, the Court has <b>leaned</b> <b>in</b> different directions. Critics from both sides complain that activist-judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead. Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano, Phyllis Schlafly, Mark R. Levin, Mark I. Sutherland, and James MacGregor Burns. Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: [...] "What judges have wrought is a coup d'état,– slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless." [...] Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism, [...] "their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than they would like." [...] One law professor claimed in a 1978 article that the Supreme Court is in some respects [...] "certainly a legislative body." ...|$|E
