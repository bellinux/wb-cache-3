5|$|Agriculture {{is another}} {{significant}} source of the Sava River basin surface water pollution, specifically through <b>livestock</b> <b>manure</b> production. It is estimated that the nutrient pollution levels generated by manure production equal 32,394tonnes of nitrogen and 3,784tonnes of phosphorus per year. As a consequence, the Sava River is microbiologically polluted in areas affected by the nutrient pollution. One such part of the river is the lowermost part of its course between Šabac and Belgrade, where acceptable freshwater bacterial counts are exceeded.|$|E
25|$|The peasant {{associations}} face a {{cycle of}} poverty. Since the landholdings are so small, farmers cannot allow the land to lie fallow, which reduces soil fertility. This land degradation reduces the production of fodder for livestock, which causes low milk yields. Since the community burns <b>livestock</b> <b>manure</b> as fuel, rather than plowing the nutrients back into the land, the crop production is reduced. The low productivity of agriculture leads to inadequate incomes for farmers, hunger, malnutrition and disease. These unhealthy farmers have difficulty working {{the land and the}} productivity drops further.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{components}} of anthropogenic emissions are fertilized agricultural soils and <b>livestock</b> <b>manure</b> (42%), runoff and leaching of fertilizers (25%), biomass burning (10%), fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (10%), biological degradation of other nitrogen-containing atmospheric emissions (9%), and human sewage (5%). [...] Agriculture enhances nitrous oxide production through soil cultivation, {{the use of}} nitrogen fertilisers, and animal waste handling.

2500|$|The marine chemist Scott Doney thinks [...] "the main {{tactics are}} raising energy efficiency, {{switching}} to renewable and nuclear power, protecting forests and exploring carbon sequestration technologies. Regionally, nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates dead zones but also amplifies acidification.

We have to be smarter about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat <b>livestock</b> <b>manure</b> and sewage [...] Locally, acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced electrochemically from seawater and rocks.

The drop in ocean pH is expected to accelerate in coming decades, so marine ecosystems will have to adapt. We can enhance their chances for success by reducing other insults such as water pollution and overfishing, making them better able to withstand some acidification while we transition away from a fossil-fuel energy economy." ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to understand the status and extent of soil contamination with trace elements to make sustainable management strategies for agricultural soils. The inputs of trace elements to agricultural soils via atmospheric deposition, <b>livestock</b> <b>manures,</b> fertilizers and agrochemicals, sewage irrigation and sewage sludge in China were analyzed and an annual inventory of trace element inputs was developed. The results showed that atmospheric deposition was responsible for 43 - 85 % of the total As, Cr, Hg, Ni and Pb inputs, while <b>livestock</b> <b>manures</b> accounted for approximately 55 %, 69 % and 51 % of the total Cd, Cu and Zn inputs, respectively. Among the elements concerned, Cd was a top priority in agricultural soils in China, with an average input rate of 0. 004 mg/kg/yr in the plough layer (0 - 20 cm). Due to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the sources, the inventory as well as the environmental risks of trace elements in soils varies on a regional scale. For example, sewage sludge and fertilizers (mainly organic and phosphate-based inorganic fertilizers) can also be the predominant sources of trace elements where these materials were excessively applied.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of nitrogen (N) loss from agricultural systems is represented by ammonia (NH 3) volatilisation. At the global scale, soil application of <b>livestock</b> <b>manures</b> and N-fertilisers {{represents one of the}} main sources of this atmospheric pollutant. A literature review was carried out over 78 field trials in order to collect and summarise the research on NH 3 emission from land application of manure and N-fertiliser in Italy. Data availability proved to be still limited in terms of coverage of the national territory, representativeness of the measurement method used, type of fertiliser and application strategies explored. Coherently with their importance as NH 3 emission sources, <b>livestock</b> <b>manures</b> and urea have been the most assessed materials. From a methodological perspective, the measurements were mostly performed on non-representative scales and the collected data present large weaknesses due to lacking information on the variables that regulate losses of this gas to the atmosphere. The measured emission factors (EFs) have proved to be consistent with the ranges reported by international literature, showing appreciable differences in magnitude among manures and synthetic N-fertilisers and among different field management practices. This is supported by the ALFAM model estimation, which has also shown a strong dependency upon the simulated measurement methods. The reviewed EFs for the different type of fertilisers were compared with the values used by the European and Italian emission inventories. Despite the agreement between these values, our analysis emphasized that the reviewed EFs cannot be regarded as representative for the national territory, mainly because of inconsistencies in the measurement methods...|$|R
40|$|<b>Livestock</b> <b>manures</b> {{are major}} sources of nutrients, used for the {{fertilisation}} of cropland and grassland. Accurate estimates of the amounts of nutrients in <b>livestock</b> <b>manures</b> are required for nutrient management planning, but also for estimating nitrogen (N) budgets and emissions to the environment. Here we report on N excretion factors {{for a range of}} animal categories in policy reports by member states of the European Union (EU). Nitrogen excretion is defined in this paper as the total amount of N excreted by livestock per year as urine and faeces. We discuss the guidelines and methodologies for the estimation of N excretion factors by the EU Nitrates Directive, the OECD/Eurostat gross N balance guidebook, the EMEP/EEA Guidebook and the IPCC Guidelines. Our results show that N excretion factors for dairy cattle, other cattle, pigs, laying hens, broilers, sheep, and goats differ significantly between policy reports and between countries. Part of these differences may be related to differences in animal production (e. g. production of meat, milk and eggs), size/weight of the animals, and feed composition, but partly also to differences in the aggregation of livestock categories and estimation procedures. The methodologies and data used by member states are often not well described. There is a need for a common, harmonised methodology and procedure for the estimation of N excretion factors, to arrive at a common basis for the estimation of the production of manure N and N balances, and emissions of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) across the EU. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R
40|$|To {{successfully}} curb {{microbial contamination}} of surface waters {{we need to}} understand, and holistically evaluate, the range of mitigation strategies that {{have been designed to}} protect watercourses from non-point agricultural sources, so as to use them to best effect. A cost-effective and pragmatic approach is to improve knowledge of farm management operations capable of (i) reducing potential pathogen numbers in <b>livestock</b> <b>manures</b> and (ii) reducing subsequent transfer (through the environment) of fecal micro-organisms derived from <b>livestock</b> <b>manures</b> that are recycled to land. This will prove important for supporting farmer decision making, devising policy and implementing mitigation practices to limit fecal micro-organism delivery from land to water. In this chapter, we consider a diverse suite of manure, animal and land management options that range from simple manure composting techniques and the use of slurry additives, through to land management engineering approaches and the design of constructed wetlands to protect watercourses from microbial contamination. The choice as to which strategy to use, if any, is ultimately made by the farmer and is likely to be influenced by a complex range of factors which may include, for example, tradition, convenience and farm economics. We conclude that the inherent complexity associated with heterogeneous landscapes confounds the likelihood that a single management strategy will provide complete protection of receiving waters from microbial contamination. Instead, the coupling of different strategies alongside improved education and considerable vigilance by farmers and land-owners is needed for a more sustainable approach to limiting diffuse microbial (and, crucially, other contaminant) pollution from agriculture...|$|R
