Japanese models all had chrome <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and European and Australian versions all had painted <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> The USA <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> tradition continued until model year 2010 on the fifth generation Legacy platform, with Subaru using black plastic instead of chrome starting with 1994 Legacy lower trim levels.

To operate the door we need <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> and it’s {{the most important part}} in <b>door.</b> <b>Door</b> <b>handles</b> are used for opening and closing of a door with minimum effort. Various types of <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> such as lever handle, doorknob and pull handles are the different kind of handles we came across in our day to day life. There are various designs of <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> are available so that we are unaware of <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> selection criteria. Different shapes can be designed on the basis of user reaction to the available <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> How we operate on the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is one key factor for selection of <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> There are various other factors associate with <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> such as style, comfort, cost etc. It’s not just a device used for opening and closing of door but also for locking purpose. <b>Door</b> <b>handles</b> are divided on the basis of different types of door, finishes, and shapes...|$|R

Current {{approaches}} for opening door usually {{focus on the}} recognition of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> in a fixed position, {{but in the process}} of door opening, a manipulator with a mobile platform is very important under real-world scenarios, which brings significance to the location and distance measurement of a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> when the mobile platform is moving. In this paper, a method for location of a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> in HSI color space is presented. The image of the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is captured by the kinect for Xbox 360, and is processed in HSI color space, resulting in a rectangle frame fitted to the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> to be displayed in real time. The distance value of the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is obtained from the depth image. Experiment results show the efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R

25|$|Designed by Alfa Centro Stile {{under the}} {{guidance}} of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its style included high curved flanks, retro styled front <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> recessed rear <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> and a dramatic deep grille, which necessitated a highly unusual off-centre licence plate holder. The car {{was one of the first}} saloons, and wagons, to feature hidden rear <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and prominent front <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> to give it a coupé look. The design was influenced by three historical Alfa Romeo models: the 1900, the Giulietta and the Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31.|$|R
50|$|The Lever lock <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> on a {{backplate}} {{is another}} type of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> which operates similarly to the lever latch <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> This type of handle on a backplate consists of a lever and just below it, a key hole cut. This allows a key to be inserted into the door to control a mortice sash lock. Just the like the lever latch, the door can be opened and shut by pushing the handle but can also be locked using a key. This locking mechanism is why this type of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is used for front and back doors of residential housing.|$|R

50|$|<b>Door</b> <b>handles</b> {{provide a}} {{suitable}} environment for bacteria to spread easily, {{this makes it}} a hotspot for bacteria to gather and create colonies. After {{a study conducted by}} the Worcester Polytechnic institute, WPI, gathered that 1323 bacterial colonies were displaced among 27 <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> This study was conducted on the university campus, an area which is considered fairly dense in population, which many people will access these doors, providing a host for the bacteria to travel elsewhere. Flu viruses can have the potential to last up to 24 hours on <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> Over this period of time, this gives measure for the bacteria to further spread or even other <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> This bacteria on exposure can be harmful to humans, potentially infecting us with diseases such as e-coli, fungal or other viral infections. Many people may forget the potential for bacteria to thrive on <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> and after exposure may touch their face, or other places that may lead to ingesting it into their body. The study conducted by WPI using a hidden camera discovered that out of 1,060 and over of a period of 35 minutes, 86 people touched their face after exposure with the <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R
40|$|Foot-operated {{door opener}} to {{eliminate}} the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> {{as a source of}} contamination Fußtüröffner zur Ausschaltung der Kontaminationsquelle Türklinke Aim: As <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> represent a transmission route for viruses and micro-organisms, a door opening and closing mechanism should be developed without manual operation.

Results: The design enables mechanical opening of the door with a foot pedal without manual operation. Subsequently, the door closes with the help of a mechanical locking mechanism. Discussion: The foot-operated door opener constitutes an additional option to the <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> Together with the equipment of a soft closing mechanism, it is possible to prevent noise emanating from the door latch impinging on the door frame. Using this construction, the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> as a transmission vector is eliminated. In addition, the transport of goods held with two hands simultaneously is facilitated.

50|$|The {{most common}} and basic type of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is the Lever latch <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> on a {{backplate}} found in residential houses and commercial and public buildings.

When the handle is pushed down, the spindle rotates which “passes through the door and the tubular latch inside the door allowing the door to be opened”. This type of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is normally found on doors leading into the living and dining rooms as they don’t require any type of locking. The lever latch handle is also easy to install and use and is available in a variety of styles and finishes.|$|R
