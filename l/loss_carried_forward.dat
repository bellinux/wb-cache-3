30|$|Recognizing the {{existence}} of <b>loss</b> <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and carried backward in the US corporate tax system, Mackie–Mason (1990) analysed {{the effects of the}} marginal tax rate on debt policy. He found that when a company has <b>loss</b> <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and investment tax credit (i.e., another tax shield), it is less likely to raise capital by new debt issue. Since both existing <b>loss</b> <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and investment tax credit are substitutes for new debt issue in terms of tax savings, this result is consistent with the trade-off theory.|$|E
40|$|In data envelopment analysis, {{there are}} several methods for {{measuring}} efficiency change over time, e. g. the window analysis and the Malmquist index. However, they usually neglect carry-over activities between consecutive two terms. These carry-overs {{play an important role}} in measuring the efficiency of decision making units in each term as well as over the whole terms based on the long-term viewpoint. Dynamic DEA model proposed by Färe and Grosskopf is the first innovative contribution for such purpose. In this paper we develop their model in the slacks-based measure (SBM) framework, called Dynamic SBM (DSBM). The SBM model is non-radial and can deal with inputs/outputs individually, contrary to the radial approaches that assume proportional changes in inputs/outputs. Furthermore, according to the characteristics of carry-overs, we classify them into four categories, i. e. desirable, undesirable, free and fixed. Desirable carry-overs correspond, for example, to profit carried forward and net earned surplus carried to the next term, while undesirable carry-overs include, for example, <b>loss</b> <b>carried</b> <b>forward,</b> bad debt and dead stock. Free and fixed carry-overs indicate, respectively, discretionary and non-discretionary ones. We develop Dynamic SBM models that can evaluate the overall efficiency of decision making units for the whole terms as well as the term efficiencies. DEA, Dynamic DEA, DSBM, Carry-over...|$|E

50|$|A group {{relief is}} {{available}} {{independently of the}} seat of a company within the EU. Therefore, the CCCTB implies a consolidation of losses and profits within the group. The allocation of the overall profit would not be determined by separate accounting but by the formula. Because of EU-wide consolidation of profits and losses, each Member State bears a subsidiary's loss in proportion to {{its share of the}} overall profit. Acceptance of foreign losses by Member States is thus easier to attain. Because of the consolidation of the EU-wide operations of the firm, it is sensible to assume that there are sufficient profits to absorb losses of group members. Hence, an immediate cross-border loss compensation is available, making interest and liquidity disadvantages disappear. In the case of an overall <b>loss,</b> a <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> and a <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> back must exist in each Member State.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of tax asymmetries (the lack of full loss offsets) under current {{corporate}} income tax law and a stylized tax reform proposal. The government's tax claim on the firm's pretax cash flows is modelled {{as a series of}} path-dependent call options and valued by option pricing procedures and Monte Carlo simulation. The tax reform investigated reduces the statutory tax rate, eliminates the investment tax credit and sets tax depreciation approximately equal to economic depreciation. These changes would increase the effective tax rate on marginal investments by firms that always pay taxes, but dramatically reduce the potential burden of tax asymmetries. "Stand-alone" investments, which are exposed to the greatest burden, are uniformly more valuable under this reform, despite the loss of the investment tax credit and accelerated depreciation. These general results are backed up by a series of numerical experiments. We vary investment risk, inflation (with and without indexing of tax depreciation), and investigate how allowing interest on <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> <b>forwards</b> would affect after-tax project value. ...|$|R

The empirical analysis is based on data of German multinationals. The data is taken from the MiDi database provided by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). Regarding the tax loss treatment of potential future losses, our regression results suggest that a short carryforward time limit lowers investments in industries having a high probability to make losses. Moreover, we find significant positive effects of group loss offsetting provisions on the size of investments and on the number of subsidiaries they are structured across.

In this article we {{study the effects of}} a set of more flexible rules – discretionary tax depreciation (DTD) – introduced in the Netherlands during the 2009 – 2011 economic crisis. Our simulation results show DTD, which allows firms to accelerate and also to postpone depreciation, to be much more effective than bonus depreciation in reducing the expected value of tax payments, especially in crisis periods. Using a sample of 325 clients of a single office of a Dutch accounting firm, we show that DTD has led to higher investments in assets qualifying for discretionary depreciation for firms that faced the highest marginal tax rate. For other firms, the additional investments crowd out investments in assets that do not qualify for DTD. Our analysis on the actual depreciation choices reveals that firms postpone depreciation when facing <b>losses</b> or <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> <b>forwards,</b> or to smooth taxable income under the progressive tax system.

40|$|As Southeast European {{countries}} have {{become much more}} attractive for foreign investors since 2000, this paper analyses factors that have influenced FDI inflows in these economies. There is a broad consensus that, regardless {{of the type of}} FDI, the most important FDI determinants include market size, prospects for market growth, the degree of development of host countries and the progress made in the process of transition, especially progress in institutional development. Still, the specific FDI determinant in SEECs has been the privatization process, especially that of large-scale state assets. The assessment of the impact of tax incentives on FDI is evolving - showing increasing evidence that tax incentives in their broadest sense could {{have a significant impact on}} the pattern of regional FDI. The effects of incentives are likely to be particularly strong in the competition for FDI within regions, when the initial investment decision has been taken and the investor is choosing between alternative locations in a given region. In such circumstances, taxes will start to play an important role, especially corporate income tax. Its tax rate is of crucial importance and will play a major role in attracting investment. Accelerated depreciation and tax credits (allowances) for investment are even more cost efficient and could be seen as a good supplement to the former major factor. Tax holidays should be avoided.

40|$|As the Norwegian {{continental}} shelf is maturing, the interest from major international companies is falling. New and smaller players {{that will have}} to take over {{do not have the same}} credit ratings as the majors, and will thus have to finance their investment activities at a higher interest rate. Additionally, the petroleum industry is characterized by large up-front investments, which forces new players to <b>carry</b> <b>losses</b> <b>forward</b> until they have production on stream. This reduces the value of a project, as the interest rate charged by creditors is much higher than the <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> rate given by the state. Allowing companies to pledge their tax balance will reduce the interest cost, and lower the barriers of entry. Based on the regulations in the Petroleum Tax Act, the cash flow of investments was modeled. Historic numbers and projections of future investments were used to find an applicable investment level. It was assumed that companies could finance the majority of the tax value of investments with debt. Applying an estimate for the industry’s weighted average interest rate provided the interest cost per annum. The value of allowing companies to pledge tax allowances was estimated by adjusting the interest rate to a level representative for secured debt. The model gave an annual interest cost of NOK 7. 30 bn. before tax. Tax deductions of interest costs were calculated to be approximately 60 percent, giving an after tax cost of NOK 2. 82 bn. After adjusting the interest rate, the interest cost was reduced by NOK 860 mm. This is a reduction of 11. 77 percent, with the state receiving NOK 528 mm. and the industry NOK 332 mm. after tax. The Norwegian state is already by law obliged to pay out the remaining depreciation of investments, even if extractive business is ceased. The state would receive the majority of the reduced interest costs through increased tax revenue. More important, cheaper funding costs can help ensure that petroleum activity in Norway is continued in the years to come.

40|$|Midwestern producers, {{especially}} livestock producers, {{may find}} that their projected farm expenses exceed anticipated farm income for the current tax year. These farm losses are likely to cause cash flow difficulties. However, for some producers, farm losses may generate cash inflows {{in the form of}} tax refunds. Tax law allows choices with respect to farm losses. Losses in one tax year may be carried back two years or five years to obtain refunds of taxes previously paid, or <b>losses</b> may be <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> to offset tax liabilities in future years. Many farmers had high incomes in 2007 and 2008, and carrying back a 2009 loss is likely to generate an income tax refund. If <b>carrying</b> a 2009 <b>loss</b> back two or five years has little or no tax benefit, a producer can elect to <b>carry</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>forward.</b> Therefore, producers with farm losses should analyze their carryback and carryforward alternatives and not just file their current year’s tax return. The farm loss reported on Schedule F (Form 1040) is generally not the same as a net operating loss (NOL) for income tax purposes. The NOL concept is simple, but computation of the NOL deduction and NOL carryback can be quite complex. This complexity arises because various tax benefits must be removed by modifying the deductions of the loss year and modifying the income in the carryback year or years. Similar modifications are made if the <b>loss</b> is <b>carried</b> <b>forward.</b> Because of these modifications, the tax benefits of the loss may be reduced significantly.

40|$|Section 20 of the Income Tax Act, No 58 of 1962 {{allows a}} {{taxpayer}} that incurs an assessed <b>loss</b> to <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> {{the balance of}} assessed loss incurred, to be set off against taxable income earned in or added to losses incurred in future years. The issues regarding the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> of assessed <b>losses</b> in terms of section 20 is complex {{and in terms of}} the said section, a company is only entitled to set off its assessed loss from the previous year against its taxable income in the current year, if the taxpayer has carried on a trade during the current year and has derived income from that trade. Under the provisions of section 20 (2 A), a taxpayer other than a company can utilise an assessed loss even if no trading has been conducted. Assessed losses of natural persons, may however be ring-fenced. The aim of this treatise was twofold. Firstly it was to gain clarity on the „trade‟ and „income from trade‟ issues and secondly to compare South African legislation with that of Australia, with a view to recommending a change in our rules regarding the treatment of assessed losses in the context of companies. The critical lessons to be learned from the cases presented, is that liquidators, creditors and others must ensure that the company continues trading in order to x keep the assessed losses valid. Realisation of assets (including stock), and the collection of outstanding debts during liquidation does not constitute the carrying on of a trade in terms of s 20 (1). The continuity of trade is an important element in regard to the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> of assessed <b>losses</b> to be utilised in the current and future years. Therefore it is important that a company carries on some activity that falls within the definition of trade. In the landmark case of SA Bazaars, it was held that a company did not have to trade continuously throughout the year to qualify for the set-off of the assessed <b>loss</b> or <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> of the assessed loss, that is, to trade for say part of the year. The court however left open the issue of whether it was necessary to derive income from that trade. In order to clarify the issues regarding assessed losses, SARS issued Interpretation Note 33 granting taxpayers a concession in certain cases where a company has traded, but not derived income from that trade. But in ITC 1830, the court ruled that a company must trade and must derive income from that trade in order to <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> its assessed <b>loss,</b> which effectively means that SARS cannot apply Interpretation Note 33. SARS does not have the authority to make concession which is contrary to the wording of the Act. xi In Australia, operating <b>losses</b> can be <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> indefinitely to be set-off against future income, provided a company meets the more than 50 % continuity of ownership test. Where the continuity test fails, losses can be deducted if the same business is carried on in the income year (the same business test). From the research conducted and in order to solve the issues surrounding the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> of assessed <b>losses</b> it was suggested that one of the following be adopted :- The method used in Australia for the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> of assessed <b>losses.,</b> or A decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal is needed for a departure from the literal meaning of the words pertaining to the requirements regarding the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> of assessed <b>losses.</b> Furthermore, to clarify the definition of „income‟, as used in the context of s 20, is it gross income less exempt income or taxable income?. If section 20 relates to taxable income, then an assessed loss will never be increased, which it is submitted, is not what the legislature intended.

In separating individual tax incentives mainly used in the SADC region the study gives a robust analysis on the impact of each tax incentive on FDI inflows into SADC countries. The tax incentives used in this study are: tax holidays, corporate income tax (CIT), reduced CIT in specific sectors and <b>losses</b> <b>carried</b> <b>forward.</b> The study also derives data indices for governance, infrastructure and economic policy variables which gives the study clean and reliable data for efficient regression results. These macroeconomic data derivations assist in giving the FDI attraction analysis more variables and well behaved data in drawing conclusions. Through an analysis and comparison of trends in FDI inflows and stock data in different African regions the study draws important conclusions on the impact of the socio-economic environment in FDI attraction. The study, in consultation with data from the period 2004 to 2013 separates the SADC countries into four panels based on resource richness. Panel 1 includes the resources-rich countries, Panel 2 the resources-poor countries, Panel 3 all SADC countries, except South Africa and Panel 4 all the SADC countries. Each of the estimate models in this study, use individual tax incentives variables to avoid the effects of collinearity between different tax incentives variables and to improve the predictive power of the panel data models. This study derived tax incentives data for individual SADC countries, from Ernst and Young’s worldwide tax data. Regular tax incentives in the SADC are derived from tax holidays, corporate income tax (CIT); <b>losses</b> <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and reduced CIT in specific sectors. This study seeks to achieve two major objectives: firstly, to establish the effectiveness of tax incentives in attracting FDI inflows into SADC countries, and, secondly, to establish other variables that influence FDI inflows into SADC countries. The study estimated four panels for SADC countries, separated according to resource richness. This was done because different types of FDI are dependent on the available resources in developing countries and thus factors that influence the FDI inflows differ according to resource richness. Resource-seeking FDI moves to resources-rich economies, market-seeking FDI goes to economies that have access to larger markets and efficiency-seeking and strategic-asset-seeking FDI move to economies that ensure efficient use of their capital resources. Thus, as expected, factors that attract FDI to countries in the separate panels differ in direction of causality and magnitude of impact. The study adopts a system Generalised Method of Moments (SYS GMM) methodology {{to address the problem of}} endogeneity associated with dynamic panel data models. The estimated results established that tax holidays positively explain FDI inflows in Panel 2. CIT was found to negatively affect FDI inflows into all SADC countries despite their particular category of resource-richness. <b>Losses</b> <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> are insignificant in all panels and reduced CIT in specific sectors negatively influences FDI inflows in Panel 1 and surprisingly positively influences FDI inflows in Panel 2. The lagged FDI variable shows a positive relationship with current year FDI inflows. The governance index is significant and positively affects FDI inflows in panels 1, 3 and 4. Panel 2 shows a negative relationship between governance and FDI inflows. Market potential measured by GDP growth rate is insignificantly different from zero in all the four panels in the study and negatively signed, except in models A and C of Panel 2. The stock of infrastructure is significant and negatively signed in all the panels. The log natural resources variable though insignificant in some models, mainly, exhibit a significant and negative effect in most models of the study’s panel estimations. The trade openness variable is positively related to FDI inflows in Panel 1. Panel 2 show negative effects of trade openness to FDI inflows. Financial globalisation significantly impacts positive FDI inflows in all the four panels. The economic policy variable is insignificant in all the four panels of the study, except, in model B of Panel 1 where it is weakly significant at 10 % level and negatively signed. The study concludes that tax incentives are important in FDI attraction in the SADC countries; therefore, an effective tax mix that ensures efficient use of tax incentives is important to ensure sustainable FDI inflows into the region. Good governance is important in the region for FDI inflows to increase. Increasing government rents from natural resources reduces FDI inflows in the SADC. Previous year flows of FDI are positively related to current year inflows, thus consistent FDI attraction policies in the SADC are important. Infrastructure in the SADC should be consistently improved to ensure suitability with the dynamic nature of foreign investment. Financial markets should be developed to ensure effective flow of capital and growth in economies through more investment. EconomicsD. Com [...] (Economics...|$|R
