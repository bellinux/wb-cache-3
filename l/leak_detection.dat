5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is <b>leak</b> <b>detection.</b> Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E

5|$|While {{balloons}} {{are perhaps}} the best known use of helium, they are a minor part of all helium use. Helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties, such as its low boiling point, low density, low solubility, high thermal conductivity, or inertness. Of the 2014 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (180 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 32% of the total in 2014) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers. Other major uses were pressurizing and purging systems, welding, maintenance of controlled atmospheres, and <b>leak</b> <b>detection.</b> Other uses by category were relatively minor fractions.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> and shutoff, and other techniques.

40|$|PurposePeridevice leaks after left atrial {{appendage}} (LAA) closure with the Amplatzer® Cardiac Plug (ACP) {{have been reported}} using trans oesophageal Echocardiography (TOE), but this evaluation is challenging, and the few available data are inconsistent. There are currently few data regarding the evaluation of cardiac CT (CT) for peridevice <b>leaks</b> <b>detection.</b> We aimed to assess the incidence and the related factors of ACP peridevice leaks using CT. MethodsCardiac-CT using a multi-phase protocol and a second-generation dual-source-CT-system was performed in 45 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 24 h before the procedure and 3 months after LAA closure with ACP. Peridevice leak {{was defined as a}} presence of opacification of the LAA by the contast agent. ResultsFourty three patients were included, aged 73 ± 9. 4 years. ACP size compared to mean diameter of the landing zone measured by CT was oversized by 2. 7 ± 2. 2 mm. Peridevice leaks were found on CT in 18 patients (41. 9 %). The rate of peridevice leaks was lower among patients in whom the ACP oversizing was 3 mm, 23. 5 % and 55 % respectively, p= 0. 052. The size of the LAA landing zone did not correlate significantly with the presence of peridevice leak (20. 6 ± 3. 7 vs 21. 5 ± 4. 2 mm, p= 0. 47). The shape of the LAA was not associated with peridevice leaks (p= 0. 39). Clinical outcome with a mean follow-up 14. 7 months was similar in both groups with 1 stroke in the peride-vice leak group and 2 in the other group (5. 5 % and 8 % respectively). ConclusionsCardiac CT scan is an accurate technique for peridevice <b>leaks</b> <b>detection.</b> Important oversizing of the device is not associated with absence of residual leaks. There is a trend toward more residual leaks in the biggest LAAs. No adverse outcome were related with a residual leak...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{number of}} Android apps have grown explosively in re-cent {{years and the}} number of apps leaking private data have also grown. It is {{necessary}} to make sure all the apps are not leaking private data before putting them to the app markets and thereby a privacy <b>leaks</b> <b>detection</b> tool is needed. We propose a static taint analysis approach which leverages the control-flow graph (CFG) of apps to detect privacy leaks among Android apps. We tackle three problems related to inter-component communication (ICC), lifecycle of components and callback mechanism making the CFG imprecision. To bridge this gap, we ex-plicitly connect the discontinuities of the CFG to provide a precise CFG. Based on the precise CFG, we aim at providing a taint analysis approach to detect intra-component privacy leaks, inter-component privacy leaks and also inter-app privacy leaks...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, water stress has been {{imminent}} in most municipalities around the world. The problem of water losses from pipelines {{is a major concern}} due to the increasing demands. Leakage is normally responsible for a large percentage of water losses in distribution systems and results in enormous wastage of valuable resources and energy. Leaks may be developed in many forms and locations in the system and active <b>leak</b> <b>detections</b> are required to find and repair damaged pipes. Few studies have been done on the soil-leak interaction in real pipeline systems. Recent research have shown that the high velocity water jets entering the surrounding soil causes a fluidisation zone outside leaks. The fluidised zone of soil and water is responsible for dissipating most of the energy of the water jet from the pipe leak and thus, limiting the leak's ability to reach soil surface. In municipalities where active <b>leak</b> <b>detections</b> are not implemented, it is easier for municipalities to detect leaks if they appear on the surface and thus, it is crucial to understand the routes of water leaks and the factors causing them to appear above the ground. This study investigated the soil-leak interaction focusing mainly on factors affecting leakage flow paths in water distribution systems. An experimental set up was designed and built to study the different factors in a controlled environment. A series of experiments were performed where water jets from manufactured circular leaks were released in different trench set ups. Three main variables were investigated namely flow rate, leak orientation and in-situ soil to start understanding the movement of the leak flow as a preliminary study. The volumetric moisture content were measured using EC- 5 moisture sensors at different locations in the tank to analyse the movement of leakage water and iPERLS smart water meters were used to measure the flow of water through the walls of the trench. The results of the experiments showed how much leakage water is actually lost through the side and bottom walls. The volumetric moisture content readings indicated the movement of the leak in the tank. The results of the study indicated that leak orientation has the greatest influence on the paths of the leaks. Also, the flow rate had to be increased to a very high value so that the leak appears above the sand surface. The permeability of the in-situ soil was found to have the least effect on the leakage flow paths...|$|R

40|$|Complex {{respiratory}} events, {{which may}} have a detrimental effect on both quality of sleep and control of nocturnal hypoventilation, occur during sleep in patients treated by non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Among these events are patient-ventilator asynchrony, increases in upper airway resistance with or without increased respiratory drive, and <b>leaks.</b> <b>Detection</b> of these events is important in order to select the most appropriate ventilator settings and interface. Simple tools can provide important information when monitoring NIV. Pulse-oximetry is important to ensure that an adequate SpO 2  is provided, and to detect either prolonged or short and recurrent desaturations. However, the specificity of pulse-oximetry tracings under NIV is low. Transcutaneous capnography discriminates between hypoxemia related to V/Q mismatch and hypoventilation, documents correction of nocturnal hypoventilation, and may detect ventilator-induced hyperventilation, a possible cause for central apnea/hypopnea and glottic closure. Data provided by ventilator software helps the clinician by estimating ventilation, tidal volume, leaks, rate of inspiratory or expiratory triggering by the patient, although further validation of these signals by independent studies is indicated. Finally, autonomic markers of sympathetic tone using signals such as pulse wave amplitude of the pulse-oximetry signal can provide reliable information of sleep fragmentation...|$|R
