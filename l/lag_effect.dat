40|$|What is {{the effect}} of US {{macroeconomic}} policy on the business cycle of South Asian economies? The evidence reported in this article suggests that there is little systematic contemporaneous effect of US monetary policy on South Asian GDP. The <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> of US monetary policy tends to be statistically significant, but it appears that a monetary expansion in the US in year t lowers real GDP in year t + 1 in a majority of South Asian economies. Conversely, US fiscal policy has both contemporaneous and <b>lagged</b> Keynesian <b>effects</b> in a majority of countries. Interestingly, the <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> is quantitatively larger than the contemporaneous effect. The paper also looks at the impact of domestic macroeconomic policy in South Asian countries. Two key results emerge in this respect. First, the contemporaneous effects of domestic monetary and fiscal policy are in line with â€˜Keynesianâ€™ predictions: an increase (decrease) in government consumption or money growth increases (decreases) real GDP. Second, there is also evidence of significant <b>lagged</b> <b>effects</b> of domestic macroeconomic policies. However, while the sign of the <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> of fiscal policy is generally the same as the sign of the contemporaneous effect, for monetary policy the sign of the <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> is inverted in some countries.

40|$|Aims The {{plasticity}} {{of ecosystem}} responses could buffer and postpone {{the effects of}} climates on ecosystem carbon fluxes, but this <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> is often ignored. In this study, we used carbon flux data collected from three typical grassland ecosystems in China, including a temperate semiarid steppe in Inner Mongolia (Neimeng site, NM), an alpine shrub-meadow in Qinghai (Haibei site, HB) and an alpine meadow steppe in Tibet (Dangxiong site, DX), to examine the time <b>lagged</b> <b>effects</b> of environmental factors on CO 2 exchange. Methods Eddy covariance {{data were collected from}} three typical Chinese grasslands. In linking carbon fluxes with climatic factors, we used their averages or cumulative values within each 12 -month period and we called them 'yearly' statistics in this study. To investigate the <b>lagged</b> <b>effects</b> of the climatic factors on the carbon fluxes, the climatic 'yearly' statistics were kept still and the 'yearly' statistics of the carbon fluxes were shifted backward 1 month at a time. Important Findings Soil moisture and precipitation was the main factor driving the annual variations of carbon fluxes at the alpine HB and DX, respectively, while the NM site was under a synthetic impact of each climatic factor. The time <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> analysis showed that temperature had several months, even half a year <b>lag</b> <b>effects</b> on CO 2 exchange at the three studied sites, while moisture's effects were mostly exhibited as an immediate manner, except at NM. In general, the <b>lagged</b> climatic <b>effects</b> were relatively weak for the alpine ecosystem. Our results implied that it might be months or even 1 year before the variations of ecosystem carbon fluxes are adjusted to the current climate, so such <b>lag</b> <b>effects</b> could be resistant to more frequent climate extremes and should be a critical component to be considered in evaluating ecosystem stability.

40|$|Although {{the concept}} of {{monetary}} policy lag has historical roots deep in the monetary economics literature, relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to the idea. In this paper, we build on Svensson’s (1997) inflation targeting framework by explicitly taking into account the <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> of monetary policy and characterize the optimal monetary policy reaction function both in the absence and in the presence of the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate. We numerically show the function to be more aggressive and more pre-emptive with the <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> than without it. We also characterize the long-run stabilization cost to the central bank by explicitly taking into account the <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> of monetary policy. It turns out that, in the presence of the zero lower bound constraint, the long-run stabilization cost is higher with the <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> than the case without it. This result suggests that the central bank and/or the government should set a relatively high inflation target when confronted with a relatively long monetary policy lag. This can be interpreted as another justification for targeting a positive inflation rate in the long-run. Inflation targets; Monetary policy framework; Monetary policy implementation...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{large number}} of studies have {{reported}} the relationship between ambient temperature and mortality. However, few studies have focused on the effects of high temperatures on cardio-cerebrovascular diseases mortality (CCVDM) and their acute events (ACCVDM). Objective: To assess the threshold temperature and time <b>lag</b> <b>effects</b> on daily excess mortality in Harbin, China. Methods: A generalized additive model (GAM) with a Poisson distribution was used to investigate the relative risk of mortality for each 1 °C increase above the threshold temperature and their time <b>lag</b> <b>effects</b> in Harbin, China. Results: High temperature threshold was 26 °C in Harbin. Heat effects were immediate and lasted for 0 – 6 and 0 – 4 days for CCVDM and ACCVDM, respectively. The acute cardiovascular disease mortality (ACVDM) seemed to be more sensitive to temperature than cardiovascular disease mortality (CVDM) with higher death risk and shorter time <b>lag</b> <b>effects.</b> The <b>lag</b> <b>effects</b> lasted longer for cerebrovascular disease mortality (CBDM) than CVDM; so did ACBDM compared to ACVDM.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> of macroeconomic {{variables on}} firm stock returns by employing {{data for the}} period from 1998 to 2012. The macroeconomic variables investigated in this study include: exchange rate, risk free rate, inflation, money supply and oil prices. For this purpose, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is applied. The findings declared that <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> of economic factors plays considerable role in explaining the firm stock returns. Such that three and four {{are the most common}} lags indicating significant and positive impact of exchange rate on firm stock returns. While, two and five lags are the most common lags implying statistically significant but negative relation of exchange rate with firm stock returns. However, it is uncovered that overall the statistically significant <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> of risk free rate on stock returns is negative in large and is found to be maximized at lag one. More so, <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> of inflation rests on quite worthy outcomes; firstly it is noted that its significant effect is shifted from negative to positive with the increase in lags from lag one to lag four. Secondly, it is established that four lags is the most common lag reflecting statistically significant positive impact of inflation on firm stock returns, while one and two lags are the most common lags displaying negative and significant relationship of inflation with firm stock returns. Taken together, money supply indicates significant positive <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> on firm stock returns in majority of the cases, that is subject to maximization either at lag two or lag five. However, largely, documenting significant positive <b>lagged</b> <b>effect</b> of oil prices on firm stock returns, it is established that one and two lags are the most common lags at which oil prices has significant and positive impact on firm stock returns.

40|$|Abstract: The {{distributed}} <b>lag</b> <b>effect</b> of ambient particulate {{air pollution}} that {{can be attributed to}} all cause mortality in Kathmandu valley, Nepal is estimated through generalized linear model (GLM) and generalized additive model (GAM) with autoregressive count dependent variable. Models are based upon daily time series data on mortality collected from the leading hospitals and exposure collected from the 6 six strategically dispersed fixed stations within the valley. The distributed <b>lag</b> <b>effect</b> is estimated by assigning appropriate weights governed by a mathematical model in which weights increased initially and decreased later forming a long tail. A comparative assessment revealed that autoregressive semi-parametric GAM is a better fit compared to autoregressive GLM.
