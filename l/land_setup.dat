50|$|While {{the mining}} camp itself went into decline, the nearby {{riverside}} landing established some years earlier for steamboats of the Colorado River began to thrive. The <b>landing,</b> <b>setup</b> for transport of ore {{and as a}} supply point for the mines some 17 mi east of the river, provided a new town site for the region, and was soon established as Castle Dome Landing. The post office re-opened under this new name on August 6, 1878, and the small port became an active supply and shipping depot for the mines in the Castle Dome Mountain mining district. For the next six years, Castle Dome Landing served as the first stop for steamboats traveling up the Colorado River from Yuma, and the town thrived, both as a supply and shipping point and as a popular destination for travelers from Yuma who came up the Colorado River for various celebrations held at the numerous river towns. For Castle Dome Landing, Mexican Independence Day on September 16 was the main draw.|$|R

40|$|Reactions of {{secondary}} beams at energies {{of several hundred}} MeV/u are utilized at the GSI radioactive beam facility to explore the structure of unstable nuclei. Scattering of radioactive nuclei can be studied by kinematically complete measurements with the <b>LAND</b> reaction <b>setup.</b> In the present article, experiments concerning inelastic excitations to the continuum will be discussed utilizing the electromagnetic excitation process at high energies. First experiments in this direction were performed for light neutron-rich nuclei. Two aspects are of particular interest: i) Nonresonant transitions to the continuum just above the threshold, which have been established as a spectroscopic tool to study the ground state single-particle structure of the projectile. ii) The dipole excitations of neutron-proton asymmetric systems, in particular collective excitations such as the giant dipole resonance or low-lying soft modes. ...|$|R

40|$|Large area (50 × 50 cm 2) scintillating fibre {{detectors}} {{are used}} to detect charged fragments in the reaction studies with relativistic ion beams in the <b>LAND</b> experimental <b>setup</b> at GSI. These detectors are employed to reconstruct the trajectory after a large acceptance dipole magnet (ALADIN) of the heavy fragments from the reactions {{in order to determine}} their masses. Each of these detectors consists of about 500 parallel fibres of 1 × 1 mm 2 cross section allowing for a precise position determination in the dispersive plane. Instead of reading each individual fibre separately, one end of each fibre is coupled to a position sensitive photomultiplier (PSPM), using a specially designed mask. The PSPM has a rectangular anode grid with 18 wires in one direction (u) and 16 wires in the orthogonal direction (v). When an ion passes through one of the fibre, the resultant light induce...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose to}} search for proton dipole pygmy {{resonances}} in nuclei near the proton drip line. Experimental evidence only exists for neutron pygmy resonances, but calculations infer the occurrence of proton pygmy resonances in proton-rich nuclei in the mass region A = 30 – 50. According to recent RQRPA calculations, low-lying E 1 transitions, well below the giant dipole resonance, reveal the dynamics of excess protons oscillating versus the core. The experiment uses Coulomb projectile excitation of secondary 32 Ar and 34 Ar beams of 700 MeV/u energy from the FRS in-flight separator and the upgraded <b>LAND</b> reaction <b>setup</b> in Cave C. In total, 10 days of beam time are requested. 1. Physics background The occurrence of the pygmy dipole resonances, pictured as the resonant dipole oscillation of a neutron or proton skin against the isospin-symmetric proton-neutron core in exotic nuclei is currently much under debate and subject to theoretical and experimental investigations. In fact, the onset of low-lying E 1 strength assigned to a neutron pygmy resonance was already observed in stable nuclei, 44, 48 Ca, 208 Pb [Rye- 02][End- 03][Har- 04], and some N= 82 isotones [Zil- 01], all of which exhibit an onl...|$|R

Using Ethiopian rural panel household survey data, we showed that perceived risks have adverse impact on households’ investment on land though the results vary with the investment indicators and the region under consideration. Our results underscore the importance of considering the institutional setup and the resultant risk environment in looking into the impact of property rights on land investment...|$|R

It shows that there are 3 types of tropical cyclones which can have effects on this area: direct landing, northward after landing and sea northward. For landing north type and offshore activity type, the distribution of setup contours is near parallel to the coastline; for direct landing type, maximum surge obviously occurs at <b>landing</b> point, and <b>setup</b> reduces gradually from the centre to outside. The storm surge in the submerged radial sandbars has a close relation with sea-floor relief and the combination of passing time of typhoon and astronomic tide. It is necessary for storm surge prediction or simulation to consider topography, route and the time going through synthetically...|$|R

However, I suppose it will not do to resent it, for these scoundrels would clearly be only too glad of an excuse to shoot us down; but if this sort of thing is going on at every village we pass through, we shall have hard work in keeping our tempers until we are fairly out of the Transvaal. I pity our countrymen who have bought <b>land</b> or <b>setup</b> stores in this country. I was never fond of the Boers, though I am willing to allow that they are a splendid set of men, and that they are {{magnificent}} riders and good shots. I question if we shall ever retain them against their will. Of course if we had a government which worked with energy and decision it would be a different matter altogether. There are a considerable number of English and Scotch settlers already here, and the natives would rise against the Dutch to a man if called upon to do so; and if a couple of dozen of their ringleaders were promptly seized and shot, there would be an end to the whole matter. But I know what it will be: the natives will not be encouraged or even allowed to rise, our soldiers, who can hardly hit a haystack at a hundred yards, will be shot down at a distance by the Boers, and, likely enough, we shall meet with a serious disaster, and then the English government will get frightened and make any terms these fellows demand." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{all know}} that in India many of the village’s still do not have electricity. But many a times it becomes {{difficult}} to transfer energy from its source / plant up to its destination and as the distance increases cost of electricity also goes on increasing. Now to tackle this problem there are many ideas. One of those is to generate own energy from the resources available. But electricity generation can be very costly. No construction of hydro dams is necessary for such an application. As well as in hydro power plants, compact helical turbines {{can be used in}} Wind Farms instead of conventional propeller-type machines of huge diameter. So to solve these problems we are making a Microhydro turbine with less initial cost and maintainace cost. So that electricity is available to everyone also in areas where it is not able to reach. Also it ` does not required much large <b>land</b> for its <b>setup.</b> The utilization of energy is an indication of the growth of a nation. For example, the per capit...|$|R
