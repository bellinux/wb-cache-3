40|$|In {{order to}} {{research}} the influence of homogeneity on the rockburst tendency and on AE characteristics of coal-rock combination body, uniaxial compressive tests of inhomogeneous coal-rock combination bodies obeyed by the Weibull distribution were simulated using particle flow code (PFC 2 D). Macromechanical properties, energy evolution law, and AE characteristics were analyzed. The results show that (1) the elastic modulus homogeneity mE has an exponential relation with macroscopic modulus E, and the bonding strength homogeneity mσ has an exponential relation with uniaxial compressive strength σc; (2) the rockburst tendency of the coal-rock combination body will increase {{with the increase of}} mE or mσ, and mσ is the leading factor influencing this tendency; and (3) both the change law of AE hits and <b>lasting</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> different periods of AE characteristics are influenced by mσ, but mE just influences the <b>lasting</b> <b>time.</b> The more inhomogeneous the coal-rock combination body is, the shorter the <b>lasting</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> booming period of AE characteristics will be. This phenomenon can be used to predict the rockburst tendency of the coal-rock combination body...|$|R

5|$|At {{one point}} as a {{tropical}} storm, the thunderstorm activity around Kristy {{appeared to be}} organizing into hooking bands, and further intensification was considered likely, potentially as strong as 60mph (95km/h). However, the thunderstorm activity decreased markedly on September6, primarily from dry air entrainment, and it weakened to tropical depression status for the <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> one forecast, Kristy was predicted {{to move into the}} area of warning responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, or west of 140°W. However, the depression was unable to maintain organized convection around its center for a few days, and Kristy degenerated into a remnant low on September8. The low turned to the southwest, degenerating into a tropical wave on September9 about 1500miles (2400km) southeast of the island of Hawaii, or about 1600miles (2600km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. The remnant disturbance continued westward, and initially Kristy was believed to have developed into Tropical Depression Two-C in the central Pacific Ocean; however, post-season analysis concluded the systems were separate.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 13th century, the Omiš {{branch of}} the Kačić family was {{involved}} in the politics of more powerful authorities. Their local hereditary oligarchy disappeared, but the Kačićs probably continued to live in the area. The war with Venice at {{the end of the}} 1270s and the beginning of the 1280s led to their loss of Omiš in favor of princes from the Šubić noble family. The Omiš Kačićs are mentioned for the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1294, when the Venetians wrote to Dubrovnik residents seeking compensation from Dubrovnik authorities who had failed to send an armed ship against Omiš pirates. It is not known whether Ivan, son of Matej Kačić, mentioned in Dubrovnik 1285, was related to the Omišani Kačićs. After that, Kačićs are no longer mentioned.|$|E

Further fighting occurred from 31 December 1941 – 2 January 1942, before Bardia was re-taken by the 2nd South African Division. Bardia changed hands again in June 1942, being occupied by Axis forces for a third time and was re-taken for the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> November unopposed, following the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein.|$|E
