5|$|Unlike typical record labels, Key Sounds Label {{does not}} license {{any of the}} artists {{featured}} on albums and singles released on the label. When Key Sounds Label formed, Jun Maeda, Shinji Orito, and Magome Togoshi were Key's signature composers and have continued to produce {{the majority of the}} music on Key Sounds Label. In October 2006, however, Togoshi left Key and is no longer affiliated with either Key or VisualArt's. One of the founding members of Key, OdiakeS, left Key before Key Sounds Label formed, but did contribute on the Kanon Original Soundtrack and the remixing of a song on Clannads remix album -Memento-. Key Sounds Label's roster features Japanese bands and singers, several of which originated from the I've Sound techno/trance music production group under VisualArt's, such as Ayana, Kotoko, Lia, Mell, Mami Kawada and Eiko Shimamiya. Other artists including Annabel, Chata, Karuta, Ayaka Kitazawa, LiSA, Marina, Runa Mizutani, Psychic Lover, Rita, Riya, Harumi Sakurai, Haruka Shimotsuki, Keiko Suzuki, Miyako Suzuta, Suzuyu, Aoi Tada, Tomoe Tamiyasu, and Nagi Yanagi have also been released on records through the label. The musical units Work-S, Eufonius, OTSU, PMMK, and MintJam have also produced music on Key Sounds Label. Musicians from I've Sound have been working with Key Sounds <b>Label</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arrangement of songs, as have many others.|$|E

5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the castor beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The <b>label</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E

40|$|To achieve {{automatic}} <b>labeling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> end {{surfaces of}} bundles of round steels for <b>the</b> steel plants, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{basis of the}} analysis of round steel production process, a set of automatic system for <b>labeling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> round steel end surfaces of bundles is designed. The system includes the robot visual location unit, the label supply unit, the pressure supply unit, the automatic labeling unit, the laser ranging unit, and the host computer communication control unit, etc [...] In the system, the robot visual location unit provides the round steel center location, and the automatic labeling unit implements automatic <b>labeling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> round steel. The system is tested under lab condition, which shows the system can effectively solve the artificial labeling problems such as fault paste and leakage paste of workers, and realize efficient and stable automatic labeling.

25|$|Notice {{that the}} end-loop marker {{specifies}} {{the name of}} the index variable, which must correspond to {{the name of the}} index variable in the start of the for-loop. Some languages (PL/I, FORTRAN 95 and later) allow a statement <b>label</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> start of a for-loop that can be matched by the compiler against the same text on the corresponding end-loop statement. Fortran also allows the EXIT and CYCLE statements to name this text; in a nest of loops this makes clear which loop is intended. However, in these languages the labels must be unique, so successive loops involving the same index variable cannot use the same text nor can a label be the same as the name of a variable, such as the index variable for the loop.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. IBM PC {{keyboard}} has 104 keys, {{while the}} PC keyboards for most {{other countries have}} 105 keys. In an operating system configured for a non-English language, the keys are placed differently. For example, keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release space for Ã‘/Ã±; similarly those for French or Portuguese may have a special key for the character Ã‡/Ã§. Keyboards designed for Japanese may have special keys to switch between Japanese and Latin scripts, and the character Â¥ (Japanese yen or Chinese yuan currency symbol) instead of \ (backslash, which may {{be replaced by the}} former in some typefaces and codepages). Using a keyboard for alternative languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional <b>label</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> key, because the standard keyboard layouts do not even share similar characters of different languages.|$|E
25|$|Lawler's {{greatest}} coup came in 1984, {{when she}} was granted full access to the Connecticut home of twentieth-century collectors Burton and Emily Tremaine (as it turns out, {{just a few years}} before much of their collection was dispersed at Christie's in 1988). As sometimes happens in the history of photography, the artist serendipitously discovered in one place the crux of her entire project. Working in available light with a 35mm camera, she found treasures everywhere she looked, such as this decorator's duet between the tortured gestural slashes of a late Jackson Pollock and the filigree of a Limoges soup bowl. In Living Room Corner, Arranged by Mr. & Mrs. Burton Tremaine, New York City (1984), a Robert Delaunay hangs above a television and a Lichtenstein bust, which {{has been turned into a}} lamp, seems to stare up and outward. For a later piece, Fragment/Frame/Text (#163) (1984), Lawler photographed a museum wall label next to a landscape painting by Claude Lorrain; only a fragment of the landscape appears in the photo. In Foreground (1994), a gelatin silver print showing an open-plan living area in the Chicago apartment of art collector Stefan Edlis, Jeff Koons' Rabbit (1986) can be seen next to a refrigerator. By manipulating the focus and the view-finder of the camera, Lawler demonstrated how an artwork is determined by the paradigms of the art world: A <b>label</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall of an auction house would become the focus of an image, with only a small fraction of the work itself visible, and the idea of the artwork as a commercial entity would be brought to mind.|$|E
