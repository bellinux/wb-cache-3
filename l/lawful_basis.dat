60|$|Now this {{distinction}} {{between rich and}} poor rests on two bases. Within its proper limits, on a basis which is lawful and everlastingly necessary; beyond them, on a basis unlawful, and everlastingly corrupting the framework of society. The <b>lawful</b> <b>basis</b> of wealth is, that a man who works should be paid the fair value of his work; and that if he does not choose to spend it to-day, he should have free leave to keep it, and spend it to-morrow. Thus, an industrious man working daily, and laying by daily, attains at last the possession of an accumulated sum of wealth, to which he has absolute right. The idle person who will not work, and the wasteful person who lays nothing by, {{at the end of the}} same time will be doubly poor--poor in possession, and dissolute in moral habit; and he will then naturally covet the money which the other has saved. And if he is then allowed to attack the other, and rob him of his well-earned wealth, there is no more any motive for saving, or any reward for good conduct; and all society is thereupon dissolved, or exists only in systems of rapine. Therefore the first necessity of social life is the clearness of national conscience in enforcing the law--that he should keep who has JUSTLY EARNED.|$|E

Article 9(3) of the ICCPR states that, “It shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody.” The United Nations Human Rights Committee, which provides authoritative interpretation of the covenant, has determined that bail should be granted except in cases {{in which there is a}} likelihood that the accused would abscond, destroy evidence, or influence witnesses.

Although the State conceded {{that the police had}} no <b>lawful</b> <b>basis</b> to effect the traffic stop, the California Supreme Court still held that the trial court was correct in denying the motion to suppress because, it reasoned, [...] "a passenger is not seized as a constitutional matter in the absence of additional circumstances that would indicate to a reasonable person that he or she was the subject of the peace officer's investigation or show of authority." [...] Simeroth was the exclusive target of the traffic stop, and so Brendlin was not seized until the police did something else to cast their eyes upon him.

5000|$|The clause's {{application}} to state-sanctioned same-sex marriages, civil unions, and domestic partnerships is unresolved, although {{the case of}} marriage has been rendered moot. In 1996 the U.S. Congress specifically passed a statute, known as the Defense of Marriage Act, which stated that states need not recognize same-sex marriages performed outside the state; this is interpreted to relieve states of their duty under the Full Faith and Credit clause. Between 1996 and 2004, 39 states passed laws and constitutional amendments that defined marriage as consisting solely of different-sex couples, most of which also explicitly prohibited the state from honoring same-sex marriages performed in other states and countries. Many of these state laws were struck down in federal courts, until the Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) made same-sex marriage legal in all U.S. states and territories. However, Obergefell did not rely on the Full Faith and Credit clause, but instead concludedThe Court, in this decision, holds same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States. It follows that the Court also must hold—and it now does hold—that there is no <b>lawful</b> <b>basis</b> for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex character.|$|E

40|$|Book Chapter The Limited Necessity of Resort to Force, in Imagining Law: Essays in Conversation with Judith Gardam 37 (Dale Stephens and Paul Babie eds., 2016). 2 ̆ 2 In this {{contribution}} to the volume in her honour, I propose to revisit her discussion of necessity in the jus ad bellum {{in large part to}} respond to recent interest in characterising necessity as a <b>lawful</b> <b>basis</b> for the resort to armed force. 2 ̆ 2 (37) 2 ̆ 2 The discussion begins with an overview of the general law on resort to force, then turns to a full focus on necessity. The principle of necessity is found in a number of international l aw categories with a distinctive meaning in each. Keeping the various meanings and histories separate is a challenge to scholars. In the area of resort to force, the principle of necessity is a restriction on force; it does not and cannot permit military force. In other categories of international law, necessity may provide a defence to otherwise unlawful action, such as imposition of a trade barrier, but not to the otherwise unlawful resort to military force. The conclusion here is that proposals to expand the right to use force by claiming necessity appear to be based on either a faulty understanding of necessity or faulty reasoning about the legal regime on the use of force.

40|$|In Boumediene v. Bush, 128 S. Ct. 2229 (2008), {{five members}} of the Supreme Court held that foreign prisoners at Guantanamo enjoy the {{constitutional}} privilege of habeas corpus; that their imprisonment had lasted too long for the Court to await completion of statutory review by lower courts of military tribunal findings that the prisoners were 2 ̆ 2 enemy combatants 2 ̆ 2; and that the statutory judicial review was too deficient to substitute for the Great Writ. Four Justices vigorously dissented. On the surface they differed {{on the history of the}} reach of the common law writ of habeas corpus, and on the procedural guarantees afforded by habeas, as compared to the new statutory procedures for judicial review. More fundamentally, the controlling differences were on questions of constitutional priorities and separation of powers. In assessing judicial review of prolonged detentions at Guantanamo, which constitutional value matters more - liberty or security? Which is more at risk? And which branch - the judicial or one of the political branches - is more suited to making these judgments? In assuring prisoners at Guantanamo access to habeas corpus, the majority extended a series of rulings in which the Court has defended individual liberty, judicial review of executive detentions, and ultimately the rule of law, against encroachments by an overzealous executive, joined in some cases by compliant congressional majorities. But the battle is only half won. The majority left open critical substantive and procedural questions. For example: Is there any <b>lawful</b> <b>basis</b> for indefinite detention of persons captured outside traditional war zones? What is the government 2 ̆ 7 s burden of proof in a habeas case from Guantanamo? How should the courts handle hearsay, classified evidence, and evidence obtained by coercive means? Although lower courts have subsequently begun to grapple with these questions, definitive answers may depend on the future composition of the Court - unless President-elect Obama fulfills his stated intention to close the prison at Guantanamo, in which event the issues may become moot, and this offense against the rule of law brought finally to an end...|$|E
40|$|As {{its name}} suggests, this {{yearbook}} {{focuses on a}} new reality: the gradual transformation {{of the international community}} and the structuring process of a global community in which a coherent legal system for a universal human society is being built. In recent years we have witnessed great changes in the structure and rules of the world community, as it moves away from the classical model based on mere inter-state society. The Yearbook attempts to chronicle the trend of the current international Order towards a coherent, <b>lawful</b> <b>basis</b> for a universal human society. With the founding of the United Nations, we have witnessed great changes {{since the end of the}} Second World War in the structure and rules of the international Order, away from the classical model based on mere inter-state society. International law is shifting its attention from the state to the individual: its traditional definition has been superseded, and it has developed a greater awareness and respect for the person, for ethnic groups, for man in a global sense, and for humankind and future generations in general. As a result, international law has developed rules that are increasingly oriented towards the individual. The principle of state sovereignty has been forced to confront significant changes hinging on the growing prominence of environmental awareness, of human rights protection, and of the rights of ethnic groups; furthermore, the sovereignty of states has had to make concessions to cultural heritage, sustainable growth, and international trade. As a consequence of these changes, new subjects –different in nature from states– are emerging on the international scene. These new actors are necessarily accompanied by new international procedures and safeguard mechanisms which seek to adapt to their particular characteristics and needs. International rules now al low individuals, groups of individuals, enterprises, and international non-governmental organizations to have recourse to international legal principles, and to participate in proceedings governing their own interests. At the same time, we have seen the principle of the direct responsibility of the individual for crimes against humanity (crimina juris gentium) be come established. The result of these trends is a deep transformation of the traditional model of the international community and its constitutive structure: since the Second World War, international society has developed substantive and procedural rules creating objective mechanisms to safeguard the interests and rights of humanity as a whole, by set ting up judicial organs and institutionalising procedures and forms of control over state activity, imposing limitations on the rights of states. In recent years we have witnessed a proliferation of international courts and tribunals, and a multiplication of those institutional mechanisms which, from their position of authority over states, guarantee the observance of accepted principles of both general and treaty law. The “legal” character of the international order is thus reinforced. International organizations, especially those of a universal vocation, participate in the management of international power through their organized structures and their organs, which, in various areas of international law, perform certain general functions –on behalf of the community of states– conferred on them by international law. The task of building a global community is currently only at the blue print stage, since the present international community is an unorganised and largely un-institutionalised entity; accomplishing such a task presupposes the gradual erosion of state sovereignty and a certain process of structuring of international institutions. In order for this to occur, the inter-state community must be integrated with international organizations, and to this end, norms must be developed to institutionalise appropriate procedures and mechanisms. Collective interests may thereby be safeguarded. These considerations explain the attention that the Yearbook devotes both to the activity of international organizations and to the decisions of international courts and tribunals; the latter, in particular, play a pivotal role in the process of change out lined above. In view of the absence of written general rules in the international legal order, the courts’ activity is not limited to merely applying the appropriate rule to the specific case, but takes the form of ascertaining the existence of relevant general rules and signalling the changes occurring in international society and its law, in some cases furthering such changes. It is the duty of the courts, in fulfilling their role of applying the norms of international law, to contribute to its harmonious development, eliminating the points of conflict which may arise from the interplay between international rules, or between those rules and domestic laws, as well as from the coexistence of different international courts and tribunals. The remarkable development of the international courts and tribunals has made it increasingly difficult to follow closely the wealth of case law now emanating from those jurisdictions, with out the help of an intermediary. It is this circumstance that has led to the idea of providing a yearly overview of the activities of these international organs, presented in the form of “legal maxims” based on summaries and extracts from the case law. These maxims will set out the points of law on which the international courts and tribunals have pronounced, either in their decisions regarding the state of general international law, or in their interpretations of treaty rules. The aim is to high light and make readily comprehensible the points of law declared in each dispute, thus widening awareness and knowledge of international judicial decisions. The maxims will be arranged following a systematic pattern, in such a way that the reader may be fully in formed about the cases covered; indeed, the maxims will not only contain detail about questions of law, but will ex plain the facts and cir cum stances of the specific case. Thus, it is to be hoped that they will also facilitate the reading of the full text of every decision considered. The originality and utility of this Yearbook lies precisely in this role of intermediation between the case law and international scholars, practitioners and students. Adopting a working method that reflects a functional criterion, the Yearbook is designed to provide information in an easily accessible form, set ting forth the points of law pronounced by international tribunals. Thus, the Yearbook includes an “Analytical Index” containing a wide range of items and sub-items. It provides a key for retrieval of the multifarious contents of the “legal maxims” contained, while its alphabetical order facilitates ready consultation. Moreover, the Yearbook fills the gap left by other Journals that provide partial or sectorial information about judicial decisions. Therefore a subsection of the section “Decisions of international courts and tribunals” will be de voted to each international tribunal or court, so as to carry out an annual survey of the activity of each one. As it would clearly be impracticable to consider every decision handed down by the various international organs, each subsection is prefaced by an “Introductory Note” providing a synopsis of the whole activity of the court or tribunal concerned over the course of the year. However, providing readers with critical information is not the only objective of this Yearbook. Above all, it aims to stimulate discussion on the most significant transformations in the world constitutive structure in a way that allows readers to monitor, from more than one angle, the development of the international legal order and the building of the global community heralded at the end of the second millennium. To this end, it provides academics and practitioners with the opportunity of presenting their views and commenting on the most critical developments in current international legal system, in the sections devoted to “Articles” as well as “Notes and Comments”...|$|E
