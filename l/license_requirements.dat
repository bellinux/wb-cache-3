This note proposes to replace the current money-transmitting state licensing framework with a single, federal <b>licensing</b> <b>requirement</b> in order to increase market competition and provide more reasonable prices to consumers. Federal licensing would alleviate the burden of varying state <b>licensing</b> <b>requirements</b> while still allocating to the states control of money transmission businesses through oversight of compliance with state consumer protection regulations...|$|R
