5|$|Many parasites <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> whales, notably whale lice and whale barnacles. Almost {{all species}} of whale lice are {{specialized}} towards a certain species of whale, and {{there can be}} more than one species per whale. Whale lice eat dead skin, resulting in minor wounds in the skin. Whale louse infestations are especially evident in right whales, where colonies propagate on their callosities. Though not a parasite, whale barnacles <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> the skin of a whale during their larval stage. However, in doing so it does not harm nor benefit the whale, so their relationship is often labeled as an example of commensalism. Some baleen whales will deliberately rub themselves on substrate to dislodge parasites. Some species of barnacle, such as Conchoderma auritum and whale barnacles, attach to the baleen plates, though this seldom occurs. A species of copepod, Balaenophilus unisetus, inhabits baleen plates of whales in tropical waters. A species of Antarctic diatom, Cocconeis ceticola, forms a film on the skin, which takes a month to develop; this film causes minor damage to the skin. They are also plagued by internal parasites such as stomach worms, cestodes, nematodes, liver flukes, and acanthocephalans.|$|E
5|$|Other highly {{specialized}} feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous {{compared to the}} animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. Although {{they have never been}} observed feeding, they are believed to <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Majora's Mask expands on that of Ocarina of Time; it {{retains the}} concept of dungeon puzzles and ocarina songs, and introduces character transformations and a three-day cycle. As in previous installments, Link can perform basic actions such as walking, running and limited jumping, and must use items to battle enemies and solve puzzles. Link's main weapon is the sword, which can be upgraded throughout the game. Other weapons and items are available—Link can block or reflect attacks with a shield, stun enemies by throwing Deku Nuts, attack from a distance with a bow and arrows, and destroy obstacles and damage enemies with bombs. He can also <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> objects or paralyze enemies with the Hookshot. Magic power allows attacks such as magical arrows or spin attacks, {{and the use of}} special items.|$|E
50|$|The {{hindrance}} of {{ill will}} (vyapada) is <b>latching</b> <b>onto</b> thoughts or feelings based on anger, resentment, hostility, bitterness, etc.|$|R

5|$|Weapons {{range from}} pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although {{all of them}} have {{unlimited}} ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like heat or toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members {{with the use of the}} Unity talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E
25|$|The entity {{emphasizes}} the aggressive nature in one's being, making the subject paranoid and highly obsessive. The Predator imbues its host {{with the power}} to <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> and manipulate people's minds, and is able to change and affect them at the host's will. Queen Aga'po mentions to one of her attendants that Carol Ferris would be an ideal candidate for taming the Predator.|$|E
25|$|Pharaoh ant copulation, {{like that}} of many social insects, is harmful to the female. The penis valve {{contains}} sharp teeth, which <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> a thick, soft cuticular layer in the female. This method of copulation too has an evolutionary basis. The teeth ensure sex lasts long enough for sufficient sperm transfer. Also, the pain caused to the female may, in some ways, lessen her desire to mate again.|$|E

25|$|Sea lice, {{particularly}} Lepeophtheirus salmonis {{and various}} Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon. Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> {{the skin of}} wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days. Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result. Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable. On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.|$|E
500|$|Gerard Doyle {{provided}} the {{voice for the}} English audio book of Brisingr. In order to help Doyle with this, Paolini recorded the pronunciation of every invented name and word in Brisingr from a list over nine pages long. It was tricky even for Paolini {{to do this because}} he cannot [...] "roll [...] r's" [...] properly. Doyle said he prepared for narrating Brisingr by going [...] "largely by physical description. If there are specific details about the voices, I <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> those as best I can. But if a creature’s anatomical features are described, I try to imagine, for example, how the jaw might work...and then try and adapt that and attach it to something that sounds okay to the ear and is still slightly stranger than normal." ...|$|E
500|$|The player-character is {{controlled}} via the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. While most of Mario's abilities are taken directly from Super Mario 64, {{such as the}} long jump, wall jumps, {{and a variety of}} somersaults, a new feature called the Star Pointer, which is a cursor that appears when the Wii Remote pointer is pointed at the screen. Essentially, the Star Pointer is used to pick up special konpeito-shaped objects called [...] "Star Bits", which are then shot to stun enemies, manipulate obstacles, or feed Hungry Lumas (star-shaped sentient beings which act as companions throughout the game). Secondly, the pointer can <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> small blue objects called [...] "Pull Stars", which can be utilised to pull Mario through space. If the player becomes encased in a floating bubble, the Star Pointer is used to manoeuvre the bubble.|$|E

500|$|The couple's {{status as}} photogenic, {{articulate}} and professional {{was at first}} beneficial and protective. A white, middle-class family {{caught up in a}} nightmare of evil abroad offered everything the media could <b>latch</b> <b>onto,</b> writes feminist scholar Nicola Rehling, and every institution in the UK wanted to help, from 10 Downing Street down. The McCanns took full advantage of the interest by hiring public-relations consultants and offering regular events to give the media a daily news peg. But the frenzy soon turned against them, and there began what PR consultant Michael Cole called the [...] "monstering of the McCanns". They were harshly criticized for having left their children alone, in an unlocked apartment, despite the availability of Ocean Club babysitters and a crèche. The argument ran that a working-class couple would have faced child-abandonment charges. Seventeen thousand people signed an online petition in June 2007 asking Leicestershire Social Services to investigate how the children came to be left unattended.|$|E
500|$|Several critics praised {{this episode}} for its {{character}} development, {{something that they}} said was missing in the previous episodes. Robert Canning of IGN said that although there was still {{plenty of room for}} growth, the episode gave a better understanding of Liz and Jenna's friendship. He felt that prior to the episode, nothing was known about Liz and Jenna's longtime friendship, {{and that there was no}} depth to it. Canning said that Liz's admission of being somewhat jealous of Jenna's success was a much needed storyline for the show, and one that gave the audience something deeper to <b>latch</b> <b>onto.</b> However, Canning pointed out that small hints of what their friendship was like in the past were played for laughs as opposed to establishing any sort of history. Canning found that their verbal sparring really [...] "solidified their bond", and that by the end of the episode the audience had seen their [...] "human side" [...] and the [...] "characters had become people".|$|E
500|$|Aether is a space {{adventure}} {{game with}} washed-out pastel colors and a varying soundtrack {{consisting of a}} piano, synthesizer, guitar, and percussion piece. There are four monochrome planets to explore, which have subdued hues. Players control a lonely boy from Earth and an octopus-like monster he befriends. The monster's tongue is used to propel itself and the boy through space and onto other planets. Each planet has a unique soundtrack that gets louder as you approach it. Each moon or planet exerts gravity over the player character, requiring momentum {{to escape from the}} planet's orbit. To escape a planet, the tongue must first be latched onto a cloud floating above the planet's surface, which can then be used to swing the player around. By propelling themselves from the initial cloud using swinging momentum, players can <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> the next and repeat the process to leave the planet's orbit. After reaching space the process is repeated with stars and asteroids. In space the lack of gravity causes the player to drift until the direction is changed by swinging on another object.|$|E

5000|$|... "Hell on Wheels" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The {{review of the}} Los Angeles Times newspaper describes the song as the best cut of the album and noted [...] "'Hell on Wheels', <b>latches</b> <b>onto</b> the roller-skating craze as tenaciously-and stylishly-as the Beach Boys <b>latched</b> <b>onto</b> surfing. Joel Flegler of the Fanfare Magazine, while was reviewing the Roller Boogie soundtrack gave a negative review for all the songs, using the word 'worse' {{in reference to the}} length of the album. Another critic said that every song of the album have the same rock influence, and about the song said that is [...] "her trendy roller-disco effort".|$|R
50|$|Hill scored {{his first}} goal {{in seven years}} in the 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest on 1 January, <b>latching</b> <b>onto</b> a pass and thumping across Lee Camp. He {{emulated}} this feat in the 3-3 draw with Leeds United in February.|$|R
500|$|The game {{occasionally}} {{shifts to}} an icy alternate dimension called [...] "Nightmare", where hostile monsters exist. To escape from this dimension, Harry {{must find a}} predetermined exit while avoiding the wandering creatures which chase him upon detection. Unlike previous installments in the series, there is no combat element to the gameplay: Harry is weaponless for the entire duration {{of the game and}} can only run, hide, slow down the monsters by knocking down objects to block their path, throw off the creatures if they <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> him, and temporarily ward them off by picking up and using flares found lying on the ground. His running speed and [...] "health" [...] (the amount of damage that he can endure before dying) decrease every time the monsters grab him. In contrast to the previous installments of the series, which featured various types of monsters, Shattered Memories features only one type of humanoid monster, whose physical appearance changes in response to the player's actions inside and outside the Nightmare realm, including their responses to Kaufmann's psychological tests.|$|E
500|$|The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is {{a fantasy}} action-adventure game with {{role-playing}} and puzzle elements {{set in a}} large open-world environment. The player controls series protagonist Link from a third-person perspective, in a three-dimensional world. Link primarily fights with a sword and shield, but he can also use other weapons such as projectiles, bombs, and magic spells. The control scheme introduced techniques such as context-sensitive actions and a targeting system called [...] "Z-targeting". In combat, Z-targeting allows the player to have Link focus and <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> an enemy or other objects. When using this technique, the camera follows the target and Link constantly faces it. Projectile attacks are automatically directed at the target and do not require manual aiming. Context-sensitive actions allow multiple tasks to be assigned to one button, simplifying the control scheme. The on-screen display shows {{what will happen when}} the button is pushed and changes depending on what the character is doing. For example, the same button that causes Link to push a box if he is standing next to it will have him climb on the box if the analog stick is pushed toward it.|$|E
2500|$|On Wednesday, 16 August, at 00:20, AS-34 {{attempted}} to {{attach to the}} ninth compartment escape hatch twice but was unsuccessful. It surfaced and as it was being lifted onto the deck its propulsion system was seriously damaged. The crew of Mikhail Rudnitsky elected to cannibalise the AS-32 to repair the AS-34. Rescue operations were suspended while the repairs were made. PK-7500 arrived from the coast where it had launched its DSRV. It repeatedly lowered the rescue vessel [...] to the submarine but it was unable to <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> an escape hatch. One of the rescue capsules was damaged by the storm.|$|E

5000|$|EN 840-compliant bin tippers use a comb-lift mechanism, <b>latching</b> <b>onto</b> {{reinforced}} combing {{around the}} lip of the bin. This standard is commonly used in the waste-management industry in Europe, Asia and Australasia. Compliant bins are often called wheelie bins or MGBs.|$|R
2500|$|Hannity {{promoted}} the falsehood that the Affordable Care Act would create so-called [...] "death panels". According {{to a study}} by Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan, Hannity's show, along with the Laura Ingraham Show, were the first major conservative media personalities to <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> the false claim of Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, that the Affordable Care Act contained death panels. When Sarah Palin stirred controversy by promoting the death panels myth, and argued her case in a Facebook post, Hannity defended her and said, [...] "I agree with everything that she wrote". Hannity also claimed that he found the specific pages in the Affordable Care Act containing provisions on death panels.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 February 2010, Mikel {{provided}} a long ball for Didier Drogba to <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> and fire past goalkeeper David Marshall as Chelsea beat Cardiff City 4–1 in the FA Cup Round of 16. Mikel {{provided a}}nother assist for a Drogba goal in a 5–0 win over FA Cup finalists and relegated side Portsmouth on 24 March, as Chelsea cut United's lead {{at the top}} of the table to one point. Mikel played the full ninety minutes in Chelsea's 7–1 smashing of Aston Villa three days later as Chelsea kept pace in the title race with Manchester United. [...] In their next Premier League game against United, Mikel played excellent as a marshall in midfield as Chelsea climbed above United in the table with a 2–1 win at Old Trafford, thanks to goals from Joe Cole and Drogba.|$|E
2500|$|Like I. brasiliensis, the largetooth cookiecutter shark is an {{ectoparasite}} {{that feeds}} by excising plugs of flesh from larger animals. While I. brasiliensis is theorized to <b>latch</b> <b>onto</b> {{the surface of}} its prey and bite with a twisting motion, producing a circular wound containing spiral grooves inside from its lower teeth, the largetooth cookiecutter shark seems to employ a [...] "sweeping" [...] bite that produces a larger, more elongate (twice {{as long as the}} width of the mouth), oval wound containing parallel tooth grooves. This shark has been known to bite bony fishes, sharks, and marine mammals. One study has found that the largetooth cookiecutter shark is responsible for 80% of the cookiecutter wounds found on cetaceans off Bahia, Brazil. The flank was the most often-attacked area, followed by the head and abdomen. In at least three cases, bites to dolphins appeared to have resulted in their subsequent deaths by stranding. Another prey species in the area is the subantarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis); at least two cases of juveniles fatally stranding after being bitten have also been recorded.|$|E
