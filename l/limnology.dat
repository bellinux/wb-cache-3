5|$|The {{ecological}} succession concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements, {{was important in}} early plant ecology. Alfred Lotka's predator-prey equations, G. Evelyn Hutchinson's studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers (<b>limnology)</b> and Charles Elton's studies of animal food chains were pioneers among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after Eugene P. Odum synthesized many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) {{at the center of}} the field.|$|E
25|$|Most of Hutchinson's {{contributions}} to American <b>limnology</b> came from research at Linsley Pond in Connecticut. Studies were done on small lakes, such as chemical stratification, oxygen deficits, productivity, and the ecological {{significance of the}} oxidation-reduction potential of lake waters. His four volume Treatise on <b>Limnology</b> became a standard for <b>limnology</b> students. Hutchinson expanded the field of <b>limnology,</b> especially in its ecological and biogeochemical aspects. He advocated the use of statistical and mathematical methods in <b>limnology.</b> His student Raymond Lindeman furthered Hutchinson's model of the trophic dynamic concept. Together they looked at energy flows through the lake in the trophic levels of ecosystems. They followed the energy using Hutchinson's notation system in which each organism was given an integer to mark how many organisms the energy {{had to go through}} in order to reach it, this was designated as its trophic level. It then became possible to measure the efficiency of a given system, or the energy losses between ascending trophic levels.|$|E

25|$|<b>Limnology</b> is {{the study}} of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems. <b>Limnology</b> divides lakes into three zones: the {{littoral}} zone, a sloped area close to land; the photic or open-water zone, where sunlight is abundant; and the deep-water profundal or benthic zone, where little sunlight can reach. The depth to which light can reach in lakes depends on turbidity, determined by the density and size of suspended particles. A particle is in suspension if its weight is less than the random turbidity forces acting upon it. These particles can be sedimentary or biological in origin and are responsible for the color of the water. Decaying plant matter, for instance, may be responsible for a yellow or brown color, while algae may cause greenish water. In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown. Biological particles include algae and detritus. Bottom-dwelling detritivorous fish can be responsible for turbid waters, because they stir the mud in search of food. Piscivorous fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant-eating (planktonivorous) fish, thus increasing the amount of algae (see aquatic trophic cascade). The light depth or transparency is measured by using a Secchi disk, a 20-cm (8in) disk with alternating white and black quadrants. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the Secchi depth, a measure of transparency. The Secchi disk is commonly used to test for eutrophication. For a detailed look at these processes, see lentic ecosystems.|$|E

25|$|F.A. Forel, {{who is also}} {{referred}} to as the father of <b>limnology,</b> was the first scientist to classify lakes according to their thermal stratification. His system of classification was later modified and improved upon by Hutchinson and Laffler. Because the density of water varies with temperature, with a maximum at +4 DC, thermal stratification is an important physical characteristic of lakes that controls the fauna and flora, sedimentation, chemistry, and other aspects of individual lakes. First, the colder, heavier water typically forms a layer near the bottom, which called the hypolimnion. Second, normally overlying it is a transition zone known as the metalimnion. Finally, overlying the metalimnion is a surface layer of a warmer, lighter water is called the epilimnion. However, this typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending either on the specific lake, the time of season, or combination of both.|$|E

2500|$|George Evelyn Hutchinson [...] (January 30, 1903 – May 17, 1991), was a British {{ecologist}} sometimes described [...] as the [...] "father {{of modern}} ecology." [...] He contributed {{for more than}} sixty years to the fields of <b>limnology,</b> systems ecology, radiation ecology, entomology, genetics, biogeochemistry, a mathematical theory of population growth, art history, philosophy, religion, and anthropology. He worked on the passage of phosphorus through lakes, the chemistry and biology of lakes, the theory of interspecific competition, and on insect taxonomy and genetics, zoo-geography and African water bugs. [...] He is {{known as one of}} the first to combine ecology with mathematics. He became an international expert on lakes and wrote the four-volume Treatise on <b>Limnology</b> in 1957.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926 {{he applied}} for a lectureship at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. He lectured {{for two years before}} he was fired, but he {{continued}} to study the South African water bugs. When he began his research there were fourteen known species and when he concluded his research there were nearly forty. It was here that Hutchinson discovered <b>limnology,</b> or the study of fresh waters. Along with Grace Pickford, [...] he studied the chemistry and biology of the coastal lakes. He was greatly interested in <b>limnology</b> due to it combining of all his interests such as natural history, aquatic invertebrates, and chemistry. He was drawn to the differences in the chemistry, flora, and fauna in the different water sources.|$|E

[...] It is likely that similar elevated concentrations exist in lakes with similar <b>limnology,</b> but this is only 4% enrichment (24 vs 28) and surface waters are usually enriched in D2O by evaporation to even greater extend by faster H2O evaporation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932 Hutchinson {{joined the}} Yale North India Expedition. He {{wanted to be}} the first to make {{ecological}} observations of a high-altitude lake, and to compare these with lower-altitude lakes. [...] The work yielded insights into biogeography and new data on high elevation <b>limnology.</b> Most lakes had no fish, and crustaceans were the top predators. In letters to his wife, he described the [...] different water chemistry from the Indian lakes to the South African lakes. He collected hundreds of specimens for analysis by specialists.This expedition provided the material for his first book, The Clear Mirror, in which he described the colors, organisms, ecology, and the people of the Ladakh.|$|E
2500|$|In {{connection}} with the foregoing, the Institute of Marine Sciences and <b>Limnology</b> of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, conducted a regional study, funded by the Department of Technical Cooperation of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in which specialists from 11 Latin American countries (Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Dominican Republic, Venezuela plus Jamaica) participated. The findings indicate that heavy metals such as mercury, arsenic, and lead, {{have been identified in}} the coastal zone of the Caribbean Sea. Analysis of toxic metals and hydrocarbons is based on the investigation of coastal sediments that have accumulated less than 50 meters deep during the last hundred and fifty years.

2500|$|Landscape ecology {{has been}} {{incorporated}} {{into a variety of}} ecological subdisciplines. For example, a recent development has been the more explicit consideration of spatial concepts and principles applied to the study of lakes, streams, and wetlands in the field of landscape <b>limnology.</b> In addition, landscape ecology has important links to application-oriented disciplines such as agriculture and forestry. [...] In agriculture, landscape ecology has introduced new options for the management of environmental threats brought about by the intensification of agricultural practices. [...] Agriculture has always been a strong human impact on ecosystems. [...] In forestry, from structuring stands for fuelwood and timber to ordering stands across landscapes to enhance aesthetics, consumer needs have affected conservation and use of forested landscapes. [...] Landscape forestry provides methods, concepts, and analytic procedures for landscape forestry. Landscape ecology has been cited as a contributor to the development of fisheries biology as a distinct biological science discipline, and is frequently incorporated in study design for wetland delineation in hydrology. It has helped shape integrated landscape management. [...] Lastly, landscape ecology has been very influential for progressing sustainability science and sustainable development planning. [...] In example, a recent study assessed sustainable urbanization across Europe using evaluation indices, country-landscapes, and landscape ecology tools and methods.|$|E
