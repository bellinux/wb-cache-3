5000|$|The rural {{district}} <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of three counties with very irregular boundaries, including {{a number of}} detached parishes.|$|R
50|$|Below {{the corpse}} {{was a small}} pit holding the remains of six {{sacrificial}} dogs, and along the <b>edge</b> <b>lay</b> the skeletons of 16 human slaves, evidence of human sacrifice.|$|R
60|$|But no man stirred; {{all stood}} silent {{as though they}} had been cut in stone, and there, a little nearer the cliff <b>edge,</b> <b>lay</b> the silent form of Suzanne.|$|R
5000|$|The mark is {{told that}} a coin of a {{particular}} denomination has been made so it cannot be laid on its edge. The trickster offers him a sum of money for any the mark can <b>lay</b> on <b>edge.</b> When the mark succeeds, the trickster grabs the coin and rewards him with the promised sum - which is always less than {{the value of the}} grabbed coin.|$|R
2500|$|Present-day Loveland {{originally}} <b>lay</b> at the <b>edges</b> of the Symmes Purchase and Virginia Military District, in {{what was}} then the Northwest Territory. The area was first settled in 1795 by Col. Thomas Paxton: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hark'ee! Bighorn," [...] said Dick, striding up to him, and <b>laying</b> {{the cold}} <b>edge</b> of his hatchet on the Indian's forehead; [...] "if you speak another word above yer breath, the pale-face will cleave ye to the chin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The knife was mine," [...] his visitor affirmed, {{dropping}} his voice {{once more to}} a whisper. [...] "It <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the counter, close to where Mr. Morrison was leaning, {{and as soon as}} he'd gone I missed it." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he had to}} rest. He {{appeared}} as wet {{as if he had}} been plunged into water; his skin burned, his eyes pained, his breast heaved. Panting and spent, he <b>lay</b> along the <b>edge</b> of the wheat, with closed eyelids and lax muscles.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come here!' {{said the}} flat thin voice behind the curtain; and Kim came, {{conscious}} that eyes {{he could not}} see were staring at him. One skinny brown finger heavy with rings <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the cart, and the talk went this way: ...|$|R
50|$|The female {{plain tiger}} perches on the upperside of a leaf and, curling its abdomen around the <b>edge,</b> <b>lays</b> an egg on the underside. Only one egg is laid per leaf to avoid {{overcrowding}} of the caterpillars. The egg is silvery white, shiny, tall, bullet-shaped with an apical point and ribbed sides.|$|R
40|$|In reconstructing 3 -D from images {{based on}} feature points, one usually defines a {{triangular}} mesh th at h as th ese feature p oints as v ertices and disp lay s th e scene as a p oly-h edron. If th e scene {{itself is a}} p oly h edron, h ow ev er, some of th e disp <b>lay</b> ed <b>edges</b> may be inconsistent w ith th e true sh ap e. T h is p ap er p resents a new technique for automatically detecting and eliminating such inconsistencies by using a special template...|$|R
5000|$|The {{area was}} already settled by the 11th century, when St Margaret's Church was founded. Names {{recorded}} {{at that time}} include Hadlega and Hodlega—later standardised to Hodlegh and Hothelegh, then (West) Hoathly. This Anglo-Saxon word signifies a heath-covered clearing. [...] The parish <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the dense woodland of the Ashdown Forest.|$|R
60|$|He {{waved his}} arm around the horizon, as though to {{indicate}} where the place in question <b>lay,</b> and I <b>edged</b> my horse a little nearer to him. He was the leading spirit, and it seemed possible that we might perhaps disperse the rest if I could dismount him. The man had evidently recovered from Steel's blow.|$|R
60|$|Forester, {{by means}} of his paddle, had steered the boat up to a log which <b>lay</b> in the <b>edge</b> of the water, and Marco, at first fending off from the log, to keep the boat from {{striking}} hard, and then holding on to it with his hook, got it into a good position for landing, and held it securely.|$|R
60|$|First {{she looked}} all round {{to see that}} no one was {{watching}} her, and then she set to work to peck at a piece of meat that <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of a shelf, till at last it fell down. The dog seized it ravenously, and ran with it to a dark corner where he gobbled it up in a very few minutes.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the rocks}} formed during the Cambrian, when the region <b>lay</b> at the <b>edge</b> of a {{continental}} landmass called Laurentia. These rocks include the Cambrian strata. As the Paleozoic era progressed, several intensified geologic events occurred, including repeated episodes of faulting, and in turn, orogenies which involved upward lifting of a metamorphic core complex, creating mafic and rhyolitic dikes and sills.|$|R
50|$|Other {{than the}} Margraviate of Baden and the Duchy of Württemberg, Further Austria and the Palatinate <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the southwestern area. Further Austria (in German: Vorderösterreich or die Vorlande) was the {{collective}} {{name for the}} old possessions of the Habsburgs in south-western Germany (Swabia), the Alsace, and in Vorarlberg after {{the focus of the}} Habsburgs had moved to Austria.|$|R
60|$|In the evening, when little Kay {{was going}} to bed, he jumped on the chair by the window, and looked through the little hole. A few snow-flakes were falling outside, and one of the, the largest, <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> {{of one of the}} window-boxes. The snow-flake grew larger and larger till it took the form of a maiden, dressed in finest white gauze.|$|R
60|$|VALIANT. It is so. Let a man {{have one}} of these blades, with a hand to wield it and skill to use it, and he may venture upon an angel with it. He need not fear its holding, if he can but tell how to <b>lay</b> on. Its <b>edges</b> will never blunt. It will cut flesh and bones, and soul and spirit, and all.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{two young}} girls posing on a porch. In the image, the two {{unidentified}} girls {{are looking at the}} camera standing behind a wooden chair, the smaller girl is holding a basket full of eggs while the other is holding a slingshot ready to be shot. Two cats are <b>laying</b> at the <b>edge</b> of the porch with two brooms resting next to the doorway...|$|R
60|$|I <b>lay</b> at the <b>edge</b> of that cornfield a long time; it {{was very}} peaceful. The church bells had begun to ring. The long shadows came {{stealing}} out from the sheaves; woodpigeons rose one by one, and flapped off to roost; the western sky was streaked with red, and all the downs and combe bathed in the last sunlight. Perfect harvest weather; but oppressively still, the stillness of suspense....|$|R
60|$|VALIANT. It is so. Let a man {{have one}} of these blades, with a hand to wield it and skill to use it, and he may venture upon an angel with it. He need not fear its holding, if he can but tell how to <b>lay</b> on. Its <b>edges</b> will never blunt. It will cut flesh and bones, and soul and spirit, and all (Eph. 6:12-17; Heb. 4:12).|$|R
60|$|When I {{got down}} out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies <b>laying</b> in the <b>edge</b> of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was {{covering}} up Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.|$|R
60|$|It was in {{the hottest}} part of summer that they began their journey, so hot {{that they could not}} travel at all {{in the middle of the}} day, and they were afraid to do it by night lest they might lose their way or fall into the hands of robbers. One day, a little before sunset, they came to an inn which <b>lay</b> at the <b>edge</b> of a forest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't move {{unless the}} others do; they 're {{crowding}} me down!" [...] said Cadaw-Cut; and he kicked the egg next above him. And so they continued kicking {{one another and}} rolling around in the nest until one kicked Humpty Dumpty, and as he <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the nest he was kicked out and rolled down the hay-mow until {{he came to a}} stop near the very bottom.|$|R
5000|$|The {{district}} <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the Greater London Conurbation {{and experienced}} a rapid population growth, in part caused by London County Council out-county construction at Loughton, the Urban District's headquarters, {{and also in}} the south east of the district of the Hainault Estate (which also extended into neighbouring Ilford and Dagenham). Extensive council house building by the Chigwell Urban District itself took place between Buckhurst Hill and Loughton.|$|R
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour passed and then, to his dismay, he saw that he was close to the bush, {{on the wrong side of}} the river. He himself was getting rapidly weaker, and he felt that he could not support the weight of the soldier much farther. Accordingly he grasped a branch that {{overhung}} the river, pulled himself in to the shore, and there <b>lay</b> at the <b>edge</b> of the mud.|$|R
60|$|And now, {{upon the}} left bank, they {{caught a glimpse}} of a white village, high up on the hills, smothered among green trees. That was Cold Branch--no boom town, but the slow growth of many years. Cold Branch <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the grape and corn lands. The big country road ran just back of the heights. Cold Branch had nothing in common with the frisky {{ambition}} of Okochee with its impertinent lake.|$|R
5000|$|... "A ball {{is within}} the limits of the center when any part of it {{is within the}} lines of a {{rectangle}} circumscribed by <b>laying</b> a straight <b>edge</b> successively against the inside of both stems of each arch, the inside of the stem of each arch nearest the home stake, and the inside of the stem of each arch nearest the turning stake." [...] Rule 95, Official Rules and Regulations of the American Roque League (1958).|$|R
6000|$|There were {{no trees}} above us now. Their trunks <b>lay</b> along the <b>edge</b> of the trench, built in with stones, where necessary, or {{sometimes}} overhanging it in ragged splinters or bushy tops. Bits of cloth, not French, showed, too, in the uneven lines of debris at the trench lip, and some thoughtful soul had marked an unexploded Boche trench-sweeper as [...] "not to be touched." [...] It {{was a young}} lawyer from Paris who pointed that out to me.|$|R
60|$|And so it {{was decided}} that I should return in the prospector, which still <b>lay</b> upon the <b>edge</b> of the forest at the point where we had first {{penetrated}} {{to the surface of the}} inner world. Dian would not listen to any arrangement for my going which did not include her, and I was not sorry that she wished to accompany me, for I wanted her to see my world, and I wanted my world to see her.|$|R
50|$|In the 1830s, {{the land}} {{which is now}} Montgomery Street <b>lay</b> at the <b>edge</b> of San Francisco Bay. Intense land {{speculation}} during the Gold Rush created a demand for more usable land in the rapidly growing city, and sandy bluffs near the waterfront were leveled and the shallows filled with sand (and the ruins of many ships) to make new building lots. Between 1849 and 1852, the waterfront advanced about four blocks. At present, Montgomery Street is about seven blocks from the water.|$|R
50|$|Larger timbers, {{like the}} {{comparatively}} gigantic sill, which <b>lay</b> along the <b>edge</b> {{of the northern}} bench, were absolutely intact. They were excellent examples of primitive joinery. Some of the broad, notched staves—which Cushing judged had been used as symbolic ancestral tablets, probably attached to the gables of houses, or set up in altars—lay on their edges. Flat boards sometimes stood on end, and other long, slender articles, stood slantingly upward, the lowermost ends or edges firmly stuck in the clay-marl of the bottom.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the school's foundation, San Antonio <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the American frontier, with forts all along the high ground east of the Rio Grande. Though Bishop Johnston wanted his boys to receive as good an {{education}} as boys anywhere in America, he knew that a New England-style prep school would not work in West Texas, so he created a premier academic school with a full-fledged military discipline. The specifically Southern boarding school tradition was not often military.|$|R
60|$|Helena <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the bed, {{listening}} to the ecstatics of one friend and to the impertinences of the other. In spite of her ironical feeling, the thunder impressed her {{with a sense of}} fatality. The night opened, revealing a ghostly landscape, instantly to shut again with blackness. Then the thunder crashed. Helena felt as if some secret were being disclosed too swiftly and violently for her to understand. The thunder exclaimed horribly on the matter. She was sure something had happened.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Vandemeyer gave {{a sigh of}} relief, off her {{guard for}} the moment. Then, quick as a flash, Tuppence jerked the glass upward {{as hard as she}} could. The fluid in it splashed into Mrs. Vandemeyer's face, and during her {{momentary}} gasp, Tuppence's right hand shot out and grasped the revolver where it <b>lay</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the washstand. The next moment she had sprung back a pace, and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs. Vandemeyer's heart, with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it.|$|R
