60|$|New and {{interesting}} birds were continually brought in, either {{by my own}} boys or by the natives, {{and at the end}} of a week Ali arrived triumphant one afternoon with a fine specimen of the Great Bird of Paradise. The ornamental plumes had not yet attained their full growth, but the richness of their glossy orange colouring, and the exquisite delicacy of the loosely waving feathers, were unsurpassable. At the same time a great black cockatoo was brought in, as well as a fine fruit-pigeon and several small birds, so that we were all kept hard at work skinning till sunset. Just as we had cleared away and packed up for the night, a strange beast was brought, which had been shot by the natives. It resembled in size, and in its white woolly covering, a small fat <b>lamb,</b> but had <b>short</b> <b>legs,</b> hand-like feet with large claws, and a long prehensile tail. It was a Cuscus (C. maculatus), one of the curious marsupial animals of the Papuan region, and I was very desirous to obtain the skin. The owners, however, said they wanted to eat it; and though I offered them a good price, and promised to give them all the meat, there was grout hesitation. Suspecting the reason, I offered, though it was night, to set to work immediately and get out the body for them, to which they agreed. The creature was much hacked about, and the two hind feet almost cut off; but it was the largest and finest specimen of the kind I had seen; and after an hour's hard work I handed over the body to the owners, who immediately cut it up and roasted it for supper.|$|R

50|$|The Napoleon {{inherited}} its distinctively <b>short</b> <b>legs</b> {{from the}} Munchkin, which, in that breed, {{were caused by}} a naturally occurring genetic mutation. The <b>short</b> <b>legs</b> do not hinder the cat's agility. They are able to run, jump, and play easily. From the Persian group (including Persians, Exotic Shorthairs and Himalayans) the Minuet has inherited its round face, eyes, dense coat and substantial boning. The boning provides a good support system for its uniquely <b>short</b> <b>legs.</b> The Napoleon {{is not merely a}} short-legged Persian nor a hairy Munchkin. It is a unique combination of these two groups, making it easily distinguishable from any other breed of cat.|$|R
