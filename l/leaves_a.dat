5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique <b>leaves</b> <b>a</b> gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and <b>leaves</b> <b>a</b> triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E

5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a flower, it <b>leaves</b> <b>a</b> scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E
