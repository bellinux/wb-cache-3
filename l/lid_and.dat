Thirty were autographed by Miyamoto himself {{at the opening of the}} Nintendo World Store in New York.|$|E
5|$|From Seattle, SR520 crosses Lake Washington on the tolled Evergreen Point Floating Bridge; at , it is {{the longest}} {{floating}} bridge in the world. Tolls are collected electronically using the state's Good to Go pass or by mail, and vary based on time of day and number of axles; the minimum Good to Go toll, , is $1.25 between midnight and 5a.m., and the maximum is $4.30 during the morning and evening peak periods. The freeway reaches {{the eastern end of}} Lake Washington at Evergreen Point in northern Medina, where it travels under a lidded park and next to a median-side bus station. After an interchange and lid at 84th Avenue Northeast in Hunts Point, SR520 travels eastward around the northern edge of Clyde Hill in a north-facing arc, passing through the Yarrow Point <b>lid</b> <b>and</b> bus station. The freeway enters Bellevue, intersecting I-405 and crossing over the Eastside Rail Corridor.

5|$|Should {{the player}} choose {{to fulfill the}} promise, the protagonist begins her sophomore year at St. PigeoNation's largely as normal, but with one exception—she begins to have {{recurring}} dreams of her younger self and Ryouta, and her parents lying dead {{in front of an}} unfamiliar house. A mysterious man approaches them, promising to grant any wish that they make. On 2 September, she decides to check on Ryouta, who had gone to the infirmary earlier that day; the next morning, she fails to show up for class. Kazuaki asks Ryouta to retrieve their class' box of print handouts, and upon retrieving it, blood is discovered leaking from a corner of the box. Ryouta opens the <b>lid,</b> <b>and</b> it is revealed that the box contains the protagonist's severed head. A siren sounds and there is an order to evacuate to the gymnasium, where Ryouta overhears other students mention that more pieces of a human corpse were found in the other print boxes. Doubting the headmaster's explanation of a natural disaster occurring, Sakuya and Ryouta resolve to figure out the identity of the protagonist's killer and leave the gymnasium, discovering a large metal dome surrounding the school. Upon returning to their classroom and finding the box empty, Yuuya explains that the protagonist's body had been gathered in the chemistry lab, where Shuu performs an autopsy concluding that the protagonist died of asphyxiation caused by illness or poison with the dismemberment occurring afterwards.|$|E

25|$|A very {{different}} method of popcorn-making {{can still be}} seen on the streets of some Chinese cities and Korea today. The un-popped corn kernels are poured into a large cast-iron canister — sometimes called a 'popcorn hammer' — that is then sealed with a heavy <b>lid</b> <b>and</b> slowly turned over a curbside fire in rotisserie fashion. When a pressure gauge on the canister reaches a certain level, the canister is removed from the fire, a large canvas sack is put over the <b>lid</b> <b>and</b> the seal is released. With a huge boom, all of the popcorn explodes at once and is poured into the sack. This method {{is believed to have been}} developed, during the Song dynasty, originally for puffing rice.|$|E
25|$|American Dutch ovens {{changed over}} time during the colonial era.

40|$|Objectives: To study {{bacteria}} from eye <b>lids</b> <b>and</b> {{conjunctival sac}} of patients undergoing cataract surgery {{before and after}} the application of antiseptics. Material and Method: Patients undergoing elective cataract extraction in one university hospital were randomly enrolled. Cultures for bacteria and candida were done by swabbing the eye <b>lids</b> before <b>and</b> after cleaning with 4 % chlorhexidine gluconate. Subsequently 7 % povidone iodine was applied on eye <b>lids</b> <b>and</b> conjunctival sacs. Cultures of specimens from eye <b>lids</b> <b>and</b> conjunctival sac were taken after the application of 7 % povidone iodine {{and at the end of}} the operation. Results: Fifty-one patients were enrolled. Positive cultures were found in 90. 2 % and 82. 4 % before and after cleaning the face with 4 % chlorhexidine. After topical application of 10 % povidone iodine, only 19. 6 % had positive cultures from eye <b>lids</b> <b>and</b> conjunctival sac; a significant reduction (p= 0. 001). At the end of the operation, positive cultures were found from eye lids in 10 patients and from the conjunctival sac in 4 patients. Isolates were skin flora and candida species in 2 patients. None of the patients had endophthalmitis. Conclusion: Cleaning eye lids with 4 % chlorhexidine followed by applying 10 % povidone iodine was effective in decreasing skin flora in cataract surgery. The organisms were not completely eliminated. Post-operative follow-up to detect infectious complications is warranted...|$|R

40|$|The {{volume of}} the levator {{superior}} rectus muscle complex was determined from computed tomography scans of 152 orbits from 76 patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. Clinically observed <b>lid</b> retraction <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> lag did not correlate with the levator/superior rectus muscle volume and did not correlate with limitation of vertical eye movements or inferior rectus muscle volume. These results do not support previously published hypotheses that muscle hypertrophy or levator/superior rectus muscle overaction secondary to inferior rectus muscle restriction are major causes of <b>lid</b> retraction <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> lag. Local adhesion of the levator muscle to fixed orbital tissues is postulated {{to be the most}} likely basis for the characteristic <b>lid</b> retraction <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> lag of Graves' ophthalmopathy...|$|R

The 2011 year model added a remote release button {{at the left}} of the steering wheel on the instrument panel.
