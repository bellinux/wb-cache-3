40|$|The current World Trade Organization (WTO) regime on export {{restraints}} comprises two extremes: {{at one end}} is the near-complete freedom <b>to</b> levy <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> {{enjoyed by}} most Members, which renders theWTO discipline on export restrictions largely ineffective; at the other end, the rigid obligations imposed on several acceding Members prohibiting the use of <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> for any purpose. The recent WTO ruling in China-Raw Materials has only solidified the latter extreme. This article seeks to expose the irrationality of the current regime, especially the problems created by the rigid obligations of the several acceding Members. It contends that such obligations deprive these Members of their ownership right to claim {{a larger share of}} their natural resources for domestic use and of an effective tool for managing environmental externalities associated with the resource products exported. The virtual immutability of such obligations is at odds with the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources. To rectify these problems, this article proposes integrating all stand-alone export concessions into General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) schedules, which would provide the acceding Members with the policy space and flexibility available under the GATT. It is also submitted that the key to gaining support from developing countries {{for the establishment of a}} system-wide discipline lies in the recognition of legitimate functions of <b>export</b> <b>duties.</b> Rather than pushing for their elimination, the WTO should aim <b>to</b> regulate <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> in the same manner as its regulation of import duties...|$|R

40|$|The China—Rare Earths {{decision}} of the Appellate Body addressed two main issues: (i) whether China’s obligations not <b>to</b> impose <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> under its accession protocol are subject to exceptions under Article XX of GATT, and (ii) {{the scope of the}} exception for China’s export quota measures relating to conservation under Article XX(g) of GATT. In accord with its China—Raw Materials decision, the Appellate Body found that there is no textual basis for application of the Article XX exception <b>to</b> China’s <b>export</b> <b>duty</b> obligations. This interpretation exalted a narrow contextual approach over an approach to interpretation that would focus on broader context, object, and purpose. The Appellate Body also approved the Panel’s overall approach to determining the availability of the Article XX(g) exception. This approach focused on the design and structure of China’s quota measure, but left unresolved important issues, including the extent to which non-conservation purposes may prevent use of the exception and the role of empirical evidence of effects in these determinations. While the Appellate Body found that there is no “even-handedness” requirement in Article XX(g) itself, we argue that the chapeau’s requirement of non-discrimination is an appropriate additional criterion for determining whether a policy with a target of reducing extraction of a natural resource satisfies the requirements of Article XX...|$|R

Rafi was trying to send out a merchant ship from his own port, and Roger responded by sending a small flotilla, which fled when confronted by Mahdian forces. Ali then arrested the Sicilian agents in his town and requested help from his allies, the Almoravids, and Roger pleaded with him to return relations to normal.

The theory behind trade liberalisation is that it promotes allocative efficiency by exploiting comparative advantage.
