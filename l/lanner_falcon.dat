5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the <b>lanner</b> <b>falcon</b> which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: p. 88 - 94. The Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus is a {{specialized}} predator of birds. It occurs almost worldwide but is generally uncommon. In many areas, it is sympatric {{with one of}} a complex of similar, less specialized, congeneric species (subgenus Hierofalco, the desert falcons). Peregrine density and productivity tend to decrease with latitude, while desert falcons may be most successful in the tropics. This study compares the biology of Peregrines and sympatric <b>Lanner</b> <b>Falcons</b> F. biarmicus in South Africa, and examines the relative influence of resource limitation and interspecific competition with congeners on the natural regulation of Peregrine populations in tropical environments...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lanner</b> <b>Falcons</b> Falco biarmicus are the commonest large falcons in Africa {{and this}} {{study in the}} coastal area of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa {{investigated}} their ecology from 1984 to 2000. Lanners have recently been categorised as near-threatened and this study was initiated to ascertain if the population was stable. Breeding success of a small population, in different habitat types, was monitored intensively from 1997 to 2000, and the factors that inhibited breeding were investigated. The earliest onset of incubation was 17 July and the latest 16 August, with 2. 2 young fledged per breeding pair over the four-year period. Incubation lasted 32 days and young fledged after 42 - 45 days. All nest sites were on cliffs with a mean height of 114 m, a mean vertical face of 53 m; 45 % of the nests were in ravens’ nests. The aspect of cliff sites also influenced breeding success. Radio tracking {{was used to determine}} home range, habitat use and hunting methods, with prey species identified. Home ranges were between 66 km² and 249 km². Preferred prey was domestic chickens, pigeons and small birds during the breeding season. Foraging ranges were smaller in intensively cultivated areas with seed crops. Data obtained from ringing returns showed that no long distance movements occurred in this region, but two juveniles dispersed 152 km and 127 km. Conservation aspects with possible threats to <b>Lanner</b> <b>Falcons</b> such as poisons, electrocutions and direct persecution are discussed with some recommendations made for future research. Evidence from this study indicates that Lanner breeding success is not limited by nest site availability, but by rainfall timing and prey availability. Lanners foraged more in open areas than areas with tall vegetation, and benefited from intensive agriculture. This population appeared to be healthy and in no danger of declining in the near future...|$|R
50|$|This is {{presumably the}} oldest living hierofalcon species. Support for this {{assumption}} comes mainly from biogeography agreeing {{better with the}} confusing pattern of DNA sequence data in this case than in others. Nonetheless, there is rampant hybridization (see also perilanner) and incomplete lineage sorting which confounds the data to a massive extent; molecular studies with small sample sizes can simply {{not be expected to}} yield reliable conclusions in the entire hierofalcon group. In any case, the radiation of the entire living diversity of hierofalcons seems to have taken place in the Eemian interglacial {{at the start of the}} Late Pleistocene, a mere 130,000-115,000 years ago; the <b>lanner</b> <b>falcons</b> would thus represent the lineage that became isolated in sub-Saharan Africa at some time during the Riss glaciation (200,000 to 130,000 years ago) already.|$|R
5|$|Highly gregarious, western jackdaws are {{generally}} seen in flocks of varying sizes, though {{males and females}} pair-bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks. Flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting, with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site. At Uppsala, Sweden, 40,000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for the night. Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks, the latter particularly when migrating or roosting. They have been recorded foraging with the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), and common gull (Larus canus) in northwestern England. Flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of <b>lanner</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco biarmicus), although larger groups are more able to elude the predators. Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies, common ravens, or Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus); one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group. Occasionally, a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed.|$|R

5000|$|The prairie falcon {{outwardly}} {{resembles the}} peregrine {{as well as}} the Old World [...] "hierofalcons", especially the saker falcon. It was previously often considered the only New World member of the hierofalcon subgenus, but in recent decades this assumption has been disproven by genetic analysis. DNA studies beginning in the 1980s have shown the prairie falcon to be closer to the peregrine than to the hierofalcons. [...] It now is considered an early aridland offshoot of the peregrine falcon lineage, much as the hierofalcons represent a later separate divergence that similarly adapted to arid habitat. Thus, the similarities between the prairie falcon and the hierofalcons are a good example of convergent evolution, with the prairie falcon and similar looking and behaving Old World forms such as the saker and <b>lanner</b> <b>falcons</b> not being the closest of related species, but instead ecological equivalents. [...] However, [...] "closely related" [...] is a relative term here, since most or {{all the members of the}} genus falco are closely enough related that they can produce hybrid offspring via artificial insemination. But, only the most closely related of these species will produce fertile or partially fertile offspring.|$|R

2500|$|In the Palearctic, {{the golden}} eagle co-exists {{with several other}} large {{raptorial}} birds called eagles. Unlike in their relationship with smaller raptors, golden eagles are rarely reported to hunt other eagle species. Most conflicts between different eagles are over kills or carrion, though some species will defend nesting territories from each other. When it comes to carrion and kills, usually the “aggressor” (that is the eagle who initiates the agonistic behavior) is victorious over the other eagle. Considering that they overlap considerably in both distribution and prey selection, there is remarkably almost no known accounts from Eurasia of golden eagles behaving aggressively with other Aquila eagles. This is possibly due to segregated habitat preferences amongst these species, with lesser and greater spotted eagles being essentially woodland or wooded wetland-dwelling birds, Spanish and eastern imperial eagles inhabiting fragmented, open woods and steppe eagles generally living in flat, often treeless steppe and desert-like habitats. In central Asia, where golden eagles and other Aquila species are rare or absent, steppe eagles sometimes nest in mountainous rock formations like golden eagles. Compared to these eagles, the Bonelli's eagle {{appears to have a}} more contentious relationship with golden eagles, as they are often attracted to similar prey (largely rabbits and gamebirds) and occur in abutting habitats. The larger golden eagle is apparently dominant and, in at least one case, has killed and consumed a Bonelli's. The two species defend their territories from one another exclusively, in the same way they defend them from others of their own species. Both will use nests built by the other species, more so the golden using Bonelli's nests than vice versa. Further east, in Israel, Bonelli's and golden eagles are competitors as well. In the dry, barren Negev Desert, golden eagles nests were found [...] apart and Bonelli's were scarce. In the Judaean Desert, which has more annual rainfall and more available prey, the distance between golden eagle nests averaged [...] and the Bonelli's eagle easily outnumbered them. Apparently, the Bonelli's eagle exceptionally outcompeted its larger cousin here due to a subtle topographic variation in the habitat. Still, in areas without unnatural human pressures, the gradation between these species is still adequate enough that they can exist without serious negative effect on either population. In Japan, golden eagles were observed to hunt mountain hawk-eagles (Nisaetus nipalensis), {{despite the fact that the}} local race of hawk eagle is around the same mass as a Japanese golden eagle. The Bale Mountains of Ethiopia is arguably the richest biosphere the golden eagle is known to inhabit and there, this species may potentially interact with more than 10 other eagle species and nearly 30 other accipitrid species, including both migratory and resident breeding species. These are often supported by an exceptionally diverse, dense population of rodents there. The Bale Mountains golden eagles were recorded kleptoparatisizing steppe eagles, augur buzzard (Buteo augur), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus) and <b>lanner</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco biarmicus) and the eagles were themselves kleptoparatisized by steppe eagles on three occasions. The golden eagles were also observed to chase tawny and steppe eagles out of their nesting territories. In the Bale Mountains, the golden eagle overlaps with perhaps its closest living relative, the Verreaux's eagle. The golden eagles appear to vigorously defend their territories from the Verreaux's eagles and, as in its relationship with the Bonelli's, the two species appear to maintain exclusive territories. Several chases involving the golden chasing Verreaux's were witnessed but only one where a Verreaux's chased off the golden. Despite several reported antagonistic interactions, no other raptors were found as prey in the Bale Mountains nests of golden eagles.|$|R
