5|$|The I Ching uses {{a type of}} divination called cleromancy, which {{produces}} apparently random numbers. Six numbers between 6 and 9 are turned into a hexagram, which can then be <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the I Ching book, arranged in an order known as the King Wen sequence. The interpretation of the readings found in the I Ching {{is a matter of}} centuries of debate, and many commentators have used the book symbolically, often to provide guidance for moral decision making as informed by Taoism and Confucianism. The hexagrams themselves have often acquired cosmological significance and paralleled with many other traditional names for the processes of change such as yin and yang and Wu Xing.|$|E

25|$|Ulla Koch-Westenholz, in her 1995 book Mesopotamian Astrology, {{argues that}} this ambivalence between a theistic and {{mechanic}} worldview defines the Babylonian concept of celestial divination as one which, despite its {{heavy reliance on}} magic, remains free of implications of targeted punishment {{with the purpose of}} revenge, and so “shares some of the defining traits of modern science: it is objective and value-free, it operates according to known rules, and its data are considered universally valid and can be <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> written tabulations". Koch-Westenholz also establishes the most important distinction between ancient Babylonian astrology and other divinatory disciplines as being that the former was originally exclusively mundane, being geographically oriented and specifically applied to countries cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare {{of the state and the}} king as the governing head of the nation.|$|E
25|$|The scheme {{makes use}} of {{purpose-built}} automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, manufactured by PIPs Technology, to record vehicles entering and exiting the zone. Cameras can record number plates with a 90% accuracy rate through the technology. The majority of vehicles within the zone are captured on camera. The cameras take two still pictures in colour and {{black and white and}} use infrared technology to identify the number plates. The camera network and other roadside equipment is managed largely automatically by an instation system developed by Roke Manor Research Ltd, which delivers number plates to the billing system. These identified numbers are checked against the list of payers overnight by computer. In those cases when a number plate has not been recognised then they are checked manually. Those that have paid but have not been seen in the central zone are not refunded, and those that have not paid and are seen are fined. The registered keeper of such a vehicle is <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a database provided by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), based in Swansea.|$|E
500|$|After 1 October 1936, German {{procedure}} changed, and {{the number}} of plugboard connections became variable, ranging between five and eight. As a result, the grill method became considerably less effective. However, a method using a card catalog had been devised around 1934 or 1935, and was independent of the number of plug connections. The catalog was constructed using Rejewski's [...] "cyclometer", a special-purpose device for creating a catalog of permutations.

2500|$|At {{temperatures}} below 300°C {{water is}} fairly incompressible, {{which means that}} pressure has {{little effect on the}} physical properties of water, provided it is sufficient to maintain a liquid state. This pressure is given by the saturated vapour pressure, and can be <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> steam tables, or calculated. As a guide, the saturated vapour pressure at 121°C is 200kPa, 150°C is 470kPa, and 200°C is 1,550kPa. [...] The critical point is 21.7MPa at a temperature of 374°C, above which water is supercritical rather than superheated. Above about 300°C, water starts to behave as a near-critical liquid, and physical properties such as density start to change more significantly with pressure. However, higher pressures increase the rate of extractions using superheated water below 300°C. This could be due to effects on the substrate, particularly plant materials, rather than changing water properties.|$|E

[...] Mundane astrology is therefore known to be one of the oldest branches of astrology. It was only with the gradual emergence of horoscopic astrology, from the 6th century BC, that astrology developed the techniques and practice of natal astrology.|$|E

2500|$|While {{retaining}} Jarno Trulli, Toyota replaced Ralf Schumacher with reigning GP2 champion Timo Glock for the 2008 season. The team's new car, the Toyota TF108, {{was launched}} on 10 January 2008. The team's first points came in Sepang, where Jarno Trulli qualified in 5th place (albeit being promoted to 3rd following the McLaren team being penalised) {{and went on}} to finish the race in 4th. This proved not to be a one off, with Trulli getting 6th place next time out in Bahrain, and then 8th in Spain after some late-race trouble. After retiring in the opening two rounds followed by mid-field finishes, Timo Glock was able to secure a 4th place and 5 points for Toyota at Montreal, in addition to Trulli's 3 points brought Toyota up 5th place in the Constructor's standings. Each car led the race at some point. More points were to follow at France, where Trulli managed to hold off Heikki Kovalainen in the late race stages to collect 3rd place. This was Toyota's first podium finish in over two years. Trulli dedicated this podium to former team boss Ove Andersson, who died in the week prior to the race, in a car accident. Trulli scored points in the British Grand Prix, but despite a solid showing during most of the race in Germany, neither driver scored points; Glock suffered a rear suspension failure that caused a spectacular crash, while Trulli was passed in the later stages of the race. The team's fortunes <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Hungary, where Glock put in a good qualifying run that ultimately led to a second-place finish in the race, giving him his first F1 podium and Toyota's second podium finish of the season. At the next race in Valencia, Jarno Trulli was able to gather a 5th-place finish while teammate Glock fought his way up to 7th. [...] This result put Toyota ten points ahead of Renault in the constructors' standings.|$|E
