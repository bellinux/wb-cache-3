40|$|Harmotome and chabazite from Do’ <b>le</b> <b>Pale,</b> Fassa Valley (Trento, Italy) - This {{work will}} provide amorphological and crystal {{chemical}} description of harmotome and chabazite from Do’ <b>le</b> <b>Pale,</b> Fassa Valley,Trentino, Northern Italy. The chemical formula and the monoclinic unit cell parameters of cross twinned harmotomecrystals are (Na 0. 85 K 0. 13 Ca 0. 14 Sr 0. 01 Ba 1. 84) (Fe 0. 02 Al 5. 01 Si 11. 00) O 32 · 12. 73 H 20 and am= 9. 902 (4), bm= 14. 145 (5), cm= 8. 765 (3) (Å), β(°) = 124. 56 (2), Vm= 1000. 6 (6) (Å) 3, respectively. Results of the Do’ <b>le</b> <b>Pale</b> harmotome will be comparedto those obtained for harmotome from Iskra (Bulgaria) and from Selva di Trissino (Vicenza, Northern Italy). The latter {{is the only}} Italian sample with a full characterization in the literature. The chemical formula and the hexagonalunit cell parameters of chabazite, which often presents phacolitic habit, are (Na 0. 03 K 0. 13 Ca 1. 57 Sr 0. 09 Ba 0. 05) (Al 3. 51 Si 8. 48) O 24 · 12. 94 H 20 and ahex. = 13. 802 (2), chex. = 15. 009 (3), Vhex. = 2476. 1 (5) (Å) 3, respectively. Crystal chemical featuresof chabazite from Nova Scotia (Canada) and from Madzv arovo (Bulgaria) {{will be used for}} the comparison withthe accomplished results...|$|R

60|$|Reed now built a {{house on}} the Snake River, for their winter quarters; which being completed, the party set about trapping. Rezner, Le Clerc, and Pierre Dorion went about five days' journey from the {{wintering}} house, to a part of the country well stocked with beaver. Here they put up a hut, and proceeded to trap with great success. While the men were out hunting, Pierre Dorion's wife remained at home to dress the skins and prepare the meals. She was thus employed one evening about the beginning of January, cooking the supper of the hunters, when she heard footsteps, and <b>Le</b> Clerc staggered, <b>pale</b> and bleeding, into the hut. He informed her that a party of savages had surprised them, while at their traps, and had killed Rezner and her husband. He had barely strength left to give this information, when he sank upon the ground.|$|R
