It replaced an earlier attempt called [...] "More", for which the demo version recorded by Marcy Harriell was released as an outtake on the deluxe version of the soundtrack album. [...] Although Miranda has stressed that he is still [...] "very proud of" [...] the song as a first draft, [...] "More" [...] was not good enough in retrospect because it merely expressed Moana's vague desire to see more since she had already figured out everything about the island. In contrast, [...] "How Far I'll Go" [...] expresses a deeper, richer message: Moana's struggle with the irresistible impulse to explore beyond the reef notwithstanding her genuine love for her island, her family, and her people. [...] As Miranda explained to People: [...] "To me that's much more complicated than, 'I hate it here and I want to get out,' ... To say, ‘I <b>love</b> <b>it</b> <b>here,</b> I love my parents, but why can't I stop walking to the ocean and fantasizing about getting out of here?' And questioning that instinct?
