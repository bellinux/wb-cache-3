Only 14, 000 cases remained outside Sudan in 2001. Sudan reported 78 % of all cases of dracunculiasis in 2001, and virtually all of Sudan’s cases were in the southern states, where the long-standing civil war <b>limits</b> <b>accessibility</b> to endemic areas.

In a modern context, steep grades <b>limit</b> <b>accessibility</b> by car and more so by bicycle, on foot, or wheelchair, particularly in cold climates. The strict orthogonal geometry forces roads and lots over creeks, marshes, and woodlots, thus disturbing the local ecology.
