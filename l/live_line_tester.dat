In 2011, the <b>lines,</b> <b>testers</b> and their crosses were sown in field trials at two locations (Karanac and Osijek).

Most sorghum breeding programs use elite inbred <b>lines</b> <b>testers.</b> Inbred <b>line</b> <b>testers</b> evaluate experimental <b>lines</b> against a specific genetic background, possibly increasing the probability of incorrectly discarding material. A potential solution would be to use F 1 testers that combine two genetic backgrounds. The purpose {{of this research was}} to compare F 1 <b>testers</b> versus inbred <b>line</b> <b>testers</b> for evaluating experimental sorghum lines in testcrosses <b>Line</b> x <b>tester</b> analyses were performed to assess tester consistency in assigning ranks. With one exception, all of the <b>line</b> x <b>tester</b> analyses were non-significant, indicating that the testers provided similar evaluations of the experimental lines. Correlations between the ranking of the experimental lines by their average performance and the rank assignments of each tester were measured to further asses tester accuracy. In all cases, the rank correlations were highly significant, implying that all of the testers accurately ranked experimental lines. In addition, all of the testers consistently identified the majority of the top performing experimental lines despite some important rank shifts. F-ratios for variance among the experimental lines (entry effect) were compared with the Schumann-Bradley statistical test to compare efficiencies. With one exception, the F 1 testers always produced the largest or second largest entry effect F-ratio. Where the F 1 testers produced the second largest F-ratio, it was not declared statistically different from the largest F-ratio by the Schumann-Bradley test, indicating that the testers had similar discriminatory efficiencies. Testcross variances were measured to further compare discriminatory efficiencies. With one exception, the F 1 testers consistently produced the largest variances, evidence that the F 1 testers were effective in maximizing differences among the experimental lines. The results indicate that F 1 testers represent valid testers for evaluating experimental sorghum lines against two genetic backgrounds in a single testcross...|$|R

Head bug damage increases the severity of grain moulds, which renders the grain unfit for human consumption. Gene action for resistance to head bugs and grain moulds was studied in a diverse array of male-sterile <b>lines</b> and <b>testers</b> in a <b>line</b> × <b>tester</b> mating design under conditions of natural infestation. Mean squares for parents, parents vs. crosses, <b>lines,</b> <b>testers,</b> and <b>lines</b> × <b>testers</b> were significant for head bug damage and grain mould severity. General combining ability (GCA) effects were significant and negative for ICSA 88019 for head bug damage, and ICSA 88019 and ICSA 88020 for grain moulds (except for ICSA 88020 in 1993). General combining ability effects were positive for ICSA 42 and 296 A. GCA effects of <b>lines</b> and <b>testers</b> for head bug damage and grain mould severity were in the same direction (+ve or -ve). Head bug damage in the grain was significantly correlated with grain mould severity.

Resistance to head bugs showed dominance to partial dominance type of gene action, while in the case of grain moulds, it showed dominance to overdominance.

Variances of SCA were higher than the GCA variances for traits except for plant height which indicated predominance of non-additive gene action in the inheritance of the traits.

Pigeonpea is the only food legume where cytoplasmic-genic male sterility is being exploited for commercial use of hybrids. The discovery of stable CMS system and breeding of commercial hybrids in pigeonpea has become a landmark in increasing the productivity of this crop. Keeping in view the combining ability estimates were worked out through <b>Line</b> x <b>Tester</b> analysis of 10 hybrids developed by crossing 2 lines (Males) with five cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines (Females) to know the genetic architecture of yield attributesDays to maturity, branches plant 1, pods plant 1, seed yield, wilt resistance and pollen fertility. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences among genotypes, crosses, <b>lines,</b> <b>testers</b> and <b>Line</b> x <b>tester</b> interactions for most of the traits. Preponderance of non-additive gene action was realized by higher values of specific combining ability compared to general combining ability. The average degree of dominance were more than unity (> 1) and predictability ratio was less than unity (< 1) for all the traits, signifying non-additive gene action resulted from dominance, over dominance, epistasis and various other interactions. Hence, heterosis breeding is effective for increasing yield potential of hybrids in pigeonpea.

Based on the results, the following conclusion is that lines RHA-BRE- 1 for plant height and RHA-SELEUS for head diameter have the best GCA, and the best SCA have hybrids L- 19 A x RHA-BRE- 1 for plant height and HA- 26 A x RHA-SELEUS for head diameter. Analyzing components of genetic variance, the nonadditive component played the main role in the inheritance of plant height and the additive of head diameter. The largest average contribution in the expression of plant height had the tester A-lines (83. 17 %) and for head diameter Rf lines had the greatest influence (58. 13 %) ...|$|R

The estimates of GCA:SCA variance revealed the predominance of non-additive gene action for all the characters studied namely, days to 50 per cent flowering, plant height, number of pods per plant, pod yield per plant, number of kernels per plant, kernel yield per plant, sound mature kernel per cent, shelling percentage and test weight except for number of primary branches per plant. The genotypes NRCG 12568, NRCG 11915 and NRCG 12326 were good general combiners for all the characters studied. The crosse...|$|R

The SCA variance was greater than the GCA variance for grain yield and yield components, suggesting the preponderance of dominance and epistatic gene action in expression of these traits. The line CRMS 31 A and IR 79156 A were recorded as good combiners for head rice recovery percent. The tester NPT 80 - 1 was good general combiner for grain yield per plant and TOX 981 - 11 - 2 - 3 for both grain yield per plant and head rice recovery percent. The cross combinations APMS 6 A/ET 1 - 13, CRMS 31 A/ET 1 - 12, and IR 79156 A / NP T 80 - 1 {{were found to be}} outstanding with respect to grain yield per plant, head rice recovery percent, and spikelets per panicle. The cross APMS 6 A/NPT 2 - 2 - 694 - 1 was good combiner for head rice recovery percent. These promising <b>lines,</b> <b>testers,</b> and crosses revealed wide scope for enhancing the grain yield in the CMS line or three line breeding system based rice improvement programme to develop rice hybrids...|$|R
