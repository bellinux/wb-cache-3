Winder and <b>Le</b> <b>Heron</b> (2017) advocate for geographers to engage directly and critically with the Blue Economy and to remove the ‘disciplinary framings’ from which the notion of the Blue Economy has emerged. While endorsing Winder and Le Heron’s call for human geography to engage with debates about the Blue Economy, I argue that the lack of critical engagement within the geographical community with respect to the Blue Economy has not been imposed by disciplinary framings. Instead I ask Winder and <b>Le</b> <b>Heron</b> to clarify how a social and cultural critique of the Blue Economy will expand the current knowledge base of our oceans and seas. I also ask whether a critique of extensive literature within economics, planning and governance on the ocean resource have been the building blocks for the critical analysis of the Blue Economy provided by Winder and <b>Le</b> <b>Heron...</b>|$|E

40|$|According to <b>Le</b> <b>Heron</b> "One {{of the big}} {{policy issues}} in the 1990 s in industrialised nations centres on the extent and nature of public policy {{constraints}} on economic and social activities" (1993, p. 3). Sugar is, and always has been, a highly politicised commodity and government policy has been largely responsible for shaping its trajectory, both nationally and internationally. However, {{at the beginning of}} the twenty first century traditional practices do not appear to be meeting the challenges posed by an increasingly globalised economy. A new policy framework is required (Abbott, 1990, p. 318). This chapter discusses the emergence of globalisation and some of the impacts it is having on agriculture in general, and sugar in particular. In so doing, it focuses on some ideas of globalisation as proposed by <b>Le</b> <b>Heron</b> (1993) and McMichael (1996). Attention is then turned to the notion of the "level playing field" prior to a discussion of the kinds of problems currently facing the sugar industry and how Australian industry policy is changing in order to contend with such difficulties.

40|$|While {{welcoming}} {{the intervention of}} Winders and <b>Le</b> <b>Heron</b> as opening up a space for critical – and practical – engagement with so-called ‘Blue Economy’ thinking, their employment of assemblage approaches could be extended. Doing so might produce a different conceptualisation of the blue economy, while concurrently establishing new challenges for blue economic practices. In this commentary, I focus on three key areas: 1) the ontological separation of land and sea and the conceptualisation of ‘marine space’; 2) the ‘liveliness’ of oceans; and 3) practical possibilities for Blue Economy policies to draw on and engage with ‘wet ontologies’. I argue that future geographical research on the Blue Economy would benefit from moving away from categorisations of the ‘ecological’ or ‘bio’ and towards a fuller engagement with the diversity of actants and forces {{that contribute to the}} emergence of new practices, policies and (de) territorialisations...|$|E

40|$|The {{divergent}} {{growth rates}} of New Zealand regions are a matter of concern to economists, geographers and policy makers. People have been concerned about the 'drift to the north ' {{since at least the}} 1920 s. Geographers have paid particular attention to the role of manufacturing industry in explaining the growing hegemony of Auckland (Taylor and Hosking, 1979), and in generating regional inequalities through differential wage payments (Hoare, 1986). They have also analysed the regional development policies put in place at various times in response to concerns about these divergent growth rates (<b>Le</b> <b>Heron,</b> 1979; Scott, 1980). This literature largely overlooks a significant cause of regional growth and decline. The omitted cause is industry protection policies such as import licensing, tariffs, and export subsidies. Scott (1980) hinted at the role that these policies play in creating regional imbalances but provided no supporting analysis. Some regional implications of the 1980 s process of protection refor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Synthesis of outcrop and {{subsurface}} sedimentological and geomorphological datasets across North Africa {{allows a}} tentative palaeo-glaciological {{model of the}} flow dynamics and recessional character of a 440 Ma old (Hirnantian) ice sheet to be proposed. A system of eight cross-shelf trough depocentres is identified from the Late Ordovician of the Sahara region. These are interpreted to have been carved and occupied by ice streams, providing evidence for widespread heterogeneous flow within the ice sheet. During retreat, two key geological features were produced: (1) laterally extensive, sinuous to linear piles of sediment dumped parallel to the ice margin; (2) large meltwater channels (tunnel valleys) cut near the grounding line. The goal {{of this paper is}} to present complete palaeo-glaciological reconstructions of the Late Ordovician Saharan ice sheet, whose ice margin extended 4000 km from the Atlantic coast of Morocco to Egypt. Although previous researchers have discussed the maximum size and shape of Late Ordovician ice masses across Western Gondwana (e. g. Beuf et al. 1971; Vaslet 1990; Sutcliffe et al. 2000; Ghienne 2003; <b>Le</b> <b>Heron</b> et al. 2004), most have stopped short of discussing the regional distribution of flo...|$|E
40|$|In the Neoproterozoic snowball Earth hypothesis, {{shutdown}} of the planet’s hydrological {{system has been}} attributed to a global ice cover during one or more extreme glaciations. In the central Flinders Ranges, South Australia, the Yudnamutana Subgroup of Sturtian age includes diamictite, sandstone, and siltstone units of glaciomarine origin as much as 5000 m thick, and is overlain by postglacial transgressive siltstone and shale of the Tindelpina Shale Member, Tapley Hill Formation. In the central Flinders Ranges, the Yudnamutana Subgroup consists of (1) the Pualco Tillite (gravity resedimented glacial deposits), (2) the Holowilena Ironstone (glacioturbidites), (3) poorly stratified pebbly diamictite of the Warcowie Dolomite Member, lowermost Wilyerpa Formation (gravity resedimented glacial deposits), succeeded by (4) siltstones and sandstones with abundant hummocky cross-stratification (HCS: storm deposits), and (5) a lonestone-bearing succession with cobble-sized clasts in the upper Wilyerpa Formation (ice-rafted debris interpreted to record a glacial re-advance) in which HCS is absent. Because the action of oscillating waves is required to produce HCS on the seafl oor, its presence indicates an interval of significant meltback prior to glacial re-advance. Given that the HCS occurs ~ 2 km beneath the Tindelpina Shale Member, it signifies a major ice-free interval during the Sturtian glaciation.

40|$|Resilience” {{has become}} a new lingua franca for how we should live in realms as diverse as climate change, global urbanization, {{organizational}} change, community building, and personal development. In its broadest sense, it signifies the nature {{of living in a}} context understood to be characterized by hitherto unprecedented levels of risk and uncertainty in multiple arenas (Cooper, 2010; O’Malley, 2010). Whereas growing numbers of social scientists attribute the increasing prominence of the term to the discourses and practices of neoliberalism (see Evans, 2011; Joseph, 2013), this chapter suggests that the political genealogies and geographies of resilience may be more complex. Of particular interest is how the term is being tactically used by grass-roots political subjects who are actively experimenting with relational ways of living. Drawing on ongoing empirical research conducted with Coexist, an umbrella organization set up in 2008 to support environmental and community groups in Bristol, England, this chapter argues that resilience might be better understood as an example of an “after neoliberal” (Larner, <b>Le</b> <b>Heron,</b> & Lewis, 2007) form of subjectification. While resilience is undoubtedly shaped by the legacies of neoliberalism, it is becoming central {{to the ways in which}} communities and individuals are envisioning and experimenting with alternative environmental, economic, political, and social futures...|$|E
30|$|As refugees’ worldviews, beliefs, values, {{cognition}} (including knowledge) {{and social}} relations are strongly rooted in their pre-exile worlds, their recovery strategies are informed by pre-exile modes of subsistence, social relations, {{cultural values and}} adaptive strategies. Especially among former pastoral and nomadic refugees, and within the constraints presented by the structure of camps and access to pastoral territories, refugees’ agency is directed towards the recovery of livestock husbandry, including a return, as far as possible, to nomadism or transhumance. At the same time, however, refugees become integrated within trans-regional and transnational processes through political struggles, foreign aid, emigration and informal and formal markets for wage labour and other commodities. Pastoralism and nomadism are also being transformed through economic globalization (Chatty [2005]; Bollig et al. [2013]; Gertel and <b>Le</b> <b>Heron</b> [2011]), and refugee herd recovery is thus accompanied by change in the material and cultural use and management of herds related to these larger transformation processes. The individual and collective struggles to recover pre-exile modes of subsistence and livestock husbandry are motivated {{not only by the}} desire to improve the material conditions of life and gain greater autonomy; pre-exile modes of subsistence have great continuing cultural significance that refugees and their political representatives may re-appropriate and adapt to promote and strengthen identity that underlie claims to national sovereignty and territory.|$|E

40|$|When {{researchers}} {{attempt to}} study population and development, {{and particularly the}} role of migrations, the focus is normally on national level trends, frequently involving time-series analyses of more generic indicators of population change and economic growth. The migration field does, of course, deal with questions of the integration of migrants, at a macro-level evaluating their impact on social diversity and cohesion by turning to ecological-level indices covering clustering. This paper takes a different approach in part inspired by the model developed by <b>Le</b> <b>Heron,</b> Britton and Parson to analyse a related question: restructuring. This they saw {{as likely to be}} induced and thus frequently exogenous to a particular socio-demographic system. For example, policies effecting restructuring at a regional level will often come from some central agency external to the region, or even outside the geographic territory or country. There are also other changes that can be spontaneous in nature, arising from a mix of factors and situations endogenous to a given area. 1 In both cases, so these authors argue (1992 : 5), we must deal with “processes operating at various geographic scales [...] . ”. To this end this paper thus employs as demographic variables indices plotting subnational changes, thereby recognising that population dynamics at the national-level are likely to be a composite of complex societal forces varying from region to region. For much of this essay, which is more an exercise in setting research agendas than a full-scale empirical analysis, the regional breakdown is very broad, attempting to distinguish between the more dominant and less dominant poles at any time...|$|E
40|$|The wine {{industries}} of Argentina and Spain have undergone significant structural {{change over the}} last thirty years that has coincided with a period of trade liberalisation and as part of neoliberal economic reforms. In addition new markets have emerged in North America, Europe and Australasia, domestic consumption has declined, competition has increased {{and there has been a}} shift in consumer tastes to better quality, fine wines. As a result the patterns of supply and demand have changed and there has been a transition from a protected productivist to a post-productivist regime. Wine tourism has provided the medium through which these post productive features of transition brought about by neoliberalism have been investigated. The analysis uses and extends the work of Marsden (1995) and Wilson (2001) by emphasising the importance of locally assembled networks and clusters and the integration of the producers with their local communities. It also reworks <b>Le</b> <b>Heron</b> (2001; 2005) to argue that reconfigurations of the supply chain are indicative of the post productive transition. The research specifically looks at the wine industries in Argentina and Spain from the point of view of the producer. It compares and contrasts wine tourism in these countries with wine tourism in the English speaking world and it looks at the rationale and benefits of wine tourism. Consequently, it broadens our knowledge of wine tourism and post productivism beyond the boundaries of the English speaking world where both have been adequately documented, to Spanish cultures in the Old and New Worlds, in Europe and Latin America...|$|E
40|$|The Bolla Bollana Formation is an {{exceptionally}} thick (ca 1500 m), rift-related sedimentary succession cropping {{out in the}} northern Flinders Ranges, South Australia, which was deposited during the Sturtian (mid Cryogenian) glaciation. Lithofacies analysis reveals three distinct facies associations which chart changing depositional styles on an ice-sourced subaqueous fan system. The diamictite facies association is dominant, and comprises both massive and stratified varieties {{with a range of}} clast compositions and textures, arranged into thick beds (1 to 20 m), representing stacked, ice-proximal glaciogenic debris-flow deposits. A channel belt facies association, most commonly consisting of normally graded conglomerates and sandstones, displays scour and fill structure of ca 10 m width and 1 to 3 m depth: these strata are interpreted as channelized turbidites. Rare mud-filled channels in this facies association bear glacially striated lonestones. Finally, a sheet heterolithics facies association contains a range of conglomerates through sandstones to silty shales arranged into clear, normally graded cycles from the lamina to bed scale. These record a variety of non-channelized turbidites, probably occupying distal and/or inter-channel locations on the subaqueous fan. Coarsening and thickening-up cycles, capped by dolomicrites or mudstones, are indicative of lobe build out and abandonment, potentially as a result of ice lobe advance and stagnation. Dropstones, recognized by downwarped and punctured laminae beneath pebbles to boulders in shale, or in delicate climbing ripple cross-laminated siltstones, are clearly indicative of ice rafting. The co-occurrence of ice-rafted debris and striated lonestones strongly supports a glaciogenic sediment source for the diamictites. Comparison to Pleistocene analogues enables an interpretation as a trough mouth fan, most probably deposited leeward of a palaeo-ice stream. Beyond emphasizing the highly dynamic nature of Sturtian ice sheets, these interpretations testify to the oldest trough mouth fan recorded to date. Daniel P. <b>Le</b> <b>Heron,</b> Marie E. Busfield, and Alan S. Collin...|$|E

The development paper examines landownership in Northern England and the tensions surrounding different land uses. The history papers examine the impacts of transport technology, long term trends in agriculture exports, and Shelley's activities in rural education in Canterbury. The contemporary research papers, while wide ranging, include common themes such as how farm people {{have responded to the}} economic downturn in recent years by seeking off farm income. Another focus is the rural community with one paper examining local politics and another paper examining public drinking.

40|$|Greening"' is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the process of change in the ideologies and practices of (largely) western social systems as they move toward the incorporation of environmental concerns. The proliferation of green terms, as part of this process, not only provides evidence of the significance of green discourse in contemporary society but also indicates the confusion and disagreement about the actual processes of change which are occurring. In this paper, an attempt is made to examine a number of prominent green terms, and to evaluate their utility in explaining the trajectory of particular social henomena. Our purpose is to seek some conceptual clarity in the application of green terminology, and to undertake an initial and provisional analysis of the significance of the greening of institutions and institutional practices. In other words, we are seeking, first, to clarifY what we mean when we use terms like corporate greening, green consumption and greenwash; and, second, to establish a framework which will enable us to evaluate what, if any, particular social actions can be accurately defined by the use of such terms. For example, when and under what circumstances are the actions of a company that undertakes to minimise the environmental effects of its production practices to be seen as genuine (corporate greening), and when is such action merely window-dressing (a greenwash) ? We try to achieve these twin aims by considering the various ways green terms are being employed in agri-food discourse, and by providing examples from the organic farming industries in Australia and New Zealand, and the operations of a supermarket chain in the UK. This chapter discusses the emergence of globalisation and some of the impacts it is having on agriculture in general, and sugar in particular.
