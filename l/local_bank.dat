40|$|This {{paper is}} a study about <b>local</b> <b>banks</b> in Italy, with a special focus on the role these {{financial}} intermediaries have played {{before and during the}} crisis in lending to firms. Although in the literature there is not a clear consensus on the link between <b>local</b> <b>banks</b> and access to credit, our paper shows that the firms predominantly funded by <b>local</b> <b>banks</b> have been less rationed during the crisis. This result holds when we consider also the firm characteristics, the shape of the bank-firm relationship, and the features of the local credit market where the firm is located. This result supports the view that <b>local</b> <b>banks</b> may address firms' financial needs in a better way than not <b>local</b> <b>banks</b> because of their comparative advantage at collecting local information. This advantage appears to be relevant in a period of high risk aversion...|$|R

The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with <b>local</b> <b>bank</b> foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state.

The responsibility for setting the schedule, selling tickets and marketing was transferred to Flåm Utvikling, a newly established company that NSB owned 49 percent of, and Aurland Ressursutvikling 51 percent. The latter was owned by Aurland Municipality, the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and Aurland Sparebank, a <b>local</b> <b>bank.</b> Flåm Utvikling also took over responsibility for other tourism-related activities in Flåm, such as port facilities. NSB would still operate the trains, and Flåm Utvikling would pay NSB the cost of running the trains, but keep the profits from the ticket sales. The Norwegian National Rail Administration, which had been established in 1996 and had taken over the responsibility for infrastructure, retained ownership of the line itself. Flåm Utvikling also started building a cruise ship terminal at Flåm, so tourists could walk ashore and directly to the trains.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failed}} negotiations, Confederate Attorney General George Davis and Confederate Treasury Secretary George Trenholm resigned. The {{rest of the}} Confederate cabinet—escorted by over 2,000 cavalrymen under Basil W.

Believing that the Confederate cause was not yet lost, Davis convened a council of war on May 2 in Abbeville, South Carolina, but the cavalry commanders {{told him that the}} only cause for which their men would fight was to aid Davis's escape from the country. Informed that gold and silver coins and bullion from the Confederate treasury were at the train depot in Abbeville, Breckinridge ordered Duke to load it onto wagons and guard it as they continued southward. En route to Washington, Georgia, some members of the cabinet's escort threatened to take their back salaries by force. Breckinridge had intended to wait until their arrival to make the payments, but to avoid mutiny, he dispersed some of the funds immediately. Two brigades deserted immediately after being paid; the rest continued to Washington, where the remaining funds were deposited in a <b>local</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically assess the {{relationship}} existing between local financial development and the growth of firms, with a special focus on cooperatives. More in detail, the interest is in investigating whether <b>local</b> <b>banking</b> development impacts differently on the growth of cooperative firms, as compared to partnerships and corporations. To pursue this aim, using Italian data, a multiplicative interaction model is specified, so as to allow the impact of <b>local</b> <b>banking</b> development to differ between cooperative and non-cooperative firms. This empirical strategy presents the distinctive advantage of offering a direct test of the hypothesis of institutional complementari-ty between specific features of banking institutions (i. e. their degree of development) and of firms (i. e. the legal form they assume). The main finding is that although <b>local</b> <b>banking</b> development represents a determinant of firms’ growth, regardless of their legal structure, it plays a special role in boosting the growth of cooperatives: as <b>local</b> <b>banking</b> markets become more developed, cooperatives tend to grow at a rate higher than non-cooperative firms. This result provides, therefore, evidence in favor of the existence of an institutional complementarity relationship between the development of <b>local</b> <b>banking</b> institutions and cooperative firms...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate whether the participation of <b>local</b> <b>banks</b> exerts an impact on the spreads of syndicated loans in Russia. Following Berger, Klapper and Udell (2001), we aim to test whether <b>local</b> <b>banks</b> possess a superior ability to solve information asymmetries. In this aim, we use a sample of 528 syndicated loans to Russian borrowers. We perform regressions of the spread on a set of variables including information on the participation of <b>local</b> <b>banks,</b> loan and borrower characteristics. Unlike former papers, we consider separately foreign banks with and without a local presence, as this presence may influence their monitoring ability and their information. We observe no significant impact of the participation of <b>local</b> <b>banks</b> in syndicated loans on the spread. We also do not find any significant influence of the presence of domestic-owned banks or foreign-owned banks on the spread. Additional estimations considering subsamples for which information asymmetries are exacerbated provide similar results. Therefore our conclusion is that <b>local</b> <b>banks</b> do not benefit from an advantage in monitoring ability and in information in Russia.

5|$|In 2006, team-owner Per Berg {{stated that}} Lillestrøm SK {{would be in}} need of a new venue and {{indicated}} that one could be built at Kjeller, should the airport close. By 2007, the club's management was working on ideas to building new stadium, as the luxury boxes were all sold out and the club could not make more than NOK22 to 23 million per year on commercial income from Åråsen. In 2009, Lillestrøm launched itself as one of six candidate cities for Norway's joint bid with Sweden to host Euro 2016. This would involve building a new venue seating between 35,000 and 44,000 in Lillestrøm. The stadium would be built in modules, so the upper tiers could be dismounted after the championship and installed on other venues. The proposal was selected as one of four for the bid, but the bid was never sent. In January 2009, the club sold 25 percent of their ownership in Åråsen Eiendom, which is responsible for operating the commercial facilities at the stadium, to Lillestrømbanken, a <b>local</b> <b>bank,</b> for NOK9 million. The club retained full ownership of Åråsen Stadion AS, the company which owns the venue. In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, Åråsen was found to be the league's third-best stadium, with a score of 4.33 on a scale from one to five.|$|E
