Fig.10 shows an Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) image of the Sun at 195Ångströms, corresponding to a spectral line of multiply-ionized iron atoms. EIT used multilayer coated reflective mirrors that were coated with alternate layers of a light [...] "spacer" [...] element (such as silicon), and a heavy [...] "scatterer" [...] element (such as molybdenum). Approximately 100 layers of each type were placed on each mirror, with a thickness of around 10nm each.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to study the {{boundary}} <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> growth with vertical spires of varying heights and c/c spacing. In this study, {{it was observed that}} boundary <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> is affected by the presence of vertical spires in wind tunnel. Various spires of different heights 20, 30 and 40 cm with wall clearance of 2. 5 cm were used to study their effects. The boundary <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> was in turn affected by the configuration of the spires.

40|$|Wurzite GaN epilayers on {{sapphire}} substrates usually {{suffer from}} biaxial compressive strain {{due to the}} mismatches of the thermal expansion coefficients and the lattice constants between GaN layers and sapphire substrates. We have investigated the <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> effects on strain and transition energies by photoluminescence (PL), photoreflectance (PR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Samples {{used in this study}} are grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) and have the <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> of 0. 76, 2. 6, 5. 3 and 48 m. The PL and PR spectra showed the redshift of the transition energies with increasing <b>layer</b> <b>thickness.</b> This is attributed to strain-induced energy shift. The <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> dependence of strains is directly observed by XRD. The strain along the c -axis (εzz) decreased with increasing <b>layer</b> <b>thickness.</b> This indicates the strain is relaxed with <b>layer</b> <b>thickness.</b> From strain variation with <b>layer</b> <b>thickness,</b> we suggest that strain relaxation process is rapid at the initial stage of growth and becomes slower as the layer grows. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of PL spectra and theta rocking curves decrease with increasing <b>layer</b> <b>thickness.</b> This indicates the crystal quality improves as the strain is reduced.

The simulations monitor {{the operation of}} interfacial and threading sources with lengths greater than the individual <b>layer</b> <b>thickness.</b> At larger <b>layer</b> <b>thickness,</b> strength increases with decreasing <b>layer</b> <b>thickness,</b> due to slip confinement to individual layers. At sufficiently small <b>layer</b> <b>thickness,</b> slip confinement is not possible, even during initial stages of plastic deformation. Consequently, strength is not controlled by <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> but rather by source length, as well as coherency stress and interfacial barrier strength. Here, strength may increase, decrease, or reach a plateau depending on how source length and barrier strength vary with <b>layer</b> <b>thickness...</b>|$|R

50|$|A QCL however {{does not}} use bulk {{semiconductor}} materials in its optically active region. Instead it consists of a periodic series of thin layers of varying material composition forming a superlattice. The superlattice introduces a varying electric potential across {{the length of the}} device, meaning that there is a varying probability of electrons occupying different positions over the length of the device. This is referred to as one-dimensional multiple quantum well confinement and leads to the splitting of the band of permitted energies into a number of discrete electronic subbands. By suitable design of the <b>layer</b> <b>thicknesses</b> it is possible to engineer a population inversion between two subbands in the system which is required in order to achieve laser emission.

Participants: Healthy volunteers (n= 218) of Chinese ethnicity with spherical equivalent of - 6 to + 4 dioptres were recruited for study from October 2001 to March 2003. Ocular examination was carried out and measurements of peripapillary retinal nerve fibre <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> were performed using optical coherence tomography (Carl Zeiss Humphrey OCT 2 machine), in a circular pattern of 3. 4 mm diameter, centred on the optic disc. Main outcome measures: Mean retinal nerve fibre <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> and age. Results: The mean age was 40 (standard deviation, 17; range, 11 - 69) years. The mean peripapillary retinal nerve fibre <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> was 111. 6 (standard deviation, 18. 5; range, 52. 0 - 155. 0) μm.
