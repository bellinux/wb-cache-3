25|$|Braxton {{began his}} long career {{representing}} King William County in the Virginia House of Burgesses, taking {{his seat in}} 1761. However, his brother George died on October 3 of that year, leaving an insolvent estate, so the family lost Newington (which burned down, under other owners, in 1800). Although both high-living Braxtons had been considered wealthy, {{as well as political}} allies of Speaker John Robinson, when the John Robinson Estate Scandal broke in 1766, {{they turned out to be}} among the largest beneficiaries of the late speaker's interest-free <b>loans</b> of <b>redeemed</b> paper money supposed to have been burned.|$|R
5000|$|However, until 1540 Gui {{failed the}} provincial exam. He became Juren ranked second at age 35. Meantime, {{his first wife}} who came from Wei (...) clan died. Then he married to a woman came from Wang (...) clan of Anting which was once prosperous. Since the clan was on the decline, a younger {{descendant}} sold the local mansion treasured by the other members as heritage to pay taxes. On that account, his new wife begged him to get <b>loan</b> and <b>redeem</b> the mansion. In about 1541, he paid off all the debts eventually and moved to Anting, Jiading.|$|R
25|$|During {{his tenure}} at the RFC, Reed {{influenced}} two major national policies. First, Reed was instrumental in setting up the Commodity Credit Corporation. In early October 1933, President Roosevelt ordered RFC president Jesse Jones to establish a program to strengthen cotton prices. On October 16, 1933, Jones met with Reed and together they created the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6340 the next day, which legally established the CCC. The brilliance of the CCC was {{that the government would}} hold surplus cotton as security for the loan. If cotton prices rose above the value of the <b>loan,</b> farmers could <b>redeem</b> their cotton, pay off the loan and make a profit. If prices stayed low, the farmer still had enough money to live as well as plant next year. The plan worked so well that it became the basis for the New Deal's entire agricultural program.|$|R
50|$|Until late 2014 {{there existed}} eight undated gilts, which {{made up a}} very small {{proportion}} of the UK government's debt. They had no fixed maturity date. These gilts were very old: some, such as Consols, dated from the 18th century. The largest, War Loan, was issued in the early 20th century. The redemption of these bonds was {{at the discretion of}} the UK government, but because of their age, they all had low coupons, and so for a long time there was little incentive for the government to redeem them. Because the outstanding amounts were relatively very small, there was a very limited market in most of these gilts. In late 2014 and early 2015 the government gave notice that four of these gilts, including War <b>Loan,</b> would be <b>redeemed</b> in early 2015. The last four remaining gilts, with coupons of 2.5% or 2.75%, were redeemed on 5 July 2015.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 Beverly Loan Company {{claimed that}} more than 90% of clients that provide {{collateral}} for <b>loans</b> return to <b>redeem</b> their collateral. Other clients sell their merchandise outright instead of taking a loan, which Beverly Loan Company then puts up for sale. Some of the items sold {{are the result of}} defaulted loans, however very special items are usually kept {{for a longer period of}} time in hopes that the owner will eventually repay the loan and reclaim the items. Merchandise sold by Beverly Loan Company can be purchased in excess of one million dollars off of the retail price. While some clients take loans from the company due to their poor credit, others take loans from the company in order to receive the funds more quickly than they could from their bank. Items used as collateral are held for four months before they are offered for sale. The company also hires gemologists to appraise jewelry and diamonds to determine the value of collateral. In 2013 the company opened a sister location named New York Loan Company as a part of the company's 75th anniversary.|$|R
5|$|After the Norman Conquest, Æthelwig was trusted {{by the new}} king, William the Conqueror, {{and given}} some {{administrative}} duties. Æthelwig {{was one of a}} very small number of native Englishmen trusted by the king, which group included Ealdred and Wulfstan. Probably in 1069, Æthelwig was given authority in the former lands of the Mercian kingdom. After the deposition of Godric, the abbot of Winchcombe Abbey in 1070, Æthelwig served as his jailor. In 1072, Æthelwig was acting as a royal judge in the western part of England. During the rebellion of 1075, Æthelwig kept Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, one of the rebels, from joining up with the other rebels. In this action, Æthelwig was assisted by Wulfstan, as well as the sheriff of Worcestershire, Urse d'Abetot. Æthelwig also took the opportunity after the Norman Conquest to acquire more lands, obtaining 36 estates by <b>redeeming</b> <b>loans.</b> Æthelwig used his knowledge of English law not only on his own account, but to aid the new Norman ecclesiasitcs, such as Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Serlo, the Abbot of Gloucester. A number of English landowners commended themselves into Æthelwig's care after the Conquest, and this led to conflicts over who owned the lands after Æthelwig's death.|$|R
40|$|Loans is an {{agreement}} between one party to another and usually the common agreement is money. One party as the provider of the loan (creditor), while the other party is the party that receives the loan money (debtor). The essence of loans agreement is the creditors lend some money to the debtor, and the debtor shall repay it within a specified time along with interest. <b>Loan</b> repayment is <b>redeemed</b> by monthly installment. Oftenly, the repayment of the debtor is not as what it was agreed. If the debtor does not do what he was promised, {{it can be said}} he is breaching the lo{{an agreement}}. This research uses descriptive normative method. Using secondary data and primary data. Literature studies, field studies and interviews are used as the techniques to collect the data. And with qualitative data analysis method. 	Based on the results of research and discussion the conclusion is that the breach of loans agreement which is done by debtor against the loans agreement inflicting some legal consequences/legal responsibilities/legal sanctions should be given, such as: debtor is obliged to pay the monetary loss suffered by the creditor or so called restitution, cancellation agreement, risk transition, debtor is obliged to pay the court costs if the case is filed upon trials, and the debtor is proven breaching the agreement. In the contex of restitution, these are included: fees or costs which have incurred, the actual monetary loss because of damage, the loss of the creditor’s object caused by the negligence of the debtor, interests or provit which was expected...|$|R
40|$|Today {{microfinance}} {{has become}} a familiar term that many associate with financially sustainable poverty reduction. Others, on the other hand, argue that it make poor people’s lives even more rigid by making them slaves of debt. Seeing that no {{country in the world}} has more clients associated with its microfinance sector than India, {{there is a need for}} examining the quality of the growth in the Indian microfinance movement. What lead me to focus on the quality of the sector’s outreach is that the sector now counts more clients than there are poor households in the country. If providers of microfinance truly direct their services toward the poor the dependence on informal sources of credit could be expected to have declined, and the “Report of the Committee on Financial Inclusion” (2008) should not have documented that exclusion from formal financial services in general is large, and that the poorer the group, the greater is the exclusion. The aim of this thesis is to challenge the argued outreach by considering the quality of it. The paper accounts for why microfinance in India is needed, how the microfinance approaches aim to reach the people that traditionally are excluded from formal financial services, and it explores strengths and weaknesses in banking poor through the microfinance approaches. The thesis will discuss the group lending approach, the relationship between the size of microloans and the impact it has on the lives of poor persons, the problems associated with low quality self help groups, and it takes a closer look at the competition that is going on between the providers of microfinance and the effects this competition might cause. The reason why I use the word ‘might’ is because even though my informants expressed to witness the effects documented in this thesis, their statements alone does not allow me to argue that the effects are universal trends applying to the sector as a whole. However, the concerns raised in this thesis are in my view worrisome developments (though to greater or lesser extent), and I believe that it needs to be raised awareness of them. The concerns raised by my informants also led me addressed the Andhra Pradesh Ordinance. The ordinance came be in order to regulate the microfinance institutions as some of them allegedly charge extortive interest rates and <b>redeem</b> <b>loans</b> through coercive methods which cause poor clients to commit suicides. This thesis suggests that the ordinance might be a blessing in disguise more than it is an actual blessing for the sector...|$|R
