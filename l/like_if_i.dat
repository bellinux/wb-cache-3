The engineering process was handled by Jens Koerkmeier. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The song's keyboards, whistle, guitars, bass, percussion and drum programming were provided by Eman, with additional keyboards and drum programming by Koerkmeier and Andrew Goldstein. On July 29, 2011, the audio of [...] "It Girl" [...] was uploaded to Derulo's official YouTube account. When speaking of the song, Derulo told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I wanted to put myself in a position as if I'd found my It Girl, to make myself feel <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> found that one true love. I've basically described {{what it would be}} <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> found her." [...] Derulo further elaborated about the concept of the song in another interview with Matt Elias of MTV News: ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding his remix of the album, O'Brien stated, [...] "The band {{loved the}} {{original}} mix of Ten, but were {{also interested in}} what it would sound <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to deconstruct and remix it...The original Ten sound is what millions of people bought, dug and loved, so I was initially hesitant to mess around with that. After years of persistent nudging from the band, I was able to wrap my head around the idea of offering it as a companion piece to the original—giving a fresh take on it, a more direct sound." ...|$|E

5000|$|Xie Jin {{maintained}} {{later in}} his life that {{he was forced to}} make concessions {{in the second half of}} Two Stage Sisters. In an interview in 1989, he confessed [...] "the second part seems weak to me. I couldn't finish it the way <b>I</b> would have <b>liked.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> could redo the second part now, it would improve the entire film." ...|$|R
500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well what would it be <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E
500|$|Del Toro and Soderbergh both {{attended}} the French premiere in late November 2008, where they took {{questions from the}} press. Del Toro remarked that the [...] "legendary rebel" [...] was still pertinent because [...] "the things that he fought for in the late 1950s and mid 1960s are still relevant today", adding that [...] "he did not hide behind curtains ... he stood up for the forgotten ones". When asked why he made the film, Soderbergh stated, [...] "I {{needed to make the}} film, and that is a different feeling. I felt <b>like,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am worth anything, I have to say yes. I can't say no". The following day, the Dubai International Film Festival would describe Soderbergh's narrative as a [...] "magisterial ... compelling experience", with Del Toro's performance as [...] "blue-chip".|$|E
500|$|At the {{induction}} ceremony, Pearson {{said that he}} felt the inaugural class should include more pioneers such as Raymond Parks, Tim Flock, and Lee Petty. Pearson said [...] "I feel <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was going in next year and I knew Raymond Parks wasn't, I'd withdraw my name to get him in." [...] In 2010, Pearson {{was named to the}} 2011 class in the NASCAR Hall of Fame. He received the most votes, from 50 of 53 voters.

When {{speaking}} about her weight loss and diet to Access Hollywood, Sparks said, [...] "My diet has pretty much remained the same, <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{want a piece of}} bread, I’m gonna have a piece of bread, but I’m making healthier decisions like instead of a bag of chips for a snack, I’ll see if I can find an apple. I’ve also upped my intake of vegetables and I’m drinking a lot more water." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the local}} {{publication}} City Pages description of the BCA conversation, Yanez [...] "could never state definitively ... that he saw a firearm that day". Yanez uses [...] "various terms to suggest {{the presence of a}} firearm". Yanez states, [...] "it appeared to me that he was wrapping something around his fingers and almost <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to put my hand around my gun. It was dark inside the vehicle ..." [...] At another point [...] "it seemed like he was pulling out a gun and the barrel just kept coming." [...] "I know he had an object and it was dark. And he was pulling it out with his right hand."He added: [...] "It was, to me, it just looked big and apparent that he's gonna shoot you, he's gonna kill you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{has clearly}} spelled out the {{importance}} of her characters to her stories: [...] “As far as I’m concerned, character is everything. I never did see why I have to throw in a plot, too.” [...] In an earlier (1977) interview, she stated that “the real joy of writing is how people can surprise one. My people wander around my study until the novel is done. It’s one reason I’m {{very careful not to}} write about people I don’t <b>like.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> find somebody creeping in that I’m not really fond of, I usually take him out.” [...] Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler’s characters seem to take on {{a life of their own}} that she doesn’t seem to totally control: “Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they surprise her too.” ...|$|E

2500|$|VanderWaal began {{composing}} {{her first}} songs at age three, using a wireless microphone. As a preteen, she found songwriting inspiration by watching movies {{and trying to}} imagine what a character was feeling, and [...] "what it would be <b>like</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were them, and wrote a song." [...] She was inspired to learn the ukulele after watching a family friend play and seeing a Twenty One Pilots video on YouTube. She then bought one, using money she had received for her 11th birthday, and watched more videos to teach herself how to play. She has also played the saxophone in her school's marching band. After learning to play the ukulele, VanderWaal began to perform during open mic events at small venues near her home and to study music theory. In July 2016, after her audition on AGT, VanderWaal performed at the Lafayette Theatre in Suffern and at the Ramapo Summer Concert Series at Palisades Credit Union Park.|$|E
