The loss of cable load and presence of cable breakage can be catastrophic for the entire structure. Various techniques have been applied to the non-destructive monitoring of structural health of multi-wire <b>cable</b> <b>structures.</b> However, few of them could fully characterize the early structural degradation or reliably determine the damage mechanism due to the limited access to structural components and other environmental factors. In this thesis, a guided wave-based structural health monitoring system {{that is capable of}} monitoring the cable load levels and detecting defect simultaneously is developed for multi-wire <b>cable</b> <b>structures.</b> A series of finite element analysis were conducted using Abaqus/Explicit to explore the feasibility of using ultrasonic guided waves to detect the notch in multi-wire <b>cable</b> <b>structures,</b> followed by the experimental verification on a seven wire strand. Both numerical studies and experimental works presented in this research have revealed that guided waves could be a promising technique for defect detection in multi-wire <b>cable</b> <b>structures.</b> On the other hand, finite element analyses were conducted in this study to investigate the nonlinear characteristics of ultrasonic guided waves in a multi-wire cable under different preloaded levels. The wave signals after a fast Fourier transform indicate that second harmonic peak together with the calculated nonlinear parameters decreased as the preload level increased. The corresponding wave energy was integrated to minimise the adverse influence caused by dispersion and multimodality during wave propagation.

40|$|Abstract: Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is an {{advanced}} composite material with {{the advantages of}} high strength, lightweight, no corrosion and excellent fatigue resistance. Therefore, unidirectional CFRP has great potential for cables and to replace steel <b>cables</b> in <b>cable</b> <b>structures.</b> However, CFRP is a typical orthotropic material and its strength and modulus perpendicular to the fiber direction are much lower {{than those in the}} fiber direction, which brings a challenge for anchoring CFRP cables.

After introducing properties of carbon fibers, mechanical characteristics and structural forms of CFRP cables, existing CFRP <b>cable</b> <b>structures</b> in the world (all of them are cable bridges) are reviewed.

Typical cable characteristics are that they are susceptible to corrosion and tend to sag during their long service life, so it is essential to take these characteristics into account in the structural analysis to determine the actual behaviour of a cable in service.
