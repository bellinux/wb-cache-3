5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure <b>love.</b> <b>This</b> is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|Burne-Jones {{was elected}} an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1885, and the {{following}} year he exhibited (for the only time) at the Academy, showing The Depths of the Sea, {{a painting of a}} mermaid carrying down with her a youth whom she has unconsciously drowned in the impetuosity of her <b>love.</b> <b>This</b> picture adds to the habitual haunting charm a tragic irony of conception and a felicity of execution which give it a place apart among Burne-Jones's works. He formally resigned his Associateship in 1893. One of the Perseus series was exhibited in 1887, two more in 1888, with The Brazen Tower, inspired by the same legend. In 1890 the second series of The Legend of Briar Rose were exhibited by themselves, and won the widest admiration. The huge watercolor, The Star of Bethlehem, painted for the corporation of Birmingham, was exhibited in 1891. A long illness for some time checked the painter's activity, which, when resumed, was much occupied with decorative schemes. An exhibition of his work was held at the New Gallery in the winter of 1892-1893. To this period belong several of his comparatively few portraits. In 1894 Burne-Jones was made a baronet. Ill-health again interrupted the progress of his works, chief among which was the vast Arthur in Avalon. In the winter following his death a second exhibition of his works was held at the New Gallery, and an exhibition of his drawings (including some of the charmingly humorous sketches made for children) at the Burlington Fine Arts Club.|$|E
5|$|On April 17, James {{defeated}} Madison Rayne in a {{steel cage}} match, which lasted {{less than a}} minute, to win the TNA Knockouts Championship for the first time. With the win, James {{became the first woman}} in history to have held the WWE Women's Championship, the WWE Divas Championship, and the TNA Knockouts Championship. On the May 5 episode of Impact!, James made her first successful title defense against Ms. Tessmacher. On May 15 at Sacrifice, James successfully defended her title against Madison Rayne and in the process helped Tara get a release from her alliance with Rayne. The following month at Slammiversary IX, James successfully defended her title against Angelina Love, however after the match both Love and Winter attacked her. On June 18, James made her debut for TNA's Mexican partner Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) at Triplemanía XIX, where she teamed with Angelina Love, Sexy Star and Velvet Sky to defeat Cynthia Moreno, Faby Apache, Lolita and Mari Apache in an eight-woman tag team match. James returned to AAA on July 9, teaming with Sexy Star to defeat the Apaches in a tag team match, after which she challenged Mari to a match for her AAA Reina de Reinas Championship. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, James competed in an eight–way match for the Reina de Reinas Championship, becoming the last person eliminated by the new champion, Pimpinela Escarlata. On the June 23 episode of Impact Wrestling, James was defeated by Winter in a non-title Street Fight, following outside interference from <b>Love.</b> <b>This</b> led to a match on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, where James lost the Knockouts Championship to Winter, following multiple interferences from Love and a red mist from Winter. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, James defeated Madison Rayne to earn a rematch for the title. On the September 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, James defeated Winter to win her second TNA Knockouts Championship. On September 11 at No Surrender, James dropped the title back to Winter. On the September 22 episode of Impact Wrestling, James defeated Ms. Tessmacher to earn another shot at the championship at Bound for Glory, in a four-way match with defending champion Winter, Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky, which Sky would win.|$|E

25|$|Cupid and Psyche {{has been}} {{analyzed}} from a feminist perspective as a paradigm {{of how the}} gender unity of women is disintegrated through rivalry and envy, replacing the bonds of sisterhood with an ideal of heterosexual <b>love.</b> <b>This</b> theme was explored in Psyche's Sisters: Reimagining the Meaning of Sisterhood (1988) by Christine Downing, who uses myth as a medium for psychology.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the Zionists' use of Rabbi Chaim Vital (see above), the Satmar Rebbe argued that Vital's remarks refer not to the Three Oaths incumbent on the Jewish people, but to God's oath not to redeem the Jewish people unless they repent out of <b>love.</b> <b>This</b> oath lasts a thousand years; after that point even repentance out of fear can bring the redemption.|$|E

25|$|The {{struggle}} with the world is framed {{by the idea that}} series of personal and social transformations can increase our share of attributes associated with the divine and give us a larger life. It emphasizes love over altruism, rejecting the moral of the mastery of self-interest to enhance solidarity, and emphasizing the humility of individual <b>love.</b> <b>This</b> orientation has been articulated in two different voices: the sacred voice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the profane voice of the secular projects of liberation.|$|E
25|$|The {{season premiere}} {{opened with a}} roll call filled with {{officers}} never before seen on the show, briefly fooling viewers into thinking the entire cast had been replaced. It was then revealed that this was, in fact, the night shift. The action then cut to the day shift pursuing their after-work activities. Another unique episode from this season explained through flashbacks how Furillo and Davenport met and fell in <b>love.</b> <b>This</b> was the first season that Travanti and Hamel were not nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor/Actress in a Drama Series.|$|E

25|$|Here, Ellis touches {{upon the}} often {{paradoxical}} nature of widely reported consensual S practices. It {{is described as}} not simply pain to initiate pleasure, but violence—"or the simulation of involuntary violent acts"—said to express <b>love.</b> <b>This</b> irony is highly evident in the observation by many, that not only are popularly practiced sadomasochistic activities usually performed at the express request of the masochist, {{but that it is}} often the designated masochist who may direct such activities, through subtle emotional cues perceived or mutually understood and consensually recognized by the designated sadist.|$|E
25|$|Just as he {{had done}} with his other children, Jean Petipa began giving the young Marius lessons in ballet at the age of seven. At first the young boy resisted, caring very little for dance. Nevertheless, he soon came to <b>love</b> <b>this</b> art form that was so much the life and {{identity}} of his family, and he excelled quickly. At the age of nine Marius performed {{for the first time in}} a ballet production as a Savoyard in his father's staging of Pierre Gardel's 1800 ballet La Dansomani in 1827.|$|E
25|$|When Maggie is {{apparently}} murdered by {{a serial killer}} in 2003, it comes as a shock when Mickey starts a relationship with Bonnie Lockhart. Bonnie was Maggie's nemesis, and former housekeeper. This relationship lasts {{for the better part}} of 2003, and into much of 2004. Maggie is found on the island of Melaswen (New Salem spelled backwards). Maggie returns to Salem only to learn her husband Mickey is in a relationship with Bonnie. A furious and embarrassed Maggie tries everything to win back his <b>love.</b> <b>This</b> is about the time that longtime veteran John Clarke retired as Mickey Horton, and is replaced by actor John Ingle.|$|E

Along with EXIT Festival, Sea Dance Festival was a part of a special festival package called EXIT Adventure. EXIT was attended by 215,000 people.|$|E
25|$|The film is stunningly {{beautiful}} at times, and wildly ambitious, {{an attempt}} to be both wordless and wordy, {{to get to the}} hypnotic state that poetry and music can induce while saying something meaningful about black and white attitudes to land and <b>love.</b> <b>This</b> last part, as I read Murray, is largely imposed and disruptive, trying to pin a romantic political agenda to the work that's hardly there. It makes the film too literal, too current, when it wants to lodge itself in the more mysterious part of the brain. The film still has a power – Haywood's performance is magnificent – but it never achieves a strong inner reality. It falls short of its own tall ambitions.|$|E
25|$|Fire and Ice {{begins with}} Fireheart and Graystripe {{performing}} a traditional silent vigil after their promotion to warrior status in Into the Wild.

During a hunting patrol, Graystripe almost drowns after chasing a vole onto thin ice and falling in the river separating RiverClan and ThunderClan. He is rescued by Silverstream, a RiverClan warrior, with whom he falls in <b>love.</b> <b>This</b> inter-clan love is against the warrior code, a code of honor that all warriors must follow. Fireheart discovers their relationship, and unsuccessfully attempts to discourage them from seeing each other.|$|E
