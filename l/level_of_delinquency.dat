5000|$|In criminology, the power-control {{theory of}} gender and {{delinquency}} (abbreviated as the power-control theory) holds the gender distribution of delinquency is caused by stratification from gender relations within the family. The theory seeks to explain {{gender differences in the}} rates of delinquency by attributing them to the level of social/parental control practiced. The theory states that the class, gender, and type of family structure (e.g. egalitarian or patriarchal) will influence the severity of social/parental control practiced which will in turn set the [...] "accepted norm" [...] for the child/individual. This norm will in turn control the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency</b> by the individual.|$|E
50|$|Credit {{scorecards}} are mathematical models which {{attempt to}} provide a quantitative estimate of {{the probability that a}} customer will display a defined behavior (e.g. loan default, bankruptcy or a lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency)</b> with respect to their current or proposed credit position with a lender. Scorecards are built and optimized to evaluate the credit file of a homogeneous population (e.g. files with delinquencies, files that are very young, files that have very little information). Most empirically derived credit scoring systems have between 10 and 20 variables. Application scores tend to be dominated by credit bureau data which typically amounts to over 80% of the predictive power from closer to 60% in the late 1980s for UK scorecards. Indeed there has been an increasing trend to minimize applicant or non-verifiable variables from scorecards which has increased the contribution of the credit bureau data.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{large number}} of delinquent {{activities}} are performed by adolescents and only occur during this period in their lives. One of the main factors that influence this behaviour is social interaction, mainly with peers. This paper contributes a computational model that predicts delinquent behaviour during adolescence based on interaction with friends and classmates. Based on the model, which was validated based on empirical data, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency</b> of pupils is simulated over time. Furthermore, simulation experiments are performed to investigate for hypothetical scenarios what {{is the impact of}} the division of students over classes on the (individual and collective) <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to examine the {{relationship}} between attachment to parents, control by parents and self-reported delinquency, within the framework of social control theory (Hirschi, 1969). Factors associated with delinquency, substance abuse, school misbehaviour and police contacts were investigated in two time periods - 1982 and 1994. Two hundred and forty-nine boys aged twelve to fourteen years were surveyed in school in 1994. Forty-four were surveyed in 1982. Results revealed that the prevalence <b>of</b> self-reported <b>delinquency</b> in Galway is similar to that in other countries and cities. Boys who reported high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency</b> also reported having more delinquent friends, parents who had been picked up by the police, higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> substance abuse, more physical punishment by and weaker attachments to parents. Different factors predicted the different types <b>of</b> <b>delinquency.</b> The expected interactions between poor attachment, harsh discipline and high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> self-reported <b>delinquency</b> were not found, except in respect of fathers in the 1982 sample. In the 1994 sample, those who claimed to be strongly attached reported lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency.</b> Those who reported being strongly disciplined by their mothers and both parents also reported higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency.</b> In the 1982 study, there was no significant correlation between attachment to parents and delinquency or between discipline by parents and delinquency. There were significant differences between the two samples in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> punishment, attachment, supervision, family size and structure but no differences in terms <b>of</b> <b>delinquency.</b> The reliability <b>of</b> all the measures was high over a two-week period. It was concluded that self-reported delinquency, is a normal part of adolescence in Galway, with high and worrying <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> substance abuse and police contacts, especially among those who are poorly attached to parent...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{researchers}} confirmed socialization models depicting parenting {{practices and}} social cognitions associated with prosocial and antisocial behaviors. However, {{little research has}} focused on processes underlying the link between parenting and these behaviors. Per Grusec and Goodnow’s internalization model, children and adolescents develop expectancies regarding their parents’ reactions to their behaviors. Adolescents’ expected parental reactions to prosocial behaviors were hypothesized to predict prosocial behaviors; expectations regarding antisocial behaviors were expected to predict antisocial behaviors. For this study, 80 adolescents and their parents reported adolescents’ antisocial and prosocial behaviors. Adolescents completed a measure of prosocial moral reasoning and an assessment of how appropriately they expected each parent to react to prosocial and antisocial behaviors. Expected parental reactions to antisocial behavior predicted lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency</b> and aggression (adolescent report).

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} three issues in the current debate on youth delinquency: (1) Whether the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency</b> of adolescents is negatively correlated with the quality of her/his personal networks (as stated by the social inability model) or not (as stated by the social ability model); (2) Whether there is homophily in adolescents’ networks regarding degree of delinquency; and (3) Whether homophily regarding the degree of delinquency is more pronounced for strong relationships than for weak relationships. A network survey, the Dutch Social Behavior Study, was carried out on 1, 317 students (aged 15 to 17 years) in 20 high schools. Students completed a self-report questionnaire about petty crime and nominated fellow students for ten different types of relationships, both positive and negative and varying from weak to strong. Results showed that (1) the quality of the personal networks of delinquents and non-delinquents did not differ over any positive relationship. Delinquents seemed to avoid others a little more than nondelinquents, but were not avoided more; (2) the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency</b> of students involved in positive relationships was correlated. This was caused partially by sex segregation; and (3) Homophily in weak-tie networks was not smaller than in strong-tie networks. ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: One {{explanation}} for the increase in delinquency in adolescence is that young people are trapped in the so-called maturity gap: the discrepancy between biological and social maturation, which motivates them to engage in delinquency as a temporary means to {{bridge this gap by}} emphasizing their maturity. In the current study, we investigated to what extent the discrepancy between pubertal status (i. e., biological maturation) and autonomy in decision making (i. e., social maturation) is related to conflict with parents, which in turn predicts increasing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency</b> as well as substance use. Methods: Hypotheses were tested by means of path models in a longitudinal sample of adolescent boys and girls (N = 1, 844; M age 13. 02) from the Social Network Analyses of Risk behaviors in Early adolescence (SNARE) study using a one-year time interval. Results: Results indicate that biological maturation in interaction with social maturation predict conflict with parents, which in turn was related to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>delinquency</b> and substance use over time.

Important contributing factors to the prevalence and variety of self-report delinquency are discussed in the multi-theory framework. Findings suggest that this sample of rural migrant students are exposed to more risks but are not more delinquency-prone than non-migrant students; results show support to quite different socialization processes for the two groups: strong moral beliefs and good academic performance play key roles in the prevention of delinquency for rural migrant students while non-rural migrants are affected by school attachment and negative social activities.
