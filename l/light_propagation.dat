5|$|This {{and related}} {{predictions}} follow {{from the fact}} that light follows what is called a light-like or null geodesic—a generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics. Such geodesics are the generalization of the invariance of lightspeed in special relativity. As one examines suitable model spacetimes (either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or, for more than a single mass, the post-Newtonian expansion), several effects of gravity on <b>light</b> <b>propagation</b> emerge. Although the bending of light can also be derived by extending the universality of free fall to light, the angle of deflection resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity.|$|E
25|$|In his {{doctoral}} dissertation Carathéodory originated his method {{based on the}} use of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation to construct a field of extremals. The ideas are closely related to <b>light</b> <b>propagation</b> in optics. The method became known as the royal road to the calculus of variations. More recently the same idea has been taken into the theory of optimal control. The method can also be extended to multiple integrals.|$|E
25|$|In media termed birefringent, {{in which}} the amplitudes are {{unchanged}} but a differential phase delay occurs, the Jones matrix is a unitary matrix: |g1| = |g2| = 1. Media termed diattenuating (or dichroic {{in the sense of}} polarization), in which only the amplitudes of the two polarizations are affected differentially, may be described using a Hermitian matrix (generally multiplied by a common phase factor). In fact, since any matrix may be written as the product of unitary and positive Hermitian matrices, <b>light</b> <b>propagation</b> through any sequence of polarization-dependent optical components can be written as the product of these two basic types of transformations.|$|E

25|$|Later, in 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose {{developed}} {{the theory of}} the statistical mechanics of photons, which allowed a theoretical derivation of Planck's law. The actual word 'photon' was invented still later, by G.N. Lewis in 1926, who mistakenly believed that photons were conserved, contrary to Bose–Einstein statistics; nevertheless the word 'photon' was adopted to express the Einstein postulate of the packet nature of <b>light</b> <b>propagation.</b> In an electromagnetic field isolated in a vacuum in a vessel with perfectly reflective walls, such as was considered by Planck, indeed the photons would be conserved according to Einstein's 1905 model, but Lewis was referring to a field of photons considered as a system closed with respect to ponderable matter but open to exchange of electromagnetic energy with a surrounding system of ponderable matter, and he mistakenly imagined that still the photons were conserved, being stored inside atoms.|$|E
25|$|If one {{illuminates}} {{two parallel}} slits, {{the light from}} the two slits again interferes. Here the interference is a more-pronounced pattern with a series of light and dark bands. The width of the bands is a property of the frequency of the illuminating light. (See the bottom photograph to the right.) When Thomas Young (1773–1829) first demonstrated this phenomenon, it indicated that light consists of waves, as the distribution of brightness {{can be explained by the}} alternately additive and subtractive interference of wavefronts. Young's experiment, performed in the early 1800s, played a vital part in the acceptance of the wave theory of light, vanquishing the corpuscular theory of light proposed by Isaac Newton, which had been the accepted model of <b>light</b> <b>propagation</b> in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, the later discovery of the photoelectric effect demonstrated that under different circumstances, light can behave as if it is composed of discrete particles. These seemingly contradictory discoveries made it necessary to go beyond classical physics and take the quantum nature of light into account.|$|E
25|$|Having unique {{features}} of tunable resonances and unprecedented near-field enhancement, plasmon is an enabling technique for light management. Recently, performances of thin-film solar cells have been pronouncedly improved by introducing metallic nanostructures. The improvements are mainly {{attributed to the}} plasmonic-optical effects for manipulating <b>light</b> <b>propagation,</b> absorption, and scattering. The plasmonic-optical effects could: (1) boost optical absorption of active materials; (2) spatially redistribute light absorption at the active layer due to the localized near-field enhancement around metallic nanostructures. Except for the plasmonic-optical effects, the effects of plasmonically modified recombination, transport and collection of photocarriers (electrons and holes), hereafter named plasmonic-electrical effects, have been proposed by Sha, etal. For boosting device performance, they conceived a general design rule, tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. The design rule suggests that electron to hole transport length ratio should be balanced with electron to hole mobility ratio. In other words, the transport time of electrons and holes (from initial generation sites to corresponding electrodes) should be the same. The general design rule can be realized by spatially redistributing light absorption at the active layer of devices (with the plasmonic-electrical effect). They also demonstrated the breaking of space charge limit in plasmonic-electrical organic solar cell.|$|E

We show through experiment and theory that a plasmonic-excitonic design using gold nanoshells with optimized single particle scattering-to-absorption cross-section ratios leads to a strong enhancement in near-field absorption and a resultant 35 % enhancement in photocurrent in the performance-limiting near-infrared spectral region. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
2500|$|In many wave-propagation media, wave {{velocity}} changes with frequency or wavelength of the waves; {{this is true}} of <b>light</b> <b>propagation</b> in most transparent substances other than a vacuum. [...] These media are called dispersive. [...] The result is that the angles determined by Snell's law also depend on frequency or wavelength, so that a ray of mixed wavelengths, such as white light, will spread or disperse.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} features of any VECSEL is the small thickness of the semiconductor gain region in the direction of propagation, less than 100nm. In contrast, a conventional in-plane semiconductor laser entails <b>light</b> <b>propagation</b> over distances of from 250µm upward to 2mm or longer. The significance of the short propagation distance is that it causes the effect of [...] "antiguiding" [...] nonlinearities in the diode laser gain region to be minimized.

2500|$|In {{the modern}} quantum {{mechanical}} understanding of <b>light</b> <b>propagation</b> through a slit (or slits) every photon has {{what is known}} as a wavefunction which describes its path from the emitter through the slit to the screen.

[...] In important experiments (A low-intensity double-slit experiment was first performed by G. I. Taylor in 1909, see double-slit experiment) the existence of the photon's wavefunction was demonstrated. [...] In the quantum approach the diffraction pattern is created by the distribution of paths, the observation of light and dark bands is {{the presence or absence of}} photons in these areas (no interference!). [...] The quantum approach has some striking similarities to the Huygens-Fresnel principle, in that principle the light becomes a series of individually distributed light sources across the slit which is similar to the limited number of paths (or wave functions) available for the photons to travel through the slit.|$|E

40|$|Structured {{beams of}} light can move small objects in {{surprising}} ways. Particularly striking examples include observations of polarization-dependent forces acting on optically isotropic objects and tractor beams that can pull objects opposite to {{the direction of}} the <b>light's</b> <b>propagation.</b> Here we develop a theoretical framework in which these effects vanish at the leading order of light scattering theory. Exotic optical forces emerge instead from interference between different orders of multipole scattering. These effects create a rich variety of ways to manipulate small objects with light, so-called photokinetic effects. Applying this formalism to the particular case of Bessel beams offers useful insights into the nature of tractor beams and the interplay between spin and orbital angular momentum in vector beams of light, including a manifestation of orbital-to-spin conversion.

40|$|We {{investigate}} continuous-time quantum {{walks of}} two indistinguishable particles (bosons, fermions or hard-core bosons) in one-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbour interactions. The two interacting particles can undergo independent- and/or co-walking dependent on both quantum statistics and interaction strength. We find that two strongly interacting particles may form a bound state and then co-walk like a single composite particle with statistics-dependent propagation speed. Such an effective single-particle picture of co-walking is analytically derived {{in the context}} of degenerate perturbation and the analytical results are well consistent with direct numerical simulation. In addition to implementing universal quantum computation and observing bound states, two-particle quantum walks offer a novel route to detecting quantum statistics.
