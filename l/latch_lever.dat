50|$|The Lever lock {{door handle}} on a {{backplate}} is {{another type of}} door handle which operates similarly to the <b>lever</b> <b>latch</b> door handle. This type of handle on a backplate consists of a lever and just below it, a key hole cut. This allows a key to be inserted into the door to control a mortice sash lock. Just the like the <b>lever</b> <b>latch,</b> the door can be opened and shut by pushing the handle but can also be locked using a key. This locking mechanism is why this type of door handle is used for front and back doors of residential housing.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} and basic type of door handle is the <b>Lever</b> <b>latch</b> door handle on a {{backplate}} found in residential houses and commercial and public buildings. Doors fitted with this handle has a latch {{which is used to}} keep the door shut. The door handle features only a lever handle which operates this latch. When the handle is pushed down, the spindle rotates which “passes through the door and the tubular latch inside the door allowing the door to be opened”. This type of door handle is normally found on doors leading into the living and dining rooms as they don’t require any type of locking. The <b>lever</b> <b>latch</b> handle is also easy to install and use and is available in a variety of styles and finishes.|$|R
5000|$|Tadpole trikes tend also to use Ackermann {{steering}} geometry, {{perhaps with}} both front brakes {{operated by the}} stronger hand. While the KMX Kart stunt trike with this setup allows the rear brake to be operated separately, letting the rider do [...] "bootlegger turns", the standard setup for most trikes has the front brake for each side operated by each hand. The center-of-mass of most tadpole trikes {{is close to the}} front wheels, making the rear brake less useful. The rear brake may instead be connected to a <b>latching</b> brake <b>lever</b> for use as a parking brake when stopped on a hill.|$|R
50|$|The Third Model Dragoon numbers {{stand at}} ten-thousand from 1851 through 1860. This design had more {{variations}} {{as compared to}} its earlier counterparts. Some of the third model Colt Dragoon Revolvers had frame cuts for detachable shoulder stocks, horizontal loading <b>lever</b> <b>latches</b> and folding leaf sights. Third Colt Dragoon Revolvers had a round trigger guard. Government records showed an order for 8,390 Dragoons.|$|R
50|$|Additional guide slots, pins, notches, or holes {{may be used}} to aid {{in proper}} {{insertion}} of a component between other live components, while mechanical engagement <b>latches,</b> handles, or <b>levers</b> {{may be used to}} assist in proper insertion and removal of devices that either require large amounts of force to connect or disconnect, or to assist in the proper mating and holding together of power and communications connectors.|$|R
5000|$|ETRS: A {{modification}} introduced July 1982, ETRS {{production discontinued}} September 1989. Unnamed change to original ETRS model. Lens release sliding <b>lever</b> <b>latch</b> located to {{left side of}} camera side panel, film-backs released using two independent tabs. This version is reputedly {{referred to as the}} [...] "plastic" [...] body ETRS and film-back, for the change in the side panels of the body and film-backs to polycarbonate.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} use the inbuilt {{shooting}} mechanism, the opening lever is pressed, and the barrel rotated out of the knife handle, the cartridge is inserted into the firing chamber and the barrel is then inserted back into the handle and rotated back into place using two prongs that fit into the outer <b>latch.</b> The <b>lever</b> {{on the right side}} of the NRS-2 is then cocked while the safety catch located beside the barrel is turned to the [...] "fire" [...] position. Then the user's left hand is used to hold the knife blade, and the right hand to hold the knife handle, with the right index finger being placed on the trigger, which is located above the safety catch beside the gun barrel.|$|R
50|$|A Johnson bar is a {{hand lever}} with several {{distinct}} positions {{and a positive}} latch to hold the lever in the selected position. The latch is typically activated with a spring-loaded squeeze handle on the lever so that only one hand is needed to release the <b>latch,</b> move the <b>lever,</b> then re-engage the latch in a different position. This is an American English term; in British English, the lever is named for its function.|$|R
50|$|The {{receiver}} {{portion of}} the action features integrally milled bases to facilitate accurate and stable scope mount installation. The streamlined bolt sleeves contain a locking bar mechanism to prevent accidental rotation when the bolt {{is removed from the}} receiver. DuBiel rifles were balanced for handling ease - the result of “total concept design”. Distinctive <b>lever</b> <b>latches</b> complement the floor plates (button releases were optional). DuBiel stock designs closely parallel the bore axis to reduce the effect of recoil.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, the Swiss factory Henke {{introduced}} the buckle boot, using over-center <b>levered</b> <b>latches</b> patented by Hans Martin to replace laces. Laces spread the load across {{a number of}} eyelets in the leather, whereas the buckles concentrated the load at only a few points. To spread it back out again, the boots featured C-shaped flaps that stretched over the opening where the laces would be, to the side where the buckles were located. These had the added advantage of also helping block snow from entering {{the front of the}} boot.|$|R
50|$|The Dragoon was {{produced}} {{because of the}} problems seen with the fielded Colt Walker revolvers, namely, the Walker's large size, {{four and a half}} pounds, making it suitable only for use as a saddle-mounted revolver, the Walker's propensity for cylinders exploding on occasion when fired (due to the chambers being loaded with too much powder), and the Walker's habit of dropping the loading lever upon discharge, locking up the revolver action in the middle of combat. The Colt Dragoon Revolver had a comparatively shorter cylinder (thus preventing overloading the cylinder) and held up to 50 grains of powder, whereas the Walker had used up to 60 grains of powder. The Dragoon Revolver had a shorter barrel at 7.5 inches (some later revolvers 8 inches) as compared to the 9 in barrel on the Walker. A loading <b>lever</b> <b>latch</b> in front of the lever replaced the spring to keep the lever from dropping during recoil, thereby preventing jamming of the revolver. These variations made the Colt Dragoon Revolver 4 pounds two ounces. These changes also reduced the risks of the Colt Dragoon Revolver from exploding when fired, unlike the risk that had been demonstrated with the Walker revolvers.|$|R
40|$|Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) {{generate}} extremely {{rapid and}} forceful predatory strikes through {{a suite of}} structural modifications of their raptorial appendages. Here we examine the key morphological and kinematic components of the raptorial strike that amplify the power output of the underlying muscle contractions. Morphological analyses of joint mechanics are integrated with CT scans of mineralization patterns and kinematic analyses toward the goal of understanding the mechanical basis of linkage dynamics and strike performance. We test whether a four-bar linkage mechanism amplifies rotation in this system and find that the rotational amplification is approximately two times the input rotation, thereby amplifying the velocity and acceleration of the strike. The four-bar model is generally supported, although the observed kinematic transmission is lower than predicted by the four-bar model. The results of the morphological, kinematic and mechanical analyses suggest a multi-faceted mechanical system that integrates <b>latches,</b> linkages and <b>lever</b> arms and is powered by multiple sites of cuticular energy storage. Through reorganization of joint architecture and asymmetric distribution of mineralized cuticle, the mantis shrimp 2 ̆ 7 s raptorial appendage offers a remarkable example of how structural and mechanical modifications can yield power amplification sufficient to produce speeds and forces at the outer known limits of biological systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{latching}} {{device is}} disclosed which is lever operated sequentially to actuate {{a set of}} collet fingers to provide a radial expansion and to actuate a force mechanism to provide a compressive gripping force for attaching first and second devices to one another. The latching device includes a body member having elongated collet fingers which, in a deactuated condition, is insertable through bores on {{the first and second}} devices so that gripping terminal portions on the collet fingers are proximate {{to the end of the}} bore of the first device while a spring assembly on the body member is located proximate to the outer surface of a second device. A lever is rotatable through 90 deg to move a latching rod to sequentially actuate and expand collet fingers and to actuate the spring assembly by compressing it. During the first 30 deg of movement of the lever, the collet fingers are actuated by the latching rod to provide a radial expansion and during the last 60 deg of movement of the lever, the spring assembly acts as a force mechanism and is actuated to develop a compressive latching force on the devices. The <b>latching</b> rod and <b>lever</b> are connected by a camming mechanism. The amount of spring force in the spring assembly can be adjusted; the body member can be permanently attached by a telescoping assembly to one of the devices; and the structure can be used as a pulling device for removing annular bearings or the like from blind bores...|$|R
