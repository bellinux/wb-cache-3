5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the <b>local</b> <b>high</b> noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E

5|$|Berg's {{observation}} of <b>local</b> <b>high</b> school students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development {{of some of}} the characters. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football career is ended by a spinal injury in the pilot, was inspired by a local event. David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when this accident occurred; he was profoundly affected by Edwards' injury and how it overturned his life. Berg set up a similar incident in the pilot.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's fire balloons. These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc on American soil. <b>Local</b> <b>high</b> school girls made these fire balloons out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used to help these bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|E

40|$|The Chern-Simons {{coupling}} {{shift is}} calculated {{within the framework}} of the hybrid regularization based on a <b>local</b> <b>higher</b> covariant derivative regulator. When the Yang-Mills term is present in the theory the well-know integer-shift is obtained, but is absent, the shift value is non-integer. These results show a possibility that a non-integer-shift can be derived using a <b>local</b> <b>higher</b> covariant derivative and also suggest that the Yang-Mills term plays an important role in the integer-shift of the Chern-Simons coupling...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Greer {{served as the}} home field for the Father Ryan High School {{football}} team. Father Ryan returned to playing at Greer from 2006 through 2008, before moving to a new school athletic complex for the 2009 season. Depending on the Sounds' schedule, some of the school's home games were held at the visiting school's field (with Father Ryan designated as the home team) or at other unused <b>local</b> <b>high</b> school fields. In the football configuration, the field runs along the first base line.|$|E
5|$|Informally, {{football}} and baseball games had been played at the Maryland Agricultural College {{as early as the}} time of the Civil War. In 1890, an unofficial school team composed mostly of Maryland Agricultural students saw action against <b>local</b> <b>high</b> schools Laurel and Sandy Spring. It was not officially sanctioned by the college, but was allowed to use the school's name. In 1891, the same team played three games against Gallaudet, Hyattsville, and Sandy Spring. The victory over Sandy Spring prompted the MAC faculty to officially recognize the team.|$|E

Keef also became the CEO of his own record label, Glory Boyz Entertainment, which later developed into Glo Gang.|$|E
5|$|McLeansboro in {{particular}} experienced minor damage over an extensive area. Its <b>local</b> <b>high</b> school reported 19broken {{windows in the}} girls' gymnasium, along with cracked plaster walls. Most of the high school's classrooms sustained fractured walls. The facade of the town's First United Methodist Church was damaged, and a brick and concrete block fell off the top. Hamilton County Courthouse withstood several structural cracks, including one on the ceiling above the judge's seat. The town's residents also reported collapsing chimneys; three chimneys toppled at one home, leading to further damage.|$|E

5|$|Black convinces Birckenbeuhl {{to confess}} {{publicly}} to the hit-and-run, {{in order to}} have his son returned. Birckenbeuhl does so, but continues to maintain his innocence in private. Charlie is not returned, however; instead, a cassette is sent to Birckenbuehl by the killer, who explains that since Birckenbeuhl took a life, one must be taken from him in return. Black is able to deduce from the background noise on the tape that Charlie is being held near the <b>local</b> <b>high</b> school's swimming pool. The boy is rescued, and killer—Edward Petey—is found and arrested. However, the elder Birckenbeuhl is found hanged in his bedroom, driven to suicide by his guilt.|$|E

He joined the U.S. Army in 1942 and went to fight in World War II. Upon his return in 1945, he finished his collegiate studies at Auburn University in Alabama. After graduating, he tried out and made the roster for the Browns, a team under formation in the new AAFC. He played as a linebacker and backup center {{for most of his}} first two years before earning a spot as the starting center. He retained that position as Cleveland continued to dominate after the AAFC dissolved and the Browns were absorbed by the NFL in 1950. He retired in 1958, never having missed a game or practice in his career.|$|E
