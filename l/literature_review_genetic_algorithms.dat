We found a negative association between risk of extinction and population birth and growth rates; indicating that slower reproducing species had a greater risk of extinction.

40|$|A random-key <b>genetic</b> <b>algorithm</b> is an {{evolutionary}} metaheuristic for discrete and global optimization. Each solution is encoded as a vector of n random keys, where a random key {{is a real}} number, randomly generated, in the continuous interval [0, 1). A decoder maps each vector of random keys to a solution of the optimization prob-lem being solved and computes its cost. The algorithm starts {{with a population of}} p vectors of random keys. At each iteration, the vectors are partitioned into two sets, a smaller set of high-valued elite solutions, and the remaining non-elite solutions. All elite elements are copied, without change, to the next population. A small number of random-key vectors (the mutants) is added to the population of the next iteration. The remaining elements {{of the population of the}} next iteration are generated by combining, with the parametrized uniform crossover of Spears and DeJong [58], pairs of solutions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>review</b> of <b>Genetic</b> <b>Algorithms</b> (GAs) and its applications {{within the field}} of Chemical Engineering. The primary applications of GAs in Chemical Engineering date back to the 1970 s, and within the last decades, they have been more and more often used to solve various complex problems, even when the objective functions don't possess properties like continuity, differentiability and so on. These algorithms manipulate and maintain a set or population of solutions and implement a “survival of the fittest ” strategy in their search for better solutions. GAs are very helpful for the optimization and variable selection in modeling and calibration due to the strong effect of the relationship between presence/absence of variables in a calibration model and the prediction ability of the model itself. This review is an outline of the concept of GA and in fact, it does not present all applications of <b>Genetic</b> <b>Algorithms</b> to Chemical Engineering problems; its goal is to rather point out to the researchers, the important fields of application of GAs along with providing a list of references on the topic...|$|R

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{estimated}} that approximately 80 % of all cancers {{are related to}} environmental factors. Individual cancer susceptibility can {{be the result of}} several host factors, including differences in metabolism, DNA repair, altered expression of tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes, and nutritional status. Xenobiotic metabolism is the principal mechanism for maintaining homeostasis during the body's exposure to xenobiotics. The balance of xenobiotic absorption and elimination rates in metabolism can be important in the prevention of DNA damage by chemical carcinogens. Thus the ability to metabolize and eliminate xenobiotics can be considered one of the body's first protective mechanisms. Variability in individual metabolism has been related to the enzymatic polymorphisms involved in activation and detoxification of chemical carcinogens.

40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken to provide tools {{to aid in}} the design and optimisation of offshore mooring systems. The tools present a set of feasible solutions with different performance characteristics. With an increased reliance on the exploitation of the reserves of hydrocarbon on marginal offshore areas, both in Australia and around the world, mooring mobile vessels becomes a more challenging task. The latest evolutionary optimisation techniques offer new prospects for designing and analysing moorings, but to select an appropriate method of optimisation, both the classical deterministic search and evolutionary optimisation methods are <b>reviewed.</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>Algorithms</b> (GAs) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) have been investigated in terms of their capability, strengths, and limitations. The GA and PSO have been benchmarked against each other, and PSO has been found to more efficient in the engineering applications considered. Particle swarm optimisation was selected and implemented in the evolutionary mooring design computer software coded by the author. This software tool interfaces with the offshore industry commercial package OrcaFlex, which supplies results from model simulations. A case study of a mooring design is presented to demonstrate the ability of the optimisation tool, while the results provide potential improvements in mooring design solutions. A performance based multi-objectives particle swarm optimisation (MOPSO) was developed where the multiple constraints can confidently be switched to problems with multiple objectives. Meanwhile, the results from the mooring optimisation obtained from MOPSO were compared with PSO, and showed that highly competing constraints leads the PSO search in an unhealthy manner. Alternatively, the performance based MOPSO design produces a set of solutions with a different performance which can be further processed and selected by offshore engineers. MOPSO offers greater flexibility and computational efficiency to optimise the final solutions...|$|R

Through {{the use of the}} cost benefit operator, it is possible to dynamically constrain the search of the base level <b>genetic</b> <b>algorithm,</b> to suit the user’s requirements. Initially we <b>review</b> meta-evolutionary (multi-level <b>genetic</b> <b>algorithm)</b> approaches. We note that the current literature has abundant studies on meta-evolutionary GAs. However these approaches have not identified an efficient approach to termination of base GA search or a means to balance practical consideration such as quality of solution and the expense of computation. Our Quality time tradeoff operator (QTT) is user defined, and acts as a base level termination operator and also provides a fitness value for the meta-level GA. In this manner the amount of computation time spent on less encouraging configurations can be specified by the user. Our approach has been applied to a computationally intensive test problem which evaluates a large set of configuration settings for the base GAs.

Whether genetic risk factors have an explanatory role poses an interesting question, however. Thus, we conducted a systematic <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> regarding <b>genetic</b> predisposition to AKI or outcome of AKI patients.

We summarized the findings and scored the quality of articles. Results The articles were quite heterogeneous and of moderate quality (mean 6. 4 of 10).

40|$|Both {{the hormones}} of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the {{endogenous}} opioid system are activated {{in response to}} stress as well as after alcohol consumption, supporting the hypothesis that stress can influence both alcohol consumption and craving for alcohol. Activation of the HPA axis by stress or alcohol results {{in the production of}} glucocorticoid hormones, such as cortisol. Those hormones, in turn, are important for the release of the brain chemical dopamine in certain brain areas that are associated with the rewarding and reinforcing effects of alcohol and other drugs. Alcohol-induced release of certain endogenous opioids similarly results in dopamine release in those brain regions. Through this mechanism, both the HPA axis and the endogenous opioid system may influence alcohol consumption. Consequently, genetically determined differences in the activities of the HPA axis and endogenous opioid system may help determine a person’s alcohol consumption level and vulnerability to alcoholism.
