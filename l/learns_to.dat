40|$|Research Report: The {{research}} {{reported here}} investigates variation in first year university students’early experiences of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program, {{with a particular}} focus on revealingdifferences in how they go about <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program. A phenomenographic researchapproach was used to reveal variation {{in relation to the}} act of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with students who had either completed,or were recently completing a university level introductory programming subject. Theanalysis process revealed five different ways in which students go about learning toprogram in introductory university level units. These are captured in categories ofdescription which capture the critical dimensions of what students learn as well ashow they go about learning. Students may go about <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program by: • Following – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as ‘getting through’ the unit. • Coding – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> code • Understanding and integrating – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> write a program through understanding and integrating concepts • Problem solving – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> {{do what it takes to}} solve a problem • Participating or enculturation – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as discovering what it means to become a programmer The mapping of the variation constitutes a framework within which one aspect of theteaching and learning of introductory programming, how students go about it, may beunderstood.

5|$|At first, Raziel can jump, glide {{using his}} torn wings, move blocks, {{and pick up}} and throw objects and enemies. Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can {{alternatively}} use weapons such as rocks, torches, spears and staffs, and the Soul Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, but can return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm and climb walls in the material realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and <b>learns</b> <b>to</b> swim.|$|E
5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually {{realize that there is}} a price to be paid for his actions, as he <b>learns</b> <b>to</b> discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} empirical exploration of using reinforcement <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> use simple forms of working memory. <b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> use memory involves <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> behave in the environment while simultaneously <b>learning</b> when <b>to</b> select internal actions that control how knowledge persists in memory and <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> use that information stored in memory to make decisions. We focus on two different models of memory: bit memory and gated memory. Bit memory is inspired by prior reinforcement learning literature and stores abstract values, which an agent can <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> associate with task history. Gated memory is inspired by human working memory and stores perceptually grounded symbols. Our goal is to determine computational bounds on the tractability of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> use these memories. We conduct a comprehensive empirical exploration {{of the dynamics of}} <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> use memory models by modifying a simple partially observable task, TMaze, along specific dimensions: length of temporal delay, number of dependent decisions, number of distinct symbols, quantity of concurrent knowledge, and availability of second-order knowledge. We find that <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> use gated memory is significantly more tractable than <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> use bit memory because it stores perceptually grounded symbols in memory. We further find that learning performance scales more favorably along temporal delay, distinct symbols, and concurrent knowledge when <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> use gated memory than along other dimensions. We also identify situations in which agents fail <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> use gated memory optimally which involve repeated identical observations which result in no unambiguous trajectories through the underlying task and memory state space...|$|R
