40|$|Tropical shrimp {{aquaculture}} is in a disease-induced crisis of lost production. The {{response to this}} crisis currently focuses on microbiology and pathology, quarantine, and transboundary transfer of shrimp. The crisis also involves an interaction between shrimp genetics and various human interests including protection of intellectual property. Breeders of high-quality strains generally employ (and are encouraged to employ) some form of breeder lock that generates inbreeding when broodstocks are copied. Smaller hatcheries sell these copied, inbred shrimp to farmers, who thereby {{increase the likelihood of}} losing their crops to disease. The joint behavior of breeders, hatcheries and farmers causes inbreeding to accumulate in tropical regions. The depressive effect of inbreeding on disease resistance is exceptionally strong in shrimp, as shown in a re-analysis of published field and experimental data. Inbreeding increases the severity and frequency of disease through a variety of mechanisms. We have relatively few, marker-based estimates of accumulated inbreeding in any non-pedigreed {{shrimp aquaculture}} system. Simulation shows, however, that <b>locked</b> <b>post</b> larvae (PLs) can be distinguished from copies in broodstocks and farm ponds, given appropriate analysis of genetic markers. Culture of stocks certified to be free of specified pathogens (specific pathogen free or SPF stocks) is strongly recommended and only SPF stocks can now be legally imported into most jurisdictions. These recommendations are appropriate, beneficial and necessary. But insofar as they increase the commercial value of proprietary genetic strains, such regulations may also increase the likelihood of copying, and thus inbreeding at farm level and ever-increasing susceptibility to disease and climate stress (Doyle, 2014 a). The intellectual property value of disease-resistant strains will be extremely high and intellectual property rights are fundamental to science-based economic innovation. Breeders will, and must, continue to protect their genetic improvement programs with genetic locks, especially in regions where judicial sanctions are ineffective. The regulatory objective should be to encourage biosecurity and genetic progress while discouraging copying and consequent inbreeding. The current consensus that inbreeding is unimportant may therefore be out of date. Inbreeding may be amplifying the severity of diseases (including the major current threats: white spot syndrome virus or WSSV, infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus or IHHNV and early mortality syndrome or EMS (acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease or AHPND). Continuing to ignore the interaction between inbreeding and disease may become a fatal error for tropical shrimp aquaculture...|$|R

40|$|The visual {{mismatch}} negativity (vMMN) {{response is}} typically examined by subtracting the average {{response to a}} deviant stimulus from {{the response to the}} standard. This approach, however, can omit a critical element of the neural response, i. e. the non-phase-locked (‘induced’) oscillatory activity. Recent investigations of the oscillatory characteristics of the auditory mismatch negativity (aMMN) identified a crucial role for theta phase locking and power. Oscillatory characteristics of the vMMN from 39 healthy young adults were investigated in order to establish whether theta phase locking plays a similar role in the vMMN response. We explored changes in phase <b>locking,</b> overall <b>post</b> stimulus spectral power as well as non-phase-locked spectral power compared to baseline (- 300 - 0 ms). These were calculated in the frequency range of 4 - 50 Hz and analysed using a non-parametric cluster based analysis. vMMN was found intermittently in a broad time interval 133 - 584 ms post-stimulus and was associated with an early increase in theta phase locking (75 - 175 ms post stimulus) that was not accompanied by an increase in theta power. Theta phase locking {{in the absence of an}} increase in theta power has been associated with the distribution and flow of information between spatially disparate neural locations. Additionally, in the 450 - 600 ms post-stimulus interval, deviant stimuli yielded a stronger decrease in non-phase-locked alpha power than standard stimuli, potentially reflecting a shift in attentional resources following the detection of change. The examination of oscillatory activity is crucial to the comprehensive analysis of a neural response to a stimulus, and when combined with evoked potentials (EPs) provide a more complete picture of neurocognitive processing...|$|R
5000|$|The male captives were {{normally}} chained {{together in}} pairs to save space; right leg {{to the next}} man's left leg — while {{the women and children}} may have had somewhat more room. The chains or hand and leg cuffs were known as bilboes, which were among the many tools of the slave trade, and which were always in short supply. Bilboes were mainly used on men, and they consisted of two iron shackles <b>locked</b> on a <b>post</b> and were usually fastened around the ankles of two men. At best, captives were fed beans, corn, yams, rice, and palm oil. Slaves were fed one meal a day with water, if at all. When food was scarce, slaveholders would get priority over the slaves. Sometimes captives were allowed to move around during the day, but many ships kept the shackles on throughout the arduous journey. Aboard certain French ships, slaves were brought on deck to periodically receive fresh air. While female slaves were typically permitted to be on deck more frequently, male slaves would be watched closely to prevent revolt when above deck.|$|R
5000|$|Many people {{misunderstand}} [...] "Flash Trading" [...] {{and believe}} it to be a major concern.
