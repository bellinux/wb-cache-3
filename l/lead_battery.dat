50|$|Type 032 is {{the armed}} {{version of the}} midget {{submarine}} series. Unlike the <b>lead</b> <b>battery</b> powered prototype Type 032-1, Type 032 was to be powered by silver-zinc batteries and a water cooled diesel engines. The high performance silver-zinc battery is much more efficient than the <b>lead</b> <b>battery</b> used on the prototype and thus far less numbers of batteries would be needed, and the space saved {{would be used for}} two torpedoes and the diesel engine.|$|E
50|$|Zinc battery {{terminals}} are an environmentally friendly alternative to <b>lead</b> <b>battery</b> terminals.

5000|$|A 2003 {{report by}} the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council to the EPA noted that: [...] "Abandonment of {{hazardous}} wastes has been a serious problem because of the apparent ease with which responsible parties {{have been able to}} avoid enforcement actions by crossing the border. While cooperation between U.S. and Mexican enforcement authorities should theoretically prevent such occurrences, complaints about abandoned or unremediated sites and the failure to hold the responsible parties accountable have been persistent."

50|$|The Electrobat was {{the first}} {{successful}} electric automobile. It was designed and built in 1894 by mechanical engineer Henry G. Morris and chemist Pedro G. Salom in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Both had backgrounds in battery streetcars and, as the battery streetcar business was fading, they teamed up to make battery road vehicles. Their effort was patented on August 31, 1894. Built like a small version of a battery streetcar, it was a slow, heavy, impractical vehicle with steel tires to support the 1,600 pound immense weight of its large <b>lead</b> <b>battery.</b> It entered production in 1895. In 1896, Morris and Salom founded the Morris & Salom Electric Carriage and Wagon Company, evidently the first electric car company in America.|$|E
50|$|Deep-cycle {{lead-acid}} batteries generally {{fall into}} two distinct categories; flooded (FLA) and valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA), with the VRLA type further subdivided into two types, Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) and Gel. The reinforcement of absorbed glass mat separators helps to reduce damage caused by spilling and jolting vibrations. Further, flooded deep-cycle batteries {{can be divided into}} subcategories of Tubular-plated Opzs or flat plated. The difference generally affects the cycle life and performance of the cell. The structural difference between deep-cycle batteries and cranking batteries is in the <b>lead</b> <b>battery</b> plates. Deep cycle battery plates have thicker active plates, with higher-density active paste material and thicker separators. Alloys used for the plates in a deep cycle battery may contain more antimony than that of starting batteries. The thicker battery plates resist corrosion through extended charge and discharge cycles.|$|E

50|$|Back {{in control}} of Auto-liter, Miniger quickly {{expanded}} into other automotive product lines, including electric starters, ignition systems, and batteries. Calling his company Electric Auto-lite, in 1927 Miniger gained a controlling interest in the National <b>Lead</b> <b>Battery</b> Company, Prest-O-Lite Battery Company, and Prest-O-Lite, Ltd. (located in Toronto, Canada). Battery manufacturing plants were established in seven U.S. states and in Canada. A foreign division was established and batteries manufactured in six overseas locations. Miniger bought out another headlamp company in 1934 and formed the Brown Lamp Division in Cincinnati, Ohio. The same year, he purchased outright the Starting and Lighting Division of the American Bosch Magneto Company. Late in 1934, Electric Auto-lite merged with Moto-Meter Gauge and Equipment Company and expanded into industrial gauges and thermometers, molded plastic parts, speedometers, oil pressure gauges, gasoline gauges, heat indicators and ammeters.|$|E
50|$|The 30К6Е {{control system}} can be {{integrated}} with the S-400 Triumph 98ZH6E system; the S-300PMU2 (through the 83М6Е2 control system); the S-300PMU1 (through the 83М6Е control system); the Tor-M1 through the Ranzhir-M battery-command post; the Pantsir-S1 through the <b>lead</b> <b>battery</b> vehicle. The Protivnik-GE and Gamma-DE radars, integrated with the 92H6E radar system, enables communication between each battery with Baikal-E senior command posts and similar types; nearby 30К6Е, 83М6Е and 83М6Е2 administration systems; the Polyana-D4М1 command post; fighter-aircraft command post, and mobile long-range radars. The Nebo-M system is designed to hunt the F-35 joint-strike fighter. The system's VHF component provides sector search and tracking, with the X- and L-band components providing fine-tracking capability. Good placement of the radars relative to the threat axis enables the L- and X-band components to illuminate the incoming target from angles where the target RCS is sub-optimal. Attempts to jam the Nebo-M would be problematic, since all the radars have passive angle track capability against jammers; jamming permits passive triangulation of the target using three angle-track outputs. The RLM-S and RLM-D have better elevation-tracking accuracy than the RLM-M, and the Nebo M should be capable of producing high-quality tracks suitable for mid-course guidance of modern surface-to-air missiles and trajectory guidance of legacy SAMs.|$|E
50|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, Georges Irat {{was among the first}} auto-makers to focus on electric cars, there being diminishing quantities of oil based motor-fuel available for civilian use, especially after the German invasion in May/June 1940. An all-new electric car was designed during Summer 1940 and developed rapidly in order to be ready for public launch at the Lyon Fair during the autumn of 1941. The little car was designed to be as light-weight as possible and the electric motor had a number of ingenious features. The vehicle had a top speed of 30-35 km/h (roughly 20 mph) and the <b>lead</b> <b>battery</b> provided for a range of 90-100 kilometres (nearly 60 miles) between charges. Both a small 2-seater cabriolet and a 2-seater mini-van were produced, although most of the rear portion of the car and indeed of the van was permanently occupied by the electric motor and batteries. The first few cars were produced for use by Georges Irat employees, but small batches of the cars were built for sale via an exclusive deal with a car dealer on the Rue de Passy on the western side of central Paris. After the end of 1942 significant levels of auto-production were no longer possible due to the non-availability of materials and labour for civilian production. Production of electric cars did not restart when peace returned in 1945.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} use of lead dioxide is as the cathode of <b>lead</b> acid <b>batteries.</b> Its utility {{arises from the}} anomalous metallic conductivity of PbO2.

Due to the acid bath the paper sits in, the fiber length is reduced so far that it cannot be rewoven.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{blood lead}} {{concentrations}} {{of workers in}} <b>lead</b> <b>battery</b> factories are more than 4 times {{higher than those of}} the general population in Taiwan. Therefore, efforts are needed to reduce lead exposure in this high-risk population. A health promotion program on personal habits that reduce lead exposure has been carried out in a <b>lead</b> <b>battery</b> factory since 1991. This study investigated the longitudinal relationship of workers ’ blood lead concentra-tions and personal hygiene habits from 1991 through 1997. Methods: In each of the 7 years of the study, occupational physicians questioned workers regarding nine personal hygiene items, personal information, and medical history before their annual health examination. The relationship between blood lead concentrations and personal hygiene habits was analyzed by longitudinal multiple regression in a mixed effect model with adjustment for potential confounders. In addition, the risk ratio of a blood lead concentration exceeding 40 µg/dL in men and 30 µg/dL in women (the action levels set by the Department of Health, Taiwan) was estimated by generalized estimating equations. Results: Blood lead levels decreased significantly in the first 5 years of the study. The personal habits most closely related to blood lead concentrations were smoking at work site...|$|E
