25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E

500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{begins with}} quivering reverb and a plaintively plucked guitar setting a somber mood for about fifteen {{seconds before the}} beats begin {{alongside}} Beyoncé's voice. Her vocals set a hushed and morbid tone on the song as she bring doses of edge and grit, singing: [...] "I wanna <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> footprints on the sands of time / Know {{there was something that}} meant something that I left behind / When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets / I'll leave something to remember, So they won't forget". She further sings throughout the song, [...] "The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leaved that I made a difference". Watery synths shimmer in the background before Beyoncé adopts an authoritative tone to chant the chorus lines: [...] "I was here / I lived, I loved / I was here / I did, I've done / Everything that I wanted / And it was more than I thought it would be / I will <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> mark so everyone will know / I was here".|$|E

A more disorganized use of assonance appears in line 31, [...] "A third time pass'd they by, and, passing, turn'd", {{in which the}} pairs third/turn'd, time/by, and pass'd/passing share vowel sounds. The first line exemplifies the poem's consistent iambic pentameter scansion: ...|$|E

500|$|Willkie {{never had}} any doubt that Roosevelt would run for a third term, and that his route to the White House {{would have to be}} through the Republican Party. [...] In late 1939 he changed his {{registration}} from Democratic to Republican, and early in 1940 announced that he would accept the Republican nomination if it were offered to him. [...] He blamed his allegiance shift on the Roosevelt policies that he deemed anti-business. He had voted for Landon in 1936, he said, and he felt that the Democrats no longer represented the values he advocated. [...] As he later characterized it, [...] "I did not <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> party. [...] My party left me." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} Abbot Pescall's tenure, in 1530, that Cardinal Thomas Wolsey visited the abbey. Wolsey was an {{influential}} {{minister in the}} government of King Henry VIII. He fell from favour after failing to secure papal permission for Henry to divorce his wife Katherine of Aragon, and on 4 November 1530 was arrested for treason. While en route from Yorkshire to London, where Wolsey would be held prisoner, he fell ill. The journey took Wolsey through Leicester, and he arrived at the abbey on 26 November, declaring: [...] "Father abbott, I ame come hether to <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> bones among you". Wolsey died on 30 November and the public were allowed to view his remains before he was interred within the abbey's church.|$|E

500|$|As Grant moved south against Lee in the Overland Campaign, Union Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler {{launched}} the surprise Bermuda Hundred Campaign with landings up the James River. Beauregard successfully lobbied with Jefferson Davis's military adviser, Braxton Bragg, to prevent significant units of his small force from being transferred north of Richmond {{to the aid}} of Lee. His timely action, coupled with the military incompetence of Butler, bottled up the Union army, nullifying its threat to Petersburg and Lee's supply line. Now that this sector was stable, pressure began to rise to transfer troops from Beauregard's front to Lee's. Beauregard did send a division (Maj. Gen. Robert Hoke's) to Lee for the Battle of Cold Harbor, but Lee urgently wanted more and took the step of offering Beauregard command of {{the right wing of the}} Army of Northern Virginia for his cooperation. Beauregard replied in a passive–aggressive manner, [...] "I am willing to do anything for our success, but cannot <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> Department without orders of War Department." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Infinity" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad {{that lasts}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes. Carey belts the lines, [...] "Close the door, lose the key, <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> heart {{on the mat}} for me. I was yours eternally, there's an end to infinity", while the songs hook consists of the singer [...] "breathily cooing" [...] the title repeatedly in a descending vocal run. Accompanied by an orchestral synth, string and brass instrumental, Alex Camp of Slant Magazine described [...] "Infinity" [...] as a [...] "welcome throwback to Mariah's early ballads". Andrew Unterberger of Spin likened the intro {{to the work of}} Just Blaze, and noted that she finishes the song with a whistle note. According to its lyrics, Carey is putting herself first in order to emancipate herself. As described by Wass, [...] "Infinity" [...] is [...] "distinctly unromantic" [...] and [...] "a kiss-off anthem", writing that it sits somewhere in between two of Carey's previous singles, [...] "Obsessed" [...] (2009) and [...] "You're Mine (Eternal)" [...] (2014).|$|E
500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and I can feel the end coming. That's why I'm taking money now. I've got nothing to <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> family but the money I can make from films. Nothing is beneath me if it pays well. I've earned the right to damn well grab whatever I can in the time I've got left." ...|$|E

500|$|Bowlby's {{work was}} misinterpreted {{to mean that}} any {{separation}} from the natural mother, any experience of institutional care or a multiplicity of [...] "mothers" [...] necessarily resulted in severe emotional deprivation and sometimes, that all children undergoing such experiences would develop into [...] "affectionless children". As a consequence it was claimed that only 24-hour care by the same person (the mother) was good enough, day care and nurseries were not good enough and mothers should not go out to work. The WHO advised that day nurseries and creches could have a serious and permanent deleterious effect. Such strictures suited the policies of governments concerned about finding employment for returned and returning servicemen after World War II. In fact, although Bowlby was of the view that proper care could not be provided [...] "by roster", he was also of the view that babies should be accustomed to regular periods of care by another and {{that the key to}} alternative care for working mothers was that it should be regular and continuous. He addressed this point in a 1958 publication called Can I <b>Leave</b> <b>My</b> Baby?. Ainsworth in the WHO 1962 publication also attempted to address this misapprehension by pointing out that the requirement for continuity of care did not imply an exclusive mother–child pair relationship.|$|E
500|$|Madonna was {{released}} in hardback in the United States in November 2001. It debuted at position 15 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and reached eight the next week, but was present there for only two weeks. Madonna was still livid that Morton wrote the book without her permission, even saying [...] "It's not a well-written book. We all know he wrote it for financial gain and the truth {{had little to do}} with it", after the book {{was released}}. With Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 1, she added that [...] " [...] really went through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, and I ended up writing him a letter saying, 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't want to have anything to do with it – and please <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> friends alone'." [...] The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about – that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added.|$|E
500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future for myself and doing what was right. The ghetto makes you think. The world is ours. I used to think I couldn't <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> projects. I used to think if I left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice or I would be just a dead slave or something. The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E

500|$|Following Red 2, Zeta-Jones {{took another}} sabbatical from acting, saying: [...] "If I'm going to <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> family {{for any length}} of time it had better be for a role that I haven't played before, [...] I would prefer to stay at home". She found the role {{opposite}} Bill Nighy and Toby Jones in the British war comedy film Dad's Army (2016), based on the television sitcom of the same name. She was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a British Home Guard platoon based in Walmington-on-Sea. Catherine Bray of Variety found the film to be an [...] "amiable but creaky resurrection" [...] of the popular sitcom, and thought that while Zeta-Jones [...] "hits the required single note with some spirit" [...] she was [...] "generally underused" [...] in it. Zeta-Jones returned to television the following year by portraying the actress Olivia de Havilland in the first season of Ryan Murphy's anthology drama series Feud, subtitled Bette and Joan, about the rivalry between the actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis (played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, respectively). Dominic Patten of Deadline.com found Zeta-Jones to be [...] "wonderfully cast" [...] and Sonia Saraiya of Variety praised her for providing [...] "the best turn in the show". Displeased with an [...] "unauthorized use of her name and identity" [...] in the series, de Havilland, at 101 years old, sued the network and producers of Feud for invasion of privacy and other personality rights.|$|E
500|$|In his will, dated 12 December 1589, Walsingham {{complained of}} [...] "the greatness of my debts {{and the mean}} state [...] shall <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> wife and heirs in", but the true state of his {{finances}} is unclear. He received grants of land from the Queen, grants for the export of cloth and leases of customs in the northern and western ports. His primary residences, apart from the court, were in Seething Lane by the Tower of London (now {{the site of a}} Victorian office building called Walsingham House), at Barn Elms in Surrey and at Odiham in Hampshire. Nothing remains of any of his houses. He spent much of his own money on espionage {{in the service of the}} Queen and the Protestant cause. In 1586, he funded a lectureship in theology at Oxford University for the Puritan John Rainolds. He had underwritten the debts of his son-in-law, Sir Philip Sidney, had pursued the Sidney estate for recompense unsuccessfully and had carried out major land transactions in his later years. After his death, his friends reflected that poor bookkeeping had left him further in the Crown's debt than was fair. In 1611, the Crown's debts to him were calculated at over £48,000, but his debts to the Crown were calculated at over £43,000 and a judge, Sir Julius Caesar, ordered both sets of debts cancelled quid pro quo. Walsingham's surviving daughter Frances received a £300 annuity, and married the Earl of Essex. Ursula, Lady Walsingham, continued to live at Barn Elms with a staff of servants until her death in 1602.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} winter of 1867, Stowe {{followed}} {{her son to}} Florida, finding that the warmer weather allowed her {{to spend more time}} on two novels she was writing. Her first weeks in Orange Park utterly transformed her and she became enchanted with Florida at once, writing that she felt she had sprouted wings and become [...] "young & frisky". She accompanied her son one day to collect the mail, which was deposited in Mandarin, about [...] across the St. Johns River. They rowed to the eastern shore and Stowe {{fell in love with a}} cottage in Mandarin, attached to an orange grove. Stowe's transformation in Florida was rooted in her identification and familiarity with Puritan New England: industry and thrift in a climate where cold sharpened one's senses and values. The laid-back attitude of the people and warmth of the Southern climate were seductive. She at first attempted to persuade her brother Charles to purchase the land in Mandarin, writing to him and asking [...] "How do you think New England theology would have fared had been landed here instead of Plymouth Rock?" [...] She wrote about the land and climate intoxicating her and pondered the effect it might have had on literature when she posed an idea to her publisher: [...] "I hate to <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> calm isle of Patmos—where the world is not and I have such quiet long hours for writing. [...] Emerson could insulate himself here and keep his electricity. [...] Hawthorne ought to have lived in an orange grove in Florida." ...|$|E
