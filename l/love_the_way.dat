[...] Robert Christgau alleged that, along with [...] "Yellow", the song {{was one of only}} two good ones on all of Parachutes.

[...] David DeVoe of Hybridmagazine.com wrote: [...] "It is a wonderful song that echoes the promise of what is to come {{on the rest of the}} record.

Initially, Case believed she would only be playing the role for a maximum of six months. Of her casting, she stated: [...] "Not only is this my third soap, but I'm also the third actress {{to play the role of}} Sharon Collins. So, if three times is the charm, this should be it." [...] The actress wanted to [...] "breathe new life" [...] into the role and make it her own. In 2003, Case was off-screen from February 17 to May 1, during contract negotiations. These were resolved that April, when she signed a new contract to remain on the show for another four years, until 2007. Case revealed that while she considered leaving the series, [...] "I would not have been negotiating if I did not want to come back. I've always had a great story to play.

500|$|In early 2007, it was {{reported}} that Madonna was recording songs with American singer Justin Timberlake for her upcoming eighth studio album.

On July 2007, a demo of the song, titled [...] "Candy Store", leaked online, but was quickly removed following copyright issues. [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was the first song Madonna and Williams worked on together. The latter recalled, [...] "we were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] Madonna stated during an interview with Q magazine that [...] "Candy Shop", along with album track [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You", was among her favorite songs, [...] "I love 'Candy Shop' cos it's cheeky and fun, and I feel it sort of represents the sassy side of me; the fun, sassy side of me.

500|$|Pete Rock said of {{his studio}} {{experience}} with West, [...] "He's definitely hip-hop, his roots, I was testing him on joints...He takes it to another level which is dope. He had these musicians and this song, they played around my little raggedy beat and made it real. I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he works — he goes from one room, writing rhymes then goes to another beat and goes to another room and does something else — I love what he's done". Rapper Pusha T characterized the album as [...] "a collage of sounds" [...] and found West's methods unorthodox when recording, saying that [...] "We could easily be working on one song, thinking we're in a mode, and he'll hear a sound from someone like [...] Jeff Bhasker and immediately turn his whole attention to that sound and go through his mental Rolodex to where that sound belongs on his album, and then it goes straight to that song, immediately". DJ Premier said of the production in comparison to West's previous work, [...] "Well, first of all, {{if you look at}} all of Kanye West's output, he actually did a lot to bring back sampling and make it cool again, even though he's more of a mainstream artist...but his new album is strictly hard beats and rhyme. He's totally done with electro. You're gonna be surprised what you hear".|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to those artists who state that Bush has been a direct influence on their own careers, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for her work including Annie Lennox, Björk, Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine, Little Boots, Dido, Sky Ferreira, St. Vincent, Lily Allen, Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons, Big Boi of OutKast, Tupac Shakur, Steven Wilson, Steve Rothery of Marillion, and André Matos. Courtney Love of Hole mentioned Bush among other artists {{as one of her}} favourites as a teenager. Tricky wrote an article about The Kick Inside, saying: [...] "Her music has always sounded like dreamland to me.... I don't believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible". Suede front-man Brett Anderson stated about Hounds Of Love: [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it's a record of two halves, and the second half is a concept record about fear of drowning. It's an amazing record to listen to really late at night, unsettling and really jarring". John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, declared her work to be [...] "beauty beyond belief". Rotten once wrote a song for her, titled [...] "Bird in Hand" [...] (about exploitation of parrots) that Bush rejected. Bush was one of the singers who Prince thanked in the liner notes of 1991's Diamonds and Pearls.

500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} {{primarily}} filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, {{which is the}} headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are genuine medical supplies, including the MRI machine. Prior to being cast, Sara Ramirez was seen by ABC executives, in her Broadway performance of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, which ultimately led in her choosing Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", a statement she deemed rare. Ramirez's character was given recurring status in the second season, having been conceived as a love interest for George O'Malley. At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Grey's relationship. When asked of this, Torres said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] Discussing Izzie Stevens' relationship with Alex Karev, Katherine Heigl described her character as naive enough to believe she can save him, assessing that: [...] "Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her, she forgave him and gave him another chance.

[...] Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny, regarded by her as [...] "undeniably handsome and totally charming". Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Izzie lights up when she’s around him.

[...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn't know this was coming." ...|$|E
