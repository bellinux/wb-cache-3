40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the European Union (EU) has had a strong impact on the way public organisations {{introduce}} market philosophies in their policies. The EU directives on procurement, the battles against cartels, the globalisation and harmonisation of markets, all lead to extra attention to the procurement practice of public agencies. This paper focuses on the procurement practice {{of one of these}} public organisations, the municipalities in the Netherlands. Statistical data suggest that Dutch municipalities prefer <b>limited</b> <b>tendering</b> procedures, and seem to avoid public tender procedures. This paper reports on research into the reasons for such preference. Analysis of municipalities' procurement and tendering practice uncovered an intricate mechanism for maintaining project control. Municipalities implicitly use the prospect of future assignments to restrain contractors' misbehaviours. By doing so municipalities reduce uncertainties and risks. Contractors' demeanour becomes more flexible, cooperative and quality orientated because of this mechanism. Through the use of this mechanism the municipality-contractor relationship has developed to a kind of co-makership relation. This phenomenon is categorically overlooked in the standard market paradigms. Bending the procurement and tendering practice towards more public tendering is expected to make project control more troublesome...|$|E

500|$|The {{abolition}} of the half dime, still circulating in the Far West, led to shortages of small change there. Congress tried to address this with the unpopular twenty-cent piece, which was struck for circulation only in 1875 and 1876 and {{was rejected by the}} public for its similarity to the quarter dollar. The Western United States was not fully supplied with small change until the Mint began striking cents there in 1908 and five-cent nickels in 1912. The Trade dollar, struck principally to compete with Mexican dollars in the Far East trade, failed to gain full acceptance in the Orient.

50|$|The Campanile is a 120-foot bell tower, {{which was}} built in the 1920s to commemorate the 1820 Dutch/French Settlers who became the Afrikaans people of South Africa. The first {{proposal}} for a memorial tower to commemorate the landing of the British Settlers of 1820, was made in 1904 by the Reverend Alfred E Hall, a minister of the Queen Street Baptist Church. On 9 April 1921, the foundation stone of the Campanile was laid by H R H Prince Arthur of Connaught, governor of the Union of South Africa. On 10 March 1922, the design for the Campanile was approved and the contract for building the structure was subsequently awarded on 18 March 1922 to a local firm of builders, Harris and Harrower <b>Limited.</b> The <b>tender</b> was worth £6 150. It took approximately 18 months to complete the campanile. The dressed stone, used to construct the base, was taken from some of the oldest buildings in the city and the arched main doorway was built of stone quarried in Grahamstown. The tower is made of brick and reinforced with concrete. Each brick went through a selective test before being used. The structure, both base and belfry, is made of local brick faced with smooth, red Grahamstown bricks. The roof tiles were also obtained from Grahamstown.|$|R

As the silver coins had a legal <b>tender</b> <b>limit</b> of $5, a glut arose of the lightweight silver coins on the market in the late 1850s.

The value of these pieces was larger than that of all other silver coins struck by the mints in 1852. The chaotic state of commerce, with no circulating federal coin valued between the three-cent piece and gold dollar, {{was a source of}} concern, and mint officials and congressmen corresponded in 1852 concerning a reduction in weight of silver coins such as the half dime and half dollar. Congress at last responded by laws passed on February 21, 1853 and March 3, 1853. [...] These reduced the weight of all silver coins except for the silver dollar. [...] The three-cent piece had its weight reduced from [...]8 grams to [...]75, but its fineness increased to [...]900.
