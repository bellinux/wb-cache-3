The lake volume increased by 1.38 million m^ 3 between 17 March and 18 April and the lake water temperature culminated to 59  ^∘C {{a week after the}} eruption. Such lake volume and temperature increases are highly unusual; the lake volume typically increasing by 3 million m^ 3 during the entire rainy season and the <b>lake</b> <b>temperature</b> rarely exceeding 50  ^∘C (Caudron et al. 2015 a).

Selected thermal remote-sensing LSWT observations provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) sensors onboard the Terra/Aqua and ENVISAT satellites, respectively, were included into the assimilation. The domain of our experiments, which focussed on two winters (2010 – 2011 and 2011 – 2012), covered northern Europe. Validation of the resulting objective analyses against independent observations demonstrated that the description of the lake surface state can be improved by the introduction of space-borne LSWT observations, compared to the result of pure prognostic parameterisations or assimilation of the available limited number of in-situ <b>lake</b> <b>temperature</b> observations. Further development of the data assimilation methods and solving of several practical issues are necessary in order to fully benefit from the space-borne observations of lake surface state for the improvement of the operational weather forecast.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a procedure}} that was developed to delineate potential fishing grounds in Lake Malawi using data on chlorophyll-a concentration derived from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/AQUA) in combination with <b>lake</b> surface <b>temperature</b> (LST) data obtained from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and MODIS/Terra satellite sensors. The paper draws from findings of studies [1, 2] on development of algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a and <b>lake</b> surface <b>temperature</b> in <b>Lake</b> Malawi from satellite imagery, respectively. To estimate chlorophyll concentration (a proxy for phytoplankton) in Lake Malawi using data from MODIS satellite imagery, in situ measurements of chlorophyll concentration were conducted at three selected sampling stations over the southeastern arm of Lake Malawi concurrent with satellite image acquisitions. These were regressed on chlorophyll-a concentration values obtained from Ocean Color (MODIS/AQUA) Data using SeaWIFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) software. From this, an equation for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration in Lake Malawi from MODIS satellite imagery was developed and used for mapping the spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration in the lake. Since Lake Malawi is an oligotrophic lake, with an average value of chlorophyll concentration of 1 μg/L, areas in the lake with relatively high chlorophyll-a concentration were identified as potential locations {{for the development of}} the fishery industry. Estimation of <b>lake</b> surface <b>temperature</b> using satellite imagery involved two main activities. Firstly, in situ measurements of <b>lake</b> surface <b>temperature</b> were conducted at the three selected sampling stations over Lake Malawi concurrent with satellite image acquisitions. The second activity involved downloading and processing AVHRR and MODIS/Terra satellite imagery. AVHRR data covered the period September 1997 to February 1998 whereas MODIS/Terra data covered the period May to November, 2006. Both MODIS Land Surface Temperature (MOD 11 A 1) and Ocean Color Sea Surface Temperature (SST) were downloaded from EOS Gateway website and processed into <b>lake</b> surface <b>temperature.</b> Two glass thermometers were used to measure temperature directly from the lake surface at a depth of 0 - 7. 0 cm (i. e., skin temperature) and the average of the two readings was recorded as the <b>lake</b> surface <b>temperature</b> at a particular sampling station. Observed temperatures were regressed on remotely sensed data. ER Mapper was employed in drawing maps showing the distribution of <b>lake</b> surface <b>temperature</b> using the regression equation that was developed. Upwelling and downwelling zones were demarcated from <b>lake</b> surface <b>temperature</b> maps. Upwelling zones were identified as areas with a high potential {{for the development of the}} fishery industry because of their association with primary productivity.
