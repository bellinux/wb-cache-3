Australian wild rice which has been largely genetically isolated from cultivated rice might be {{a new source of}} genetic variation for use in improving rice production. The physical properties of Oryza australiensis and of the two perennial Australian Wild rice taxa-belonging to the A genome wild rice were evaluated. Seeds collected from rice in the wild were generally smaller than those from domesticated rice. The wild rice A genome collections were classified as extra-long paddy rice with grains that were long or medium, while O. australiensis was categorized as <b>long</b> <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> with a short grain. However, these wild rices were slender compared with domesticated rice. The grain colour of these wild rices varied from light red brown to dark brown compared with domesticated rice which is brighter, with less redness and more yellowness than the wild rice. The physical characteristics of the grains of the Australian wild rice indicate that these rice grains may be successfully processed using current rice processing techniques and may be a useful novel food especially in the coloured rice market...|$|E

Application of the proposed SDSS predicted average water and sediment yields of 383. 37 mm yr- 1 and 21. 28 t ha- 1 yr- 1 were predicted as against actual observations of 390. 69 mm yr- 1 and 25. 35 t ha- 1 yr- 1 for the validation periods 1981 - 1983; 1985 - 1989 and 1991. Simulations of the annual dynamics of total water and sediment yields showed good to moderately good correlation coefficients of 0. 83 and 0. 65; model efficiency coefficients of 0. 54 and 0. 70; mean relative errors of - 4. 28 % and - 17. 97 % and root mean square prediction errors of 71. 8 mm and 9. 63 t ha- 1, respectively.

However, there are many difficulties in mapping <b>paddy</b> <b>rice,</b> especially mapping multi-season <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> in rainy regions, including differences in phenology, the influence of weather, and farmland fragmentation. To resolve these problems, a novel multi-season <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> mapping approach based on Sentinel- 1 A and Landsat- 8 data is proposed. First, Sentinel- 1 A data were enhanced {{based on the fact}} that the backscattering coefficient of <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> varies according to its growth stage. Second, cropland information was enhanced {{based on the fact that}} the NDVI of cropland in winter is lower than that in the growing season. Then, <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and cropland areas were extracted using a K-Means unsupervised classifier with enhanced images. Third, to further improve the <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> classification accuracy, cropland information was utilized to optimize distribution of <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> by the fact that <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> must be planted in cropland.

40|$|The {{practical}} use of forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and rice is encouraged because {{it contributes to}} the effective utilization of paddy fields and production {{as well as the}} use of domestic feed. Research on forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and rice has typically focused on the perspective of paddy or livestock farmers. However, {{to address the issue of}} the {{practical use}} of forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and rice, the maintenance of users is necessary, and this demands the existence and cooperation of both paddy and livestock farmers. In this study, an interview survey was conducted to clarify the logic of paddy and livestock farmers who introduce forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and rice as well as determine the importance of intermediation companies for <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> farmers. We find that paddy farmers plant forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and <b>rice</b> to keep <b>paddy</b> fields because they have to deal with adjustments to long-term production and the expansion of areas dedicated to changing crop. Meanwhile, livestock farmers use forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> to produce coarse feed.

Seedlings of <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> were exposed to 5 mg L(- 1) Sb (KSbC(4) H(4) O(7) center dot 1 / 2 H(2) O), in the presence of Se (Na(2) SeO(3)) at 0. 1, 1, 5 mg L(- 1) in culture solution, with no Sb and Se addition as the control. <b>Paddy</b> <b>rice</b> took up Sb greatly and the highest Sb contents measured among all treatments in this experiment in the leaves, stems and roots were 65. 5, 298. 5 and 195. 7 mg kg(- 1), respectively. Without Sb addition in the solution, single exposure to 0. 1 mg L(- 1) Se remarkably reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) formation in <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> demonstrating the beneficial effect of Se at low dosages. The addition of 5 mg L(- 1) Sb was found to generate toxicity to <b>paddy</b> <b>rice,</b> showing as decreased biomass and increased leaf MDA content in <b>paddy</b> <b>rice,</b> while addition of 1 mg L(- 1) Se mitigated the toxicity of Sb, as seen with the decreased leaf MDA content and increased biomass, indicating antidotal role of Se to Sb. In addition, the presence of 0. 1. 1, 5 mg L(- 1) Se generally decreased the accumulation of Sb in the leaves, stems and roots in <b>paddy</b> <b>rice.</b> Toxicity was also seen when <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> was exposed to single Se at 1 and 5 mg L(- 1) levels, however, 5 mg L(- 1) Sb addition was found to decrease the contents of Se in the leaves/stems whereas increased them in roots, accompanied with decreased MDA contents and increased biomass in <b>paddy</b> <b>rice,</b> indicating a possible detoxification role of Sb to Se too.

This article aimed to explore the possibility of introducing a discriminatory pricing system to grain related facilities for increasing the percent of capacity use. Through a choice-based conjoint analysis of rice farmer's choice of rice drying types, following results are obtained. First, factors which determine rice farmer's choice are utility fee, length of staying at facility (staying time), closing time of receiving harvested <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> from farmers, size of <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> filed, occupation of drying equipment, and main crop.

40|$|In mountainous {{areas of}} Southeast Asia, lowland <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> is often {{assumed to be}} the {{cornerstone}} of farming systems. Households production strategies are usually analysed by assessing access to two factors: lowland <b>paddy</b> and the <b>rice</b> self-sufficiency level of the household. Rainfed rice, pig raising and off-farm activities are associated with households that are deficient in <b>paddy</b> <b>rice,</b> whereas cash crops and the raising of large ruminants are described as a diversification process run by families who have already met their <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> needs (Castella et al, 2002). A survey of 73 households conducted in three districts of Xieng Khouang province revealed that traditional agriculture is being slightly modified {{by the emergence of}} new economic opportunities such as (i) increasing local and regional urban consumption demand, and (ii) better road access to markets. The survey divided households into ten different types according to their food security strategies. For <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and marketable products, the labour and surface area allocated and the generated income by each type of product were all analysed. The labour and surface area allocated for both rice and market products, and the income generated by eac...|$|R
30|$|Another {{technology}} of <b>rice</b> cultivation is <b>paddy</b> <b>rice,</b> which is typically grown by transplanting 25 - to 35 -day-old seedlings in well-prepared puddled soils.

Growing <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> in Pakistan is a formidable challenge for food security, where limited water reservoirs and increasing population are important barriers (Briscoe and Qamar, 2009).|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} to develop the {{quantitative}} relationships between fieldmeasured leaf area index (LAI) and VEGETATION-derived vegetation indices for <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> fields, we have measured LAI of <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> fields at 10 -day intervals at five sampling sites in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province of China during the rice growing season (July to October) of 1999, using a LI-COR LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyser. Twenty-seven 10 -day VEGETATION (VGT) synthesis products (VGT-S 10) from 1 - 10 March to 21 - 30 November 1999 were acquired. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were calculated for the VGT-S 10 products, using ground surface reflectance values of VGT spectral bands (B 3 -near-infrared; B 2 -red). After rice transplanting in mid to late June, LAI increased rapidly and reached its plateau by early to mid August. There were similar temporal dynamics of NDVI and LAI among the five sampling sites over the growing season of <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> in 1999. Simple linear regression analyses indicate that there are statistically significant linear relationships between NDVI and LAI data over the growing season of <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> in 1999...|$|R
40|$|In three cultivars of japonica <b>paddy</b> <b>rice,</b> {{mesocotyl}} {{length of}} seedlings {{grown in the}} dark from grains obtained 10 and 20 days after anthesis was greater than 10 mm, while mesocotyl length decreased with the maturity of the grain and {{it was less than}} 10 mm in grain obtained 40 days after anthesis. Abscisic acid (ABA) stimulated the elongation of mesocotyl to more than 10 mm in a cultivar of japonica <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> in the dark, though it inhibited the elongation of coleoptile. It seems that morphological characters of these seedlings were {{similar to those of the}} seedlings grown from immature grains. From the above results, it is suggested that ABA-like substances were contained in the mesocotyl of the <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> seedlings grown from immature grains...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Iron (Fe) {{fortification}} of {{parboiled rice}} increases both Fe concentration and bioavailability in milled grains (i. e. white rice). The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate parboiled rice fortified with 250 and 450 mg Fe kg- 1 <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> for its pre-cooking appearance, cooking quality, basic sensory attributes and overall acceptance in comparison with unfortified parboiled rice in Thailand and local parboiled rice in Bangladesh. RESULTS: Fe fortification at 250 mg Fe kg- 1 <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> significantly elevated Fe concentration in white rice to as high as 19. 1 mg Fe kg- 1 white rice, compared with 6. 2 mg Fe kg- 1 white rice for unfortified parboiled rice, without any adverse impact on consumer acceptance based on the current preliminary assessment. The added Fe was well retained in the cooked rice, with significant residual value for human intake. Panellists in Thailand and Bangladesh did not detect significant differences in the acceptability of parboiled rice fortified at 250 mg Fe kg- 1 <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> compared with unfortified and local parboiled rice respectively. However, Fe fortification of parboiled rice at the higher level of 450 mg Fe kg- 1 <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> significantly intensified the yellow colour of the grain and changed the off-flavour, chewiness and flakiness of the cooked Fe-fortified parboiled rice. This resulted in a low acceptability ranking of parboiled rice fortified at 450 mg Fe kg- 1 <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> by panellists in both Thailand and Bangladesh. CONCLUSION: Fe fortification of parboiled rice at an appropriate level (e. g. 250 mg Fe kg- 1 <b>paddy</b> <b>rice)</b> is dosage-effective and acceptable to rice consumers. Consumer acceptability of Fe-fortified parboiled rice is closely related to pre-cooking appearance, cooking quality and sensory attributes. Copyright © 2009 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R

30|$|RHA is {{the residue}} of {{completely}} incinerated rice husk under proper conditions. Rice husk, the outer covering part of rice kernel, is an agricultural waste from the milling process of <b>paddy.</b> <b>Rice</b> husk is abundant {{in many parts of}} the world, especially in rice cultivating countries, like Vietnam. Each ton of <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> can produce approximately 200  kg of rice husk, which on combustion produces about 40  kg of ash (Bui 2001). According to the’’Rice market monitor’’ report [FAO (2012)], the global <b>rice</b> <b>paddy</b> production in 2011 was about 723 million tons (in which the Vietnam paddy production was about 42 million tons) that results in approximately 145 million tons of rice husks. <b>Rice</b> husk from <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> mills is disposed directly into the environment or sometimes is dumped or burnt in open piles on the fields. This results in serious environmental pollution, especially after it is disintegrated under wet conditions.|$|R
