50|$|The <b>Lendu,</b> or Balendru, are an ethno-linguistic agriculturalist group {{residing}} in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo {{in the area}} west and northwest of Lake Albert, specifically the Ituri Region of Orientale Province. Their language {{is one of the}} most populous of the Central Sudanic languages. There are three-quarters of a million <b>Lendu</b> speakers in the DRC, and 10,000 more in Uganda. A conflict between the <b>Lendu</b> and Hema people was the basis of the Ituri conflict.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1999 James Kazini, the {{commander}} of UPDF forces in the DRC, ignored the protests of the RCD-K leadership and created a new “province” of Ituri out of eastern Orientale Province. He then named a Hema {{to be the new}} governor. This apparently convinced the <b>Lendu</b> that Uganda and the RCD-K were backing the Hema against them, and violence erupted between the two groups, resulting in the Blukwa massacre in which more than 400 ethnic Hemas were massacred by <b>Lendu</b> militias. [...] The UPDF did little to stop the fighting but, in some cases, aided the Hema. However, even as the fighting intensified the UPDF continued to train both Hema and <b>Lendu.</b> Reports indicate that <b>Lendu</b> trainees refused to join the RCD-K and instead set up ethnically-based militias.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} Hema speak <b>Lendu,</b> the Nilo-Saharan {{language of}} the neighbouring <b>Lendu</b> people. The southern Hema still speak Hema, a Bantu language, and the closely related Hema dialect of Nyankore of western Uganda. Languages which are also related are such languages as Lunyoro, Luganda and Lusoga. Most Hema are Christians.|$|E

50|$|Hema is {{sometimes}} called Southern Hema {{in contrast to the}} unrelated language <b>Lendu,</b> also known as Northern Hema.|$|E
50|$|Besides the Balendru themselves, <b>Lendu</b> {{is spoken}} {{as a native}} {{language}} by {{a portion of the}} Hema, Alur, and Okebu.|$|E
50|$|Ethnic {{tension between}} the <b>Lendu</b> and Hema {{can be traced to}} the colonial period, when the area was part of the Belgian Congo. The Belgian colonial administrators favored the {{pastoralist}} Hema, resulting in education and wealth disparities between the two groups. This divergence continued into modern times. Despite this, the two peoples have largely lived together peacefully and extensively intermarried. While the southern Hema speak their own language, the northern Hema speak <b>Lendu.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{languages}} are <b>Lendu</b> (Balendru), with {{over a million}} speakers, and the smaller Ngiti, as well as perhaps an additional language or two.|$|E
50|$|The Hema and <b>Lendu</b> have longstanding grievances about land {{issues that}} had erupted into {{conflict}} {{on at least}} three previous occasions: 1972, 1985 and 1996. Much of the animosity revolves around the 1973 land use law, which allows people to buy land they do not inhabit and, if their ownership is not contested for two years, evict any residents from the land. Some wealthy Hema used this law to force <b>Lendu</b> off their land, leading to {{a growing sense of}} resentment.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} year, {{there were no}} reports that the Lendu-dominated FNI and other <b>Lendu</b> groups in Ituri District committed killings or rapes against civilians.|$|E

50|$|Ethnologue gives Bbadha as an {{alternate}} name of <b>Lendu,</b> but Blench (2000) lists Badha {{as a distinct}} language. A draft listing of Nilo-Saharan languages, available from his website and dated 2012, lists Lendu/Badha.|$|E

[...] Owere Igbo has a seven-way contrast among bilabial stops, , and its alveolar stops are similar. The dorsal stops [...] {{do not seem to be}} attested in the literature as speech sounds, but [...] has been claimed for Kaqchikel. <b>Lendu</b> has been claimed to have voiceless , but they may actually be creaky-voiced implosives.|$|E
50|$|Chapin's flycatcher (Muscicapa <b>lendu)</b> is a {{bird species}} in the Old World flycatcher family (Muscicapidae). It {{is found in the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Uganda, and {{possibly}} Rwanda. The Itombwe flycatcher was formerly considered conspecific.|$|E
50|$|The FRPI was {{established}} in November 2002 from the Ngiti ethnolinguistic group, a subgroup of <b>Lendu,</b> as an ally to the Lendu-dominated Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI). The Ngiti, organized under traditional leaders, thus formed a counterweight to the Rwanda-backed and Hema-dominated Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) in the Ituri conflict. The FRPI {{was supported by the}} Uganda-backed Forces for Renewal faction of the Rally for Congolese Democracy. In 2002-2003, the FRPI received support from both the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) and Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) in fighting against the UPC. Both the DRC and Uganda had also assisted in the initial creation of the FRPI and FNI, though neither group ever established full control over <b>Lendu</b> fighters in Ituri.|$|E
50|$|During the Second Congo War, the Ituri {{conflict}} {{occurred in}} the Ituri Region alongside Lake Albert and the Ugandan border. The Ituri conflict was fought between two non-governmental informally organised ethnic groups, the <b>Lendu</b> and Hema, that had caused the deaths {{of thousands of people}} by 2003.|$|E
5000|$|Demolin (1995) {{posits that}} <b>Lendu</b> has voiceless implosives, [...] (...) [...] However, Goyvaerts (1988) had {{described}} these as creaky-voiced implosives , as in Hausa, contrasting {{with a series}} of modally voiced implosives [...] as in Kalabari, and Ladefoged judges that this seems to be a more accurate description.|$|E
50|$|Bogoro is {{a village}} in Ituri Province, in the {{north-east}} of the DRC. Between 1999 and 2003, Ituri {{was the scene of}} a violent conflict between the <b>Lendu,</b> Ngiti and Hema ethnic groups. The Hema-dominated Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) seized control of Bunia, the district capital, in August 2002.|$|E
50|$|The Ituri Conflict is {{an ongoing}} {{conflict}} between <b>Lendu</b> and Hema {{ethnic groups in the}} Ituri region.

50|$|In 1981, mining in {{the region}} was opened to private enterprise, causing rapid growth in artisanal mining as well as formal {{commercial}} mining by foreign companies.Gold mining resumed its decline in the 1980s and 1990s. Industrial gold production was affected by the First Congo War from October 1996 to May 1997 and halted by the Second Congo War from August 1998 to May 2003. In 2002 and 2003 there were a series battles between rival armed groups over Mongbwalu in which 2,000 civilians died.In some cases civilians were killed because they were Hema or <b>Lendu</b> people.The town changed hands five times.The Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) <b>Lendu</b> militia emerged the winner.The FNI controlled Mongbwalu and its gold mines {{until the middle of}} 2005, using the gold to pay its troops and to buy supplies and weapons.|$|E
50|$|Most {{members of}} the group speak Alur, a {{language}} closely related to Dojunam Acholi and Adhola. Some Alur speak <b>Lendu</b> or Kebu.Alur language dialects vary considerably. The highland Alur (Okoro) speak a slightly different dialect from the lowland Alur (Jonam), and it might be difficult to for a native highland Alur person to properly understand his lowland kinsman.|$|E
50|$|The rare {{mountain}} gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) survives {{only in this}} ecoregion as do the L'Hoest's monkey, and a sub-species of the Hamlyn's monkey − {{as well as many}} endemic species of butterflies and birds including: Grauer's warblers, Chapin's flycatchers, and the Ruwenzori turaco. The <b>Lendu</b> Plateau clawed frog is endemic to that landform in the ecoregion.|$|E
