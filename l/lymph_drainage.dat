25|$|The {{arterial}} blood {{supply of the}} breast has medial and lateral vascular components; it is supplied with blood by the internal mammary artery (from the medial aspect), the lateral thoracic artery (from the lateral aspect), and the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th intercostal perforating arteries. Drainage of venous blood from the breast is by the superficial vein system under the dermis, and by the deep vein system parallel to the artery system.

ResultsA total of 63 (17 %) patients exhibited defects of the inguinal lymph nodes with mild or moderate dilatation of afferent lymph vessels. A total of 123 (32 %) patients exhibited lymphatic anomalies as lymphatic aplasia, hypoplasia or hyperplasia with no obvious defect of the <b>drainage</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes. The involvement of both lymph vessel- and lymph-node abnormalities in the affected limb was found in 192 (51 %) patients. The primary lymphoedema was classified as three major types as: (1) lymph nodes affected only; (2) lymph vessel affected only with three subtypes and (3) both lymph vessel and lymph node affected with subgroups. ConclusionsA comprehensive classification of lymphatic-system malformation in primary lymphoedema is proposed, which clearly defines the location and pathologic characteristics of both lymphatics and lymph node and may lead to further study of the aetiology as well as rational treatment of the disease...|$|R

50|$|Manual lymphatic {{drainage}} (MLD) {{is a type}} of massage {{based on}} preliminary evidence which is hypothesized to encourage the natural drainage of the lymph, which carries waste products away from the tissues back toward the heart. The lymph system depends on intrinsic contractions of the smooth muscle cells in the walls of lymph vessels (peristalsis) and the movement of skeletal muscles to propel lymph through the vessels to lymph nodes and then to the lymph ducts which return lymph to the cardiovascular system. Manual <b>lymph</b> <b>drainage</b> uses a specific amount of pressure (less than 9 ounces per square inch or about 4 kPa) and rhythmic circular movements to stimulate lymph flow. Clinical studies of MLD conclude that further study of the practice is required before recommending it as an effective health treatment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Adenocarcinoma of {{the body}} and tail of the {{pancreas}} is an aggressive malignancy, and classically there have been few survivors after surgery. Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy and distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection are new procedures for these tumors. Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy is designed to es-tablish an operation with oncologic rationales both for the dissection planes used to achieve negative margins and the extent of node dissection. The ex-tent of lymph node dissection is based on the descriptions of N 1 <b>lymph</b> node <b>drainage,</b> and dissection planes are based on fascial planes of the retroperitoneum. Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy is modular, adjusting the posterior plane of dissection based on the position of the tumor on preoperative computed tomograms. It is also performed right to left to increase visibility and control blood supply early. Radical ante-grade modular pancreatosplenectomy is not an extended pancreatectomy but brings the rationales of the modern Whipple procedure to left-side...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of <b>lymph</b> node <b>drainage</b> {{levels in the}} neck from CT scans {{is necessary for the}} proper treatment of cancer {{of the head and neck}} with radiation therapy. However, to comply with the guidelines one must segment at least 20 fiducial anatomic objects on each side, and then apply complex rules to determine six boundaries for each of nine different levels. To reduce physician time and standardize results it is necessary to automate the entire process. In this paper, we propose solving this problem by deforming the nodal levels from an atlas patient to target patient in a way combining two novel ideas: a) The large deformation diffeomorphic transformations of curved landmark paths; b) a scheme provided by m-reps and their geodesic paths for producing curved paths between corresponding points associated with the fiducial objects. This method is applicable to a wide variety of problems of mapping between an atlas and a target image with automatically segmentable structures. 1...|$|R
40|$|Squamous cell {{cancer of}} the skin usually follows {{prolonged}} exposure to known carcinogens including ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, chronic infection or irritation, chemicals, and immunologic suppression. The majority of squamous cell skin cancers metastasize infrequently and can be cured with aggressive wide local excision. However, on occasion they can be quite aggressive locally, with or without associated distant metastasis, and may require a radical surgical approach. We report a series of four male patients covering the spectrum of this disease with the following distribution: lower pole of the right ear, right posterior thigh below gluteal fold with positive inguinal nodes, lateral aspect of the foot with bone involvement, and as an incidental finding in a pilonidal cyst. We conclude that one should not hesitate to proceed with aggressive surgical resection as it may provide the only chance for cure.
