Smaller scale sprinkler systems such as solid set systems with impact sprinklers are commonly used to grow vegetables and turf.

25|$|Irrigation {{methods in}} Australia have {{improved}} {{over many years}} allowing for more efficient production per megalitre of water used. Current methods include systems such as centre pivot irrigation, impact (knocker) sprinklers, butterfly sprinklers, drip and surface irrigation.

40|$|This paper explores {{professional}} employees’ {{career move}} preferences {{and the impact}} of both individual and organizational career management. Departing from theoretical work on the “new career”, different types of career moves employees can make on the internal labor market are discussed (i. e. vertical <b>moves,</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>moves,</b> job enrichment and temporary moves). Next, these are related to the literature on both organizational and individual career management. Hypotheses are formulated about professional employees’ preferences for making distinct types of internal career moves and {{about the extent to which}} these preferences are affected by (a) employees’ individual career management initiatives and (b) four distinct bundles of organizational career management practices (succession management, potential assessment, feedback and development). The results of a study among 472 professional employees from one company are presented, which indicate that the preferences for both vertical career moves and moves relating to job enrichment and temporary moves are significantly affected by individual career management, but not by organizational career management practices. The preference for making <b>lateral</b> <b>moves</b> could not be explained by our antecedent variables, but was affected by managerial ambition and variables relating to respondents’ family situation. The implications of our findings for stimulating internal career mobility are discussed, and suggestions for further research are made. ...|$|R

40|$|Centre Pivots and <b>Lateral</b> <b>Moves</b> (CP&LMs) or {{overhead}} {{irrigation systems}} have been successfully installed in every cotton growing district in Australia. This industry now {{has the capacity to}} broaden the uptake of this irrigation technology, and benefit from its simplicity and improved water use efficiency while moving away from farming systems based on saturated fields. The greatest source of information that the Australian cotton industry has in respect of CP&LMs is the small number of people that have experience with these machines. The greatest disadvantage that the Australian cotton industry faces in respect of CP&LMs is the small number of people that have experience with these machines. Growers considering purchasing CP&LMs should do everything in their power to look, listen and learn from these people. Their experience is invaluable in ensuring that the Australian cotton industry implements this irrigation technology successfully. In keeping with the cotton industry's mantra of "Concentrate on the things you can change and forget about the rest", I will outline the important parameters you can alter during design to optimize the overall performance of CP&LMs. This paper will examine the optimal design, installation and management of Centre Pivot and <b>Lateral</b> <b>Moves</b> or overhead irrigation systems.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In fiscal year 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spent more than $ 15 million to move air traffic controllers and their managers to new permanent duty locations. FAA classifies the funds that it spends for these moves as permanent change of station (PCS) benefits. In 1998, {{as part of a}} broader effort to reform its personnel policies, FAA changed its policies on PCS benefits. Instead of fully reimbursing the costs of all PCS moves and prohibiting unfunded PCS moves, as it once did, FAA now determines the amount of PCS benefits to be offered on a position-by-position basis and allows employees and managers to move at their own expense. Under its new polices, FAA can fully reimburse the costs of a move if it determines that he move is in the interest of the government, or it can offer partial fixed relocation benefits if it determines that the agency will derive some benefit from the move. FAA's policies on eligibility for PCS benefits are the same for air traffic controllers and their managers, but the amounts of the benefits vary. According to these policies, eligibility depends on a determining official's decision about how critical a position is and/or whether FAA will benefit from the move. Air traffic controllers have been less likely than air traffic managers to be offered PCS benefits when they move between facilities. Between fiscal year 1999 and 2001, Air Traffic Services funded 16 percent of moves involving a promotion and 6 percent of <b>lateral</b> <b>moves</b> between field facilities for controllers, compared with 38 percent of promotional moves and 34 percent of <b>lateral</b> <b>moves</b> for managers. According to FAA officials, PCS costs have decreased and FAA's ability to quickly fill vacant controller positions has improved since the new PCS policies took effect. ...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. Marine Corps {{is in need}} of a unified enlisted manpower model to guide the recruiting, training, promoting and discharging of an enlisted force of over 153, 000 Marines. This thesis develops a set of linear programs (LPs) for this purpose. Each LP optimizes the estimated manpower structure within an occupational field by varying the number of recruits, promotions, and <b>lateral</b> <b>moves</b> over a 30 -year time horizon, at a yearly level of detail. The goal is to meet annual force-level targets specified by Headquarters Marine Corps for cohorts defined by occupational specialty, and rank. Estimated attrition rates are key inputs; these are based on Kaplan-Meier estimators for "survival probabilities" computed from Marine Corps data covering 1990 - 2000. Current force strength data, also required by the LPs, is derived from the Marine Corps database. Average LP solving time is less than thirty minutes on a Pentium IV 2 Ghz personal computer, using the GAMS modeling system and the CPLEX LP solver. Captain, United States Marine Corp...|$|R
