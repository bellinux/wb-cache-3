50|$|Pascal's {{calculator}} {{was especially}} {{successful in the}} design of its carry mechanism, which adds 1 to 9 on one dial, and when it changes from 9 to 0, carries 1 to the next dial. His innovation made each digit independent {{of the state of the}} others, which enabled multiple carries to rapidly cascade from one digit to another regardless of the machine's capacity. Pascal was also the first to shrink and adapt for his purpose a <b>lantern</b> <b>gear,</b> used in turret clocks and water wheels, which could resist the strength of any operator input with very little added friction.|$|E
50|$|A cage gear, {{also called}} a <b>lantern</b> <b>gear</b> or lantern pinion has {{cylindrical}} rods for teeth, {{parallel to the}} axle and arranged {{in a circle around}} it, much as the bars on a round bird cage or lantern. The assembly is held together by disks at each end, into which the tooth rods and axle are set. Cage gears are more efficient than solid pinions, and dirt can fall through the rods rather than becoming trapped and increasing wear. They can be constructed with very simple tools as the teeth are not formed by cutting or milling, but rather by drilling holes and inserting rods.|$|E

40|$|Photograph of an {{interior}} {{view of a}} fireplace of a log cabin, ca. 1930 - 1940. In the center, a fireplace constructed with wooden logs and concrete is visible; it contains lumber and a pot hanging from a steel which can be seen extended horizontally on the upper area of the fireplace. To its left, a guitar case is sitting in an upright position. On the right, a pot covered by its top, {{which appears to be}} made of clay, sits underneath several objects hanging from the wall: a <b>lantern</b> and fishing <b>gear.</b> Above the fireplace, a small counter is seen hanging from the wall and several objects are sitting on top: {{what appears to be a}} small clock, candle stands, a framed picture of two men, and a bottle of wine. Farther above, more framed paintings and pictures along with two bottles are sitting on the last wooden log which makes up the wall...|$|R
5000|$|Pascal {{went through}} 50 prototypes before {{settling}} on his final design; {{we know that he}} started with some sort of calculating clock mechanism that used springs which apparently [...] "works by springs and which has a very simple design", was used [...] "many times" [...] and remained in [...] "operating order". Nevertheless, [...] "while always improving on it" [...] he found reason {{to try to make the}} whole system more reliable and robust. Eventually he adopted a component of very large clocks, shrinking and adapting for his purpose the robust gears that can be found in a turret clock mechanism called a <b>lantern</b> <b>gear,</b> itself derived from a water wheel mechanism. This could easily handle the strength of an operator input.|$|E
50|$|However, in corn mills {{rotation}} about {{a vertical}} axis {{was required to}} drive its stones. The horizontal rotation was converted into the vertical rotation by means of gearing, which also enabled the runner stones to turn faster than the waterwheel. The usual arrangement in British and American corn mills {{has been for the}} waterwheel to turn a horizontal shaft on which is also mounted a large pit wheel. This meshes with the wallower, mounted on a vertical shaft, which turns the (larger) great spur wheel (mounted on the same shaft). This large face wheel, set with pegs, in turn, turned a smaller wheel (such as a <b>lantern</b> <b>gear)</b> known as a stone nut, which was attached to the shaft that drove the runner stone. The number of runner stones that could be turned depended directly upon the supply of water available. As waterwheel technology improved mills became more efficient, and by the 19th century, it was common for the great spur wheel to drive several stone nuts, so that a single water wheel could drive as many as four stones. Each step in the process increased the gear ratio which increased the maximum speed of the runner stone. Adjusting the sluice gate and thus the flow of the water past the main wheel allowed the miller to compensate for seasonal variations in the water supply. Finer speed adjustment was made during the milling process by tentering, that is, adjusting the gap between the stones according to the water flow, the type of grain being milled, and the grade of flour required.|$|E
