40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{issues of}} open access from {{the context of}} the broader <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> industry as a whole. The structure and contours of the <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> industry have shaped the availability of online open access publishing of legal scholarship. The competitive duopoly of Lexis and Westlaw is a particularly important factor in considerations of open access. Also significant is the relationship between Lexis and Westlaw and law schools, which form an important market segment for both Lexis and Westlaw. This paper begins by considering the important role information plays in the law. It then notes the increasing industry concentration that has occurred over the last 10 - 15 years among legal and other publishers. This industry concentration is believed to have contributed to significant price increases for scholarly journals generally. This industry concentration has potentially significant implications for questions of access, particularly in the current environment of increasing electronic dissemination of <b>legal</b> <b>information.</b> In addition to examining characteristics of the <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> industry, this paper also looks at the role of dominant players such as Lexis and Westlaw {{and the ways in which}} information dissemination has changed with the advent of electronic <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> Consumers of <b>legal</b> <b>information,</b> including law firms, law school users and the general public are also considered, particularly with respect to the implications of <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> industry organization and operation for questions of access to <b>legal</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R

Some courts relying on the authority of the Ohio Revised Code Section 2303. 201 assess additional court costs to fund the acquisition and maintenance of computer-assisted legal research. This study develops a profile of single-judge municipal court libraries in Ohio in order to predict trends in the selection and acquisition of print materials and online research services. Eighty-six single-judge municipal courts were contacted, and 47 responded with returned questionnaires. Results provide a guide to courts seeking information necessary for improving their collections and services. Budgets were generally modest, and 10 percent of the courts deemed their <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> less than adequate or poor.

40|$|Any {{meaningful}} {{design of}} information {{system for a}} user group {{must take into account}} the need to establish the sources of information and channels/means to access. This paper reports on the study instituted to determine the sources of legal information and means used to access legal information by Lawyers in Uganda and propose strategic interventions. The study used survey research design with structured questionnaire to elicit the required data. The results indicate that sources outside legal literature, acts of parliament, law textbooks and judgments constitute the main sources of legal information. While constitutional, human rights, law reference and gender related needs constitute the difficult legal information to access. Highly used channels/means to access legal information include visiting law libraries, telephones and using research assistants. It concludes that concerted efforts are required by the Government of Uganda and law librarians to address issues of legal information provision to lawyers in Uganda. This is because the growth in law has led to changes in the legal publishing industry. It is recommended that provision of literature from outside law should be integrated into the legal information provision strategies. Law librarians should be proactive and mobile technologies integrated in the <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> delivery among others...|$|E

40|$|The {{beginning}} of the fall 2009 semester marks another benchmark in the physical transformation of the Notre Dame Law School facility. This {{will be the only}} complete academic year without dedicated library study and research space and with just one-quarter of our print collection onsite. For first year students, this will mark some changes in the way that we teach legal research. We continue to strive to balance our teaching of various methods of online access to legal information with locating and using traditional print materials. We survey our students annually to monitor what law firms expect in research methods by summer law clerks, and we use this information to guide our efforts to best teach students in the research practices that they will need after graduation. Recently, a number of writers have explored the changing nature of the marketplace. LexisNexis and Westlaw continue to post substantial profits, but clients are increasing less willing to allow firms to directly charge for the use of these two databases. An article in the August 24 edition of the Wall Street Journal also outlined significant shifts away from hourly billing by many corporate clients of major law firms.

40|$|Toronto, September 13, 2017 – In {{keeping with}} its {{commitment}} to cultivate law graduates who will serve and strengthen the communities {{in which they live}} and work, York University’s Osgoode Hall Law School will devote substantial resources {{over the next three years}} to support ongoing and new student-led Osgoode projects that partner with community groups. The newest of these community collaborations – the DUKE Heights/Osgoode Community Impact Project – will be officially launched on October 6. The two-year pilot program will see DUKE Heights, which is located on Finch Avenue in North York and is the second largest Business Improvement Area (BIA) in North America, working with Osgoode to create a Virtual Employment Hub and, in particular, an online <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> The Virtual Employment Hub will offer one source through the DUKE Heights website where employers, entrepreneurs and job seekers can find resources to help them succeed and grow. The Law School will also begin implementing a Social Procurement Strategy this year with a goal of significantly increasing its support for independent businesses in the vicinity of York University, social enterprises and businesses supporting equity-seeking communities, as part of the broader AnchorTO initiative of which York University has been a founding member. In addition, the Law School intends to grow the number of Public Interest Summer Internships that it supports (including those funded by donors). In the 2016 - 17 academic year, Osgoode awarded internship funding of $ 240, 000 to 24 students ($ 10, 000 each) who attained summer employment at a public interest organization. In 2018, two additional internships will be offered. “Greater community engagement is one of the key priorities to which we have committed in our Access Osgoode strategic plan,” said Osgoode Dean Lorne Sossin. “We are investing energy and resources in creating and supporting opportunities for students to make community engagement a central and positive part of their experience at Osgoode. ” Matias de Dovitiis, Executive Director of DUKE Heights BIA whose boundaries run from Steeles Avenue to Sheppard Avenue and from Keele Street to Dufferin Street, explains the importance of the partnership with Osgoode: “Duke Heights BIA has over 2, 500 businesses and is right at the doorstep of York University. We have a mandate from our Board of Directors to develop a relationship that will make our area a hub for innovation and growth and this Osgoode partnership is a step in that direction. ” To ensure the success of the collaboration, De Dovitiis said DUKE Heights has hired a new team member – Symone Walters – as Community Impact Coordinator. “Symone Walters will be working as a liaison for Osgoode Hall Law School and the DUKE Heights BIA between our members, employment organizations and potential employees,” de Dovitiis said. Encouraging employment growth in a community is vitally important, according to Sossin. “What has become clear over years of working in a variety of community-oriented, law school partnerships and outreach is that employment is a key to community building – and to overcoming the kind of legal barriers which many face. ” Sossin noted that, as part of the AnchorTO initiative, York University has defined itself as an “Anchor Institution” within the Black Creek and Jane-Finch communities and has targeted four areas – employment, engagement, infrastructure and social procurement – where it could be mutually beneficial for the University and its neighbours to work together on selected projects. “The DUKE Heights/Osgoode Community Impact Project fits in nicely with the Anchor YorkU framework,” Sossin said. “Legal innovations around social enterprise and social procurement can help fulfill the potential of the University to support and strengthen communities. ” In addition to the above, Osgoode is also advancing its engagement in the community in a number of other ways including through the Law in Action Within Schools (LAWS) program, hosting of the Success Beyond Limits (SBL) youth leadership camp and new partnerships with Indigenous communities. A significant component of Osgoode’s commitment to community engagement supports access to justice through the Osgoode Public Interest Requirement (OPIR), Osgoode’s 19 clinical and intensive programs, and Osgoode faculty members’ many research contributions to the access to justice field.
