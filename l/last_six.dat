5|$|The lack {{of flight}} {{recorder}} {{data for the}} <b>last</b> <b>six</b> minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was {{a major factor in}} its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the <b>last</b> <b>six</b> minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E

All five EVAs were conducted successfully, for a total time in EVA activity of thirty-six hours, fifty-six minutes.|$|E

5|$|The {{first film}} has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, {{and the third}} 1,488 (2,730 in total). The total {{increases}} to 3,420 with the extended editions. 260 visual effect artists began work on the series, and the number doubled by The Two Towers. The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, worked long hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's active imagination was a driving force. For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within the <b>last</b> <b>six</b> weeks of post-production of The Two Towers, and the same happened again within the <b>last</b> <b>six</b> weeks on The Return of the King.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After the hosts had complied, the Australian skipper fielded a full-strength team. In a rain-interrupted match, Lindwall bowled Hutton for a duck with the new ball. He returned and took five of the <b>last</b> <b>six</b> wickets to fall as the hosts lost their <b>last</b> <b>six</b> wickets for 57 runs. His last five victims were former England captain Walter Robins and Test players Freddie Brown, Evans, Bedser and Laker. Lindwall ended with 6/59; four of his wickets were bowled, while {{the other two were}} caught by Ian Johnson in the slips. He made five as Australia with 8/489 declared; time ran out in the rain-affected match with Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1994 season, Reeves named Dave Brown, who {{had been}} a #1 {{supplemental}} draft choice in 1992, the Giants starting quarterback.

During the winning streak, they never allowed more than 20 points in a game.|$|E

5|$|Germany {{failed to}} qualify for the first two UEFA European Championships in 1984 and 1987.

Gillingham thus gained promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time in the club's 107-year history, in what proved to be manager Peter Taylor's final match in charge.|$|E

Smith recorded 24receptions for 336yards and twotouchdowns. In its midseason report, The Baltimore Sun credited Smith for often giving an inconsistent Maryland team good field position with his long kick returns.|$|E

5|$|The Gita {{consists}} of 18 chapters and 700 shlokas (verses), with each chapter named as a different yoga, thus delineating eighteen different yogas.

During 1974, Cambodia continued to collapse. More than half of the population had become refugees and malnutrition and disease stalked a nation that had once been the best fed in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the final}} match for Bradman in England, and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions. It was Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson {{at the expense of}} Ring. The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat, but Lindwall took 6/59 in an innings that lasted into the second day, bowling four of his victims and taking five of the <b>last</b> <b>six</b> wickets to fall as the hosts lost their <b>last</b> <b>six</b> wickets for 57 runs. Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62. Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face, breaking his nose. Australia reached 2/407 on the third and final afternoon before collapsing to 8/469 before Bradman declared without attempting to force a result. Leveson-Gower's XI played out time, with Bradman bowling the last over.|$|E
5|$|While {{conventional}} English sonnet form {{described by}} Gascoigne {{is seen in}} Sonnet 86, the Petrarchan sonnet form, which requires a pause between the first eight lines and the <b>last</b> <b>six</b> lines is also evident.
