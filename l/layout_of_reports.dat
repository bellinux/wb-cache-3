40|$|This report {{describes}} a method called MCM (Method for Conceptual Modeling) for building and evaluating formal specifications of object-oriented models of database system behavior. An important aim of MCM is {{to bridge the}} gap between formal specification and informal understanding. Building a MCM model is a process that moves from the informal to the formal, evaluating the model is a process that moves back from the formal to the informal. First, a general framework for information system development methods is given, that is used to indicate which elements are needed to build a particular information system development method. In general, the following elements are needed (see figure 0. 1) l. Requirements determination methods that can be used to determine the information needs of the environment, and to find functional and nonfunctional requirements specifications. 2. Conceptual modeling methods that can be used to elaborate the statement of functional require­ ments into a formal specification of observable system behavior. 3. Implementation methods that can be used to transform the conceptual model specification into an implementation within the constraints indicated by the nonfunctional requirements. 4. Project management methods that can be used to manage the development process in the presence of limited resources and a potentially disturbing environment. MCM is a conceptual modeling method, and must therefore in any information system development project be supplemented with three other kinds of methods. MCM contains three kinds of methods (figure 0. 1). 1. Observation methods to find relevant data about the required database system. 2. Induction methods that allow one to go from a finite set of data about required system behavior to a conceptual model that represents all of this behavior. 3. Evaluation methods that allow one to test the quality of a specification of a conceptual model. In this report, I concentrate on induction and evaluation methods and merely make a list of relevant observation methods. The induction methods listed in figure 0. 1 are not exhaustive. MCM can be viewed as a framework within which methods and techniques for conceptual modeling can be plugged. Some of these methods and techniques are mentioned in this report but not elaborated. There are three kinds of evaluation methods, that deal with the validity of the conceptual model, the utility of the specified behavior, and the quality of the use that is made of the available modeling constructs. Prototyping and animation are briefly discussed as evaluation methods. The quality checks, however, are listed exhaustively. The result of following MCM is a conceptual model. In the philosophy of MCM, a conceptual model consists of three components (see figure 0. 2) : 1. The UoD model is a model of the part of reality represented by the database system. 2. The DBS model represents DBS behavior, such as the queries to be asked from the DBS, the user interface, the contents and <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> produced by the DBS, etc. 3. A model of the boundary between the DBS and the UoD. This is a list of all possible transactions that the DBS can engage in, plus the function that this behavior has for the user of the DBS...|$|E

40|$|Managers tend {{to provide}} {{subjective}} performance evaluations that are relatively high (leniency) {{and not very}} dispersed (compression). This paper reports on an experiment that investigates whether the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> performance <b>reports</b> affects the leniency and compression of managers’ subjective evaluations. Relying on psychology theory, we predict that subjective ratings will be higher and more compressed if performance reports contain alphabetically listed indicators rather than categorically listed indicators (as in a balanced scorecard). Moreover, we predict that ratings will be higher and more compressed if performance reports present indicator target and actual values in tables than when this information is presented in graphs. The results from the experiment provide support for the hypothesis that performance ratings are higher if measures are listed in alphabetical order as opposed to presented in a four-category balanced scorecard format. However, there is no support for the other hypotheses. We discuss {{the implications of the}} study for accounting research and practice...|$|R

In this report some basic theory from micro-economics is outlined. It is then shown how that economic theory can be mapped onto a distributed system.

40|$|This report gives a {{detailed}} description of the techniques employed by ADAPT for the auto-parallelisation of Distributed Fortran 90. It assumes that the reader is familiar with Fortran 90, especially with its array features and other new facilities, such as procedure interfaces, on which the auto-parallelisation is based. If not, an overview of these features can be found in [2, 3]. These references also provide an overview of the execution model for the transformed output program, while this report describes the execution model in more detail. The <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the <b>report</b> is as follows. Section 2 describes the data distribution model and declarations of Distributed Fortran 90, and the restrictions it imposes on the use of distributed data and of some old Fortran features. Sections 3 and 4 describe in detail the auto-parallelisation techniques employed by ADAPT, and comprise the main body <b>of</b> the <b>report.</b> Section 3 introduces the basic principles and techniques, such as array partitioning, subscript transformation, attribute vectors, regular section parameterisation, and dynamic storage allocation. Section 4 describes the transformation of array expressions and assignments, which is the core of the auto-parallelisation process. Section 5 suggests two further language extensions to Distributed Fortran 90 (or perhaps Fortran generally) that would assist distributed memory auto-parallelisation while not impairing language portability. Section 6 contains a brief overview of the ADAPT preprocessor, and the last section presents our conclusions.

Much has occurred since our last review of the defense industry in 1990. Aerospace cutbacks have accelerated, more military bases have been scheduled for closure, and the state is mired in recession.

In this Introduction, the authors summarize the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the <b>report,</b> and then touch upon two over-arching issues that need {{to be taken into account}} in reading the report. To set the context for m-banking services in the focus countries, chapter two reviews the demand for m-banking services in Southern Africa, particularly in relation to migrant remittances and cross-border payments of trade-related transactions.

On the supply side, chapter three briefly describes the financial and telecommunications landscape in which the development of m-banking is set. The heart of this study is the country diagnostics set out in annex A, which examine, for each country the regulatory issues that are listed in annex B.
