5|$|Stela 2 is a {{monument}} {{in the early}} Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which would place it in the 1st century BC. Flanking the text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor. Above the figures and the text is an ornate figure depicted in profile <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the left-hand figure below. Stela2 is located {{in front of the}} retaining wall of Terrace5.|$|E
5|$|The song's music video, {{directed}} by Nick Brandt, and shot in Los Angeles, is focused around six unrelated {{people living in}} isolation in a cityscape on a dark, cloudy day {{while the rest of}} the world moves around them in slow motion. The first half of the video introduces these figures. Five of the figures are: a bald man <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the city from his apartment window, a middle-aged woman sitting alone in a coffee shop, a homeless man lying on the damp street, a well-dressed figure feeding pigeons, and a teenage boy ostracized from a game of baseball. The sixth figure is Jackson himself, seen walking the city streets while he sings. Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in slow motion.|$|E
25|$|An ebook {{version was}} {{released}} in July 2011 by Ridan Publishing and also contained the foreword by John Scalzi and introductions by Haldeman and Robin Sullivan (President of Ridan Publishing). The cover art depicts a soldier in a war torn setting <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the helmet of a fallen comrade.|$|E

25|$|Sebastian de Belalcazar's {{monument}}: It is {{the most}} visited and popular monument in the city located in the hills overlooking the city. The monument is famous due to its pointing finger which is pointing to {{the opposite direction of}} the valley, while its face is <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the city.|$|E
25|$|Another {{commemorative}} {{monument to}} La Fontaine {{was set up}} {{at the head of}} the Parisian Jardin du Ranelagh in 1891. The bronze bust designed by Achille Dumilâtre was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889) before being placed on a high stone pedestal surrounded by various figures from the fables. The work was melted down, like many others during World War II, but was replaced in 1983 by Charles Correia’s standing statue of the fabulist <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the fox and the crow on the steps and plinth below him.|$|E
25|$|On 19 September 1936, while {{preparing}} for the race, Tom Campbell Black was killed at the U.K's Liverpool, Speke Airport, in a ground collision with another aircraft. A RAF bomber that had landed ran into Black's Mew Gull as he taxiied out for take off. Black was reputed to have been <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his map at the time. The propeller of the large biplane tore through the side of Black's cockpit, striking and mortally wounding {{him in the chest}} and shoulder. He died on the way to hospital. He left a widow, the English actress Florence Desmond, whom he had married in 1935.|$|E

25|$|After the Vorticists' only U.K. {{exhibition}} in 1915, the movement broke up, {{largely as a}} result of World War I, though Lewis's patron, John Quinn, organised a Vorticist exhibition at the Penguin Club in New York in 1917. Lewis was posted to the western front, and served as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. Much of his time was spent in Forward Observation Posts <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> apparently deserted German lines, registering targets and calling down fire from batteries massed around the rim of the Ypres Salient. It was dangerous work and he made vivid accounts of narrow misses and deadly artillery duels. After the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917, he was appointed as an official war artist for both the Canadian and British governments, beginning work in December 1917.|$|E
25|$|Gorytus' final race of {{the season}} was the Group One Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 15 October, {{in which he was}} matched against the unbeaten Middle Park Stakes winner Diesis. Gorytus started the 1/2 {{favourite}} with Diesis on 2/1, while the other two runners, Gordian and Tough Commander started at odds of 33/1 and 200/1 respectively. Carson settled Gorytus in third place behind the two outsiders, with Lester Piggott restraining Diesis in last place. The favourite appeared to be going well until half way but then began to struggle and quickly dropped out of contention with Carson <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the horse's legs as if he had sustained an injury. Diesis won easily by five lengths, with Gorytus finishing last of the four runners, thirty lengths behind the third-placed Tough Commander.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous image of the Tet Offensive, a photo that was taken by Eddie Adams, was the {{photograph}} that depicted a Vietnamese man being executed by the Southern Vietnamese General, General Nguyen Ngoc Loan. The photo shows the moment of death for the young man. Adams won a prize for his iconic photo, which {{was said to be}} more influential than the video that was released of the same execution. The impact that the photos had on the American public was astounding. Support for the war plummeted, and though two hundred thousand troops were requested {{at the beginning of the}} Offensive, the request was denied. Adams had another photo published that, while not making as big as an impact as his other photo, was certainly gruesome. The image depicted a soldier, who appears to be a child, dead and lying on the side of the road, with a group of civilians <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the body. It was published on May 5, 1968.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E
500|$|... 6. Licensed Withdrawal: When {{a subject}} is pictured in an {{advertisement}} as looking {{away in the}} distance, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> an object, etc. This often shows the person being removed from the scene itself or lost in thought. This subject can be female in most cases, but male in some as well. Scott Morris and Katherine Warren further explain this term by saying, [...] "When women are not presented as withdrawn, they are presented as over engaged, {{to the point of}} losing control: laughing uncontrollably or overcome with extreme emotion." [...] With licensed withdrawal shown in many different types of advertisements, they are seen almost everywhere with many people being exposed to them.|$|E
500|$|Several of the film's {{establishing}} {{shots of}} the 70s-era Bay Area were created by the Marin County effects house Matte World Digital. The [...] "helicopter shots" [...] of the fireworks-laden sky over Vallejo, the San Francisco waterfront, and the overhead shot of the cab driving through San Francisco were CG, as was the shot <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> traffic from the tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. A time-lapse sequence of {{the building of the}} Transamerica Pyramid was a hybrid of 2D and 3D matte painting. The shot was initially created using reference photos of the Pyramid taken from the rooftop of Francis Ford Coppola's Sentinel Building. MWD's visual effects supervisor, Craig Barron, then researched the Pyramid's original construction techniques for accuracy in the animated sequence to imply the passage of time within the film's story.|$|E

500|$|Williams {{went on to}} add: If {{you really}} analyze that, the most {{inspiration}} is probably deep inside a synesthesiac. So for us, 'seeing sounds' is what we relate to the most. We figured we'd make an album out of it. Energy and emotion was the criteria , but we made the music anticipating the [...] show. That {{was the most important}} thing… 'Spaz' is [...] old school, hip hop feeling with some drum and bass. It becomes a big, tall monster. It's almost like this big gorilla <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> you. If he smacks you, he kills you. His fingers are the size of your body. That's kinda what we're doing. We're facing this big monster of, of what we know is out there, of what we see, that big monster of energy.|$|E
500|$|Posin {{stated that}} one {{theme of the}} film is that [...] "the adults in this world tend to be {{immature}} or childish and the kids tend to be very mature and adult and sophisticated for their age". He shot the teenage characters slightly below eye level to create the impression of looking up at an adult, and shot the adults slightly above eye level as if the viewer were <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a child. He said that hypocrisy was [...] "at the top of the list" [...] of the themes he wanted to explore in the story. While all of the adults in the film are attempting to live perfect lives, they cannot see that their children are driven to suicide, antidepressant addiction and kidnapping [...] for instance, Terri is so obsessed with her upcoming wedding that she does not realize her son is missing.|$|E
500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I think I could have done better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like it when you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for." ...|$|E

500|$|The final episode, 1995, sees Nicky, who has {{emigrated to}} Italy, {{returning}} to Newcastle {{to oversee the}} funeral of his mother. Tosker has managed to rebuild his business {{and is about to}} hold the opening night of his new floating nightclub, based on a boat moored on the River Tyne (filmed on the real club the Tuxedo Princess). Mary, now a Labour Member of Parliament sympathetic to New Labour, is also invited to the opening, and Tosker is surprised to find Geordie back in the city as well; he has escaped from prison. Neither Mary nor Geordie make it to the opening night party, but the four friends are reunited the following day at Nicky's house after his mother's funeral. Tosker leaves to be with his grandchildren, and Mary leaves after agreeing to meet Nicky for lunch the next day. However, a desperate Nicky realises that [...] "tomorrow's too late" [...] and runs after Mary's car. He eventually attracts her attention and breathlessly asks, [...] "Why not today?" [...] to which she agrees, smiling. Meanwhile, Geordie walks off, and the series ends with him heading off into the distance across the Tyne Bridge after <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Tosker playing with his grandchildren on the boat below. As Geordie walks away and the credits fade up, the music of [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] by Oasis is heard.|$|E
500|$|... "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] is a bass solo by Burton, {{accompanied}} on drums by Ulrich. A {{staple of}} Burton's live performances since {{his high school}} days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive [...] "lead-bass" [...] style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as [...] "Bass solo, take one", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: [...] "We heard this wild solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He was <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his bass, playing." [...] "Whiplash" [...] was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that [...] "Whiplash" [...] signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: [...] "If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene the two girls are {{returning}} from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning attribute, a lamb with a cruciform halo, and carrying a martyr's palm. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the Prefect of Rome, who has {{fallen in love with}} Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ {{on the inside of the}} cover. Agnes [...] rejects him, with the words Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels. [...] The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a brothel for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess Vesta. Caxton's Legend fills in the intervening action: Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great clearness that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all abashed, he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. And when he came to the clearness, he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead. In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a banderole reads Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", [...] ), and the Prefect looks on sadly.|$|E
