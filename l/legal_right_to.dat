5|$|All {{of these}} {{positions}} were nominally {{appointed by the}} Emperor and their holders were answerable directly to him. Nevertheless, from 1936 the Japanese Army and Navy held, effectively, a <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> nominate (or refuse to nominate) their respective ministers.

5|$|The {{case went}} to trial in June 1982 in Philadelphia. Judge Albert F.

Due to Abu-Jamal's continued disruptive behavior, Sabo ruled that Abu-Jamal forfeited his right to self-representation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} if Swift allowed Faulkner {{to publish the}} works {{in order to allow}} an Irish publisher to compete against an English publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to Motte in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> publish the works but made sure to admonish the attitude and action of Motte as a publisher for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that Faulkner would be allowed to reprint the copyrighted material.|$|E
5|$|The unequal {{concentration}} of land ownership remained an emotional subject and was violently challenged in the 1880s through the Highland Land League. After {{the report of}} the Napier Commission of 1883, the government stepped in, passing the Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886 to reduce rents, guarantee fixity of tenure, and break up large estates to provide crofts for the homeless. Explicit security was given for the Scottish smallholders; the <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> bequeath tenancies to descendants and a Crofting Commission was created in 1886.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E

5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won the <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> {{be shown}} in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander {{in the form of}} pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{rejected}} the plaintiffs' argument that, by compulsorily acquiring a temple, the Government was limiting a person's right under Article 15(1) of the Constitution to profess, practice and propagate {{his or her}} religion, and that this in turn gave him or her the <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> commence an action {{on the ground that}} where an individual's constitutional rights are affected, he or she has a sufficient interest to ensure that his or her rights are protected. The court ruling held that this land acquisition matter was not in any way related to religious freedom. Because the acquisition was not related to religious freedom, the High Court found that only the trustees who were the legal owners of the temple property had the requisite locus standi to institute proceedings if they deemed their rights to have been infringed.|$|E
5|$|Under French law, both Sally and James {{could have}} petitioned for their freedom, as the 1789 revolutionary {{constitution}} in France abolished slavery in principle. Hemings had the <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> remain in France {{as a free}} person; if she returned to Virginia with Jefferson, {{it would be as}} a slave. According to her son Madison's memoir, Hemings became pregnant by Jefferson in Paris. She was about 16 at the time. She agreed to return with him to the United States based on his promise to free their children when they reached the age of 21 years. Hemings' strong ties to her mother, siblings and extended family probably drew her back to Monticello.|$|E

5|$|During the 2014–15 season, Luton Town had {{an average}} home league {{attendance}} of 8,702—the second highest in League Two behind only Portsmouth. In the 2013–14 season, when the club were in the Conference Premier, the club had significantly higher support than the other clubs in its league, with an average home attendance of 7,387; more than twice compared to the second highest of 3,568. Average attendances at Kenilworth Road fell with the installation of seats and the club's reduction in stature, dropping from 13,452 in 1982–83 to their 2014–15 level—a slump of 35% over 32 years. A supporters' trust, Trust in Luton, owns shares in the club and elects a representative to the club's board. The club's official supporters' group, Luton Town Supporters' Club, merged with Trust in Luton in 2014. The club is associated with another supporters' group, the breakaway Loyal Luton Supporters Club. Trust in Luton has, since March 2014, held the <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> veto any changes to the club's identity, including name, nickname, colours, club crest and mascot.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes, the first containing the Drapier's Letters, in the Dublin Journal. However, this edition {{led to the}} Motte v Faulkner (1735) lawsuit, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had publication rights, under British copyright legislation, {{to many of the}} works included in Faulkner's edition. Although the Drapier's Letters were not under copyright, the complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in England by a ruling on 28 November 1735. It is uncertain if Swift allowed Faulkner to publish the works to allow an Irish publisher to compete against a British publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to Motte in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> publish the works. Instead, Swift admonished Motte for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that would allow Faulkner to reprint the copyrighted material.|$|E
5|$|Thanks {{to popular}} support within Poland, {{as well as}} to {{international}} support and media coverage, the Gdańsk workers held out until the government gave in to their demands. On August 21 a Governmental Commission (Komisja Rządowa) including Mieczysław Jagielski arrived in Gdańsk, and another one with Kazimierz Barcikowski was dispatched to Szczecin. On August 30 and 31, and on September 3, representatives of the workers and the government signed an agreement ratifying many of the workers' demands, including the right to strike. This agreement {{came to be known as}} the August or Gdańsk agreement (Porozumienia sierpniowe). Other agreements were signed in Szczecin (the Szczecin Agreement of August 30), and Jastrzębie-Zdrój on September 3. It was called the Jastrzębie Agreement (Porozumienia jastrzebskie) and as such is regarded as part of the Gdańsk agreement. Though concerned with labor-union matters, the agreement enabled citizens to introduce democratic changes within the communist political structure and was regarded as a first step toward dismantling the Party's monopoly of power. The workers' main concerns were the establishment of a labor union independent of communist-party control, and recognition of a <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> strike. Workers' needs would now receive clear representation. Another consequence of the Gdańsk Agreement was the replacement, in September 1980, of Edward Gierek by Stanisław Kania as Party First Secretary.|$|E
