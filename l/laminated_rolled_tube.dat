Overall, the numbers of xylanolytic bacteria producing greater than 5 -mm-diameter zones of clearing on 0. 24 % xylan <b>roll</b> <b>tube</b> medium after 24 to 36 h of incubation were 1. 6 X 10 (8) and 4. 2 X 10 (8) /g (dry weight) of feces for the control pigs and those fed the high-fiber diet, respectively.

Total number of organisms by microscopic bacterial counts varied among fecal samples from 4. 48 X 10 (10) to 7. 40 X 10 (10) bacteria/g (wet weight). Comparison of different nonselective <b>roll</b> <b>tube</b> media indicated that about 30 % of the fecal bacteria could be recovered with a rumen fluid (40 %, vol/vol) medium (M 98 - 5). Recoveries of 21 and 15 %, respectively, were obtained with M 10 and rumen fluid-glucose-cellobiose agar (RGCA) media. Rumen fluid, Trypticase, sugars, and CO 2 gas phase were important components required for maximum recovery with this medium. Similar high recoveries of anaerobes were also obtained with M 98 - 5 containing swine cecal extract of place in rumen fluid or M 10 plus swine cecal extract. Significantly lower recoveries were observed with RCGA, media supplemented with swine fecal extracts, reinforced clostridial medium, brain heart infusion agar, and prereduced blood agar. Ninety percent of the bacteria isolated from <b>roll</b> <b>tube</b> media were gram positive and consisted of facultatively anaerobic streptococci, Eubacterium sp., Clostridium sp., and Propionibacterium acnes. The remainder of the flora (8 %) included several other species of anaerobes and Escherichia coli.

Variation in the relative proportions of the predominant fecal microflora was observed.

However, the minimum value of the ratio of storage modulus reached for gap delta = 5 mm suggests that gluten network structuration is improved in this case.

40|$|Shortly after Koch's plating {{methods were}} introduced, there was {{developed}} by Esmarch (1886) a procedure for spreading the solid films inside <b>tubes.</b> The Esmarch <b>roll</b> <b>tube</b> culture is fa-miliar to bacteriologists, although {{it does not appear}} to have found general favor. In recent years the method was placed on a strictly quantitative basis by Wilson (1922), who found it advantageous in elaborate counts for statistical work. Roll-tube cultures are more convenient than plate cultures for many purposes. It is possible that they would be more widely used if they required less manual dexterity and practice in preparation, and were suitable for the variety of media which can be used in the regulation plating method. In order to be incubated, examined, and counted satisfactorily, the film must be hard, adhering to the tube and free from wrinkles; it should not be thick at the base of the tube, and should not splash on the cotton plug. Esmarch developed the technic primarily for gelatin. Wilson used a hard, 2. 5 per cent agar, which involves a high inoculating temperature. For critical studies of marine organisms at this laboratory it was necessary to make viable counts at sea, preferably by a procedure permitting subsequent transfer of colonies. Petri dish cultures cannot be handled conveniently on board ship. Some have used tables hung on gimbals, similar to a compass mounting, for the solidification, but this arrangement is a make-shift.
