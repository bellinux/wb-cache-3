In particular the spandrel walls are subjected to both in-plane and out-of- plane actions: the former mainly due to shear and the latter due to the filling thrust or earthquake excitation. The proposed techniques concern the application on the masonry surface of a GFRP reinforced <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> <b>cement</b> <b>mortar</b> coating or a reinforced repointing with a net of stainless strands. Some experimental diagonal compression tests evidenced the significant effectiveness of the first technique to shear.

40|$|Workability of masonry mortar is an {{important}} concern for masons, contractors and producers of mortar, in new construction {{as well as for}} restoration. The definition of workability has been an issue in the literature on building materials for the last decades, and attracted special attention from normalising institutions, with the predominant aim to develop suitable measuring methods. When applied to different types of mortar, the shortcomings of these methods often appear. We attempt to provide a basis for the definition of workability starting from a medium scale practical experiment with six masons and six different types of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> <b>cement</b> <b>mortars.</b> It appears that, despite the obvious existence of personal and national or regional accents, a general correspondence {{can be found in the}} masons' appreciation of different mortars. The preferences of a group of the test panel are consistent, and allow to draw up a series of properties, which together give a complete image of workability. The analysis of the results leads to the classification of these properties in rheology, hygric properties and density, which interact in a complex manner. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Damages {{existing}} in masonry engineering structures {{are caused by}} various loads {{and has to be}} repair because of structural and architectural requirements. Repair of cracked masonries using materials of high stiffness and low deformability, like <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> or epoxy resins, does not increase significantly the tensile strength of the repair joint. This is because of the stress concentration occurrence. The use of highly deformable bonding materials allows reducing peaks of stress concentration, causing (after repair) increase of strength of cracked masonry elements. Proposed repair materials of high deformability can be easily covered with original masonry material to ensure protection of architectural value. In the paper, there were tested masonry units (bricks), investigated in two kinds of loading. One of them was the four point bending test on Polish Bonarka bricks and the second one was the Single Lap Shear Test on Italian Rosso Vivo- A 6 R 55 W bricks, strengthened using CFRP and SRP strips bonded on epoxy resin. In both cases, the primary failure appeared in form of cracks (or detachment) going through the brick materials. The failure surfaces of both tests were repaired using materials of low and high deformability. More significant strength increase of the tested masonry elements (after repair) was obtained {{in the case of the}} use of highly deformable interface materials than of barely deformable bonding materials. Efficiency of highly deformable repair materials was also examined as repair on cracked masonry walls in laboratory using polymer injection and externally bonded composite mats made of glass fibers bonded on highly deformable polymer. Additionally, the highly deformable polymer joints were tested dynamically in situ on a masonry building, up to failure also...|$|R

Romano in Garfagnana (Lucca, Italy) - have been analysed to characterise their binder and aggregate fractions. The chemical, mineralogical, petrographic and physical data collected on the bulk mortar samples show that the stone walls were built up using different mortars. The mortars with a hydraulic-binder are prevailing on those with an air-hardening lime binder. The older mortars, coming from the walls built before the XV century, were produced mixing lime putty with locally available sands. They are characterized by a sandy aggregate with grain size from medium to very coarse and {{by a number of}} snow-white lumps, due to a not complete mixing between binder and aggregate. This last feature suggests that the mortars were prepared, as it was usual in ancient times, hand-mixing the lime putty added to the sand.

Abstract Earth block walling has the lowest environmental impacts of any masonry material. Its embodied carbon dioxide can be one tenth that of fired bricks or autoclaved blocks. It can be recycled and locally made with limited technology thus reducing {{the environmental impacts of}} transport. Earth blocks can be made from waste earth produced as a by-product of other construction activities. The particular advantage of earth block walling over other earth construction methods, lies in the prefabrication of the masonry units. The production process is less weather dependent and the blocks are fully shrunk so that dimensional changes in the completed walls are less severe. Blocks can be pre-tested for strength and durability prior to their inclusion in the building. This gives greater certainty in design. Earth block walling has the potential to replace conventional masonry in a significant proportion of UK dwellings. This thesis examines earth block walling from a practitioner's point of view. From design through to block production and site construction, it considers the obstacles to its wider use. It emphasises the cost penalties of earth block walling, believed to be the principal reason for its decline and its limited revival. It examines options for earth block production through case studies of earth block producers in France, the USA and the UK and assesses their potential for reducing production costs Earth mortars are also assessed and tested for strength. The cost savings of earth slurry mortars are considered both in terms of the speed of construction and the possibilities for reducing the thickness of walls by utilising the higher flexural bond strengtiis available with slurry mortars. Earth slurry mortars are tested for flexural bond strength. The results indicate that slurry mortars can offer considerable improvements in flexural bond strength particularly where the mortar is reinforced. Through these improvements in flexural strength comes the possibility of reducing the overall wall thickness which could offer significant cost savings over thick joint techniques using earth <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> <b>cement</b> <b>mortars.</b> Earthen codes current in the USA and France are reviewed and compared with UK Building Regulations and masonry design codes to identify the additional costs associated with earth design in the UK. It concludes that the absence of a specific earthen code in the UK is a major obstacle to the revival of earth as a contemporary construction material. This thesis wresties with the dilemma of whether earth blocks should be produced on a local, small scale, using limited technology, thereby maximising the enviroimiental benefits; or whether the commercial benefits of mass production can offer economic viability without compromising the environmental advantages. It finds that the argument turns on the question of transportation and the distance between the production facility and the site of use. This thesis identifies the principal obstacles to the wider use of earth block walling. It emphasises the high cost of earth block constraction and the limited scope for reducing these costs down to that of conventional masonry. It identifies a need for greater fiscal and regulatory mtervention to tip the economic balance in favour of natural, low carbon materials such as earth block. It quantifies the environmental benefits of earth block wallmg and sets these against the additional costs involved...|$|R
