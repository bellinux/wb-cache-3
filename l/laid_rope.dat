2500|$|Fossilised {{fragments}} of [...] "probably two-ply <b>laid</b> <b>rope</b> of about 7 mm diameter" [...] {{have been found}} in one of the caves at Lascaux, dated about 15,000 BC. Egyptian rope dates back to 4000 to 3500 BC and was generally made of water reed fibers. Other rope in antiquity was made from the fibers of date palms, flax, grass, papyrus, leather, or animal hair. [...] Rope made of hemp fibres was in use in China from about 2800 BC.|$|E

50|$|The shroud knot is a {{multi-strand}} {{bend knot}} used to join two ends of laid (or twisted) rope together. Shroud knots, in general, are {{a class of}} knots {{in which the individual}} strands of <b>laid</b> <b>rope</b> are knotted, but not woven, to the individual strands of another <b>laid</b> <b>rope.</b> This makes them more secure than a simple bend but less secure than a full splice.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, a three strand <b>laid</b> <b>rope</b> {{is called}} a plain- or hawser-laid, a four strand rope is called shroud-laid, and a larger rope formed by counter-twisting three or more {{multi-strand}} ropes together is called cable-laid.|$|E
5|$|At 1:55p.m., {{just before}} the start of the war, a {{reconnaissance}} force swam to the east bank of the Suez Canal, two kilometers south of Fort Lahtzanit, and <b>laid</b> two <b>ropes</b> across the canal to facilitate the crossing of friendly forces. At 2:05p.m., as Operation Badr began, an artillery barrage was initiated against the fort using just the 85mm guns and B-10 recoilless rifles of the brigade's anti-tank company; the use of high trajectory artillery guns was forbidden since a number of Egyptian aircraft were flying over this area.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was said}} by the {{surviving}} members of McDonnell's team that {{he refused to}} descend because he was helping the others that were injured. Expedition leader Wilco van Rooijen, a 40-year-old Dutch climber who was airlifted to a military hospital in Pakistan after surviving the accident, said that poor preparations had contributed to the disaster. He suggested that advance climbers <b>laid</b> <b>ropes</b> in the wrong places on the mountain, hampering the climb of several teams of mountaineers and ultimately contributing to deaths {{of three of the}} climbers on his team. [...] "Everything was going well to camp four, and on summit attempt, everything went wrong," [...] said van Rooijen from his hospital bed in the Northern Pakistani town of Skardu. [...] "The biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements. Everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised. With such stupid things, lives are endangered." [...] He singled out another team for only bringing half the length of rope they were supposed to. Ger McDonnell's satellite phone was given to Pemba on the summit and he brought it along with McDonnell's camera back to base camp. Mr McDonnell's partner, brother JJ and sister Denise flew to Islamabad in search of answers. Whilst McDonnell's body was not recovered, a memorial service was held in Kilcornan on 17 August 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Herb and Jan usually {{seek the}} easiest and most direct routes {{to the top of}} the most {{striking}} rock formations. Before the development of specialized climbing shoe, harnesses or protection, like nuts and cams, they climbed in cheap smooth-soled tennis shoes with 80-foot <b>laid</b> nylon <b>rope</b> tied around their waist and used US army [...] scavenged at Seneca Rocks after World War II. They used body belays and down-climbed their routes instead of rappelling, if it was not possible to walk-off. Despite of this they established many routes that would be challenging and terrifying to today's climbers.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{error in}} tying {{can be avoided}} by assuring that the turns {{are made in the}} working part around itself. [...] When making the hitch in <b>laid</b> <b>rope,</b> the turns should be made with the lay of the rope, that is, in the same {{direction}} as the twist of the rope.|$|E
5000|$|One {{property}} of <b>laid</b> <b>rope</b> is partial untwisting when used. This can cause spinning of suspended loads, or stretching, , or [...] {{of the rope}} itself. An additional drawback of twisted construction is that every fibre is exposed to abrasion numerous times {{along the length of}} the rope. This means that the rope can degrade to numerous inch-long fibre fragments, which is not easily detected visually.|$|E

50|$|The {{admiralty}} rope-works {{was established}} at Oostenburg and was approximately 300 meters in length. Because of the <b>ropes</b> <b>laid</b> alongside each other, sometimes at lengths {{of up to}} 220 meters, it was called a kuil or net. Old rope was also hung up, to provide oakum for closing up the seams between ships' boards.|$|R
50|$|The Ashley Book of Knots was {{compiled}} and first published before {{the introduction of}} synthetic fiber ropes, {{during a time when}} natural fiber cordage - typically twisted, <b>laid,</b> or braided <b>rope</b> - was most commonly used. The commentary on some knots may fail to address their behavior when tied with modern synthetic fiber or kernmantle style ropes.|$|R
50|$|Plaited rope {{is made by}} {{braiding}} twisted strands, and is {{also called}} square braid. It is not as round as twisted rope and coarser to the touch. It is less prone to kinking than twisted rope and, depending on the material, very flexible and therefore easy to handle and knot. This construction exposes all fibres as well, with the same drawbacks as described above. Brait rope {{is a combination of}} braided and plaited, a non-rotating alternative to <b>laid</b> three-strand <b>ropes.</b> Due to its excellent energy-absorption characteristics, it is often used by arborists. It is also a popular rope for anchoring and can be used as mooring warps. This type of construction was pioneered by Yale Cordage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Laid</b> <b>rope,</b> {{also called}} twisted rope, is {{historically}} the prevalent form of rope, {{at least in}} modern western history. Common twisted rope generally consists of three strands and is normally right-laid, or given a final right-handed twist. The ISO 2 standard uses the uppercase letters S and Z to indicate the two possible directions of twist, {{as suggested by the}} direction of slant of the central portions of these two letters. The handedness of the twist is the direction of the twists as they progress away from an observer. Thus Z-twist rope is said to be right-handed, and S-twist to be left-handed.|$|E
5000|$|The ropewalk at Chatham Dockyard (as {{part of the}} Ropery or Ropehouse) {{is still}} {{producing}} rope commercially and has an internal length of 1,135 ft (346 m). When it was constructed in 1790, it was the longest brick building in Europe. Before steam power was introduced in 1836, it took over 200 men to form and close a 20-inch (circumference) cable <b>laid</b> <b>rope.</b> [...] The rope walk is used to form and close the rope, these being the final stages in rope making. Before this the raw hemp, manila hemp or sisal has to be , spun into yarn, and tarred.|$|E
5000|$|Tools are {{sometimes}} {{employed in the}} finishing or untying of a knot, such as a fid, a tapered piece of wood that is often used in splicing. With the advent of wire rope, many other tools {{are used in the}} tying of [...] "knots." [...] However, for cordage and other non-metallic appliances, the tools used are generally limited to sharp edges or blades such as a sheepsfoot blade, occasionally a fine needle for proper whipping of <b>laid</b> <b>rope,</b> a hot cutter for nylon and other synthetic fibers, and (for larger ropes) a shoe for smoothing out large knots by rolling them on the ground.|$|E
50|$|The ban'ei course {{consists}} of a 200-metre (660 ft) dirt track with lanes separated by <b>ropes</b> <b>laid</b> in the sand. This creates ten lanes, each incorporating a starting gate and two hill-shaped obstacles. The second and steeper obstacle is called the Ban'ei Point. Horses haul sleds across this track, {{with the weight of}} each sled ranging from 450 kg (990 lb) to 1 ton, as seen in the Ban'ei Kinen event.|$|R

25|$|On 18 April 1987, the Pakistani {{troops at}} Quaid Post fired on the Indian {{soldiers}} at Sonam (6,400 m), killing two of them. The Indian Army then launched {{a plan to}} evict the Pakistanis from the Quaid Post. The 8th Battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (8th JAK LI) was given the task of capturing the Quaid Post. On May 29, a 13-member JAK LI patrol led by Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pande was asked to identify the best approach route to the Post, and mark it with ropes. The group started climbing the ice wall leading to the Quaid Post, but were detected by the Pakistani soldiers, when it was just 30 m from the top. The Pakistanis opened fire with a heavy machine gun, killing ten Indian soldiers, including Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pande. Before they were killed, the Indian soldiers managed to establish a number of footholds on the vertical ice wall with a pick axe, and had <b>laid</b> a <b>rope</b> to the top.|$|R
5000|$|Fishing nets {{have not}} evolved greatly, and many {{contemporary}} fishing nets would be recognized {{for what they}} are in Neolithic times. However, the fishing lines from which the nets are constructed have hugely evolved.

5000|$|The use of ropes for hunting, pulling, fastening, attaching, carrying, lifting, and {{climbing}} {{dates back to}} prehistoric times. It {{is likely that the}} earliest [...] "ropes" [...] were naturally occurring lengths of plant fibre, such as vines, followed soon by the first attempts at twisting and braiding these strands together to form the first proper ropes in the modern sense of the word. Impressions of cordage found on fired clay provide evidence of string and rope-making technology in Europe dating back 28,000 years. [...] Fossilized fragments of [...] "probably two-ply <b>laid</b> <b>rope</b> of about 7 mm diameter" [...] were found in one of the caves at Lascaux, dating to approximately 15,000 BC.|$|E
5000|$|Two <b>ropes</b> <b>laid</b> down a ramp {{attached}} to a raised platform. A barrel is rolled onto the ropes and the ropes are passed over the barrel and handed to two workers {{at the top of}} the ramp. The workers pull the ropes together to get the barrel to the top. The barrel is a movable pulley and the MA = 2. If there is enough friction where the rope is pinched between the barrel and the ramp, the pinch point becomes the attachment point. This is considered a fixed attachment point because the rope above the barrel does not move relative to the ramp. Alternatively the ends of the rope can be {{attached to}} the platform.|$|R

50|$|An Arresting gear, or {{arrestor}} gear, is {{a mechanical}} system used to rapidly decelerate an aircraft as it lands. Arresting gear on aircraft carriers {{is an essential}} component of naval aviation, and it is most commonly used on CATOBAR and STOBAR aircraft carriers. Similar systems are also found at land-based airfields for expeditionary or emergency use. Typical systems consist of several steel wire <b>ropes</b> <b>laid</b> across the aircraft landing area, designed to be caught by an aircraft's tailhook. During a normal arrestment, the tailhook engages the wire and the aircraft's kinetic energy is transferred to hydraulic damping systems attached below the carrier deck. There are other related systems which use nets to catch aircraft wings or landing gear. These barricade and barrier systems are only used for emergency arrestments for aircraft without operable tailhooks.|$|R
5000|$|The cove and slipway are privately owned, but {{the public}} are {{permitted}} to quietly and respectfully enjoy them. Swimming in the cove is quite safe, provided swimmers do not go beyond the headland where there are dangerous, strong sea currents. At {{the foot of the}} cove's slipway is a tunnel dug by tin miners from St Just to give farmers horse-and-cart access to the beach to collect seaweed to use as a fertiliser. A second tunnel, leading seawards, is the fishermen's access to the tidal 'hulleys' built in the rocks to store shellfish. The 'hulleys', which ceased being used about 20 years ago, had wooden floors and topcovers with trapdoors and were used to store shellfish prior to taking the catch to market once or twice a week.

60|$|They had the {{uncoiling}} {{wire rope}} to drag {{them back into}} line, the stream swept them down a fathom for every one they made ahead, and, as ill luck would have it, bore upon the launch's pressed down side {{so that they could}} hear the water gurgling into her in ever faster swirl. Still, they had to reach the opposite bank, or be hauled back to commence the task again, and, gasping and panting, they heaved on the wet rope that led into the rain ahead. Most of them were used to work of that kind, but during the first five minutes Austin felt his arms grow weary and nerveless, and the veins distend on his forehead, while a curious singing commenced in his ears. He choked with every fresh grasp he <b>laid</b> upon the <b>rope,</b> and a Canario behind him gasped out breathless snatches of Castilian obscenity.|$|R

50|$|More of a family/children's event than a pure competition, night {{shooting}} {{consists of}} archers {{going out on}} a short, one round course using flashlights to light their way through the course and use the lights to shine the targets which often have reflective tape or paint on them. The course, <b>laid</b> out and <b>roped</b> off in advance before dark, is designed to keep all participants safe. The distances to the targets are very short, often not more than twenty yards (18.28 metres) and the targets are typically quite large in size. In some cases there can be two shooting distance markers: a far one for adults, and a short one for children; the rules do allow for children to move closer if necessary in order to shoot. The short shooting distances are necessary since, at night, complete misses would mean the loss of an arrow(s). Though there is no inherent practical purposes for night shooting, it is just a different form of competition that is enjoyably fun. There are two variants: the Monster Shoot and the Raccoon Shoot.|$|R

The judge offered the sailor a full pardon if he could show him a knot that he, the judge, could neither tie nor untie.The sailor called for ten fathoms of rope and, having retired to the privacy of his cell, unlaid the rope halfway, put in a MATTHEW WALKER KNOT, and then <b>laid</b> up the <b>rope</b> again to the end.So Matthew Walker secured his pardon, and the world gained an excellent knot.|$|R
