25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{deposits of}} nahcolite (NaHCO3) {{are found in}} the Eocene-age (55.8–33.9 Mya) Green River Formation, Piceance Basin in Colorado. Nahcolite was deposited as beds during periods of high evaporation in the basin. It is commercially mined using common underground mining techniques such as bore, drum, and <b>longwall</b> <b>mining</b> in a fashion very similar to coal mining. A very small portion is also obtained using in situ leach techniques involving dissolution of the nahcolite by heated water pumped through the nahcolite beds that have previously been mined using the aforementioned techniques. It is then reconstituted through a natural cooling crystallization process. Currently only Tronox (formerly FMC) in the Green River Wyoming basin has successfully commercially solution mined the product.|$|E
25|$|Improvements in mining methods (e.g. <b>longwall</b> <b>mining),</b> {{hazardous}} gas monitoring (such as safety-lamps or {{more modern}} electronic gas monitors), gas drainage, electrical equipment, and ventilation have reduced {{many of the}} risks of rock falls, explosions, and unhealthy air quality. Gases released during the mining process can be recovered to generate electricity and improve worker safety with gas engines. Another innovation {{in recent years is}} the use of closed circuit escape respirators, respirators that contain oxygen for situations where mine ventilation is compromised. Statistical analyses performed by the US Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds. However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, even in 2006, mining remained the second most dangerous occupation in America, when measured by fatality rate. However, these numbers include all mining, with oil and gas mining contributing the majority of fatalities; coal mining resulted in only 47 fatalities that year.|$|E
500|$|A new {{headgear}} {{and winding}} engine were {{built at the}} Deep pit shaft; ventilation was by means of two axial-type fans installed in an underground chamber. After 1947 a [...] tunnel [...] below ground level was driven to the Stuart Street Power Station, to provide coal direct from the colliery. A conveyor within the tunnel delivered 200 long tons (224 short tons) of small coal an hour to the power station's bunker. Most of the developments begun by Manchester Collieries were completed after nationalisation in 1947 by the National Coal Board (NCB). After modernisation and reconstruction, coal was extracted by <b>longwall</b> <b>mining</b> using coal-cutting machinery and conveyors. This type of mining creates a void or goaf into which the roof is allowed to collapse. At Bradford, which had no spoil heap, the goaf was infilled with spoil or waste. As there was insufficient spoil to fill the void, some was brought from other pits. The NCB incorporated the takes, or coal reserves, of Moston and Ashton Moss Collieries into the redeveloped Bradford Colliery. Moston was closed, but the shafts of Ashton Moss were retained for winding men and equipment.|$|E
40|$|Mine dust {{is one of}} {{the main}} hazards in {{underground}} <b>longwall</b> <b>mines</b> worldwide. In order to solve the mine dust problem, a significant number of studies have been carried out regarding <b>longwall</b> <b>mine</b> dust control, both in China and Australia. This paper presents a comparative study of dust control practices in Chinese and Australian <b>longwall</b> <b>mines,</b> with particular references to statutory limits, dust monitoring methods and dust management practices, followed by a brief discussion on the research status of <b>longwall</b> <b>mine</b> dust control in both countries. The study shows that water infusion, face ventilation controls, water sprays, and deep and wet cutting in longwall shearer operations are commonly practiced in almost all underground <b>longwall</b> <b>mines</b> and that both Chinese and Australian <b>longwall</b> <b>mine</b> dust control practices have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is concluded that there is a need for further development and innovative design of more effective dust mitigation products or systems despite the development of various dust control technologies. Based on the examinations and discussions, the authors have made some recommendations for further research and development in dust control in <b>longwall</b> <b>mines.</b> It is hoped that this comparative study will provide beneficial guidance for scholars and engineers who are engaging in <b>longwall</b> <b>mine</b> dust control research and practice...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Longwall</b> <b>mining</b> {{accounts}} for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of [...] or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically {{back and forth across}} a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the <b>longwall</b> <b>mining</b> equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Longwall</b> <b>mining</b> - A set of <b>longwall</b> <b>mining</b> {{equipment}} {{consists of}} a coal shearer mounted on conveyor operating underneath a series of self-advancing hydraulic roof supports. Almost the entire process can be automated. <b>Longwall</b> <b>mining</b> machines are typically 150-250 metres in width and 1.5 to 3 metres high. Longwall miners extract [...] "panels" [...] - rectangular blocks of coal {{as wide as the}} face the equipment is installed in, and as long as several kilometres. Powerful mechanical coal cutters (shearers) cut coal from the face, which falls onto an armoured face conveyor for removal. Longwalls can advance into an area of coal, or more commonly, retreat back between development tunnels (called [...] "gateroads") As a longwall miner retreats back along a panel, the roof behind the supports is allowed to collapse in a planned and controlled manner.|$|E

40|$|In <b>longwall</b> coal <b>mines,</b> {{the entries}} {{on both sides}} of the panel play a {{significant}} role in production rate and safety of operation. With increasing production amount, the rate of conveying material through such entries increases. Therefore, it is required to design wider entries. Support of these entries, particularly in deep mines is difficult. In this paper, by using FLAC 3 D program code a deep <b>longwall</b> coal <b>mine</b> is modeled. The coal seam has a strain softening property, and the analysis index of stress and deformation of ribsides and coal pillars at different loading levels are determined. Strain softening parameters is studied separately for each modeled coal pillar, and based on conventional formula the pillar strength are calculated. In a modeled <b>longwall</b> <b>mine,</b> the caving material at goaf zone are fully compact. The results shows that based on Mohr-Coulomb model, the strain softening occurs at maximum cohesion and friction, and at region of decreasing the strength of pillar in stress-strain curve. Because of 3 D nature of analyses, the effect of front and side abutment load on stability of pillar are studied simultaneously. Therefore, the results of this study could be suitable criteria for appraisal of pillar design method at deep <b>longwall</b> coal <b>mines...</b>|$|R
