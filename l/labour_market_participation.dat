Using time series estimation technique, we found no significant link between trade flows and employment in Nigeria both in the short-run and long run.

50|$|Ferragina {{suggests}} that, in the divergent cases, {{the value}} of the historical legacy is affected by the poor present socio-economic conditions. Social capital sleeps, not because of the absence of certain clearly defined historical steps as suggested by Putnam, but because socio-economic underdevelopment profoundly depressed the self-pride of Southern Italians and Walloons. The biased and simplistic interpretations of Southern Italian and Walloon history will be discarded only when their socio-economic conditions reach a sufficient level, enacting a cycle similar to Flanders and the North East of Italy. Stronger redistribution, an increase of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation</b> accompanied by a simultaneous process of 'reinvention of the past' could enhance a positive cycle of social capital increase in both areas. The historical legacy in these two areas should not be seen as the root of the present lack of social capital but as a potential element for improvement. Important moments of social engagement also existed in the history of these two areas; the imagery of Walloons and Southern Italians should be nourished by these almost forgotten examples of collective history (i.e. the Fasci Siciliani in the south of Italy) rather than the prevailing idea that the historical legacy of these areas is simply an original sin, a burden to carry through the process of modernization.|$|E
50|$|However, from {{a purely}} {{historical}} perspective, the medieval town is not unanimously {{considered to be}} a symbol of freedom, creation of horizontal ties and embryo of democratic life. In Making Democracy Work, Putnam disregarded the division within municipal towns and their dearth of civic participation and considered only the experience of few areas in North Central Italy, ignoring the existence of important towns in the South. To this more complicated historical picture, Ferragina (2012) added the result of a regression model, which indicated that social capital in the South of Italy and Wallonia should be much lower than currently detected according to their socio-economic condition. He unfolded Putnam's theory by undertaking a comparative analysis between these two deviant cases and two regular cases located in the same country, namely Flanders and the North of Italy. The historical legacy does not {{have a negative effect on}} the present lack of social capital in Wallonia and the South of Italy, but the potentially positive effect of the historical legacy is currently curtailed by the poor socio-economic conditions, notably by the high level of income inequality and the low level of <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation.</b> This historical interpretation is driven by the comparison with Flanders and the North East of Italy.|$|E

We answer this question by studying the effect on <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation</b> of a Norwegian family policy programme that clearly has affected the incentives {{to participate in the}} labour market of mothers with small children. From January 1999, all parents with one- and two-year-old children who did not use publicly subsidised day-care became entitled to a benefit, 'Cash-for-Care' ('CFC').

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation</b> {{among young}} adults is {{essential}} for their future socioeconomic status and health. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association between perceived stress among 20 – 21 year-olds and their <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation</b> 8 years later as well as investigate any potential gender differences. Methods A cohort of 1640 young adults born in 1983 completed a questionnaire in 2004 in which perceived stress was measured. The cohort was followed in a register of social benefits for 12  months in 2011 – 2012 and was categorized into active and passive <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation.</b> Logistic regression was used to analyse the association between perceived stress and future <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation,</b> taking into account effects of potential confounders. The analyses were stratified by gender. Results The effects of perceived stress on future <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation</b> differed significantly among young women and young men (p[*]=[*] 0. 029). For young men, higher levels of perceived stress reduced the risk of future passive <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation,</b> when adjusting for socioeconomic factors, self-rated health and copings strategies (p[*]=[*] 0. 045). For young women, higher levels of perceived stress increased the risk of future passive <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation,</b> when adjusting for the same potential confounding factors, although unlike the men, this association was not statistically significant (p[*]=[*] 0. 335).

The article focuses on the careers of the mothers: what are the influences of the educational attainment and the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation</b> of the mothers on the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation</b> of their daughters when the latter become mothers. To formulate hypotheses the Blau and Duncan model was used: by controlling for cohort effects, the higher the educational attainment of the mother, and the higher her <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation</b> when she has children, the higher the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>participation</b> of her daughter when the latter makes the transition into motherhood.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} lone mothers’ <b>participation</b> {{in active}} <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> programmes in Germany. Since the 2005 Hartz IV employment and welfare policy reforms, expectations that non-em- ployed parents receiving means-tested benefits {{should be ready}} for employment or <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> programme <b>participation</b> have grown stronger. However, discretion for programme assignments is left to individual caseworkers. As a consequence, {{it is not clear}} to what extent the formal policy orientation towards an adult worker model of the family is reflected in practical policy implemen- tations. Thus, lone mothers’ <b>participation</b> in active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> programmes is studied empiri- cally here on the basis of large-scale administrative data, using event-history analysis. Findings are that lone mothers are treated as adult workers with respect to workfare and training pro- grammes even when their children are still quite young. As soon as their youngest child is 3 - 5 years old, lone mothers’ transition rates into these programmes are as high as for childless single women. In the case of programmes that provide more direct pathways into regular employment, like job subsidies and in-firm training programmes, however, participation rates for lone mothers of young children are substantially lower than for childless single women. <br /...|$|R
