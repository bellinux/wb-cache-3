5|$|A {{number of}} naturalists have visited the island, {{starting}} with the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition to the Abrolhos Islands in 1913. This expedition spent <b>little</b> <b>time</b> on North Island, as shore collecting was not very successful there, and other islands appeared better suited to their work. Expedition members nevertheless published substantial information about the island, including a description of its physiography {{and a list of}} its vertebrates.|$|E

In a 1992 interview, he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{de-icing}} vehicles usually {{consist of}} a large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as <b>little</b> <b>time</b> as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean <b>little</b> <b>time</b> for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss is an important component of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E
5|$|Although Hogg spent <b>little</b> <b>time</b> at the Varner {{plantation}} after Bayou Bend was constructed, {{she continued}} to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and chair {{as well as his}} collection of walking sticks. She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was just}} {{thirty years old}} when the Revolutionary War ended, but his {{greatest}} military achievements were already behind him. After Clark's victories in the Illinois country, settlers continued to pour into Kentucky and live illegally on Indian land north of the Ohio River. From 1784 to 1788 Clark served as the superintendent-surveyor for Virginia's war veterans, surveying lands granted to them for their service in the war. The position brought Clark a small income, but he devoted very <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to the enterprise.|$|E

5|$|Drusus had <b>little</b> <b>time</b> {{to mourn}} or {{celebrate}} {{the death of}} his grandfather or the ascendance of Tiberius: the legions in the Rhine and Illyricum were in mutiny. They had not received the bonuses promised to them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon Germanicus, who dealt with the situation on the Rhine. Drusus did not require proconsular powers because he was consul designate.|$|E
5|$|In 1479, Báthory {{was made}} {{governor}} of Transylvania and in late August 1479, an Ottoman expedition from Bosnia, commanded by twelve pashas, invaded Transylvania {{with a force}} of 43,000 men. The Turks moved very quickly through the land while pillaging it, giving Báthory <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to gather his militia at Sibiu. Pál Kinizsi, the Ban of Timişoara, promised to aid Báthory. As Báthory approached Sebeş, Ali Bey, one of the Turkish pashas, had raised camp on a plain between Mureş and Sebeş, totally unaware that Kinizsi was also on his way against him.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, Egan (now {{bishop of}} Philadelphia) {{promoted}} de Barth {{to the position}} of Vicar General. Egan died shortly thereafter. Until a suitable bishop could be found, Carroll, now Archbishop of Baltimore, appointed de Barth as the apostolic administrator. De Barth tried to refuse this assignment, likely due to the ongoing disputes in Philadelphia between the clergy and the lay trustees of the city's parishes over who should control the churches, but he eventually accepted and took temporary control of the diocese. He spent <b>little</b> <b>time</b> in the city, leaving day-to-day control of the parishes there to Terrence McGill, a local priest.|$|E

5|$|In the new Taliesin, Wright {{worked to}} repair his {{tarnished}} reputation.

Although he later expanded the agricultural wing, Wright spent <b>little</b> <b>time</b> at the second Taliesin house, often living near his construction sites abroad. Instead of serving as a full-time residence, Wright treated Taliesin like an art museum for his collection of Asian works.

5|$|In this decade, Sullivan's {{conducting}} appointments {{included the}} Glasgow Choral Union concerts (1875–77) and the Royal Aquarium, London (1876). In {{addition to his}} appointment as Professor of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music, {{of which he was}} a Fellow, he was appointed as the first Principal of the National Training School for Music in 1876. He accepted the latter post reluctantly, fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too <b>little</b> <b>time</b> for composing. In this he was correct, as his successor Hubert Parry also discovered. Sullivan was not effective in the post, and he resigned in 1881.|$|E
