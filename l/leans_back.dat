5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images of military power {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski likens the memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down as if by a great weight. At the same time, the sheer size of the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense of strength and power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense of masculinity that pervades the work, from the phallic image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E
500|$|The 2016 movie Deadpool's post-credit {{scene is}} {{an homage to}} Ferris Bueller's post-credit scene. Deadpool {{is dressed in a}} robe and talks {{directly}} to the audience in a hallway that looks similar to the one in the movie. Similar to Ferris, Deadpool says [...] "You're still here? It's over. Go home." [...] At the end of the scene, Deadpool <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> into the frame from behind a doorway, and makes the [...] "Chicka-chickahhhh" [...] sound from Ferris Bueller.|$|E
500|$|On 22 March 2011, a short scene {{serving as}} a prequel for the first episode was {{released}} on the programme's website. In the prequel, Nixon receives {{a phone call from}} the little girl who keeps calling him in the episode. She begs for the President to look behind him, but he asks how she got that number, which the 'spaceman' told her. She tells him it is about monsters, to which he replies [...] "Young lady, there are no monsters in the Oval Office." [...] He then hangs up and <b>leans</b> <b>back.</b> Behind him stands an out-of-focus Silent.|$|E

500|$|The {{standing}} {{image is}} the focus of much discussion among historians and archaeologists, since there is a general belief {{that it is not a}} statue of the Buddha. The image is [...] tall, and stands on a low pedestal shaped like a lotus. It <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> in a relaxed manner, its arms folded across its chest. [...] The statue's face carries a sorrowful expression and the reclining image—which depicts the Buddha's parinirvana—lies next to it, which has led some to believe that it is the monk Ānanda, who is lamenting the Buddha's demise at his deathbed. [...] The remains of the walls, however, indicate that the two images were once in separate chambers, rather than next to each other. Paranavithana believes that the statue is of the Buddha, which depicts the para dukkha dukkhitha mudra or [...] "sorrow for the sorrow of others". However, this is a rarely used gesture in Sinhalese sculpture, and is seen at only a few locations in the country. Another possibility is that the image shows the Buddha during his second week after enlightenment, which he spent gazing at the Bodhi Tree in gratitude for providing him shelter. The image is not mentioned in the Chulavamsa, which only mentions the other three. While this may be an indication that it is not an image of the Buddha, it is also possible that it may have been made at an earlier period than the others.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920, a New York {{attorney}} {{whose daughter}} had received an unsolicited copy of The Little Review issue containing the [...] "Nausicaa" [...] episode of Ulysses {{brought it to}} the attention of John S. Sumner, secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. Sumner lodged a complaint in September 1920, and on October 4 Anderson and Heap were arrested and charged with obscenity for publishing [...] "Nausicaa" [...] in the 1920 July–August issue of The Little Review. [...] This episode was an account of protagonist Leopold Bloom fantasizing about a young girl named Gerty MacDowell who <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> to expose herself to Bloom. The scene culminates in Bloom’s orgasm, which legal historian Edward de Grazia, in Girls Lean Back Everywhere, argues would have likely escaped the average reader's notice due to Joyce’s metaphorical language.|$|E
2500|$|Most simply, {{he may be}} {{a subtle}} aside on the artist's status in society—he carries the palette that Hogarth made his trademark, which appears in several of his self-portraits. However he is {{painting}} a sign advertising gin, so his ragged appearance could equally reflect the rejection of the spirit by the people of Beer Street. He may be also be a resident of Gin Lane, and Hogarth includes him as a connection to the other scene, and as a suggestion that the government's initial policy of encouraging the distillation of gin may be the cause of both Gin Lane's ruin and Beer Street's prosperity. He is ignored by the inhabitants of Beer Street as they ignore the misery of Gin Lane itself. Paulson suggests that he is the lone [...] "beautiful" [...] figure in the scene. The corpulent types that populate Beer Street later featured as representations of ugliness in Hogarth's The Analysis of Beauty, while the painter, as he <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> to admire his work, forms the serpentine shape that Hogarth identified as the Line of Beauty.|$|E

2500|$|The skiff is {{designed}} for optimum performance and so the technique applied is important. The two fundamental reference points in the stroke are the catch where the blade {{is placed in the}} water, and the 'finish' where the blade is removed from the water. The skiffer leans forward, and bends the legs slightly. After placing the blade vertically in the water at the catch, he or she applies pressure to stretcher, levering the blade in the water on the thole and <b>leans</b> <b>back.</b> This is called the drive phase of the stroke. Once the skiffer has pushed the blade as far forward in the water as possible, he or she extracts the oar from the water, and the recovery phase begins, setting up the skiffer's body for the next stroke. On the recovery, it is normal to tip the blade flat (known as [...] "feathering"). There are some differences from the rowing stroke. The hands must never pass one above the other - one hand must always lead, or one of the blades will [...] "dig" [...] in the water. The seat does not slide and the unbending of the legs follows from the leaning back of the body. Finally skiffs are more stable so {{that it is possible to}} lean back further and keep the blade in the water for longer. The last extra distance provides considerable motive power to the boat, leading to the encouragement to [...] "squeeze the finish".|$|E
