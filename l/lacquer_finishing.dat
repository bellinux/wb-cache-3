5000|$|Yonezawa Isho-dansu: Tucked {{remotely}} {{into the}} snowy mountains of the Tohoku region, the castle town of Yonezawa developed a chest on chest style for clothing storage {{strongly influenced by}} the refined <b>lacquer</b> <b>finishing</b> techniques of the Mikune area of the Japan Sea coast.

50|$|UPM ProFi {{composite}} is a Biofore {{material that}} combines the best characteristics of cellulose fibres and plastic.

5000|$|Delicate and meticulous marquetry, {{produced}} {{since the}} Safavid period: at this time, khatam {{was so popular}} in the court that princes learned this technique {{at the same level}} of music or painting. In the 18th and 19th centuries, katahm declined, before being stimulated under the reign of Reza Shah, with the creation of craft schools in Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz. [...] "Khatam" [...] means [...] "incrustation", and [...] "Khatam-kari" [...] (خاتم‌کاری), [...] "incrustation work". This craft consists in the production of incrustation patterns (generally star shaped), with thin sticks of wood (ebony, teak, ziziphus, orange, rose), brass (for golden parts), camel bones (white parts). Ivory, gold or silver can also be used for collection objects. Sticks are assembled in triangular beams, themselves assembled and glued in a strict order to create a cylinder, 70 cm in diameter, whose cross-section is the main motif: a six-branch star included in a hexagon. These cylinders are cut into shorter cylinders, and then compressed and dried between two wooden plates, before being sliced for the last time, in 1 mm wide tranches. These sections are ready to be plated and glued on the object to be decorated, before <b>lacquer</b> <b>finishing.</b> The tranche can also be softened through heating in order to wrap around objects. Many objects can be decorated in this fashion, such as: jewellery/decorative boxes, chessboards, cadres, pipes, desks, frames or some musical instruments. Khatam can be used on Persian miniature, realizing true work of art.|$|E
