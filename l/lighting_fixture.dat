25|$|LED {{instruments}} can {{and have}} been used to replace any conventional <b>lighting</b> <b>fixture,</b> and some shows, such as Radiohead's recent tour, have used only LED lighting instruments. Most shows use LEDs only for lighting cycloramas, or as top, side, or back light due to their low throw distance. They can also be used as audience blinders (lights pointed directly at the audience from a low angle).|$|E
25|$|Moving {{lights are}} much more {{difficult}} to program than their conventional cousins because they have more attributes per fixture that must be controlled. A simple conventional <b>lighting</b> <b>fixture</b> uses only one channel of control per unit: intensity. Everything else that the light must do is pre-set by human hands (colour, position, focus, etc.) An automated <b>lighting</b> <b>fixture</b> can have as many as 30 of these control channels. A slew of products are available on the market to allow operators and programmers to easily control all of these channels on multiple fixtures. Lighting boards are still the most common control mechanism, but many programmers use computer software to do the job. Software is now available that provides a rendered preview of the output produced by the rig once fixtures are connected to the program or console. This allows programmers to work on their show before ever entering the theater and know what to expect when the lights are connected to their controller. These products usually feature some method of converting a computer's USB output to a DMX output.|$|E

2500|$|A {{tungsten}} lamp's colour {{is typically}} controlled by inserting {{one or more}} gels (filters) into its optical path. In the simplest case, a single gel is inserted into the optical path to produce light of the same color. For example, a blue gel is used to create blue light. Custom colours are obtained by means of subtractive CMY colour mixing, by inserting combinations of cyan, magenta and yellow filters into the optical path of the <b>lighting</b> <b>fixture.</b> The inserted filters may have varying densities, with correspondingly varied percentages of transmission, that subtractively mix colours.

2500|$|Ungrounded metal objects {{close to}} {{electric}} field {{sources such as}} neon signs or conductors carrying alternating currents can have measurable voltage levels caused by capacitive coupling. [...] Since voltages detected by high-impedance instruments disappear or become greatly reduced when a low impedance is substituted, the effect is sometimes called [...] phantom voltage (or ghost voltage). The term is often used by electricians, and might be seen, for example, when measuring the voltage at a <b>lighting</b> <b>fixture</b> after removing the bulb. [...] It is not unusual to measure phantom voltages of 50–90 volts when testing the wiring of ordinary 120V circuits with a high-impedance instrument. While the voltage produced may read almost to the full supply voltage, the capacitance or mutual inductance between the wires of building wiring systems is typically quite low and incapable of supplying significant amounts of current.|$|E

40|$|Digitally {{addressable}} {{lighting systems}} offer tremendous opportunities for performance {{monitoring and control}} of individual <b>light</b> <b>fixtures.</b> However, the locations of individual <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> within a building are not easily differentiable; as such, facility managers cannot easily distinguish and control each fixture. Virtual models contain semantic representation of objects which enable users to visually identify, distinguish and interactively monitor and control building components. To monitor and control <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> from these models, each physical fixture needs to be tightly integrated with its virtual representation such as to enable bi-directional coordination. Bi-directional coordination between virtual models and physical <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> offers tremendous opportunities for enhancing progress monitoring during construction, and performance monitoring and control during the operations and maintenance phase. Thus, this paper presents an approach to component-level cyber-physical systems integration using <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> as an example.
