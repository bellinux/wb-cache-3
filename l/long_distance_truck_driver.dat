The NGO North Star Alliance aims to alleviate this situ-ation by placing so-called Roadside Wellness Centers (RWCs) at busy truck stops along major truck routes. Currently, locations for new RWCs are chosen {{so as to}} maximize the expected patient volume and to ensure continuity of access along the routes. As North Star’s network grows larger, the objective to provide equal access to healthcare along the different truck routes gains importance.

Though the facility location problem is strongly NP-hard, our algorithm yields near-optimal solutions to large randomly generated problem in-stances within an acceptable amount of time.

40|$|Background: Despite high HIV {{prevalence}} amongst key {{populations in}} strategic travel corridors in Nigeria, {{there is still}} very low access to HIV and Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) services. Targeting men-who-have-sex-with-men, females who sell sex, <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> and those who live along the country’s transport corridors is vital for effective control of the HIV epidemic in Nigeria. Excellence and Friends Management Consult (EFMC) partnered with the Nigerian National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) to improve access to HIV, SRH services educate and test for HIV, and offer referral/treatment to HIV-infected individuals. We report on the need, process and outcome of this project. Methods: The Strategic Travelers Outreach Program (STOP) took place between February and August 2016 in Sagamu/Ogere and Obollo-Afor travel corridors. Through community advocacy and outreach, house-to-house, door-to-door and community/office testing, key populations were provided with targeted HIV, SRH and referral services. Results: Over 50, 000 people were contacted with HIV and SRH education/counselling. 19, 275 (M: 10, 965, 56. 9 %; F: 8, 310, 43. 1 %) were tested with all receiving their results same day. General positivity rate was 1. 3 %: female (1. 9 %). Brothel-based female sex workers had higher positivity rate (3. 2 %). The study also revealed prostitutes did not use condoms with their husbands or long-term boyfriends and that knowledge of HIV was poor.

However, it is common practice to analyse this data {{as if it was}} collected through random sampling ignoring the sampling design. We sought {{to determine the effects of}} including weights in the analysis of survey data collected through non-probabilistic sampling methods. Broad objective To assess the effects of weighting on risk taking behaviours associated with STIs among female sex workers (FSW) and <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> (LDTD) in Beitbridge using weighted and unweighted logistic regression models. Methods Both inverse probability weighted and unweighted forward selection multivariate logistic modelling techniques were used to determine significant risk taking behaviours associated with STIs in FSW and LDTD. Final models compared magnitude of the difference between odds ratios, the selection of final variables, standard errors,statistical significance of selected variables and the overall fit of the models to determine whether or not we believed weighted models were more appropriate for the analysis of the survey data for FSW and LDTD. Results For risk taking behaviours associated with STIs, inclusion of weights resulted in an increase in the odds ratios, a decrease in the standard errors and narrowing of theconfidence intervals for the parameters in the weighted model for FSW. In the weighted model for LDTD, the odds ratios were higher than in the unweighted model and the confidence intervals were slightly narrow. However, the standard errors were higher in the weighted models. Conclusion Based on the results, we concluded that weighting in the regression analysis of survey data collected using non probabilistic sampling methods helps to improve the precision of the regression estimates; hence weighted models should be used...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Abstract Background: In Ethiopia, chewing khat {{is legal}} and driving while chewing is normal. Although drugged driving is implicitly illegal in the country, {{it does not}} appear that this law {{includes}} khat. It has been suggested that the government's lax policy towards khat {{may be due to the}} fact that khat has become the major cash crop and foreign currency generator and from the assumption/ fear that taking any action against it may cause social uproar which will make it harder to implement policies that would be adhered by the public- the assumption being most people in Ethiopia are not concerned about the dangers of driving under the influence of khat. This survey, therefore, was conducted to investigate the awareness and magnitude of concern by Ethiopians about the dangers of driving under the influence of khat. Methodology: A cross sectional study was conducted in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. A total of 406 participants were recruited using convenience sampling method. Data were collected through survey using close ended questionnaire. Univariate logistic regression methods was used to assess association between variables. Result: 46 % of respondents considered khat to be drug; 48 % indicated that they would feel safe traveling with a driver who was chewing khat; however, 62 % indicate that chewing khat while driving should be a punishable offense. There were no differences in responses by religion, means of transportation (private vs. public) or by whether people had children or not. There were differences based on gender and age. Over all, men were more likely to think that khat is not drug than women (OR = 2. 71 95 %CI = 1. 82 - 4. 06; p= 0. 0017). Younger men (18 - 31 years of age) were more likely to think that khat is drug than older people (OR = 1. 96 95 % CI = 1. 25 - 3. 04; p=. 02). Men more than women and specifically young men (18 - 31) were more likely to feel safer riding with or traveling along someone driving while chewing khat (OR = 2. 70 95 %CI = 1. 69 - 4. 00; p = 31 (regardless of gender) were more likely to think driving while chewing khat should be punishable by law (OR= 3. 17 95 %C= 2. 06 - 5. 00; p =. 0001). There was no difference in responses by major category of occupation. But, noticeable difference was noted among people of other occupations and the sub group of taxi and <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> As such, taxi and <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> were found to be less likely to think khat is drug (OR= 13. 51 95 %CI= 1. 72 - 17. 19;p= 014),and more likely to feel safer around other drivers who drive while chewing(OR= 3. 57 95 % CI= 1. 21 - 10. 00;p=. 021) and more likely to think driving while chewing khat should not be punishable by law(OR= 6. 4 95 %CI= 2. 26 - 18. 00;p= 0005) Conclusion: This survey has the limitation of being based on a convenience sample.

Recent evidence prove that people infected with STIs run much higher risks of contracting HIV infection through direct biological mechanisms, and with reduced awareness of people of such diseases and their sequel the need for control become ever pressing. Knowledge about health and health seeking behavior in relation to STIs, what makes people decide to seek professional attention for suspected STIs, or their priorities when using services for sexual health, can help pragramme planners to identify obstacles to early diagnosis and effective treatment of STIs and implement appropriate interventions. <b>Truck</b> <b>drivers</b> are a mobile group whose health is constantly under pressure, they are globally referred to as high-risk group who are highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS/STI. Objective:- This descriptive cross-sectional community based study was conducted with attempt to study the prevalence, pattern, and determinants of health care-seeking behavior in relation to STIs among <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> at soba <b>truck</b> depot. V Methodology: - A descriptive cross – sectional community based study at soba truck depot, in which structured, close ended questionnaire was administered to 422 <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> in addition to focus group discussion with 6 different groups. Result:- The study revealed that most of the respondents were Sudanese with mean age of 35 years, and low income (73. 5 %), knowledge was found to be high (92 %). The prevalence of the main syndromes during the last 12 months was found to be 17. 5 % for urethral discharge, 5. 7 % for genital ulcer, and 12. 3 % for lower abdominal pain. The study showed low level of partner's notification (14. 9 %). Slightly more than half of our respondent (51 %) selected governmental hospital for treatment, and reason for preference of health providers were found to be easy accessibility to services, confidentiality and good attitude of staff, availability of drugs with high level of satisfaction (95 %). Treatment compliance found to be also high (87. 9 %), in contrast to very low condom use rate (5 %). Health education message by health providers was very poor (5 %). Stigma (38. 1 %), ignorance of disease and its sequel (23. 8 %), loss of privacy (9. 5 %), were the main barrier for seeking care. The study revealed significant relation between initiation of care and income, knowledge, and age (P= 0. 001, 0. 005, 0. 005 respectively, and insignificant relation with income (P= 0. 200), VI education (P= 0. 267) and Choice of health provider. Still no significant relation between accessibility to treatment and income (P= 0. 836) and education (P= 0. 668), Compliance with treatment was found to be significantly related to knowledge about STIs (P= 0. 005). Condom use was found to be significantly related to knowledge (P= 0. 006), but insignificantly related to age (P= 0. 338), and marital status (0. 336). Conclusion:- The study concluded that the prevalence of STIs is similar to prevalence in African countries. Lay referral play important role in the management of STIs, easy accessibility to services and drugs, privacy, confidentiality, and friendly attitude of the health staff were the main reasons for preference of a health facility.
