This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power <b>laser</b> <b>diodes,</b> laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks.

Indium is used in PNP bipolar junction transistors with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E
5|$|ZnO has wide direct {{band gap}} (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common {{potential}} applications are in <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source.|$|E
