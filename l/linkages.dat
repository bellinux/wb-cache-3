40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} of <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium violates the underlying assumption of <b>linkage</b> equilibrium in most traditional multipoint <b>linkage</b> approaches. Studies {{have shown that}} such violation leads to bias in qualitative trait <b>linkage</b> analysis when parental genotypes are unavailable. Appropriate handling of marker <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium can avoid such false positive evidence. Using the rheumatoid arthritis simulated data from Genetic Analysis Workshop 15, we examined and compared the following three approaches to handle <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium among dense markers in both qualitative and quantitative trait <b>linkage</b> analyses: a simple algorithm; SNPLINK, methods for marker selection; and MERLIN-LD, a method for modeling <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium by creating marker clusters. In analysis ignoring <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium between markers, we observed LOD score inflation only in the affected sib-pair <b>linkage</b> analysis without parental genotypes; no such inflation was present in the quantitative trait locus <b>linkage</b> analysis with severity as our phenotype with or without parental genotypes. Using methods to model or adjust for <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium, we found a substantial reduction of inflation of LOD score in affected sib-pair <b>linkage</b> analysis. Greater LOD score reduction was observed by decreasing the amount of tolerable <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium among markers selected or marker clusters using MERLIN-LD; the latter approach showed most reduction. SNPLINK performed better with selected markers based on the D' measure of <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium {{as opposed to the}} r 2 measure and outperformed the simple algorithm.

5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether <b>linkages</b> are more chemically stable than the ester <b>linkages</b> found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E

5|$|Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are {{modified}} oligonucleotides {{where one}} of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate moiety is replaced by sulfur. Only the phosphorothioates having sulfur at a non-bridging position as shown in figure are widely used and are available commercially. The replacement of the non-bridging oxygen with sulfur creates a new center of chirality at phosphorus. In a simple case of a dinucleotide, this results in the formation of a diastereomeric pair of Sp- and Rp-dinucleoside monophosphorothioates whose structures are shown in Figure. In an n-mer oligonucleotide where all (n– 1) internucleosidic <b>linkages</b> are phosphorothioate <b>linkages,</b> the number of diastereomers m is calculated as m = 2(n– 1). Being non-natural analogs of nucleic acids, OPS are substantially more stable towards hydrolysis by nucleases, the class of enzymes that destroy nucleic acids by breaking the bridging P-O bond of the phosphodiester moiety. This property determines the use of OPS as antisense oligonucleotides in in vitro and in vivo applications where the extensive exposure to nucleases is inevitable. Similarly, to improve the stability of siRNA, at least one phosphorothioate linkage is often introduced at the 3'-terminus of both sense and antisense strands. In chirally pure OPS, all-Sp diastereomers are more stable to enzymatic degradation than their all-Rp analogs. However, the preparation of chirally pure OPS remains a synthetic challenge. In laboratory practice, mixtures of diastereomers of OPS are commonly used.|$|E

On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic <b>linkages</b> {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is advisable to conduct the sulfurization step prior to the capping step.|$|E
