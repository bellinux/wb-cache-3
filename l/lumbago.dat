5|$|It {{was thought}} that Bradman would play Ring, but {{he changed his mind}} on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of {{exploiting}} a wet wicket. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. England lost leg spinner Wright before the match due to <b>lumbago.</b>|$|E

He {{documented}} Roman beliefs about the onion's ability to improve vision ailments, aid in sleep, and heal everything from mouth sores and toothaches, to dog bites, <b>lumbago</b> and even dysentery. Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after it was buried in a volcanic explosion found gardens of Pliny's detailed narratives, where onions had grown.|$|E
5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii {{mushrooms}} are edible. They {{have been used}} in traditional Chinese medicine to treat <b>lumbago,</b> numbed limbs, and as an antihemorrhagic. Bioactive compounds that have been identified from the fruit bodies include pulveravinA, pulveravinB, vulpinic acid, and pulverolide. Mushrooms are also used in mushroom dyeing to produce the colors yellow, gold, greenish yellow, orange, or olive, depending on the mordant used.|$|E
5|$|According {{to former}} English paceman Bill Bowes, England had {{approached}} the First Test {{with the intention}} of achieving a draw against a team they regarded as their superior, reflected in their selections and use of defensive tactics. Bowes himself believed the tactics to be correct and almost successful. However, he suspected that Walter Robins, one of the selectors, considered the English strategy to be misguided and that they should attack the Australians. This was reflected in the English selections. The home team made three changes; the leg spinner Doug Wright, who was forced to withdraw from the First Test at late notice due to <b>lumbago,</b> had regained his fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox spin of Young, who had taken match figures of 1/107 in the First TestAustralian wicket-keeper Don Tallon was his only wicket. However, he had managed to keep the batsmen quiet with his defensive leg theory, bowling 60 overs for 79 runs; Wright was a much more attacking and therefore expensive bowler. Jim Laker, who had been called into the First Test team due to Wright's <b>lumbago,</b> was initially the third spinner in the pecking order, but he took 4/138, including three specialist batsmen, and was retained.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, the United States, the United Kingdom and the German Empire {{were locked}} {{in a dispute over}} control of the Samoan Islands. Historian George H. Ryden's {{research}} indicates Harrison {{played a key role in}} determining the status of this Pacific outpost by taking a firm stand on every aspect of Samoa conference negotiations; this included selection of the local ruler, refusal to allow an indemnity for Germany, as well as the establishment of a three power protectorate, a first for the U.S.. These arrangements facilitated the future dominant power of the U.S. in the Pacific; Secretary of State Blaine was absent due to complication of <b>lumbago.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hutton scored 2,049 runs at {{an average}} of 56.91 in the 1950 season. Batting {{effectively}} on a succession of early season rain-affected wickets, Hutton frequently top-scored for Yorkshire. Hutton's benefit match against Middlesex was affected by rain, but other events, collections and insurance for loss of play gave Hutton £9,713, a record at that point for a Yorkshire cricketer. Two-thirds of the amount was invested on Hutton's behalf by the Yorkshire committee, following their usual practice; Hutton resented this paternalism from the committee, particularly as he did not receive the full amount until 1972. Hutton played in three of the four Tests against West Indies. In the first Test, hampered by a finger injury, he scored 39 and 45 as England recorded their only victory of the series. The West Indies won the second Test, their first Test victory in England, and won the final two Tests to take the series 3–1; Hutton missed the third Test with <b>lumbago</b> but in the fourth Test scored 202 not out, carrying his bat through England's first innings. The West Indian spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine caused difficulties for all the batsmen except Hutton, who always appeared comfortable. Wisden praised his effort as unforgettable.|$|E
5|$|On Hutton's {{return to}} England, {{he was made}} an honorary member of the MCC, which changed its rules to allow a current {{professional}} to join the club. The selectors appointed him England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, a rare indication of confidence. After a poor start to the season, Hutton captained MCC against the tourists, but withdrew from {{the final day of}} the match with <b>lumbago.</b> His uncertain health led him to resign the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector. Hutton played for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours, his final first-class century. His last 100 runs came in an hour. After the following match, his back was too painful to continue and he did not play again that season. In eleven first-class matches, he scored 537 runs at an average of 29.83. In June, he was knighted for services to cricket. Following the advice of a specialist, Hutton announced his retirement from first-class cricket in January 1956. He was 39, an early retirement age for the period. He played one further match in 1957 for MCC against Lancashire, and two matches in 1960 for MCC and L. C. Stevens' XI. In all first-class cricket, he scored 40,140 runs at an average of 55.51 with 129 hundreds.|$|E
5|$|England {{lost their}} leg spinner Doug Wright before the match to <b>lumbago,</b> so the off spin of Jim Laker {{was brought in}} at late notice. Laker had {{struggled}} when he had played for Surrey and the MCC against Australia in the lead-up matches, taking 1/137 and 3/127 respectively. In the MCC match, the Australians had attacked him, taking nine sixes from his bowling in one 82-minute passage of play. Of the team that took to {{the field for the}} MCC, Len Hutton, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, captain Norman Yardley, Laker and Jack Young were also selected for the First Test. Hutton scored 52 and 64 in the MCC match but nobody else managed to pass 26 in either innings. Young had bowled 55.2 overs in Australia's only innings, taking 4/155. Opener Jack Robertson was left out after scoring six and a duck, and Cyril Washbrook, who had played against Australia in the 1946–47 series, partnered Hutton. Joe Hardstaff junior had scored 107 for Nottinghamshire, the only century made against Australia in the lead-up matches, earning himself Test selection. Paceman Alec Bedser did not play in the MCC match, but had been a regular during England's last series against Australia in 1946–47, and had taken 4/104 for Surrey in their match against the tourists. Godfrey Evans, who kept wickets in the previous Ashes series, also gained Test selection. According to former England bowler Bill Bowes, England went into the match with the intention of securing a draw through the selection of defensive bowlers. The home team's bowlers would tie down the Australians, forcing the batsmen to take risks to score runs and thereby increasing the chances of dismissal; however, if rain produced a sticky wicket, the England attack might be able to dismiss Australia relatively easily. As such, England filled their team with batsmen and only played three frontline bowlers, Laker, Bedser and Young, and relied on Yardley, Edrich and Charlie Barnett to support them with their occasion seam bowling. It was speculated that England would use only two specialist bowlers; the all-rounder George Pope was in the squad and it was thought he would be used in place of one of the bowlers, but in the end, he was omitted, as was Reg Simpson. The latter had made 74 and 70 for Nottinghamshire against Australia and had impressed observers with his display, and was made twelfth man.|$|E

25|$|Fairbridge had, however, {{suffered}} {{considerably from}} malaria, sciatica and <b>lumbago</b> {{and in the}} last few years of his life endured pain and general ill-health. He died at the age of 39 on 19 July 1924 in Perth, while recuperating from a minor operation related to a lymphatic tumour. He was buried at Pinjarra and survived by his wife Ruby (d. 1966) and their two sons and two daughters. His son Rhodes Fairbridge (1914–2006) was an eminent geologist and climate scientist.|$|E
25|$|Disc {{herniation}} {{can occur}} in any disc in the spine, but the two most common forms are lumbar disc herniation and cervical disc herniation. The former is the most common, causing lower back pain (<b>lumbago)</b> and often leg pain as well, in which case it is {{commonly referred to as}} sciatica. Lumbar disc herniation occurs 15 times more often than cervical (neck) disc herniation, and {{it is one of the}} most common causes of lower back pain. The cervical discs are affected 8% of the time and the upper-to-mid-back (thoracic) discs only 1–2% of the time.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Meyer {{resumed his}} prewar pattern of late summer home games in 1946, but then, in 1947, {{at the age}} of 42, allowed himself his solitary season of {{full-time}} cricket as Somerset's captain. By this stage, he was badly affected by <b>lumbago,</b> and though he scored 850 runs and took 43 wickets, the season was not a success for Somerset, and he stood {{down at the end of}} the year. He played a couple of first-class matches in each of the next three seasons, and then retired from cricket to concentrate full-time on schoolmastering and developing his school at Millfield.|$|E
25|$|Between 1888 and 1890, Narendra visited Vaidyanath in Allahabad. In January 1890 he {{went from}} Allahabad to Ghazipur and met Pavhari Baba, an Advaita Vedanta ascetic who {{spent much of his}} time in meditation. At the time he {{suffered}} from <b>lumbago,</b> and it was becoming impossible for him to move or sit in meditation. After meeting Baba, Narendra wanted to become his disciple and Baba asked him to stay a few more days at Ghazipur. However, the night before his initiation Narendra had a dream in which Ramakrishna looked at him with a melancholy face. This dream convinced Narendra that no one other than Ramakrishna could be his teacher, and he abandoned the idea of becoming Baba's disciple.|$|E
25|$|In 1916 whilst {{serving in}} the Lincolnshire Regiment, {{suffering}} from severe <b>lumbago</b> Jessop {{was sent to a}} clinic in Bath The Radiant Heat Treatment ' involved dousing with total immersion for 30 minutes at a temperature of 210-310 degrees F'. The patient was placed in an up-ended coffin like structure and steamed up. If he became too uncomfortable he could raise the lid and get out. By some 'accident' the catch fell, the attendant had gone away and Jessop was unable to summon assistance. When he was eventually rescued his heart had been seriously damaged by this terrible ordeal. In a matter of minutes the sporting life of one of the greatest athletes had come to an abrupt end.|$|E
25|$|By the mid 17th century, {{numerous}} small Dutch and Flemish distillers had popularized the re-distillation of malt spirit or malt {{wine with}} juniper, anise, caraway, coriander, etc., which {{were sold in}} pharmacies and used to treat such medical problems as kidney ailments, <b>lumbago,</b> stomach ailments, gallstones, and gout. Gin emerged in England in varying forms as of the early 17th century, {{and at the time}} of the Restoration, enjoyed a brief resurgence. When William of Orange, ruler of the Dutch Republic, occupied the British throne with his wife Mary in what has become known as the Glorious Revolution, gin became vastly more popular, particularly in crude, inferior forms, where it was more likely to be flavoured with turpentine as an alternative to juniper.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Lawrence {{contracted}} <b>lumbago</b> and {{was given}} a fortnight to recuperate by Charlot, who then saw her at an opening night party at Ivor Novello's invitation two days before she was cleared {{to return to work}} by her doctor, and immediately sacked her. When the apparent reason for her dismissal became common knowledge among other West End producers, she was unable to find work, and in early 1919 she accepted a job singing in the show at Murray's, a popular London nightclub, where she remained {{for the better part of}} the next two years. While performing there she met Captain Philip Astley, a member of the Household Cavalry. He became her friend, escort, and ultimately lover, and taught her how to dress and behave in high society.|$|E
25|$|Hutton {{returned}} to England by boat; {{the rest of}} the team travelled by air. On his arrival, he was made an honorary member of the M.C.C., which changed its rules to allow a current professional to join the club. The selectors appointed him as England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, on the condition he reduced time wasting by the team. Usually, captains were appointed for one or two matches; the only other captain to be appointed for a whole summer was C. B. Fry in 1912. However, Hutton's form was uncertain at the start of the 1955 season. He captained M.C.C. against the tourists, but had to withdraw from the final day of the match with <b>lumbago.</b> With his health uncertain, he resigned from the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector. Hutton continued to play for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours. His last 100 runs came in an hour, a very fast rate of scoring, but this was his final first-class century. After the following match, his back became too painful to continue and he did not play again that season. That June, he was knighted for services to cricket. Following the advice of a specialist, Hutton announced his retirement from first-class cricket in January 1956. At 39, he was considered at the time to be young to retire.|$|E
500|$|Between 1951 and 1954, Yardley {{served as}} a Test selector, serving as {{chairman}} in 1952 {{at the time when}} Hutton was chosen as England captain. Following the 1955 season, aged 40 and increasingly bothered by <b>lumbago,</b> Yardley retired from the team. He ended his first-class career with 18,173 runs at an average of 31.17, and 279 wickets at an average of 30.48. Wisden later described him as [...] "the finest Yorkshire amateur since F. S. Jackson".|$|E
500|$|For {{the fifth}} {{game of the}} season, Vanderbilt played the Tennessee Volunteers at {{waterlogged}} Old Dudley Field. Vanderbilt won 14–0, with Fatty Lawrence and team captain Pink Wade (who had <b>lumbago)</b> sitting out the game. Acting as captain in Wade's absence, Doc Kuhn scored all of Vanderbilt's touchdowns; he [...] "made possible the touchdown by miraculous sidestepping", evading two tacklers. [...] According to Blinkey Horn, the Tennessee coaches [...] "never saw, in all the spying trips, such interference as the Commodores made yesterday for Doc Kuhn". In the first quarter, Kuhn's 19-yard end run made the score 7–0; in the second, he had a 30-yard touchdown run with Lynn Bomar as lead blocker.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell-Innes {{was named}} {{as one of}} three captains of Somerset in 1948. Jack Meyer had reluctantly captained the side in 1947, but stepped {{down at the end}} of the season: he was having {{problems}} with his sight, and required daily painkillers for <b>lumbago.</b> There was no obvious replacement for Meyer; like many counties Somerset would not consider having a professional captain, and finding an amateur with the time and money to lead the side was proving troublesome. So, with no single candidate suitable, the Somerset committee announced that the club would be captained first by Mitchell-Innes during his leave from the Sudan, then Seamer during his own leave. Once both of these had returned to their duties, George Woodhouse would take over. In his history of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck describes the situation as a [...] "remarkable state of affairs", while David Foot suggests that the true number of captains was closer to seven.|$|E
500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war, county cricket resumed in 1946, during which year Seamer played two matches with little success. He did not appear in first-class cricket in 1947, but was named as one of three captains of Somerset in 1948. Jack Meyer had reluctantly captained the side in 1947, but stepped {{down at the end of}} the season: he was having problems with his sight, and required daily painkillers for <b>lumbago.</b> There was no obvious replacement for Meyer; like many counties Somerset would not consider having a professional captain, and finding an amateur with the time and money to lead the side was proving troublesome.

In his history of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck describes the situation as a [...] "remarkable state of affairs", while David Foot suggests that the true number of captains was closer to seven. During his time as captain, Seamer carried an old train board saying [...] "To Tonbridge" [...] in his cricket bag, claiming that it brought good luck to the team. In the eleven matches that Somerset played under his captaincy though, only one resulted in a victory. Seamer claimed that some of his best friends at the club were among the professionals, who he praised for their team spirit, despite the strained leadership changes. His friendship with the professionals was in contrast to the attitudes of both the club's committee, and its captain for the previous season. Meyer had been unpopular with the professionals due to his attitude to the game, and the manner in which he utilised them, while the club's committee felt that the professional players deserved little recognition when successful, claiming that this was what they were paid for. Seamer's batting was no longer strong enough to support his inclusion in the team, and he played low in the middle order. He failed to reach double figures in any of his first seven innings that season, but recorded a half-century against Kent in his final match for Somerset, his first since 1936 in first-class cricket.|$|E

However he got <b>lumbago</b> and was replaced by Albert Peatfield early on the second day. Even though he was a substitute Peatfield was allowed to bat. This was his only first-class match.|$|E

However, Boomert claims that neither cairi nor caeri means hummingbird and tukusi or tucuchi does. Others have {{reported}} that kairi and iere simply mean island. [...] Christopher Columbus renamed it [...] "La Isla de la Trinidad" [...] ("The Island of the Trinity"), fulfilling a vow made before setting out on his third voyage of exploration. Tobago's cigar-like shape may have given it its Spanish name (cabaco, tavaco, tobacco) and possibly its Amerindian names of Aloubaéra (black conch) and Urupaina (big snail), although the English pronunciation is , rhyming with <b>lumbago,</b> sago, and [...] "may go".|$|E
2500|$|The {{underground}} travel of the waters, {{from the}} opposite shore of the lake (more than thirty years at [...] deep), explains its temperature of 46°. Many sources provide calcium, sulphated, silica-rich waters which are very slightly radioactive at 45° or cold, and finally with bicarbonatees. They, according to their origin and their temperature, are used either for showers or baths, in a swimming-pool, or to drink. These warm waters are especially indicated for degenerative rheumatism such as lumbar or cervical arthritis, osteoarthritis, sciatica, acute <b>lumbago,</b> recurrent arthritis of the hands, knee osteoarthritis, and for inflammatory rheumatism and spontylarthrite rheumatism. The use of sources is also beneficial for the algodystrophy, tendonitis, and phlebological problems (chronic venous insufficiency, suites and sequelae of thrombosis, lymphatic insufficiency, Raynaud's disease), on the other hand, these waters are contraindicated for the varicose ulcer, stroke or recent cardiac events. The cure techniques are the use of showers, individual enclosure (Berthollet), physiotherapy, mud application, underwater showers, and rehabilitation in a swimming pool. By their calming of the nervous system, the waters can cause euphoric relaxation.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1942, Rachmaninoff {{was advised}} by his doctor to {{relocate}} to a warmer climate to improve his health after suffering from sclerosis, <b>lumbago,</b> neuralgia, high blood pressure, and headaches. A move to Long Island fell through after the composer and his wife expressed greater interest in California, and initially settled in a leased home on Tower Road in Beverly Hills. Rachmaninoff completed his final studio recording sessions during this time, in February 1942. Four months later, he purchased a home on Elm Drive in Beverly Hills. Later that year, Rachmaninoff was struck with illness during a concert tour and diagnosed with advanced melanoma; his family was informed of the diagnosis but he remained unaware. He then decided the 1942–43 season of concerts was to be his last, after which he would retire from performance due to his increasing fatigue and dedicate his time to composition. On 1 February 1943, Rachmaninoff and Satina became American citizens. Rachmaninoff's final public performance occurred on 17 February at the Alumni Gymnasium at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee. His set for the recital included Piano Sonata [...] by Chopin which contains a funeral march. The composer fell increasingly unwell after the performance, forcing {{him to return to}} cancel upcoming dates and return to Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to the Fifth Test against New Zealand at the [...] in 1958 England {{made only}} two changes to their team.

Fred Trueman was laid low by <b>lumbago,</b> which also affected him {{when he arrived in}} Queensland in 1962–63, and was replaced by Peter Loader even though he had just recovered from a strained [...] Achilles tendon and high temperature. Loader, Laker, Lock and Statham had taken plenty of wickets on tour and Graveney and captain Peter May had made the most runs. Australia also had two changes from their last team, the Fifth Test against South Africa at [...] in 1957–58. Captain Ian Craig had resigned due to ill-health and was replaced by the debutant strokemaker Norm O'Neill and Peter Burge replaced Bobby Simpson, who was twelfth man. Australia did not recall the veteran Ray Lindwall even though he had taken 7/73 for Queensland against the MCC and had swung the ball prodigiously. After vice-captain Neil Harvey captained an Australian XI to a 345 run defeat against the MCC the selectors made the surprise choice of Richie Benaud as Australian captain. He had just succeeded Craig as the captain of New South Wales, but had yet to lead his state. There was a thunderstorm before the match which precluded net practise and the air was heavy, which made the loss of Trueman's swing bowling all the more meaningful.|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1970s {{it was the}} {{practice}} to strengthen state sides with Test cricketers so that the Australian selectors could see them play and to provide more games for the tourists. Colin McDonald of Victoria, Norm O'Neill of New South Wales, Ken Mackay of Queensland were flown over and such was O'Neill's popularity that a record 17,921 people came to watch him bat on the second day, the biggest crowd at the WACA since 1932. Keith Miller wrote [...] "Not {{since the days of}} Bradman had one player so absorbed the limelight". Willie Watson was having knee surgery, Frank Tyson had <b>lumbago</b> and Roy Swetman, Tom Graveney and Tony Lock were dropped so that the other 11 players could have a game. The MCC won the toss and chose to bat on a wicket that had been dried out by a week's sunshine since their last game. Peter Richardson and Arthur Milton were out playing strokes, unused to the pace and bounce of Australian wickets, Raman Subba Row was unlucky and the tourists were soon 33/3. As many times before it was up to captain Peter May and vice-captain Colin Cowdrey to set things right after a shaky start and they had added 134 runs when May pulled a knee ligament and retired hurt on 68. Cowdrey played carefully for 78 and when Trevor Bailey was yorked by Raymond Strauss (5/99) May returned, using Bailey as a runner. He added 92 with Evans (55) and made 113 when they both got themselves out to allow the tail wag its way to 349. With May and Bailey unwell Cowdrey brought Jim Laker (2/55) in to float the ball into a strong wind once Brian Statham (2/35) finished his opening spell. O'Neill came in after the first wicket and batted wonderfully, hitting Milton for 23 off an over and making 104 on the Monday morning despite Ken Mackay making him wait for an hour by taking a single off the last ball of six overs in succession. Only 110 runs were made in the day as Laker bowled very tightly and removed O'Neill. Peter Loader (4/56) ran through the lower order as the Combined XI fell from 187/3 to 227/8 and 260 all out. Richardson failed again and the wicketless Fred Trueman went in as nightwatchman to hit 53 before Bailey (71 not out) and Cowdrey (100 not out) batted out the day to draw the game on 257/4.|$|E
