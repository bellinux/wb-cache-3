40|$|Relying on {{survey data}} from Huedin, {{a town in}} Romania, we seek to provide an {{empirical}} evidence for the hypothesis according to which remittances could have either a positive or negative developmental impact at community level. For this, we inquire about the perceptions of migratory processes with focus on the possible effects of remittances in the local economy. Our first finding is that residents share a common view on the reasons of migration, namely {{that it has been}} triggered by the large pay levels that exists between the level of local and the Western European labor markets and that migration opportunity was enhanced by the lifting of visa requirements for Schengen countries. We have also found that remittances constitute a significant source of <b>liquidity</b> <b>inflow</b> and that the ways in which repatriated earnings were spent have influenced the performance of the local economy. We conclude that a reinterpretation of migration is required in order to capture the investment and entrepreneurial aspects of the phenomenon. In the formal model proposed in Appendix 2, we make a first attempt to conceptualise migration as a sector of the local economy in which migrants are entrepreneurs, who invest in migration activities to produce the composite commodity remittance.

The kind of non-profit organization influences the best stra-tegy choice. If an exposition on liquidity strategy risk is greater, the more conservative will be the strategy. If the exposition on that risk is smaller, the more aggressive will be the net working capital strategy. The paper shows how decisions about <b>liquidity</b> strategy <b>inflow</b> the risk of the non-profit organizations and its economical results during realization of main mission...|$|R

[...] Concerns have also been expressed that, because FATCA operates by imposing withholding taxes on U.S. investments, this will drive foreign financial institutions (particularly hedge funds) away from investing in the U.S. and thereby reduce <b>liquidity</b> and capital <b>inflows</b> into the US.|$|R
40|$|The Global {{financial}} crisis hit {{the economy of}} the Kyrgyz Republic by the third wave of its transmission in the early of 2009. The article examines the impact of the Global financial economic crisis on the public budget and unemployment of the Kyrgyz Republic. We analyzed the transmission of the crisis on the public budget firstly and its effect on unemployment level by using the vector autoregression approach (VAR) and quarterly data for 2005 – 2013 within the framework of IS-LM model for small open economies with floating exchange rate. There is an inverse relationship between the public budget and remittances <b>inflow,</b> <b>liquidity</b> level, volume of deposits, and exchange rate. As a result of the study, the fall in remittances <b>inflows,</b> <b>liquidity</b> level of the banking system, depreciation of the national currency lead to an increase in public revenue. Therefore, the increase in public spending during the crisis period, with the aim of unemployment reduction, may be considered as a crucial policy. The study result allows to policy-makers to exactly know what channels of transmission mechanism transfer the Global crisis on the public budget and its effect on unemployment level of the republic in order to undertake anticrisis macroeconomic policy. The final result of the study indicates that the increase of unemployment level by 1...|$|R
40|$|Banks have {{a unique}} ability to hedge against market-wide <b>liquidity</b> shocks. Deposit <b>inflows</b> provide funding for loan demand shocks that follow declines in market liquidity. Consequently, banks can insure firms against {{systematic}} declines in liquidity at lower cost than other institutions. We provide evidence that when liquidity dries up and commercial paper spreads widen, banks experience funding inflows. These flows allow banks to meet loan demand from borrowers drawing funds from commercial paper backup lines without running down their holdings of liquid assets. We also provide evidence that implicit government support for banks during crises explains these funding flows. Copyright 2006 by The American Finance Association. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} banks {{have a unique}} ability to hedge against market-wide <b>liquidity</b> shocks. Deposit <b>inflows</b> provide funding for loan demand shocks that follow declines in market liquidity. Consequently, one {{dimension}} of bank specialness' is that banks can insure firms against systematic declines in market liquidity at lower cost than other financial institutions. We provide supporting empirical evidence from the commercial paper (CP) market. When market liquidity dries up and CP spreads increase, banks experience funding inflows. These flows allow banks to meet increased loan demand from borrowers drawing funds from pre-existing commercial paper backup lines, without running down their holdings of liquid assets. Moreover, the supply of cheap funds is sufficiently large so that pricing on new lines of credit actually falls as market spreads widen. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} model of {{contagion}} where countries borrow or lend for consumption smoothing at the market interest rate or a lower IMF rate. Highly indebted countries hit by large negative shocks to output will default. The resulting reduction in loanable funds raises interest rates, increases the vulnerability of other indebted countries, and can generate further rounds of defaults. In this environment the IMF can limit default and internalize the externality generated by contagion through its lending with conditionality. We characterize the IMF''s optimal lending decision in mitigating the loss in world consumption.

40|$|The {{transmission}} of abundant global liquidity {{and the accompanying}} surge in capital flows to economies with comparatively higher interest rates and a stronger growth outlook pose policy challenges as appreciation pressures and rising asset valuations return. In addition {{to the influence of}} domestic growth prospects and liquidity conditions, this chapter finds strong links between global liquidity expansion and asset prices, such as equity returns, in the “liquidity-receiving” economies, as well as official reserve accumulation and portfolio inflows. There are a number of policy options available to policymakers of liquidity-receiving economies in response to surges in global <b>liquidity</b> and capital <b>inflows.</b> The menu of policy responses for mitigating risks related to capital inflow surges includes the following: • A more flexible exchange rate policy, in particular when the exchange rate is undervalued. The analysis shows that a floating exchange rate provides a natural buffer against surges in global liquidity and ensuing valuation pressures on domestic assets. • Reserve accumulation (using sterilized or unsterilized intervention as appropriate). • Reducing interest rates if the inflation outlook permits. • Tightening fiscal policy when the overall macroeconomic policy stance is too loose...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} factors which can affect auditors to issue going concern audit opinions in the Chinese stock market, and furthermore, {{to discuss the}} audit quality among Chinese reporting system through the issuance of going concern opinions. Firstly, the data results illustrate that Chinese auditors {{are more likely to}} issue going concern audit opinions to those listed companies with poor profitability, low <b>liquidity,</b> less cash <b>inflows</b> and high leverage. Secondly, it can be examined that audit fee paid by a client has no statistically significant effect on impacting auditors to give going concern audit opinions. Finally, comparing with Big-Four and non-Big four audit firms, no significant difference between two types of auditors on which one have more preference to issue going concern audit opinions is found. Generally, the research shows a mature audit profession in developing countries like China is being formed, that audit independence is not compromised by economic dependence and the majority of Chinese auditors mainly issue going concern opinions based on financial distress indicators. Besides, this research paper indicates additional discussion about improvements on audit quality and independence since the new audit standard for going concern is promulgated in 2003. Key Words: going concern audit opinions, risk of bankruptcy, fee independence, size of audit firms, improvements on audit quality and independenc...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} address the problem areas which Swedish debt {{collecting}} firms encounters while not having a clear cash management strategy. Furthermore, it discusses possible areas for improvement in regards to increase the firm's long-term profitability. No earlier research {{has been found in}} this area prior to this study, whereby the study will take its scientific basis in research regarding cash management as a field. These theories will then be applied to the outcome of the empirical data that has been collected throughout this study. Due to the nature of this paper an interview was conducted to establish a foundation for how cash management is used by the Swedish debt collecting firms today. This interview has been complemented by a data gathering from the Swedish Enforcement Authority regarding amounts of seized capital from debtors and number of cases handled each year. Cash management in Swedish debt collecting firms is as seen in this study quite effective and well structured. However, the study concludes that there are improvements to be made with the purpose to generate a more efficient cash management and an increased long-term profitability. Areas with improvement possibilities which are to be concerned are the financing of debt portfolios, short-term investments of excess <b>liquidity</b> and the <b>inflow</b> of cash from debtors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical framework for considering {{the role of}} IMF-supported programs in preventing crises, particularly capital account crises. The model builds upon the global games framework to establish a unique relationship between the crisis probability and {{the parameters of the}} program, which is assumed to be negotiated between the IMF and the member country, taking explicit account of each party''s interests. In the model, {{from the perspective of the}} borrowing country, IMF financing and policy adjustment are (perfect) substitutes inasmuch as they both contribute to the country''s liquidity and thus reduce the likelihood of a crisis. In equilibrium, however, IMF financing promotes stronger policies, implying that financing and adjustment are strong complements in crisis prevention. Conditionality plays a crucial role in sustaining the program, providing mutual assurances-to the member country that, if it undertakes the agreed policies, financing will indeed be forthcoming, and to the IMF that the country will implement the agreed policies as the IMF disburses its resources. The model helps explain how liquidity crises may come about, how IMF support can reduce the likelihood of a crisis by providing liquidity and sustaining stronger policies, and why the observed mix between financing and adjustment may vary across programs.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{contagion}} from Russia to Brazil in late 1998 under two dimensions— players involved {{and the timing}} of events. The data {{does not seem to}} reflect a compensatory liquidation of assets story by international institutional investors. It does contribute, however, to the suspicion that the contagion was triggered by foreign investors panicking from the Russian crisis, and joining local residents on their speculation against the Brazilian real. Adjusted correlations in the Brady market increase significantly during the crisis, which lends support to the view that if there was a contagion from Russia to Brazil, the most likely place of the transmission was the off-shore Brady market. Finally, the paper does not support the hypothesis that it was the liquidity crisis in mature markets, and not the Russian crisis, that timed the crisis in Brazil.
