25|$|Bradman {{had only}} made 28, {{when he played}} Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it {{high in the air}} in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how it <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> sitting {{watching}} from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.|$|E
500|$|Brady {{remained}} a lifelong bachelor. When a friend asked why, he said, [...] "When my father died, he left five daughters who <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for support. All the affection I {{could have had}} for a wife went out to those sisters; and I have never desired to recall it." [...] On Sunday, February 7, 1869 {{the left side of}} Brady's body was paralyzed. He {{died at the age of}} 53 at his home in New York on February 9 at 4:45 pm. Brady's funeral occurred at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and he was interred at Calvary Cemetery.|$|E
500|$|Foley {{accepted}} {{the failure of}} the film saying, [...] "I knew it was doomed before even filming started. The day before the first shoot, I sat in my hotel and looked to the script thinking, 'Damn, wish I could re-write this whole thing.' After the film released, my dad called me up saying 'you know The New York Times are calling it the worst film of the year." [...] He recalled that both he and Madonna chose to overlook {{the failure of the}} film, and remembered one incident when he met Madonna at a hotel lobby. [...] "She just <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> once and said, 'So it's a flop right?' That's the only time she ever mentioned the film. Even Sean also never mentioned it in front of her." [...] In another article in The New York Times, Vincent Canby noted that Madonna's real personality is of a [...] "knowing, shrewd, pragmatic young woman, a performer of invigorating energy who still looks a lot like Marilyn Monroe, even with short hair, but who has much more in common with the enthusiastic, unembarrassed, comic tartness of Jean Harlow, somehow let loose on the streets of New York in the 80's." [...] However, he felt that Who's That Girl failed to portray that image, leading to its failure. The first half of the film showed a different personality of Madonna, trying to be comical, which was not accepted by the public.|$|E

2500|$|Out of this {{situation}} evolved an uproar, which through the shouting and clamour and an inexplicable {{growth in the number}} of participants in the struggle soon assumed a truly demoniacal character. It <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if the whole town would break out into a riot...Then suddenly I heard a heavy thump, and as if by magic the whole crowd dispersed in every direction...One of the regular patrons had felled one of the noisiest rioters ... And it was the effect of this which had scattered everybody so suddenly.|$|E
2500|$|For example, in a {{surviving}} recorded radio {{interview from}} June 25, Arnold described them as looking [...] "something like a pie plate that {{was cut in}} half {{with a sort of}} a convex triangle in the rear." [...] His motion descriptions were: [...] "I noticed to the left of me a chain which <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like the tail of a Chinese kite, kind of weaving... they seemed to flip and flash in the sun, just like a mirror... they seemed to kind of weave in and out right above the mountaintops..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1952, I {{was flying}} down south {{with my wife}} Hope, and we left a bit later than usual {{and by the time}} we got over the Hamersley Ranges, the clouds had formed and the ceiling got lower and lower. I got into the Turner River, knowing full well if I {{followed}} it through, I would come out into the Ashburton. [...] On going through a gorge in the Turner River, I noticed that the walls <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be solid iron and was particularly alerted by the rusty looking colour of it, it showed to me to be oxidised iron.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] exclaimed Blacky {{under his}} breath. [...] "Those <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as if they}} might be very handy, very handy indeed, for a hunter to sit on. Sitting there behind those bushes, he would be hidden from any Duck who might come in <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for nice yellow corn {{scattered}} out there among the rushes. It doesn't <b>look</b> right <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> No, Sir, it doesn't <b>look</b> right <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I think I'll keep an eye on this place." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{be asking}} a {{tremendous}} lot {{of one man}} to be player, captain and assistant manager. That <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be an outsized man's job. He will need all the good wishes possible, and he has mine." ...|$|R
2500|$|Penalties {{played a}} huge {{role in the}} game. [...] New England had 10 penalties, while the Raiders had 11. [...] "That {{was one of the}} worst-called games I have ever seen in my life," [...] said an angry Patriots DE Julius Adams. [...] "I just hope they were right", Patriots coach Chuck Fairbanks said about the {{roughing}} the passer call against Ray Hamilton on Oakland's game-winning drive. [...] "It <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like Ray Hamilton hit the ball first. If he did deflect the ball, it was an incorrect call." [...] Later on, he added [...] "I’m proud of my team and the way we played today. We’re going home knowing we played our hearts out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fischer makes several {{atmospheric}} {{observations about}} his opponent's habits and {{reaction to his}} moves. In the opening game he writes that [...] "Sherwin slid the rook with his pinky, as if to emphasize the cunning of this mysterious move." [...] In another game he recalls that [...] "Petrosian and Tal both happened to stroll by the board at this point. Petrosian made a wry face which <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like 'Can Black do this and live?'." [...] "Poker-faced as always Keres made this move {{as though it was}} the most natural one on the board" [...] (Game 37). [...] "From the glint in his eye I could see that he had come prepared for my King's Indian" [...] (on the game against Botvinnik).|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, at his rival's stable, {{throughout}} Preakness week(as late as Friday, the {{day before}} the race), Easy Goer's front feet were being soaked in a tub of Epsom salts due to small scratches or cracks on both heels. An ultrasound was also performed on his ankles and knees. Some wondered if these ailments could compromise the chances of both horses. Easy Goer had [...] "problematic, puffy" [...] ankles that he dealt with throughout his career. Trainer Thad Ackel (trained Breeders' Cup Turf winner Great Communicator) stated, [...] "Easy Goer has got a couple of osselets (enlargements of the fetlock joints usually caused by excess fluid), and it <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like there's come calcification there. I was surprised that such a good horse could have ankles like that." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Animal Spirits is {{the first}} Slough Feg album to {{exclusively}} feature art done by lead singer and guitarist Mike Scalzi. The rough-looking, stylized priest that appears on the cover is {{a departure from the}} more intricate, fantasy- and sci-fi-inspired artwork featured on previous releases. In a November 2010 interview, Scalzi commented on the choice of not getting a professional artist, saying, [...] "That’s how the music <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> The scratchy pen and ink, that’s how it <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> That’s how Slough Feg music always <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> We’ve always had artwork that’s too modernized, too slick. It never should have been like that, it should’ve been more scratchy, because those are the images that inspired what our music was to become." ...|$|R
