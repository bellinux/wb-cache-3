5|$|The first {{reported}} poisonings resulting in death from {{the consumption of}} A.bisporigera were from near San Antonio, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three children consumed the fungus; only the man survived. Amanita poisoning {{is characterized by the}} following distinct stages: the incubation stage is an asymptomatic period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In the gastrointestinal stage, about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe electrolyte imbalances, and shock. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as phalloidin. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hemorrhage appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of prothrombin and blood levels of ammonia, and the signs of hepatic encephalopathy and/or kidney failure appear. The risk factors for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short <b>latency</b> <b>period</b> between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe coagulopathy (blood clotting disorder), severe hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), and rising serum creatinine levels.|$|E

The series included 492 men and 65 women, aged between 32 and 93 years (median age 69 years). Necropsy findings were available in 456 cases (82 %). Occupational histories {{were obtained from the}} patients themselves or from their relatives by personal or telephone interviews. Routine lung sections were examined for asbestos bodies in 442 cases. In 109 cases isolation and counting of asbestos bodies were performed. A majority of people had histories of working in the shipyards. Asbestos bodies were observed in lung sections in 67 % of the cases. Lung asbestos body burdens after isolation ranged between 20 bodies and about 10 millions of bodies/g dried tissue. <b>Latency</b> <b>periods</b> (time intervals between first exposure to asbestos and death) ranged between 14 and 75 years (mean 48. 8 years, median 51. 0). <b>Latency</b> <b>periods</b> among insulators and dock workers were shorter than among the other categories.

40|$|Quantitative {{multistage}} carcinogenesis {{models are}} used in radiobiology to estimate cancer risks and <b>latency</b> <b>periods</b> (time from exposure to clinical cancer). Steps such as initiation, promotion and transformation have been modeled in detail. However, progression, a later step during which malignant cells can develop into clinical symptomatic cancer, has often been approximated simply as a fixed lag time. This approach discounts important stochastic mechanisms in progression and evidence on the high prevalence of dormant tumors. Modeling progression more accurately is therefore important for risk assessment. Unlike models of earlier steps, progression models can readily utilize not only experimental and epidemiological data but also clinical data such as the results of modern screening and imaging. Here, a stochastic progression model is presented. We describe, with minimal parameterization: the initial growth or extinction of a malignant clone after formation of a malignant cell; the likely dormancy caused, for example, by nutrient and oxygen deprivation; and possible escape from dormancy resulting in a clinical cancer. It is shown, using cohort simulations with parameters appropriate for lung adenocarcinomas, that incorporating such processes can dramatically lengthen predicted <b>latency</b> <b>periods.</b> Such long <b>latency</b> <b>periods</b> together with data on timing of radiation-induced cancers suggest that radiation may influence progression itself...|$|R

25|$|Many {{chemical}} agents, including medications, industrial toxins, and herbal {{and dietary}} supplements, can cause hepatitis. The spectrum of drug-induced liver injury varies from acute hepatitis to chronic hepatitis to acute liver failure.

25|$|Chronic aortic {{insufficiency}} If the individual survives the initial hemodynamic derailment that acute AI presents as, the left ventricle adapts by eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation {{of the left}} ventricle, and the volume overload is compensated for. The left ventricular filling pressures will revert to normal and the individual will no longer have overt heart failure. In this compensated phase, the individual may be totally asymptomatic and may have normal exercise tolerance. Eventually (typically after a <b>latency</b> <b>period)</b> the left ventricle will become decompensated, and filling pressures will increase.Some individuals enter this decompensated phase asymptomatically, treatment for AI involves aortic valve replacement prior to this decompensation phase.|$|E

For example, if a warm object is placed in front of the snake, the organ will increase in firing rate at first, but after a while will adapt to the warm object and the firing rate of the nerves in the pit organ will return to normal. If that warm object is then removed, the pit organ will now register the space that it used to occupy as being colder, and as such the firing rate will be depressed until it adapts to the removal of the object.

25|$|Exposure to VZV in {{a healthy}} child initiates the {{production}} of host immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies; IgG antibodies persist for life and confer immunity. Cell-mediated immune responses are also important in limiting the scope and the duration of primary varicella infection. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. VZV then remains latent in the dorsal ganglion cells of the sensory nerves. Reactivation of VZV results in the clinically distinct syndrome of herpes zoster (i.e., shingles), postherpetic neuralgia, and sometimes Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II. Varicella zoster can affect the arteries in the neck and head, producing stroke, either during childhood, or after a <b>latency</b> <b>period</b> of many years.|$|E
2500|$|Kowler {{and colleagues}} were among many {{to test the}} {{relationship}} between attention and saccades. [...] In one of their first experiments they hypothesized that the initiation of saccades required a signal that would determine which point in space would be the target for the saccade. They questioned whether the signal was attributed to attention or if saccades held their own independent filter. If attention was what decided {{the location of the}} target then the saccade <b>latency</b> <b>period</b> would be longer for saccades made away from the target. Additional time would be required to shift attention away from the false target to the correct target. The apparatus was constructed of eight letters arranged around the perimeter of a circle with a cross fixated at the center. Three frames were presented at each trial, the first called the pre-mask held eight letters for 500ms, the second, labeled critical frame contained seven characters and a numerical (0-9) saccade target and was held for 200ms. The last frame, post-mask, contained all of the letters. Each trial the identity of the letters, numerical saccade target and the location of the numerical saccade target were chosen at random and blind to the participants. Participants focused on the cross fixation and pressed a button {{at the start of the}} trial. After 100ms a sequence of the three frames were presented, participants were then instructed to make a saccade to either the numerical saccade target or to an opposite character. Once the saccade target was identified participants pressed a button. Results supported the hypothesis, showing that directed attention towards the saccade target made the target easier to identify, decreased <b>latency</b> <b>period</b> and improved on accuracy.|$|E

2500|$|Nuclear chain {{reaction}} (the concept behind nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons). Each uranium nucleus that undergoes fission produces multiple neutrons, {{each of which}} can be absorbed by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the probability of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a function of the shape and mass of the uranium), k>0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction.

2500|$|Transsaccadic {{memory is}} {{characterized}} by the integration of information gathered prior to the execution of a saccade (pre-saccadic) and information gathered after the saccade (post-saccadic stimuli. This involves attention, [...] locating the targets necessary to perform a saccade and continuous updates of the environmental information. Attention occurs prior to the movement of the eyes, therefore it has a strong influence on the location of the saccade, what information is being encoded, remembered across saccades and stored into transsaccadic memory. In order to perform a successful and accurate saccade an individual is required to make an attentional shift to the saccadic target. This attentional shift causes the encoding of information to occur near the saccade target location. Attention to the target of the saccade results in better object identification and an increase in accuracy of identification. As well as, improvement in coding of locational information. Attention is restricted to one saccade target per area. It is impossible to keep attention on a target in one area, while performing another saccade simultaneously in another. This will cause prolonged saccadic latency periods (the time it takes to make a saccade from one area to another), and increased reaction times. However, attention can be distributed around the saccade target, rather than the precise location that will fall on the fovea, allowing for the detection of one or two objects situated around the saccadic target. Kowler (1995) proposed two models to explain the relationship between attention, saccades and transsaccadic memory. The spatial model, states that attention is distributed among the perceptual site (visual field) and the saccadic target during the <b>latency</b> <b>period,</b> which allows for the identification of the saccadic target and object surrounding that area. The temporal model states that attention determines [...] where the saccade will occur and releases a “go” signal to initiate a saccade within that area.|$|E

A point of mutation has been identified for the major form of hereditary hyperekplexia in the gene encoding the alpha 1 subunit of the glycine receptor. OBJECTIVE: To measure startle reflexes and autonomic responses in the major form of hereditary hyperekplexia in the original Dutch pedigree. DESIGN: Startle reflexes and autonomic responses were examined by administering 3 series of 20 auditory stimuli at intervals of 10 seconds (90 and 113 dB) and 60 seconds (113 dB). SETTING: The Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology at the Leiden University Hospital, Leiden, the Netherlands. SUBJECTS: Nine patients with the major form of hyperekplexia and 20 healthy controls. Of the 9 patients, 5 took medication. The patients {{are part of the}} Dutch hyperekplexia pedigree. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Startle responses were quantified with <b>latency</b> <b>periods</b> and areas of electromyographic bursts of the orbicular muscle of the eye, sternocleidomastoid and biceps muscles, and the thenar muscles. Autonomic reactions were measured with psychogalvanic responses and beat to beat changes of blood pressure and heart rate. RESULTS: The electromyographic bursts of the 4 muscles occurred in similar order in both patients and controls. The onset of the <b>latency</b> <b>periods</b> in the patient group was significantly (P <. 001) prolonged in patients who took medication. Without medication, patients had shorter <b>latency</b> <b>periods</b> of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (P =. 003) than controls. The electromyographic burst occurred significantly more often in patients than in controls (P <. 001). The areas of the bursts were significantly larger in patients than in controls (P <. 001); the degree of habituation was significantly stronger in patients than in controls (P <. 001). The amplitude of the psychogalvanic response was increased in hyperekplexia, and the degree of habituation was significantly weaker in patients than in controls. Blood pressure and heart rate did not clearly react in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Motor startle responses are stronger and show more habituation in patients with hereditary hyperekplexia than in controls. The excessive responses include the psychogalvanic response.
