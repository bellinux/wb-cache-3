40|$|High average {{rates of}} {{economic}} growth are often seen as evidence of good national leadership. This commonly-used metric substantially upward biases the growth contribution of leaders because transitory shocks also affect average growth rates. The bias is much larger in autocratic countries, because the transitory component of their growth rates tends {{to be much more}} volatile. Even identification of the best and worst leaders is prone to error due to differences in growth rates across data sources. Assuming a contemporaneous relationship between <b>leader</b> <b>quality</b> and growth, we decompose growth into a leader-specific component, a country-specific component and a (possibly auto-correlated) random component using four growth datasets and two leader datasets over 50 years and more than 100 countries.

METHODS: The ForeGround protocol was enacted on a midi tennis court.

A velocity-precision (VP) and velocity-precision-success (VPS) index were calculated to reveal interactive effects. The validity and sensitivity of the ForeGround procedure in the target population were determined by verifying whether test scores reflected minor differences in tennis experience. RESULTS: More experienced players {{scored significantly higher than}} beginning players for success rate, ball velocity, precision of ball placement, VP, and VPS. High to moderate intraclass correlation coefficients in this open skill test indicated satisfactory test reliability.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{nearly two}} decades of {{research}} have provided support for the social identity approach to leadership, most previous work has focused on leaders' identity prototypicality while neglecting the assessment of other equally important dimensions of social identity management. However, recent theoretical developments have argued {{that in order to}} mobilize and direct followers' energies, leaders need not only to ‘be one of us’ (identity prototypicality), but also to ‘do it for us’ (identity advancement), to ‘craft a sense of us’ (identity entrepreneurship), and to ‘embed a sense of us’ (identity impresarioship). In the present research we develop and validate an Identity Leadership Inventory (ILI) that assesses these dimensions in different contexts and with diverse samples from the US, China, and Belgium. Study 1 demonstrates that the scale has content validity such that the items meaningfully differentiate between the four dimensions.

In {{this article we}} analyze cross-national data on random leadership transitions, data on close elections in the US Congress, and data on randomly audited municipalities in Brazil. Across {{a wide range of}} outcomes, we consistently find that college-educated leaders perform about the same as or worse than leaders with less formal education. Politicians with college degrees do not tend to govern over more prosperous nations, do not pass more bills, do not tend to do better at the polls, and are no less likely to be corrupt. These findings have important implications for how citizens evaluate candidates, how scholars measure <b>leader</b> <b>quality,</b> and how we think about the role of education in policy making.

The cohort experience, with the pseudonym of the Urban Schools Human Resources Improvement Project, involved ten school districts in a learning experience over a three-year period of time.

Findings from this study revealed that there was evidence to suggest that Human Resources Leaders' strategic actions were aligned with the Odden framework.

40|$|This {{multi-level}} {{study examined}} the relationship between leaders’ global mindset with followers’ rating of trust in <b>leader,</b> <b>quality</b> of the leader-member relationship (LMX), and organizational commitment. Complexity of global role and leader distance were also examined as moderating variables. ^ Data were collected from 78 leader participants and 240 raters from one Fortune 100 multinational organization. A multilevel data analysis was conducted using Hierarchical Linear Modeling. No significant relationships were found between global mindset and ratings of follower trust in leader and quality of the leader-memberrelationship. A significant negative relationship was found between global mindset of leaders and follower organizational commitment. ^ Global roles and physical distance between the leader and the follower did not moderate the relationship between global leadership and outcome variables, however the frequency of interaction between leaders and followers did. Specifically, the involvement of frequency of interaction between leaders and followers increased and strengthened the relationship between global mindset and followers’ ratings of organizational commitment. This supported the notion that without a high amount of interaction, global mindset would not significantly impact ratings of organizational commitment. The relationship between the frequency of leader-follower interaction when a single follower interacted on average with more frequency than others in the group (within), significantly moderated the relationship between global mindset and affect-based trust in leader, LMX, and organizational commitment. Specifically, the involvement of frequency of leader-follower interactions within weakened the relationship between global mindset and affect-based trust, LMX, and organizational commitment as rated by followers. These results indicate that followers who interact on average more frequently with the leader {{than the rest of the}} group and the leader who has a global mindset, report lower scores of trust in leader, LMX, and organizational commitment. Because most participants were from a collectivistic culture, these findings are indicative that followers would rather be a part of the group than separate from the group even if that means less interaction with the leader. ...|$|E
