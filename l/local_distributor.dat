40|$|In this region, {{especially}} in Serbia, common {{belief is that}} <b>local</b> <b>distributors</b> of gas used by households don’t charge for gas properly. It is suspected {{that there are two}} sources for improper ways of gas charging. <b>Local</b> <b>distributors</b> charge for delivered gas only, according to flow rat but not according to gas quality. It is usual that <b>local</b> <b>distributors</b> deliver gas of different quality than one signed in contract. In this work will be considered only one of aspects inefficient charging for delivered gas by <b>local</b> gas <b>distributors,</b> which is connected to variable atmospheric pressure. There is doubt, that <b>local</b> <b>distributors</b> make mistakes during accounting for delivered gas to costumers in regard atmospheric pressure. At the beginning of every investigation, problem has to be located and recognized. Authors are going to collect as much as possible available data, to elaborate and analyze data by scientific methods and to represent conclusions. So, the aim of this work is to diagnose current state and to approve or disapprove above mentioned suspicions. In our region this theme is very interesting, both because of energy efficiency and air pollution control. In this way both consumer and distributor will know, how mush energy they have really spent...|$|R

25|$|On 10 April 1963, {{the eve of}} 18th Anniversary of Buchenwald's Self-Liberation, {{the film}} had its premiere in East Berlin's Colosseum Cinema. It was {{released}} in 24 copies in East Germany, and sold 806,915 tickets in the first year. By 1976, it had been viewed by 1.5 million people in cinemas, a number which rose to 2.5 million until 1994. In addition, 35mm reel copies were supplied to the National People's Army, the League of People's Friendship and to other public organizations. Private screenings were held in West Germany in April 1964 - for example, by the East-German-funded Uni-Doc-Verleih in Munich - but although the government never banned it, a <b>local</b> <b>distributor,</b> Pegasus Film, did not purchase the rights to it until 1967. By that time, the film had already been exported to all the European countries, {{as well as to}} Canada, the United States, India, Japan, China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Guinea. DFF first broadcast it on television in September 1966 and re-ran it five times during the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|The suburb is {{bisected}} principally by the A184. Built in 1959, {{the road}} is {{commonly referred to as}} the Felling bypass though it [...] "is really nothing of the kind" [...] as the road splits residential areas of Felling almost neatly in half. Journey time by car or bus to Gateshead town centre from the western fringe is approximately seven minutes and twelve minutes into the centre of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, while the journey time from the eastern parts of Felling is approximately ten minutes longer. Until the building of the bypass, the principal road in the settlement was B1426 Sunderland Road; a former turnpike road and tram route where civic and commercial buildings still stand as a testament to the road's past importance. While diminished in stature today, Sunderland Road remains an integral <b>local</b> <b>distributor.</b>|$|E

500|$|As {{with the}} first film, which {{did not have a}} {{theatrical}} release in China, the film's distributor Universal Pictures had troubles releasing the sequel. When it was reported in July 2013 that the film had been denied a theatrical release in China, then the second largest film market in the world, some analysts attributed this to the protection of locally produced animation. There were also rumors that the film's release was banned in China because the film's minions too much resembled former Chinese president Jiang Zemin. China's Film Bureau was [...] "furious" [...] about the negative comments, stating that the film was not submitted for censorship approval. In fact, there was reportedly a [...] "commercial conflict" [...] between Universal and Edko Films, the film's <b>local</b> <b>distributor,</b> over which titles are to be imported. Edko had decided that the film [...] "would not do well in China and decided against using one of the precious quota slots for the film." [...] In December 2013, {{a few weeks after the}} Universal Pictures' announcement that it would open a Beijing office, it was reported that Despicable Me 2 would be theatrically released in China on January 10, 2014.|$|E
500|$|The 12th Man Towel {{was created}} in the fall of 1985 by Rusty Riley and Kyle Harris, then {{president}} {{and vice president of the}} 12th Man Student Aggie Club, respectively, with the help of Gary Leach and Larry Leach, then club secretary and treasurer. The concept was presented to the Aggie Club faculty managers Harry Green Jr., executive director of the 12th Man Foundation, and Jackie Sherrill, Texas A University athletic director and head football coach. Once their approval was given, Rusty and Kyle found a manufacturer in New York City through a <b>local</b> <b>distributor</b> in Bryan, Texas, and authorization was given to sell the towels on campus by school management and Chic Sell, who had the concession rights in Kyle Field. [...] The first 1,000 towels were purchased and delivered in time for the first home game of the 1985 college football season. Kyle and Rusty, along with a handful of Aggie Club members, sold the towels for $2 each in makeshift booths at strategic locations within Kyle Field. It was an immediate success, with all towels being sold at the first game. [...] The A Yell Leaders initially resisted the towels, claiming the Aggie Club was breaking tradition, but the Battalion staff supported the concept and began a successful selling and media campaign to help the towel gain acceptance throughout the A student body. Rusty worked with the Head Yell Leader on accepting the towel and once the Yell Leaders accepted it, a press conference was held with Rusty, Coach Sherrill, and the Head Yell Leader. [...] As the football season carried on, the 12th Man Towel continued selling in large quantities. The Aggie Club hired students to sell the towels at the MSC and on Aggie Club property, which at the time was located right outside of the main entrance to Kyle Field. The towel also gained an important supporting cast when Coach Sherrill's 12th man kick-off team squad began carrying them to motivate the student body in the stands. The 1985 regular college football season ended with a home game versus the Texas Longhorns. At that game, a sea of white 12th Man Towels filled the stadium, cheering the Aggies to a 42-10 victory. The Aggies went on to win the Southwest Conference Title and defeat Auburn in the Cotton Bowl on January 1, 1986, with the 12th Man Towels proudly displayed to a national audience. Tony Pollacia (15), a member of the 12th man squad, and his towel-waving antics became legendary. When Texas A won its first Cotton Bowl under Coach Jackie Sherrill in 1986, the Dallas Morning News chose to run his photograph, in color, on the front page of its Sunday paper. During the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic, which A played against Notre Dame, another towel was a point of contention. [...] Twice during that game, Warren Barhorst, a member of Sherrill's 12th Man Kickoff Team, tackled Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown, and then grabbed Brown's towel and waved it over his head. [...] An infuriated Brown tackled Barhorst, earning himself a 15-yard unsportsman-like conduct penalty.|$|E
2500|$|The {{overall picture}} was further {{complicated}} by the establishment of coal depots in South London by the [...] "northern" [...] companies, mainly the MR and GNR, which enabled them {{to take control of}} the whole transit of the coal from colliery to <b>local</b> <b>distributor.</b> These depots were served by dedicated workings from the yards on the MR and GNR - latterly Brent Sidings and Ferme Park – via the Widened Lines and running powers established at various dates.
