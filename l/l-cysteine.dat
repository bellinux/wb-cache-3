25|$|The animal-originating {{sources of}} <b>L-cysteine</b> {{as a food}} {{additive}} are a point of contention for people following dietary restrictions such as Kosher, Halal, Vegan or Vegetarian. To avoid this problem, <b>L-cysteine</b> can also be sourced from microbial or other synthetic processes.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{alternate}} reactions involving CBS is the condensation of cysteine with homocysteine to form cystathionine and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S {{in the brain}} is produced from <b>L-cysteine</b> by CBS. This alternative metabolic pathway is also dependent on adoMet.|$|E
25|$|Cysteine, {{mainly the}} L-enantiomer, is a {{precursor}} in the food, pharmaceutical and personal-care industries. One {{of the largest}} applications is the production of flavors. For example, the reaction of cysteine with sugars in a Maillard reaction yields meat flavors. <b>L-Cysteine</b> is also used as a processing aid for baking.|$|E
25|$|Glutathione {{is not an}} {{essential}} nutrient for humans, since it can be synthesized in the body from the amino acids <b>L-cysteine,</b> L-glutamic acid, and glycine; {{it does not have}} to be present as a supplement in the diet. The sulfhydryl group (SH) of cysteine serves as a proton donor and is responsible for its biological activity. Cysteine is the rate-limiting factor in cellular glutathione biosynthesis, since this amino acid is relatively rare in foods.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the {{reactive}} cytochrome P450-reactive metabolite formed by paracetamol (acetaminophen), which becomes toxic when GSH is depleted by an overdose of acetaminophen, glutathione is an essential antidote to overdose. Glutathione conjugates to NAPQI and helps to detoxify it. In this capacity, it protects cellular protein thiol groups, which would otherwise become covalently modified; when all GSH has been spent, NAPQI begins to react with the cellular proteins, killing the cells in the process. The preferred treatment for an overdose of this painkiller is the administration (usually in atomized form) of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (often as a preparation called Mucomyst), which is processed by cells to <b>L-cysteine</b> and used in the de novo synthesis of GSH.|$|E
25|$|Newton, et al. cultured L. jordanis {{and various}} other species of Legionella in BCYE or ACES broth. DNA {{extraction}} and PCR amplification were done under standard conditions. However, due to low GC-content and the mismatching of base pairs, the temperature used during subtractive hybridization was adjusted to 35°C. Small amounts of biosynthetic enzymes <b>L-cysteine</b> synthase and acetyltransferase were detected in L. jordanis and L. pneumophila; 19 open reading frames (ORFs) were found in L. jordanis, {{with a range of}} punitive functions making up around 47.5% of the 41 sequences represented by 40 ORFs. L. jordanis was found to contain the gene loci sidH, sidE, sidB, and sidG which express an Dot/Icm effector protein. This effector protein is essential for L. pneumophila to infiltrate host cells, so it is thought {{to be used as a}} virulence factor in L. jordanis, also. Both strains of L. jordanis tested positive for proteolysis and hemolysis. They did not test positive for cytotoxicity. Several species of Legionella “produced different proteolytic cleavage patterns on synthetic peptide substrates.” This suggests some genetic differences exist between the proteases produced by the different species of Legionella, despite them having some similarities. L. jordanis also appears to contain complex chains of lipopolysaccharides. Legionella species use amino acids as both carbon and energy sources.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of <b>L-cysteine</b> is obtained industrially by hydrolysis of animal materials, such as poultry feathers or hog hair. Despite widespread belief otherwise, {{there is little}} evidence that human hair is used as a source material and its use is explicitly banned in the European Union. Synthetically produced <b>L-cysteine,</b> compliant with Jewish kosher and Muslim halal laws, is also available, albeit at a higher price. [...] The synthetic route involves fermentation using a mutant of E. coli. Degussa introduced a route from substituted thiazolines.

50|$|According to {{the series}} of assays {{performed}} by Cleland (1967), the linear rate of pyruvate formation at various concentrations of inhibitors demonstrated that <b>L-cysteine</b> and D-serine competitively inhibit the enzyme SDH. The reason that SDH activity is inhibited by <b>L-cysteine</b> is because an inorganic sulfur is created from <b>L-Cysteine</b> via Cystine Desulfrase and sulfur-containing groups are known to promote inhibition. In addition, researchers have shown that L-threonine competitively inhibits Serine Dehydratase as well.|$|E
