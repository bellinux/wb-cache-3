Eleven days after the escape he {{appeared}} in public at the Wolfe Tone commemoration in Bodenstown, County Kildare, where troops from the Irish Army and the Garda's Special Branch attempted to arrest him, but failed after the crowd threw missiles and <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the road blocking access. He was arrested in January 1982 along with Angelo Fusco, and sentenced to ten years imprisonment for the escape under extra-jurisdictional legislation. Shortly before his release from prison in 1989 Magee was served with an extradition warrant, and he started a legal battle to avoid being returned to Northern Ireland. In October 1991 the Supreme Court in Dublin ordered his return to Northern Ireland to serve his sentence for the murder of Captain Westmacott, but Magee had jumped bail and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E

Upon hearing this news, Ali began to cry but was consoled by Fatimah who asked him to look after her two sons and for him to bury her without ceremony. It is further stated that her two sons were the first family members to learn of her death and immediately proceeded to the mosque to inform their father. Upon hearing the news, Ali fell unconscious. After recovering he followed Fatima's wishes and performed the janazah. He buried her during the night on 13 Jumada al-awwal 11AH (632 AD), also making three false graves to ensure her real grave could not be identified. With him were his family and a few of his close companions. After her death, Ali followed her wishes and buried her without informing the Medinan people.|$|E

The Rebels mounted one last drive and reached the Tigers' 1-yard line before Cannon and Warren Rabb made a game-saving tackle on the fourth down and with 18 seconds on the clock. The Tigers won [...] 7–3. After the game, Cannon <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the tunnel, exhausted and unable to reach the locker room.

2500|$|The 12-metre {{class rules}} stipulated that the hull {{had to be}} the same {{thickness}} throughout and could not be made lighter in the bow and stern.

At one press conference Dennis Conner asked, [...] "Why would you build a plastic yacht ... unless you wanted to cheat?" [...] Despite attempts to defuse the situation, the [...] "cheating comment" [...] added to the controversy surrounding the Louis Vuitton challenge races.

2500|$|Under {{the modern}} view, “common law” is not {{grounded}} in “custom” or [...] "ancient usage," [...] but rather acquires {{force of law}} instantly (without the delay implied by the term [...] "custom" [...] or [...] "ancient") when pronounced by a higher court, because {{and to the extent}} the proposition is stated in judicial opinion. From the earliest times through the late 19th century, the dominant theory was that the common law was a pre-existent law or system of rules, a social standard of justice that existed in the habits, customs, and thoughts of the people. Under this older view, the legal profession considered it no part of judge's duty to make new or change existing law, but only to expound and apply the old. By the early 20th century, largely at the urging of Oliver Wendell Holmes (as discussed throughout this article), this view had fallen into the minority view: Holmes pointed out that the older view worked undesirable and unjust results, and hampered a proper development of the law. In the century since Holmes, the dominant understanding has been that common law “decisions are themselves law, or rather the rules which the courts <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> making the decisions constitute law.” The reality of the modern view can be seen in practical operation: under the old [...] "pre-existing custom" [...] view, (a) jurisdictions could not logically diverge from each other (but nonetheless did), (b) a new decision logically needed to operate retroactively (but did not), and (c) there was no standard to decide which English medieval customs should be [...] "law" [...] and which should not. All three tensions resolve under the modern view: (a) the common law in different jurisdictions may diverge, (b) new decisions need not have retroactive operation, and (c) court decisions are effective immediately as they are issued, not years later, or after they become [...] "custom," [...] and questions of what [...] "custom" [...] might have been at some [...] "ancient" [...] time are simply irrelevant.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} return in February 2000, at Bash at the Beach on July 9, Hogan was {{involved}} in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo; Hogan wanted to take the title, but Russo was going to have Jarrett win, and lose it to Booker T. Russo told Hogan {{that he was going to}} have Jarrett lie down for him, simulating a real conflict, although Jarrett was not told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett's chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, [...] "Is this your idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!" [...] After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title belt. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, [...] "I can guarantee you that this is the last time you will ever see that piece of shit in a WCW stadium!" [...] This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the [...] "creative control" [...] clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, [...] "That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [...] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!". Since Hogan refused to job to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.|$|E

2500|$|Chauncey Yellow Robe ("Kills in the Woods") (Canowicakte) {{was born}} {{in what is now}} {{southern}} Montana around 1867, in the Sičháŋǧu Oyáte in Lakota or [...] "Burnt Thighs Nation." [...] Chauncey's father Chief Yellow Robe (Tasinagi), first known as White Thunder, assumed the name Yellow Robe name for his heroic war deeds against a Yellow Robe family of Crow Indians. [...] Tasinagi was a descendant of two famous leaders of the Sioux nation, Sitting Bull and Iron Plume. Tasinagi signed the Treaty of 1868, [...] fought in the Battle of the Little Big Horn and died in 1904 at the age of eighty-seven, Chauncey's mother Tachcawin (Deer Woman), was a niece of Sitting Bull and had seven children with Chief Yellow Robe. As a boy, Chauncey lived on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. [...] "Kills in the Woods" [...] was trained in Lakota skills of making bows and arrows, riding ponies bareback, foot racing, wrestling and swimming. [...] "Sometimes during a morning of a winter blizzard my father used to wake me up out of my warm bed of buffalo robes and dare me to go out and <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the deep snow and roll in it 'as I had come into the world'. This was not as a punishment, but a [...] test of endurance." [...] Chauncey did not see a white man until he was ten or eleven years old. When he did, he could not decide if it was a man or an animal, and as the creature approached, he decided it was an evil spirit and ran to the tipi of his father. Canowicakte spent many hours in the tipi of his grandfather and grandmother. They were his tutors in legends and history of the tribe. He was expected to memorize all these stories so that he in turn would be able to relate them to his children. [...] He was taught respect and reverence for Wakan-tanka, the Great Mystery. [...] He learned of the great and inspiring deeds of the famous chiefs, warriors and medicine men. He was trained in the old customs of how to make bows and arrows for hunting and for wars. He learned how to hunt deer and buffalo. He enjoyed wrestling, swimming and foot racing with his companions. Later in his life, Chauncey would spend many hours telling his children the Lakota tales he was told by his grandparents.|$|E
