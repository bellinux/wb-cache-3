25|$|On November 2, 2007, the Associated Press {{published}} {{a story about}} a judgment in favor of readers who felt deceived by Frey's claims of A Million Little Pieces being a memoir.

25|$|A {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} film's plot originated when veteran Indian writer Dayanand Rajan {{claimed that the}} plot of the film was plagiarised from his unpublished novel Summer Snow. It's shocking that the main plot, the love story, the hero being wheelchair-bound due to an accident and even the mercy killing are the same as in the movie. The other similarities include a serious accident, in both the scripts, which require the protagonist to begin using a wheelchair and introduce him to the woman taking care of him – it is the nurse who falls in love with Hrithik, while in the novel it is his wife who looks after him. Both scripts having key flashback scenes and the woman supporting mercy killing for the hero. Raajan has dashed off a <b>legal</b> <b>notice</b> to the producers, UTV and Bhansali asking them for an explanation on how their film has so many similarities with his novel but Bhansali's office refused to accept the notice. In late-October, a PIL was filed by Aditya Dewan, a lawyer, in Delhi High Court alleging that Guzaarish promotes euthanasia or mercy killing, which is illegal, and portrays the legal profession in bad light. He demanded a disclaimer from the producers saying mercy killing is not legal in India {{and that there is a}} debate on whether such deaths can be allowed. But the case was dismissed by the court saying the facts averred were inadequate for the court to appreciate and that it cannot be entertained in its present form..|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} also been said to be {{inspired}} by The Devotion of Suspect X, a Japanese novel written by Keigo Higashino.

A 2006 episode of the satirical British television show Star Stories (2006–2008) was entitled Catherine Zeta-Jones— Her Quest to Prove Herself...

Addressing her perceived media image, Zeta-Jones remarked in a 2004 interview to USA Weekend: [...] "The biggest misconception of me is that I'm some die-hard, ambitious, do-anything-to-get-anything kind of person, I'm not. I'm very shy socially." [...] Zeta-Jones is protective of her public image, {{and the use of}} her likeness is carefully controlled.
