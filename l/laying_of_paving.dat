40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) can {{be successfully}} used to externally strengthen reinforced concrete (RC) bridges where fire {{is not a}} primary concern. Nevertheless, common maintenance activity on a bridge deck, such as the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> bituminous <b>paving,</b> can easily lead the FRP to temperatures higher than the glass transition temperature, Tg. Exceeding Tg does not necessarily imply a drastic reduction in strength and stiffness of the reinforcement. Nevertheless, the softening of the resin implies a drastic reduction in its adhesion properties. Therefore, {{the efficiency of the}} strengthening system for existing structures, which mainly depends on the effectiveness of the bond between FRP and concrete, is significantly affected by temperature. The relationships suggested by Italian and American codes in order to evaluate the limit strain for FRP debonding at normal temperature are modified {{to take into account the}} effect of high temperature. Then, performances at high temperature of RC bridge decks strengthened with externally bonded FRP plates (EBR) are investigated by considering thermal fields in the structural members which are different from the normal ones. Both fire and the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> bituminous <b>paving</b> on the decks are considered. In addition, the thicknesses of the slabs and the protective layer are varied to assess their influence on the thermal field in the slabs. The results are discussed with reference to both ultimate and serviceability limit states...|$|R

40|$|Paving blocks are {{building}} material products that {{used as an}} alternative to pave land surfaces. Quality <b>of</b> <b>paving</b> blocks according to SNI 03 - 0691 - 1989 and BS 6717 was determined based on its compressive strength. But on field, {{it can be seen that}} the cracking pattern is different with the cracking pattern caused by compressive strength in the laboratory. Paving blocks tested by compressive strength, crack occured on around edge <b>of</b> <b>paving</b> while on the field, cracking occured across in the middle <b>of</b> the <b>paving.</b> Therefore, the BS EN 1338 recommend for testing <b>of</b> <b>paving</b> block quality by using tensile splitting test. This final assignment research for the quality test <b>of</b> <b>paving</b> using compressive test based on BS 6717 and tensile splitting test based on BS EN 1338. The testing <b>of</b> <b>paving</b> blocks used samples with a planned quality of 400 kg/cm 2 and 500 kg/cm 2 with dimension 21 x 10. 5 x 8 cm and the total sample are 128 paving blocks.
