40|$|Abstract. As we gain {{experience}} with parallel <b>le</b> <b>systems,</b> it becomes {{increasingly clear that}} a single solution does not suit all applications. For example, {{it appears to be}} impossible to nd a single appropriate interface, caching policy, le structure, or disk-management strategy. Furthermore, the proliferation of le-system interfaces and abstractions make applications di cult to port. We propose that the traditional functionality of parallel <b>le</b> <b>systems</b> be separated into two components: a xed core that is standard on all platforms, encapsulating only primitive abstractions and interfaces, and a set of high-level libraries to provide a variety of abstractions and applicationprogrammer interfaces (APIs). We present our current and next-generation <b>le</b> <b>systems</b> as examples of this structure. Their features, such as a three-dimensional le structure, strided read and write interfaces, and I/O-node programs, are speci cally designed with the exibility and performance necessary to support a wide range of applications. ...|$|R

Achieving this conve-nient feature presents a challenging data struc-tural problem because the amount of data in-volved is so large: it must use as little space as possible, and provide ecient operations for modifying the current state and accessing both current and past states. We formalize persistent le systems as a problem in data structures, and analyze {{it in the context of}} the external memory model.
