5|$|In 2011, 22.7% of the {{population}} in the Salford USD (Urban Subdivision) were non-white British compared with 15.6% for the surrounding borough. The USD had a slightly larger percentage of Asian and black people. Salford has become a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> ethnically diverse since the previous census, probably due to the relocation of many BBC establishments from London between 2011 and 2012. This has created lots of jobs and encouraged migration to the area, which was previously very deprived since the loss of many traditional industries in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested {{that there would be a}} <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
5|$|On {{return to}} his parent club, Mousinho played a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> {{frequently}} during the 2006–07 season, a total of 39 times, and was subsequently rewarded with an extended contract which was due to run until June 2009. The following campaign, he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 win against Barnet – tapping in the rebound from Kevin O'Connor's missed penalty, and also scored Brentford's first against Dagenham & Redbridge shortly after. However, he only played a total of 24 times in all competitions, 15 times less than during the club's previous campaign. At {{the end of the}} 2007–08 season, Mousinho was transfer–listed by manager Andy Scott because he did not feature in the club's future plans and, as a result, his first–team chances would be limited.|$|E

5|$|Intimidation is an {{important}} element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.|$|E

The twins Veda and Star remain in the old neighborhood and hang out at Cascade on Sundays, while Erin goes to Spelman College, the school she wanted to attend, in which Rashad appreciates a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> because she's still close. Uncle George starts attending church more often and finds a good woman to date. Ant changes direction, discarding the notion of drug dealing, finds a new girlfriend and begins to focus on his studies in school. Rashad, lastly, becomes a comic artist for the Sunday edition of the Atlanta Evening Standard, the city's newspaper. The film ends with Rashad leaving his skates in Cascades, and the building's lights go off.|$|E
25|$|Surat al-Falaq {{mentions}} the harms people {{would get in}} their worldly matters, whereas Surat an-Nās {{mentions the}} harms people would get in their religious matter.
