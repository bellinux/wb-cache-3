50|$|Targeting {{free speech}} can take various forms. As the media plays {{a crucial role}} in {{disseminating}} information, States often overregulated media in order to <b>limit,</b> <b>control</b> or prevent critical and dissenting voices to express. In some cases, the pluralistic views are also undermined by media concentration in just a few private corporations. Criminalisation of dissent by using defamation provisions is also commonly used to restrict freedom of expression. Acts of violence against journalists and media workers for reason related to their professional work often occurs and limits the right to freedom of expression and access to information as it also prevents the public from accessing that information.|$|E

An alternative proposal to use <b>control</b> <b>limits</b> narrower than three sigma <b>control</b> <b>limits</b> is made. The main reason for narrowing the <b>control</b> <b>limits</b> is to achieve a smaller variability in the frequency of process resetting as well as false alarms.

The control is distributed on a compact subset interior to the domain.

We prove that there exists a <b>limit</b> <b>control</b> as the homogenization parameter converges to zero, which results as the limit of fixed points for controllability problems.

40|$|This paper {{focus on}} {{evaluation}} of impacts of traffic control strategies on traffic congestion relief. The traffic simulation network is modeled in a traffic microsimulation {{environment and the}} calibration {{with the real world}} data. As for traffic control strategies, fixed-time ramp metering, speed <b>limit</b> <b>control</b> and integrated control are tested and performances are compared with the actual condition along the stretch. The results indicate that there is an optimal cycle length for fixed time ramp metering and the best performance achieved at 15 s. The speed limits are tested for 60 to 100 km/h range with 10 km/h increments. Maximum performance is achieved at the speed of 70 km/h. The performance of integrated control is also examined. The results show that, 15 s cycle time fixed-time ramp metering along with 70 km/h speed <b>limit</b> <b>control</b> has the best performance overall. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the viability of integrated traffic control in metropolitan freeways is highly auspicious.

He also believes that the patron who is being denied the book is affected differently depending on {{the intent of the}} person who is choosing to limit the book. Asheim makes the analogy of the difference between someone’s leg being amputated by a doctor who is doing it because it is necessary, versus a leg being amputated by someone who is psychotic and is doing it because of a sick compulsion. The man who has had his leg amputated by the psychotic knows the difference and is affected differently than if a doctor had done it out of a need to help his patient.|$|R

30|$|In this study, dynamic {{traffic control}} strategies, namely dynamic ramp {{metering}} and dynamic speed <b>limit</b> <b>control,</b> {{have been examined}} through microscopic traffic simulation based on site measurements. In this context, the traffic flow data at a particular highway intersection have been analyzed to determine {{the pattern of the}} traffic. Then, the traffic model has been built in a traffic micro-simulation software and calibrated with the field data. The foci of the study are to measure the efficiency of the dynamic traffic control strategies and to compare it with the uncontrolled case considering various performance indicators such as total travel time, average delay time per vehicle, and average number of stops per vehicle. For the dynamic ramp metering strategies, the ALINEA (Asservissement Lineaire d’Entree Autoroutiere - French for Linear Utilization for Highway Entrances) control algorithm is implemented with different fixed-time cycle lengths. It has been observed that various ramp metering implementations decreased the average delay time per vehicle up to 30 %. The dynamic speed <b>limit</b> <b>control</b> strategies are set according to the occupancy rates that are measured at the bottleneck downstream. The examined speed <b>limit</b> <b>control</b> strategies decreased the average delay time per vehicle to around 7 %. The results also revealed that the implemented dynamic traffic control strategies help alleviate congestion by increasing the capacity of the bottleneck section.|$|E

However, the total travel time could not be significantly increased with this control strategy. For the second dynamic speed <b>limit</b> <b>control</b> strategy (DSLC 2), it decreased the average delay time per vehicle by 7 %, average speed of vehicles by 6 %, average stopped delay per vehicle by 7 %, total delay time by 8 %, number of stops by 2 %, and total stopped delay by 9 %. The total travel time remained the same for this control strategy as well.|$|E
