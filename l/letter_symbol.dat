5000|$|The IEC {{standard}} (IEC 60364) codifies {{methods of}} installing neutral and ground conductors in a building, where these earthing systems are designated with <b>letter</b> <b>symbols.</b> The <b>letter</b> <b>symbols</b> {{are common in}} countries using IEC standards, but North American practices rarely refer to the IEC symbols. The differences are that the conductors may be separate over their entire run from equipment to earth ground, or may be combined over {{all or part of}} their length. Different systems are used to minimize the voltage difference between neutral and local earth ground. Current flowing in a grounding conductor will produce a voltage drop along the conductor, and grounding systems seek to ensure this voltage does not reach unsafe levels.|$|R

50|$|Power {{amplifier}} classes are, in electronics, a <b>letter</b> <b>symbol</b> {{applied to}} {{different types of}} power amplifier. The amplifier classes give a broad indication of the characteristics and performance {{of different types of}} amplifier. The classes are related to the time period that the active amplifier device is passing current, expressed as a fraction of the period of a signal waveform applied to the input. A class A amplifier is conducting all though the period of each signal; Class B only for one-half the input period, class C for much less than half the input period. A Class D amplifier operates its output device in a switching manner; the fraction of the time that the device is conducting is adjusted so a pulse width modulation output is obtained from the stage.|$|E

To add to this confusing multitude of <b>letters</b> and <b>symbols</b> {{is the fact that}} there are several renegade <b>letters</b> and <b>symbols</b> that are not officially counted, but do exist in some Arabic loan words.

50|$|When Tokelauan {{became more}} than just a spoken {{language}}, like any other written language the peoples developed an alphabet. The Tokelauan alphabet consists of fifteen letters with five vowels and ten consonants. The alphabet is ordered in the following way: aeiou fgklmnphtv. Like English, vowels can be short or long. Moreover, vowels are lengthened for a more expressive statement. To indicate whether a vowel is read short or long, Tokelauan language denotes a long vowel with a macron over the <b>letter</b> <b>symbol.</b> A macron is a horizontal line, also seen in English. However, it is worthwhile to note that not all Tokelauan speaking peoples agree {{with the use of the}} macron. Those residing in the three atolls of Tokelau are known to have shown much resistance to the macron, while the Tokelauan speakers of New Zealand are more open and accepting of adopting the use of this linguistic symbol.|$|E
5000|$|Plain yellow, green, {{and even}} black flags {{have been used}} to symbolize disease in both ships and ports, with the color yellow having a longer {{historical}} precedent, as a color of marking for houses of infection, previous to its use as a maritime marking color for disease. The present flag used for the purpose is the [...] "Lima" [...] (L) flag, which is a mixture of yellow and black flags previously used. It is sometimes called the [...] "yellow jack" [...] but this was also a name for yellow fever, which probably derives its common name from the flag, not the color of the victims (cholera ships also used a yellow flag). The plain yellow flag ("Quebec" [...] or Q in international maritime signal flags) probably derives its <b>letter</b> <b>symbol</b> for its initial use in quarantine, but this flag in modern times indicates the opposite—a ship that declares itself free of quarantinable disease, and requests boarding and routine port inspection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{early work}} {{began as a}} part {{numbering}} system for devices which became popular in the 1960s. The first semiconductor devices, such as the 1N23 silicon point contact diode, were still designated in the old RMA tube designation system, where the [...] "1" [...] stood for [...] "No filament/heater" [...] and the [...] "N" [...] stood for [...] "crystal rectifier". The first RMA digit thus was re-allocated from [...] "heater power" [...] to [...] "p-n junction count" [...] to form the new EIA/JEDEC EIA-370 standard; for example, the 1N4001 rectifier diode and 2N2222 transistor part numbers came from EIA-370. They are still popular today. In February 1982, JEDEC issued JESD370B, superseding the original EIA-370 and introducing a new <b>letter</b> <b>symbol</b> [...] "C" [...] that denotes the die version, as opposed to [...] "N", now meaning the packaged version. The Japanese JIS semiconductor designation system employs a similar pattern. JEDEC later developed a numbering system for integrated circuits, but this did not gain acceptance in the semiconductor industry. The European Pro Electron semiconductor numbering system originated {{in a similar way}} from the older Mullard-Philips tube designation.|$|E
