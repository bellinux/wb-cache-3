25|$|The {{influence}} of the Church on Western letters and <b>learning</b> <b>has</b> been formidable. The ancient texts of the Bible have deeply influenced Western art, literature and culture.

In time, the Cathedral schools developed into Europe's earliest universities and the church has established thousands of primary, secondary and tertiary institutions throughout the world in the centuries since.

Thus different schools of opinion exist as to the role and {{influence of}} the Church in relation to western letters and learning.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{research}} {{is to determine the}} effect of learning models on learning achievement viewed from students independence learning. The type of the research is a quasi-experimental. The population are the seventh grade students of junior high school at Surakarta. The sample are 268 students. Sampling is done by stratified cluster random sampling. Instruments which are used to collect data are achievement tests and questionnaire of students independence learning. Hypothesis test is two-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The results of this research are as follows: 1) the TPS-GNT learning model gives better learning achievement than TPS and direct learning model, and TPS learning model gives better learning achievement than direct learning model. 2) the students with high independence <b>learning</b> <b>have</b> better <b>learning</b> achievement than students with medium and low independence learning, and the students with medium independence <b>learning</b> <b>have</b> better <b>learning</b> achievement than students with low independence learning. 3) in each learning model, the students with high, medium and low independence <b>learning</b> <b>have</b> the same <b>learning</b> achievement. 4) in the high independence learning, students with TPS-GNT, TPS and direct <b>learning</b> model <b>have</b> the same <b>learning</b> achievement, but in the medium and low independence learning, students with TPS-GNT <b>learning</b> model <b>have</b> better <b>learning</b> achievement than students with direct model, students with TPS-GNT and TPS <b>learning</b> model <b>have</b> the same <b>learning</b> achievement and students with TPS and direct <b>learning</b> model <b>have</b> the same <b>learning</b> achievement...|$|R

Many industrial multiversities and specialist colleges have been established, strengthening some incomplete subjects and establishing new specialties, e.g., automation, nuclear power, energy resources, oceanography, nuclear physics, computer science, polymer chemistry, polymer physics, radiochemistry, physical chemistry and biophysics. A project for creating 100 world class universities began in 1993, which has merged 708 schools of higher learning into 302 universities. Merging schools of higher <b>learning</b> <b>has</b> produced far-reaching reform of higher education management, optimizing of educational resources allocation, and further improving teaching quality and school standards.

25|$|These {{results show}} that {{at the age of}} 6 months infants are {{sensitive}} to how often certain sounds occur in the language they are exposed to and they can learn which cues are important to pay attention to from these differences in frequency of occurrence. In natural language exposure this means typical sounds in a language (such as prevoiced /d/ in Spanish) occur often and infants can learn them from mere exposure to them in the speech they hear. All of this occurs before infants are aware of the meaning of any of the words they are exposed to, and therefore the phenomenon of statistical <b>learning</b> <b>has</b> been used to argue for the fact that infants can learn sound contrasts without meaning being attached to them.|$|E
25|$|Soloveitchik's four step {{scholarly}} {{approach to}} <b>learning</b> <b>has</b> influenced {{many of his}} students. The approach {{can be traced back}} to the approach of the Gaon of Vilna. The first step is concentrating on the text. This follows the Vilna Gaon's approach of carefully amending the texts of both exoteric (the Talmud) and esoteric works (for instance, the Torat Kohanim, Tosefta, Avot de-Rabbi Natan, etc.). The second step is knowing the physical reality of the objects described. Third is the conceptual analysis proffered by Rishonim. At this point he introduces an important distinction between Rishonim, which are primary sources, and must be mastered, even if one has to struggle to understand them; and Achronim, which are secondary sources, which can be exploited (if you find good material, use it, but if you don't understand it, don't spend too much time on it). The fourth and final step is sevarah, creating the intellectual framework underpinning the Torah.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} of statistical learning was first discovered {{in the context of}} language acquisition and there is much evidence of its role in that purpose, work since the original discovery has suggested that statistical learning may be a domain general skill and is likely not unique to humans. For example, Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, and Newport found that both adults and infants were able to learn statistical probabilities of “words” created by playing different musical tones (i.e., participants heard the musical notes D, E, and F presented together during training and were able to recognize those notes as a unit at test as compared to three notes that had not been presented together). In non-auditory domains, there is evidence that humans are able to learn statistical visual information whether that information is presented across space, e.g., or time, e.g.,. Evidence of statistical <b>learning</b> <b>has</b> also been found in other primates, e.g., and some limited statistical learning abilities have been found even in non-primates like rats. Together these findings suggest that statistical learning may be a generalized learning mechanism that happens to be utilized in language acquisition, rather than a mechanism that is unique to the human infant’s ability to learn his or her language(s).|$|E

No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This {{is in contrast to}} education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more [...] "entertaining" [...] and entertainment or marketing seek to be more [...] "educational".
