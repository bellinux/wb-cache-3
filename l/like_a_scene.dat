500|$|After {{working for}} twenty {{months at the}} war front, in September 1919 Banker {{and the rest of}} her team {{returned}} home. General Edgar Russel, chief signal officer of the AEF, extolled their service as [...] "indispensable". Reminiscing about her wartime experience as chief operator, Banker humorously noted that [...] "an afternoon in the switchboard office sometimes sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from Alice in Wonderland, where only the initiated can make sense of the proceedings". She also noted the confidentiality aspect of her assignment when she was tested by an intelligence officer about her ability to keep a secret, which was about her posting out of the unit. About her work at the war front she said that [...] "the secrecy surrounding their operations gave it an aura of romance and set it apart from the civilian work". After returning from the war front with her team, she reflected: [...] "We missed the First Army with its code of loyalty and hard work. We were back in the petty squabbles of civilian life where even chief operators had 'tantrums' and where the wives of civilians attached to the Peace Conference spilled all over Paris in Army cars." ...|$|E
500|$|Phillips {{claimed the}} Dexter staff {{did not know}} how the finale would {{conclude}} until late in the season, but Phillips said Rita's death began to feel inevitable as the story evolved. [...] However, Julie Benz said she had been told John Lithgow knew about it {{from the beginning of the}} season. Phillips said the staff felt obligated to do more than simply kill the Trinity Killer in the final episode, especially because he felt the death of the third season antagonist (played by Jimmy Smits) was not handled [...] "as well as we could have". The writers discussed the idea of having Debra find out about Dexter's secret life, but it was decided they could not anticipate how drastically the series would be changed by that revelation. Benz heard rumors from David Zayas that her character would be killed in the episode, but she was not officially notified until late September, when the producers held a meeting with her the day before the season finale script was distributed to the cast. She said, [...] "It was a tough meeting. In a bizarre way, it felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from Defending Your Life." [...] Benz was unhappy about the news but she handled it professionally. Benz described the death scene as [...] "very poetic".|$|E

She loved being with us. We loved having her with us. She took it... professionally. She was greatly disappointed. She’s a professional. She works in television.

5000|$|When Gus and Lassiter run up a {{staircase}} to save Juliet, the camera view is rotated and descends the tower stairways to look <b>like</b> <b>an</b> iconic <b>scene</b> from Vertigo.|$|R
50|$|With the STV weatherman, Seán Batty, she {{promoted}} the Energy Saving Trust's new campaign. George Square in Glasgow was decorated <b>like</b> <b>a</b> snow <b>scene</b> in winter to draw people's attention to heating {{their homes in}} winter.|$|R
500|$|A {{retrospective}} feature by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Good Game highlighted Red Alarm {{as one of}} the Virtual Boy's most visually impressive games due to its polygonal graphics. The outlet praised it as one of {{the most}} entertaining titles on the console. Video game database AllGame gave the game a two and a half out of five rating, noting how the graphics made it difficult to play. The review stated that the design of the graphics [...] "makes structures hard to see because there is empty space between the lines defining them. Add multiple enemy fighters and ground defenses into the mix, and it can be very difficult to navigate your ship, especially when you are trying to fight back!" [...] The review concluded that the developers [...] "have created a very detailed setting for which to fight in. Walls have faces stretching out of them <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from The Abyss, there are several interesting bosses to combat, and you'll even hear some speech. Deep down there is a fine shooter that is simply hard to enjoy due to the limitations of the hardware... and that is truly a shame." [...] In 2008, Kolan called it [...] "a really competent shooter" [...] with strong visuals and gameplay. The following year, Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer summarized Red Alarm as [...] "pretty good fun to play", although inferior to Star Fox. However, Wireds Chris Kohler later opined that the game [...] "kind of sucked".|$|E
2500|$|The second Test at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria was won by South Africa 28–25 {{with the}} last kick of the game – a penalty by Morné Steyn from inside his own half. The Lions had led 19–8 after an hour, but tries from Bryan Habana and Jaque Fourie allowed South Africa to tie the score before Steyn's series-winning kick. It was {{described}} as [...] "devastation" [...] for the Lions, with the team ending the game [...] "looking more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from [...] ER {{as opposed to a}} rugby team".|$|E
2500|$|During 1924, Bow's [...] "horrid" [...] flapper raced against Moore's [...] "whimsical". In May, Moore renewed {{her efforts}} in The Perfect Flapper, {{produced}} by her husband. However, despite good reviews, she suddenly withdrew. [...] "No more flappers... they have served their purpose... {{people are tired}} of soda-pop love affairs", she told the Los Angeles Times, which had commented a month earlier, [...] "Clara Bow is the one outstanding type. She has almost immediately been elected for all the recent flapper parts". In November 1933, looking back to this period of her career, Bow described the atmosphere in Hollywood as <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from a movie about the French Revolution, where [...] "women are hollering and waving pitchforks twice as violently as any of the guys... the only ladies in sight are the ones getting their heads cut off." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rebirth. To {{the singing}} of American Indian children, the piano is quickly pulled away and the statue's womb begins to glow, green and red, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nativity <b>scene.</b> The {{sunlight}} returns, and seven boys are born, one for each weekday [...]|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the album sleeve features artwork by long-time Cathedral artist Dave Patchett. Dorrian, describing the art as [...] "climactic", notes that [...] "it's not <b>like</b> <b>a</b> usual epic Dave Patchett piece where he does the full spread; it's just {{one section of the}} artwork now. It's basically thank you and goodbye, fuck you God or whatever. It's just <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> inside The Last Spire I suppose; almost <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nativity <b>scene</b> gone wrong." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{director}} William Fruet, Donaldson {{stated that}} she [...] "knew {{that he would}} do things off-the-cuff at the last minute, <b>like</b> changing <b>a</b> <b>scene.</b> I might not have been called in that day and suddenly I’d get a call telling me [...] "Get to the set now!", and I’d have to do <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> I hadn’t memorized yet. It was tense that way." ...|$|R
2500|$|The cover {{photo of}} the 50th anniversary edition, {{published}} by Penguin Modern Classics {{for sale in the}} UK and aimed at the adult market received widespread commentary and criticism. [...] The cover is a photo of a heavily-made up young girl seated on her mother's knee and wearing a doll-like expression, taken by the photographers Sofia Sanchez and Mauro Mongiello as part of a photo shoot for a 2008 fashion article in a French magazine, for a fashion article titled [...] "Mommie Dearest." [...] In addition to writing that [...] "the image seemingly {{has little to do with}} the beloved children's classic", reviewers and commenters in social media (such as posters on the publisher's Facebook page) have said the art evokes Lolita, Valley of the Dolls, and JonBenet Ramsey; looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from Toddlers & Tiaras; and is [...] "misleading," [...] "creepy," [...] "sexualized," [...] "grotesque," [...] "misjudged on every level," [...] "distasteful and disrespectful to a gifted author and his work," [...] "pretentious," [...] "trashy", [...] "outright inappropriate," [...] "terrifying," [...] "really obnoxious," [...] and [...] "weird & kind of paedophilic." ...|$|E

60|$|MORRIS. [Sullenly, after a pause.] Well, the entertainment's coming on; and you English don't <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene.</b> I reckon I'll have to {{bury the}} blamed old hatchet too.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Rama Rao and Varalakshmi {{due to the}} latter's tantrums, also occurred. When Varalakshmi {{refused to}} touch Rama Rao's feet in the scene in which his father drags him from the {{marriage}} hall, Prasad asked Nagi Reddy's son B. L. N. Prasad—the second assistant cameraman working under Bartley—to wear a dhoti and stand before her. Chakrapani <b>liked</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> in <b>a</b> play in which a group of police officers in ascending hierarchy, each junior gave up his chair for the senior; he used the same idea in Savitri's marriage sequences in the film. Similarly, Prasad incorporated part of a stage play enacted by children into the film, which Nagi Reddy's son Venkatarami Reddy was a part of. Prasad also made a cameo appearance in the film.|$|R
50|$|Dolls (Dōruzu) is a 2002 Japanese film written, {{edited and}} {{directed}} by Japanese director Takeshi Kitano. A highly stylized art film, Dolls is part of Kitano's non-crime film oeuvre, <b>like</b> 1991's <b>A</b> <b>Scene</b> at the Sea, and unlike most of his other films, he does not act in it. The film has been praised for its cinematography (Katsumi Yanagishima) and features costumes by Yohji Yamamoto.|$|R
5000|$|... "The debris {{we all had}} {{to drive}} through the lap later, it looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> war <b>scene</b> from The Terminator or something. I mean, there were just pieces of metal and car on fire {{in the middle of the}} track with no car {{attached}} to it and just debris everywhere." [...] Ryan Briscoe's reaction to driving through the scene of the accident, one lap after the collision.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> in a melodrama, isn't it, Ware," [...] he whispered, [...] "but I know {{a little}} about Sylvanus Power. It's only a last resource, mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very strange!" [...] {{he said to}} himself, vacantly. [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> in a novel--it's {{like nothing}} in real life." [...] He went slowly into the house, and Mrs. Lecount waited {{for him in the}} garden.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{welcome to}} the purses. The 'ad.' is worth ten times the money. But what a funny way of getting a living nowadays! Aren't you afraid of being caught? It's all so wonderful, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from a comedy." ...|$|E
50|$|The lion, {{elephant}}, {{and bird}} scenes were all filmed {{with a mix}} of real animals, puppetry (especially for the lion fight), and CGI (to show the elephant acting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dog). The <b>scenes</b> with the orangutan, a chimpanzee, and the capuchin monkeys were filmed with live animals, but some computer work was used in <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> wherein the little monkey imitates George.|$|R

50|$|Nicholls studied art in Buffalo, New York with Lars (L.G.) Sellstedt {{and with}} Carolus-Duran at the Paris Beaux Arts. He studied {{and worked in}} England, Paris, Italy and Brittany for seven years which {{provided}} inspiration for his paintings for years. Most of Nicholl's paintings were made of European subjects and settings, <b>like</b> <b>A</b> Street <b>Scene</b> in France and A Quiet Corner, Venice, exhibited at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 held in Buffalo, New York.|$|R
6000|$|On {{reaching}} {{the summit of}} an eminence, up which they had toiled for several hours, they beheld a small lake, in which the silvery clouds were clearly reflected. The day was calm; the sun unusually brilliant; the autumnal foliage most gorgeous in colour. It was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> in fairy-land! ...|$|E
60|$|Pushing {{open the}} {{swinging}} door I confronted {{a wall of}} smoke. One-half of the floor was already consumed, and along the linoleum a sharply-defined line of fire told that it rose from burning oil--and yet I could not quite believe it, even then. It was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> in a motion picture play.|$|E
60|$|Good was right: it {{certainly}} did seem odd and out of place -- more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> out of a dream or an Italian opera than a real tangible fact; {{and the sense of}} unreality was not lessened when we heard ourselves addressed in good broad Scotch, which, however, I cannot reproduce.|$|E
60|$|Surely {{there is}} a heart of flesh in the old monk which, when warmed by a really healthy subject, can toss aside Scripture parodies and {{professional}} Stoic sentiment, and describe with such life and pathos, <b>like</b> any eye-witness, <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> which occurred, in fact, two years before his birth.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{there has}} been a crash, there is nothing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> change of <b>scene.</b> I propose that you and Mrs. Rodney should come and stay with me a week at my house at Barnes, and there a good many things may occur to us." ...|$|R
50|$|Contrary to {{the above}} interpretations, Reid {{was quoted in the}} February 2008 issue of Uncut {{magazine}} as saying:I was trying to conjure a mood as much as tell a straightforward, girl-leaves-boy story. With the ceiling flying away and room humming harder, I wanted to paint an image of <b>a</b> <b>scene.</b> I wasn’t trying to be mysterious with those images, I was trying to be evocative. I suppose it seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> decadent <b>scene</b> I’m describing. But I was too young to have experienced any decadence, then. I might have been smoking when I conceived it, but not when I wrote. It was influenced by books, not drugs.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Diehl {{brought the}} coffee in and bowed awkwardly to Mason. The whole thing seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> {{in a play}} to him. It was charming, all the same, to sit alone {{at the table with}} such a girl; it was just the least bit exciting. His hands shook a little, he noticed.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] she said, in {{describing}} afterwards her experience to her bosom friend, Miss Snagg, [...] "it was most interesting. We drove away {{down to the}} queerest part of the City, {{and went to the}} strangest little house imaginable, up the narrowest stairs one ever saw--quite Eastern, in fact, just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> out of the Koran." ...|$|E
60|$|She settled {{herself in}} the stern and they glided down the narrow thoroughfare. The rose bushes from the garden almost lapped the water as they passed. Behind, the long low cottage, the deserted dinner-table, the smooth lawn with its beds of scarlet geraniums and {{drooping}} lilac shrubs in the background, seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from fairyland, to attain a perfection of detail unreal, almost theatrical.|$|E
5000|$|Gibbs did {{not appear}} for the Sharks until round 17 of 2013 season due to an injury when he put his foot through a glass door, {{resulting}} in 30 stitches and damage to his Achilles tendon. He said, [...] "I {{was going to try}} and stitch it myself. The missus was filthy, there was blood everywhere. It looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> murder <b>scene.</b> I tried to sleep it off but it was a bit painful and throbbing." ...|$|R
50|$|Rembrandt {{painted the}} large {{painting}} The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq between 1640 and 1642. This picture was called De Nachtwacht by the Dutch and The Night Watch by Sir Joshua Reynolds {{because by the}} 18th century the picture was so dimmed and defaced {{that it was almost}} indistinguishable, and it looked quite <b>like</b> <b>a</b> night <b>scene.</b> After it was cleaned, it was discovered to represent broad day—a party of musketeers stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight.|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{all began}} when I watched the police {{investigating}} key criminal cases by using stand-ins to re-enact crime scenes," [...] director Monthon Arayangkoon {{said in the}} film's production notes. [...] "I wondered how those actors or actresses could handle such a horrifying task. Didn't they feel scared at all? For some <b>scenes,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rape <b>scene,</b> I can't help but wonder why they {{have to use a}} real woman to impersonate the victim. Didn't those who acted as the dead feel anything at all?" ...|$|R
