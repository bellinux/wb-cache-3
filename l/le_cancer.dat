40|$|Abstract: The complex {{nature of}} {{breathlessness}} in advanced cancer {{makes it a}} difficult symptom to understand and control. Measurement instruments applied to breath-lessness have thus far failed to consider the multivariant components of this symptom. This study developed a breathlessness assessment guide {{for use in the}} clinical practice setting, that may be completed by any member of the health care team. The guide aims to encourage breathlessness to be addressed as a multidimensional problem, in which the emotional experience of breathlessness is inseparable from the sensory experience and the causative biological mechanisms. This guide provides the foundation for understanding the symptom of breathlessness in advanced cancer, and in turn promotes the development of management strategies to deal with this complex symptom.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a robotic vision system that automatically retrieves and positions surgical instruments during robotized laparoscopic surgical operations. The instrument {{is mounted on}} the end-effector of a surgical robot which is controlled by visual servoing. The goal of the automated task is to safely bring the instrument at a desired three-dimensional location from an unknown or hidden position. Light-emitting diodes are attached {{on the tip of}} the instrument, and a specific instrument holder fitted with optical fibers is used to project laser dots {{on the surface of the}} organs. These optical markers are detected in the endoscopic image and allow localizing the instrument with respect to the scene. The instrument is recovered and centered in the image plane by means of a visual servoing algorithm using feature errors in the image. With this system, the surgeon can specify a desired relative position between the instrument and the pointed organ. The relationship between the velocity screw of the surgical instrument and the velocity of the markers in the image is estimated online and, for safety reasons, a multistages servoing scheme is proposed. Our approach has been successfully validated in a real surgical environment by performing experiments on living tissues in the surgical training room of the Institut de Recherche sur <b>les</b> <b>Cancers</b> de l’Appareil Digestif (IRCAD), Strasbourg, France.

40|$|Every year, {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} (ALL) affects about 400 {{children}} aged < 15 years in France, accounting for approximately 80 % of the acute leukaemia (AL) cases. The heterogeneity of cell types {{is reflected in the}} heterogeneity of clinical presentation, prognosis and, possibly, risk factors. In addition to Down’s syndrome, a few inheritable predisposing diseases and high-dose ionizing radiations increase the risk of ALL. Some environmental, infectious and genetic factors are consistently suspected. The first ALL genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reported clear associations between ALL and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) flanking the Ikaros family zinc finger 1 gene (IKZF 1) in 7 p 12. 2 (rs 6964823, rs 4132601, rs 6944602 or rs 11978267), and the AT-rich interactive domain 5 b gene (ARID 5 B) in 10 q 21. 2 (rs 7073837, rs 10740055, rs 7089424, 3 or rs 10821936, rs 10994982. The latter association was more pronounced for hyperdiploid ALL in both GWAS. In the UK study, the SNP rs 2239633 in the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein epsilon gene (CEBPE) was also associated with ALL.

Methods: Patients with ETMR, ETAN-TR, ependymoblastoma, and medulloepithelioma treated in SFCE centres (Société Française de lutte contre <b>les</b> <b>Cancers</b> et <b>les</b> leucémies de l'Enfant et de l'adolescent) since 2000 were collected. Data were retrieved from clinical charts. Results: Thirty-eight patients were included in the analysis. Seventeen had an ETAN-TR, 13 had a medulloepithelioma, and 8 had an ETMR. No ependymoblastoma was included. The median age at diagnosis was 31 months (range, 2. 8 – 141 months). The predominant tumor location was supratentorial (66 %); 18. 4 % patients had metastatic lesion. LIN 28 A expression was positive in 11 / 11 patients. Amplification of the locus 19 q 13. 42 was positive in 10 / 12 patients. Thirty patients were treated according to the primitive neuroectodermal tumors of high risk (PNET-HR) protocol. The median time of follow-up was 0. 9 years (range 0. 1 to 15. 3 years). The 1 -year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were, respectively, 36 % CI 95 % (23 – 55) and 45 % CI 95 % (31 – 64). On multivariate analysis, complete surgical resection, radiotherapy, and high-dose chemotherapy were associated with a better overall survival with a relative risk of, respectively, 7. 9 CI 95 % (2. 6 – 23. 5) p < 0. 0002, 41. 8 CI 95 % (9. 4 – 186) p < 0. 0001, and 3. 5 CI 95 % (1. 3 – 9. 5) p = 0. 012.
