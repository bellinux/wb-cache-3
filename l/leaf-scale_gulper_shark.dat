40|$|Deep-water sharks {{represent}} a major {{percentage of the}} total annual elasmobranch landings in mainland Portugal, primarily comprising Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), <b>Leaf-scale</b> <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> (Centrophorus squamosus) and Gulper shark (Centrophorus granulosus). These species are usually taken as by-catch from fisheries targeting other species. The present work describes the main characteristics of the fisheries for the three species mentioned above that take place mainly from Sesimbra and Peniche. Sesimbra accounts for nearly 50 % of the deep-water sharks landings in mainland Portugal and deep-water sharks constitute a by-catch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) fishery and in Peniche, a by-catch of multispecies artisanal fisheries. The focus was placed on a comparative analysis of the fishing regimes adopted at these two ports...|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{frequency}} and patterns of migration the <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> population estimates may be inaccurate with some sharks being counted twice, which are exacerbated by inappropriate tagging techniques. There are multiple species of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> which has contributed to misidentification in the past. For example, populations of the <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> in the Southeast Atlantic Ocean may represent a separate species. Therefore, taxonomic confusion may influence current geographical range. The <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> like deep, murky waters.|$|R
50|$|Human {{interaction}} with the <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> exists mainly {{in the form of}} fishing. Longline fishing is a typical method for fishing at the depth required to catch <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> and the broad distribution of gulper habitat leads to this method being used to catch gulpers around the world. However, <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> are not always caught intentionally. The deep waters in which the <b>gulper</b> and similar <b>shark</b> species live is difficult to harvest, and longlines are an unspecific form of fishing. Longlines intended for other species can easily catch <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Male <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> tend to outnumber females 2:1, {{which is}} common for many fish species. The life {{expectancy}}, longevity, of female <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> ranges between 54 and 70 years. Having a long life expectancy but a low net reproduction rate suggests that the population of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> would be {{at a very high}} risk if too many of them were killed from excessive fishing.|$|R
50|$|While {{information}} concerning <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> exists, {{there is no}} place to centrally compile the information so that other researchers may easily obtain it. This leads to repetition in basic data and less depth into the subject matter. Information presented may also be inaccurate as many genus of Centrophorus are morphologically similar. While attempts are being made {{to make it easier to}} identify different genus, such as Daley’s use of 16s mitochondrial DNA listed above, older data listed for <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> could be for ones other than the granulosus, such as the dumb <b>gulper</b> <b>shark.</b> This also means that current populations numbers could account for other dogfish than just the <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks.</b> Lastly, due to the frequency and patterns of migration, the recorded <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> populations may be inaccurate.|$|R
50|$|Other {{areas of}} <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> populations have no current regulations. The Northwest Atlantic Ocean {{currently}} has no rules {{in regard to}} the harvesting of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> and has already seen a decrease in gulper population of 80-95% since 1990.|$|R
50|$|Female <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> {{typically}} have between 2 and 10 pups in their lifetime, with generally one pup per pregnancy, this {{is considered to}} be a low fecundity. Once fertilized, females can hold up to 6 mature egg cells, or oocytes, in their body at a time. The length of time these egg cells are kept inside the female’s body is called the gestation period. <b>Gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> have a long gestation period, around two years. <b>Gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> can have long resting periods between pregnancies.|$|R

50|$|<b>Gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> reach {{maturity}} {{at around}} age 12 to 16 years for females, and age 7 to 8 years for males. The maturity of a <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> {{can be determined}} by the seven-stage maturity scale for aplacental and placental viviparous sharks. This scale is good for practical field use, but may not be as accurate as other maturity scales that have more than seven stages. Maturity for <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> is considered when they are at stage 3 or above, which for males is when gonads are enlarged and filled with sperm, and sperm ducts are tightly coiled. For females, stage three is when ovaries are large and well rounded.|$|R
50|$|The broad {{teeth of}} this species differ between {{the upper and lower}} jaws, with the lower teeth being much larger.

50|$|The key to {{overexploitation}} in <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> is {{that they}} require nearly {{as much time as}} humans to mature and reproduce. Their life strategy indicates that the frame of view for gulper fishing plans needs to be based on longer amounts of time, to allow for the consideration of the next generation of individuals. <b>Gulper</b> <b>shark</b> do not mature much faster than humans, so they need to be exploited based on a schedule that reflects this. However, being harvested by a species with similar growth patterns means that the <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> is unlikely to be considered in this way. It is highly susceptible to overexploitation leading to widespread population decline and its status and a species vulnerable to endangerment.|$|R
5000|$|The western <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> (Centrophorus westraliensis) is {{a species}} of squaliform shark {{discovered}} in 2008. The species had previously {{been identified as a}} variant of the dumb <b>gulper</b> <b>shark,</b> however was differentiated based on morphology. The western gulper is known from the waters of Western Australia, as well as Indonesia and islands in the Southern Indian Ocean. This shark is classified as [...] "least concern" [...] by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|On average, male <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are smaller}} than females. The size of an average adult male is 80 to 95 cm. The size of an average adult female is from 90 to 100 cm long. Differences in size between the sexes {{may be due to}} the need for space to support offspring. It has been {{hypothesized}} that <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> display a “depth distribution pattern associated with size” based on random human observation.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> is a {{deepwater}} oceanic species, {{living in}} waters ranging between 100 and 1490 meters in depth, with the juveniles being the main occupant {{of the lower}} half of the depths. [...] Acceptable habitats for gulper populations are found globally, wherever temperate and tropical waters are found. The <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> is most commonly found in the 300 to 800 meter depth range, inhabiting the upper continental slopes and outer continental shelves, the gulper is highly migratory species and has schooling habits based on multiple sharks being present around baited cameras.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} dogfish (Centrophorus zeehaani) is {{a species}} of shark in the Centrophoridae family. It was described in 2008 along with the western <b>gulper</b> <b>shark,</b> and belongs to genus Centrophorus.|$|R
50|$|The dwarf <b>gulper</b> <b>shark,</b> Centrophorus atromarginatus, is a dogfish of {{the family}} Centrophoridae found in the Indo-West Pacific oceans, from the Gulf of Aden, Japan, Taiwan, and {{northern}} Papua New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|The leafscale <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> {{lives near}} the bottom between 230 and 2360 m, but usually below 1000 m. Also occurs pelagically in much deeper water. It {{probably}} feeds on fish and cephalopods.|$|R
50|$|Fins {{and meat}} are {{generally}} taken from <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{but it is}} of particular interest because of the quantity of liver oil it contains: compared to similar species such as the dogfish <b>shark,</b> the <b>gulper</b> has a larger liver with more oil. Traditionally, shark oil is a folk remedy for a variety of ailments, but also has been shown to contain compounds of contemporary medicinal value, most notable squalene, although the compound can also be extracted from plants. This compound makes the liver of the <b>gulper</b> <b>shark</b> very valuable and is a large part of gulper-specific fishing.|$|R
