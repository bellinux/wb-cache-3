The author questions policy for treating those investments {{in a similar}} manner to other securities fraud, by looking at the history and procedure of a 10 b- 5 private cause of action. Tax returns can be used to evaluate the <b>liability</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> for SEC actions and the ensuing private actions. The author concludes that because 10 b- 5 actions are judicially created, they must be carefully cabined and screened for reliable indications of harm to the investor.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{consequences of}} proliferation {{of the illegal}} employment in Ukraine, which are classified by the levels of administration – international, macro, meso, micro, and personal level, further by the public institutions – the State employment service, system of compulsory social insurance, pension system, judiciary, trade unions etc. The article analyzes the legislative documents as to their contribution to unshadowing the employment and legalization of wages. It has been determined that employers that provide illegal employment can be subject to administrative responsibility, criminal <b>liability,</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties.</b> But, despite the available demotivators towards the illegal employment in the national legislation, its volume remains significant. Therefore we suggest the following activities to be necessary: informing citizens about the legal liability for illegal employment, activation of bodies of the State supervision and monitoring of violations of labor laws as well as working groups on legalization of the payment of wages and employment...|$|E

40|$|In December of 2008, the Congress of the Republic of Colombia {{enacted a}} law (1258) {{creating}} {{a new form of}} hybrid-business entity referred to as the Simplified Stock Corporation (SAS). Following a liberalizing approach in corporate law, this act reduced all formalities for incorporation to a simple registration before a mercantile public registry. It also ameliorated expenses associated with the formation and operation of boards of directors, fiscal auditors, management structure and other formalistic requirements. This paper provides an analytical framework concerning the legal system of directors and officers provided for under Law 1258 of 2008 for the SAS. It focuses specifically on the duties applicable to managers and directors as well as the liabilities in which they may incur pursuant to the statutory provisions. Special attention is given also to the new regulation regarding shadow directors (managers de facto). According to this system, any person who is not a director or officer of the corporation, but interferes in its management or direction, shall incur in the same <b>liabilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> applicable to the latter. Such extrapolation of the legal regime applicable to directors and officers is intended to prevent third parties who intrude in the corporation's affaires from avoiding the liabilities that normally arise for those who have management responsibilities in the corporation...|$|R

50|$|Tax amnesty is a limited-time {{opportunity}} for a specified group of taxpayers to pay a defined amount, in exchange for forgiveness of a tax <b>liability</b> (including interest <b>and</b> <b>penalties)</b> relating to a previous tax period or periods and without fear of criminal prosecution. It typically expires when some authority begins a tax investigation of the past-due tax. In some cases, legislation extending amnesty also imposes harsher penalties on those who are eligible for amnesty but do not take it. Tax amnesty is one of voluntary compliance strategies to increase tax base and tax revenue. Tax amnesty is different from other voluntary compliance strategies in part where tax amnesty usually waives the taxpayers' tax liability.|$|R

In this paper informal penalties are analysed in the context of medical errors. The introduction of informal penalties, if dependent upon formal ones, implies that: (i) the optimal enforcement regime becomes more lenient, and in some cases the lack of formal punishment is preferred, (ii) the first-best solution becomes unattainable, (iii) <b>liability</b> rates <b>and</b> formal <b>penalty</b> level are no longer perfect deterrence substitutes. In addition, powers of informal penalties provide a rationale for administrative sanctions (informal criticism, reprimands and warnings). ...|$|R

40|$|Congress has unintentionally evoked copytraps, which exact {{thousands}} of dollars from the Internet user who innocently buys music without knowing that it infringes copyright. Copytraps arise when Web sites lure innocent users into downloading expression that seems legal but is actually infringing. Regardless of whether the Web site appears legitimate, whether a user 2 ̆ 7 s good-faith belief is reasonable, or whether the Web site owner is unaware that the material is infringing, users who download infringing material face strict <b>liability</b> punishment, <b>and</b> the <b>penalties</b> are severe. It is entrapment, with the spoils from the innocent going to large corporate copyright holders. The law facilitates copytraps because it governs circumstances today that were never contemplated when copyright 2 ̆ 7 s strict liability emerged centuries ago. What has been good policy for real space is bad policy for cyberspace. As copytraps become common, end users will increasingly encounter the unfairness of strict <b>liability</b> punishment <b>and</b> ultimately become reluctant to download from unfamiliar sites. The effects of copytraps {{cast doubt on the}} wisdom of strict liability: copytraps unfairly punish the innocent, foster copyright abuse, unduly burden commerce, restrict speech, and deter the dissemination of knowledge. Congress should therefore amend the Copyright Act. Rather than imposing statutory damages on innocent downloaders, the Act should require only that innocent downloaders delete infringing material. In the alternative, courts should interpret the Act 2 ̆ 7 s strict liability provision as not applying to online expression...|$|R

40|$|For a {{long time}} it was not {{possible}} to hold collective entities criminally liable under Belgian and Dutch law. As in most civil law jurisdictions at the time, corporate entities were considered inanimate amoral collective entities which have no body or soul to damn and therefore also lack the fundamental prerequisite for criminal liability, that is, guilt. The idea was that, in the end, corporate offences always come down to an individual committing an offence for the benefit of or on behalf of the corporate entity. Therefore, it was logical to hold that individual criminally liable, and not the corporation. In both countries the legislator tried to avoid the inevitable by creating different types of substitute solutions. However, in 1950 and 1999 respectively, both countries answered the increasingly stronger call for corporate criminal liability. In the Netherlands corporate criminal liability was at first limited to economic offences, to be later transformed in a general liability system. The Belgian legislator, lagging behind, immediately opted for general corporate criminal liability in 1999. We start our analysis with a general overview of the Belgian system. After briefly discussing the principal substitute solutions for corporate criminal liability, we focus on the regime of corporate criminal liability that was created in 1999. We analyse its scope of application (thereby answering the questions who, what, when and how), the peculiar issue of concurring <b>liability,</b> <b>and</b> finally, the <b>penalties.</b> In Part III we turn to the Dutch system.
