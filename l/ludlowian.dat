40|$|The dating of radiolarian biostratigraphic zones {{from the}} Silurian to Devonian is only {{partially}} understood. Dating the zircons in radiolarian-bearing tuffaceous rocks has {{enabled us to}} ascribe practical ages to the radiolarian zones. To extend knowledge in this area, radiometric dating of magmatic zircons within the radiolarian-bearing Yoshiki Formation, Japan, was undertaken. The Yoshiki Formation is mainly composed of alternating beds of tuffaceous sandstones, tuffaceous mudstones, and felsic tuff. The felsic tuff and tuffaceous mudstone yield well-preserved radiolarian fossils. Radiolarians and zircon grains were collected from 21 tuffaceous mudstone and 30 tuff horizons of the Yoshiki Formation. The following radiolarian species which can be ascribed to the Zadrappolus yoshikiensis - Futobari solidus assemblage were identified: Oriundogutta (?) kingi, Oriundogutta (?) varispina, Zadrappolus yoshikiensis, Zadrappolus tenuis, Zadrappolus hitoeganensis, Zadrappolus lunaris, Zadrappolus (?) nudus, Zadrappolus (?) sp., Futobari solidus, Futobari morishitai, Rotasphaera (?) sp., and Ceratoikiscum armiger. U-Pb SHRIMP ages of 420. 5 ± 2. 5 Ma and 421. 0 ± 1. 9 Ma {{were obtained from the}} zircon grains. Thus the lower limit of the Zadrappolus yoshikiensis-Futobari solidus assemblage, that has previously been assigned to an age from Přidolian to Pragian, is in reality before <b>Ludlowian.</b> The technique in this paper has the capability of refining and making more accurate the dating of many radiolarian zones worldwide, and potentially of changing the direction of the entire study of radiolarian biostratigraphy...|$|E
40|$|Se exponen los resultados obtenidos del análisis de facies, asociaciones de facies, ambientes y estudio de biofacies en la cuenca silúrico-devónica del subandino sur de Bolivia y del noroeste de Argentina, analizada en su tramo devónico. Se expone la bioestratigrafía utilizada en esta cuenca, tanto en base a palinomorfos como fauna bentónica. Se caracterizan los ambientes y subambientes en una plataforma silicoclástica marina desarrollados en 19 Secuencias Genéticas, entre el Lochkoviano y el Frasniano. Se plantea un modelo de distribución de facies y de ambientes. Finalmente se estudian las biofacies desarrolladas durante etapas de contracción y de expansión de esta cuenca. A silurian-devonian {{basin of}} {{southern}} Bolivia and northwestern Argentina (Figs. 1, 2) is {{interpreted as a}} backarc basin developed in a noncontracted margin, like a Java system (Fig. 3). In this basin, 19 Genetical Sequences are described in a continuous sedimentation from <b>Ludlowian</b> to Frasnian (Fig. 8). In this paper we analize the Devonian interval. Data from facies analysis, facies associations, environments and biofacies of this basin are presented (Figs. 4, 5). The biostratigraphy of the basin is based in palynomorphs and benthic fauna. Palynological analysis is based in world wide associations and First Occurrence Biozone for each association. Chitinozoans, acritarchs, spores, and others are considered to determine the age of each sample. Benthic fauna are divided in two types, specialized and non-specialized. The former is considered an important fauna to date. This fauna is calibrated with other basins outside Gondwana (Table 1). Facies and environmental conclusions are placed in an eustatic curve designed for this period. 21 facies associations are described and exposed (Figs. 4, 6, 7). Environmental determinations in a marine siliciclastic platform developed in 19 Genetical Sequences from Lochkovian to Frasnian are characterized (Fig. 8). Seven marine environments are described {{and placed in a}} model where facies associations and environments present a logical distribution (Fig. 5). Biofacies are studied during contracted and expanded periods. During contractions, in normal regressions of Pragian and Emsian age, biofacies are more diversified and frequent than biofacies developed in the same conditions during Eifelian expansions of the basin (Fig. 10). During forced regressions, biofacies are less diversified and poorly distributed in space (Fig. 11). In this platform type, development of benthic fauna is a function of available space and eustatic changes. During a second order eustatic fall, a forzed regression could be determinated {{in the development of the}} benthic fauna. During expanded periods, biofacies developed in normal regressions during Eifelian and Giventian are less diversified and less frequent than biofacies developed during similar conditions in the Coger Devonian (Fig. 12). This process is controlled by boreal benthic fauna until the Eifelian. We propose a biofacies distribution model for this siliciclastic ramp (Fig. 13 and Table 2) ...|$|E
