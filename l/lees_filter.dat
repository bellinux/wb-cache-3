30|$|In this paper, a filter, {{which is}} based on level set, has been {{explored}} for speckle removal in SAR images. As we know, Level set is an efficient numerical technique while <b>Lee</b> <b>filter</b> is a classical speckle noise filter. What is new here is the correspondence between these two types of frameworks, moreover, for speckle filtering purposes. Unlike other existing speckle reducing filters, {{it is based on the}} theory of flow propagation and <b>Lee</b> <b>filter,</b> which uses intensity and curvature as the front advancing impetus to modify noise by differential equation iterations. According to theoretical analysis, imagery experiment including simulation and landscape, and seascape of ERS- 2 SAR images, experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm provides superior performance in comparison to the conventional speckle <b>filters,</b> such as <b>Lee</b> <b>filter,</b> Enhanced <b>Lee</b> <b>Filter,</b> Kuan Filter, Frost Filter, Enhanced Frost Filter and Gamma Filter, in terms of both smoothing speckle inner or outer uniform regions and preserving (sometimes enhancing) edges and detail features.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} deal with the contradiction between suppressing speckle noise and reserving details in laser active imaging {{recognition}} system, a denoising method based on contour curvature is proposed. Due to the contour curvature, the pixels in the image are divided into different classes, which contain different amount of information. The filter parameters are different for each class. Firstly, the origin image is smoothed using wavelet soft thresholding, then the contours are extracted by Morphological edge detection operator. Due to the difference of contour curvature, the pixels are labeled with point of strong signal, point of weak signal or point of no signal. Pixels with different labels are <b>filtered</b> by <b>Lee</b> <b>filter</b> of different step width. Experiment result indicates that compared with classical <b>Lee</b> <b>filter,</b> the proposed method performs better in filtering and keeping edge information...|$|R

The latter is better at preserving edges whilst eliminating noise spikes, than the former is.

In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for speckle reduction without using logarithmic transform of noisy image data and also which requires only single level decomposition...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} not only remove speckle but also keep edge, an {{alternative}} approach is proposed in this paper, it mainly relies on the theory of curvature anisotropic flow, that is, level set method. Firstly, the <b>Lee</b> <b>filter</b> can be transformed as a formulation of anisotropic diffusion function [7]. Thus, after the analysis, the relationship between curvature flow and <b>Lee</b> speckle <b>filter,</b> we considered further and deduced the anisotropic diffusion filter into a formulation of level set. Therefore, the new technique is not only based on the {{minimum mean square error}} approach to <b>filtering</b> as the <b>Lee</b> <b>filters,</b> but also on anisotropic diffusion sensitive to edges. The paradigm of the level set is a numerical method for tracking the evolution of contours and surfaces. In this approach, an image is interpreted as a collection of iso-intensity contours. Similar to anisotropic diffusion, under a curvature-driven factor, smoothing takes place inside a region, but not across region boundaries. So the attractive quality of this approach is that sharp boundaries are preserved while speckles are smoothed. Secondly, in order to avoid long-term iteration in the manner of traditional anisotropic diffusion, the different speed of flow approach was introduced into the new technique as a selective smoothing switch according to effects by intensity and curvature gradient of neighbor pixels. An image is filtered as a set of iso-intensity contours which can be evolved. The spikes of noise correspond to high curvature objects, so these are easily reduced by flow propagation under curvature; meanwhile, oscillations in boundaries are smoothed out, all the while preserving sharp boundaries.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} real time pasture biomass from SAR image, regression model between ground measurements of biomass and ENVISAT ASAR backscattering coefficient should be built up. An important prerequisite of valid and accurate regression model is accurate grass backscattering coefficient which, however, cannot be obtained {{when there is}} speckle. Speckle noise is the best known problem of SAR images because of the coherent nature of radar illumination imaging system. This study aims to choose better adaptive filter from NEST software to reduce speckle noise in homogeneous pasture area, with little regard to linear feature (e. g. edge between pasture and forest) or point feature (e. g. pond, tree) preservation.
