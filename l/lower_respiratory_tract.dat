5|$|Pneumonia {{frequently}} {{starts as}} an {{upper respiratory tract}} infection that moves into the <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract.</b> It is pneumonitis (lung inflammation) combined with consolidation (liquid in spaces normally inflated with air).|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{are part}} of the <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract,</b> and {{accommodate}} the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea. The lungs include the bronchial airways that terminate in alveoli, the lung tissue in between, and veins, arteries, nerves and lymphatic vessels. The trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and submucosa. The smaller bronchi have a single layer and they are absent in the alveoli.|$|E
5|$|All of the <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> {{including}} the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles {{is lined with}} respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E

5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>{{respiratory}}</b> <b>tract</b> {{is part of}} {{the respiratory}} system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has low {{plasma protein}} binding (approximately 31%, but highly variable) and an {{apparent}} volume of distribution at steady state of around 40–50liters. Peak serum concentrations (Cmax) are reached {{one to two}} hours after administration of the drug. Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from bone matrix and white adipose tissue. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid of the <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported bronchial fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its efficacy in treating pneumonia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough concentrations in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three hours in children, four hours in teenagers, and five hours in adults.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of the common cold {{are believed to be}} primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract.</b> RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the {{symptoms of}} croup due to the small size of their airways.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUsing the {{existing}} reverse genetics system {{developed for the}} subgroup A respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a chimeric virus (designated rA-GBFB) that expresses subgroup B-specific antigens was constructed by replacing the G and F genes of the A 2 strain {{with those of the}} 9320 strain of subgroup B RSV. rA-GBFB grew well in tissue culture, but it was attenuated in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> of cotton rats and African green monkeys. To further attenuate this chimeric RSV, the M 2 - 2 open reading frame was removed from rA-GBFB. rA-GBFBΔM 2 - 2 was highly attenuated in replication in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> of the infected monkeys, but it provided complete protection against wild-type subgroup B RSV challenge following two doses of infection. In this study, rA 2 ΔM 2 - 2 (a recombinant A 2 RSV that lacks the M 2 - 2 gene) was also evaluated in African green monkeys. The replication of rA 2 ΔM 2 - 2 was highly restricted in both the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> of the infected monkeys and it induced titers of serum anti-RSV neutralizing antibody that were slightly lower than those induced by wild-type rA 2. When rA 2 ΔM 2 - 2 -infected monkeys were challenged with wild-type A 2 virus, the replication of the challenge virus was reduced by approximately 100 -fold in the upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> and 45, 000 -fold in the <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts.</b> rA 2 ΔM 2 - 2 and rA-GBFBΔM 2 - 2 could represent a bivalent RSV vaccine composition for protection against multiple strains from the two RSV subgroups...|$|R
25|$|A {{large-scale}} attack using anthrax {{would require}} the creation of aerosol particles of 1.5 to 5µm: larger particles would not reach the <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract,</b> while smaller particles would be exhaled {{back out into the}} atmosphere. At this size, conductive powders tend to aggregate because of electrostatic charges, hindering dispersion. So the material must be treated to insulate and neutralize the charges. The weaponized agent must be resistant to degradation by rain and ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, while retaining the ability to efficiently infect the human lung. There are other technological difficulties as well, chiefly relating to storage of the weaponized agent.|$|E
25|$|Because PPS can fatigue facial muscles, {{as well as}} cause {{dysphagia}} (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking) or aphonia (inability {{to produce}} speech), persons with PPS may become malnourished due to difficulty eating. Compensatory routines can help relieve these symptoms such as eating smaller portions {{at a time and}} sitting down whilst eating. PPS with respiratory involvement requires special management such as breathing exercises, chest percussion with a stethoscope on regular occasions for observation of the disease and management of secretions. Failure to properly assess PPS with respiratory involvement can increase the risk of missing aspiration pneumonia (an infection of the <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract)</b> in an individual. Severe cases may require permanent ventilation or tracheostomy. Sleep apnoea may also occur. Other management strategies that may lead to improvement include smoking cessation, treatment of other respiratory diseases and vaccination against respiratory infections such as influenza.|$|E
25|$|L. jordanis is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen. It {{has been}} shown to cause <b>lower</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infections in humans and is responsible for causing a type of pneumonia commonly referred to as Legionnaires' disease. Lung infection with L. jordanis is sometimes misdiagnosed as a Aspergillus mold infection. This mold also causes a fatal type of pneumonia which L. jordanis is able to mimic. Using human sera, indirect fluorescent antibody tests strongly indicated that unrecognized human infections with L. jordanis may be occurring. A study of patients from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, NY revealed a possible risk of nosocomial infections from shower heads found to contain L. jordanis. After this finding, monthly shower head disinfection procedures were instituted, but about 19% of shower heads remained positive for Legionella. Infections of individuals who are not immunocompromised are also possible.|$|E
