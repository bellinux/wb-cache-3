50|$|The RSL Test Method {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} as a valuable tool in the testing of high-performance materials for determining susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement. This test is dependent upon the test machine’s capability to provide a profile with incremental increases in the applied stress {{as a function of}} time. It is imperative that the load increases do not overshoot the next elevation in applied stress.The predominant type of test equipment for applying loads on test specimens employ servo/hydraulic systems. For most applications, these systems are quite satisfactory, however when they have been used to perform the precision required in controlling the applied stress in an RSL test, they have not demonstrated adequate stability. It is very difficult for a servo/hydraulic system to approach a desired level of load without some mild excursions {{on either side of the}} desired stress level.

Methodology was developed for tensile test of natural fibres (bamboo single fibre). A series of experiments were performed and load drops (one or two) were observed in the load versus time graphs. From the observed AE parameters such as amplitude, energy, duration etc. significant information corresponding to the load drops were found. These AE signals from the <b>load</b> <b>drop</b> occurred from such failure as debonding between two elementary fibre or from join of elementary fibre at edge. The various sources of load at first <b>load</b> <b>drop</b> was not consistent for the different samples (for a particular sample the value is 8 N, stress: 517. 51 MPa).

40|$|Abstract For {{low-cycle fatigue}} tests with smooth bars {{the number of}} cycles to {{initiation}} is commonly defined from a measured relative drop in maximum load. This criterion cannot be {{directly related to the}} crack length, which is the actual measure of interest. In order to establish a relation between <b>load</b> <b>drop</b> and crack length for the high strength titanium alloy Ti- 6242, this investigation compares data from controlled low-cycle fatigue crack growth tests and numerical simulations of these tests. To achieve sufficient accuracy in this relation, focus is given to modelling of mean stress relaxation. Three constitutive models, the Chaboche, the Ohno-Wang and the Chaboche with threshold, are evaluated with respect to experiments. Furthermore, a straightforward method with cycle-scaling of the material parameters are used to efficiently reduce calculation cost. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} determine the relationship between <b>load</b> <b>drop</b> and crack length from numerical simulations, provided that care is taken to relevant aspects of the materials stress-strain response.

40|$|In board {{manufacturing}} the {{shear test}} is frequently {{used to evaluate}} the quality of the solder joints shortly after the soldering process as well as after thermal cycling. The latter evaluation is in particular applied to leadless ceramic components; a certain <b>load</b> <b>drop</b> is linked to solder degradation in a certain region of the joint which is declared Â¿failedÂ¿ if the <b>load</b> <b>drop</b> of the shear force reaches a predefined limit. However, there are many uncertainties in this evaluation like component misalignment to the shear tool, excessive voiding of the joint or by a fracture mode away from solder bulk failure. As few is known about these effects from a theoretical viewpoint, FE-studies have been performed to close this gap The analyses comprise studies of size effects, misalignment, and voiding on the shear force response. Additionally, the simulated solder creep response was compared to the measured one to check for the validity of creep laws for SAC solder. For a realistic creep rate range reached in low cycle fatigue, very low shear velocities have to be applied to the joints.
