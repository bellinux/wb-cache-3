50|$|The {{red-billed firefinch}} or Senegal firefinch (<b>Lagonosticta</b> <b>senegala)</b> {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird. This estrildid finch is a resident breeding bird in most of Sub-Saharan Africa with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km2. This species was introduced to Egypt, however, the introduced population has become extinct.|$|E

The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H 5 N 1 subtype) recurred in Nigeria after 9 months period of no reported case. A critical look at possible sources of the re-occurrence was desirable. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether avian influenza viruses were present at reasonably detectable levels (0. 5 %) in possible “bridge ” species of wild and domestic birds. The study was conducted in 8 Nigerian states. A total of 403 birds from 40 species were sampled. Virus isolation was done in embryonated chicken eggs according to standard protocols. The test results were all negative for avian influenza viruses. The overall confidence interval (CI) calculated in R using the exact binomial confidence interval function was 0 – 0. 007406. Tawny Eagle (Aquila rapax) was the lowest sampled 0. 3 % (1 / 403) and Red-billed Firefinch (<b>Lagonosticta</b> <b>senegala)</b> the highest 11. 7 % (47 / 403). The limitations of th...|$|E

Brood-parasitic village indigobirds, Vidua chalybeata, were bred {{in captivity}} and foster-reared by their normal host, red-billed firefinch, <b>Lagonosticta</b> <b>senegala,</b> or by an {{experimental}} foster species, Bengalese finch, Lonchura striata. Male indigobirds reared by Bengalese finches developed {{the songs of}} Bengalese finches, and males reared by firefinches developed songs of firefinches. Males copied their foster father only when they had lived with him long after independence (45 days post-fledging), while males separated normally at independence (22 – 24 days post-fledging) copied songs of other individuals and not songs of their foster father. Males reared by Bengalese finches showed no preference to learn firefinch song over songs of the experimental foster species or other control finch species even when they had lived with firefinches as companions {{from the time of}} fledging to independence. Males copied several song themes, acquired the same number of mimicry songs, and acquired their songs at the same age, whether reared by Bengalese finches or by firefinches. When they lived with other indigobirds, the male indigobirds copied mimicry songs of male indigobirds that mimicked the same foster species. We predicted mimicry-song specificity and repertoire size in experimental indigobirds from a hypothesis of an early developmental period when young indigobirds focus their attention on their foster parents, and a later period when they direct their attention to other birds with similar songs. The predictions, base...|$|E
