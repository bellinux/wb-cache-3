60|$|The bride {{waited in}} the rosy glow of the pink <b>lamp</b> <b>shade.</b> The miracles were not all passed away.

60|$|The intense {{excitement}} of the events had no doubt left my perceptive powers {{in a state of}} erethism. I remember that dinner table with extraordinary vividness even now. My dear wife's sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pink <b>lamp</b> <b>shade,</b> the white cloth with its silver and glass table furniture--for in those days even philosophical writers had many little luxuries--the crimson-purple wine in my glass, are photographically distinct.

[...] "Oh, my darling," [...] she cried, [...] "it was cruel to keep that secret from your wife! You have heard it again!" ...|$|E
60|$|Yet it {{must not}} be really {{imagined}} that a literary household is just like any other. There is the brass paper-fastener, for instance. I have sometimes thought that Euphemia married me {{with an eye to}} these conveniences. She has two in her grey gloves, and one (with the head inked) in her boot in the place of a button. Others I suspect her of. Then she fastened the <b>lamp</b> <b>shade</b> together with them, and tried one day to introduce them instead of pearl buttons as efficient anchorage for cuffs and collars. And she made a new handle for the little drawer under the inkstand with one. Indeed, the literary household is held together, so to speak, by paper-fasteners, and how other people get along without them we are at a loss to imagine.|$|E
