5|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope is {{a device}} for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on {{each of which is}} an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus <b>lateral</b> <b>separation</b> for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the Fermi level local density of states.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that {{membrane}} lipids of chilling-sensitive plants begin <b>lateral</b> phase <b>separation</b> (i. e. a minor component begins freezing) at chilling temperatures and that chilling-sensitive plants are often of tropical origin. We tested the hypothesis that membranes of tropical plants begin <b>lateral</b> phase <b>separation</b> at chilling temperatures, and that plants lower the temperature of <b>lateral</b> phase <b>separation</b> as they invade cooler habitats. To do so we studied plant species in one family confined to the tropics (Piperaceae) and in three families with both tropical and temperate representatives (Fabaceae [Leguminosae], Malvaceae, and Solanaceae). We determined <b>lateral</b> phase <b>separation</b> temperatures by measuring the temperature dependence of fluorescence from trans-parinaric acid inserted into liposomes prepared from isolated membrane phospholipids. In all families we detected <b>lateral</b> phase <b>separations</b> at significantly higher temperatures, on average, in species of tropical origin. To test for associated physiological effects we measured the temperature dependence of delayed light emission (DLE) by discs cut from the same leaves used for lipid analysis. We found that the temperature of maximum DLE upon chilling was strongly correlated with <b>lateral</b> phase <b>separation</b> temperatures, but was on average approximately 4 °C lower. We also tested the hypothesis that photosystem II (PSII) (the most thermolabile component of photosynthesis) of tropical plants tolerates higher temperatures than PSII of temperate plants, using DLE and Fo chlorophyll fluorescence upon heating to measure the temperature at which PSII thermally denatured. We found little {{difference between the two groups}} in PSII denaturation temperature. We also found that the temperature of maximum DLA upon heating was not significantly different from the critical temperature for Fo fluorescence. Our results indicate that plants lowered their membrane freezing temperatures as they radiated from their tropical origins. One interpretation is that the tendency for membranes to begin freezing at chilling temperatures is the primitive condition, which plants corrected as they invaded colder habitats. An alternative is that membranes which freeze at temperatures only slightly lower than the minimum growth temperature confer an advantage...|$|R

60|$|But, in truth, the {{pressure}} of any ambient fluid, how great soever, can be no intelligible cause of the cohesion of the solid parts of matter. For, though such a pressure may hinder the avulsion of two polished superficies, one from another, in a line perpendicular to them, as in the experiment of two polished marbles; yet it can never in the least hinder the separation by a motion, in a line parallel to those surfaces. Because the ambient fluid, having a full liberty to succeed in each point of space, deserted by a lateral motion, resists such a motion of bodies, so joined, no more than it would resist the motion of that body were it on all sides environed by that fluid, and touched no other body; and therefore, {{if there were no}} other cause of cohesion, all parts of bodies must be easily separable by such a lateral sliding motion. For if {{the pressure}} of the aether be the adequate cause of cohesion, wherever that cause operates not, there can be no cohesion. And since it cannot operate against a <b>lateral</b> <b>separation,</b> (as has been shown,) therefore in every imaginary plane, intersecting any mass of matter, there could be no more cohesion than of two polished surfaces, which will always, notwithstanding any imaginable pressure of a fluid, easily slide one from another. So that perhaps, how clear an idea soever we think we have of the extension of body, which is nothing but the cohesion of solid parts, he that shall well consider it in his mind, may have reason to conclude, That it is as easy for him to have a clear idea how the soul thinks as how body is extended. For, since body is no further, nor otherwise, extended, than by the union and cohesion of its solid parts, we shall very ill comprehend the extension of body, without understanding wherein consists the union and cohesion of its parts; which seems to me as incomprehensible as the manner of thinking, and how it is performed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Adhesion between {{membranes}} is studied using a phenomenological model, {{where the}} inter-membrane distance is coupled to {{the concentration of}} sticker molecules on the membranes. The model applies to both adhesion of two flexible membranes and to adhesion of one flexible membrane onto a second membrane supported on a solid substrate. We mainly consider the case where the sticker molecules form bridges and adhere directly to both membranes. The calculated mean-field phase diagrams show an upward shift of the transition temperature indicating that the <b>lateral</b> phase <b>separation</b> in the membrane is enhanced due to the coupling effect. Hence the possibility of adhesion-induced <b>lateral</b> phase <b>separation</b> is predicted. For a particular choice of the parameters, the model exhibits a tricritical behavior. We also discuss the non-monotonous shape of the inter-membrane distance occurring when the <b>lateral</b> phase <b>separation</b> takes place. The inter-membrane distance relaxes to the bulk values with two symmetric overshoots. Adhesion mediated by other types of stickers is also considered.
