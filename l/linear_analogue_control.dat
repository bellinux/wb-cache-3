40|$|Control {{of human}} walking is not {{thoroughly}} understood, which has implications in developing suitable {{strategies for the}} retraining of a functional gait following neurological injuries such as spinal cord injury (SCI). Bipedal robots allow us to investigate simple elements of the complex nervous system to quantify their contribution to motor control. RunBot is a bipedal robot which operates through reflexes without using central pattern generators or trajectory planning algorithms. Ground contact information from the feet is used to activate motors in the legs, generating a gait cycle visually {{similar to that of}} humans. Rather than developing a more complicated biologically realistic neural system to control the robot's stepping, we have instead further simplified our model by measuring the correlation between heel contact and leg muscle activity (EMG) in human subjects during walking and from this data created filter functions transferring the sensory data into motor actions. Adaptive filtering was used to identify the unknown transfer functions which translate the contact information into muscle activation signals. Our results show a causal relationship between ground contact information from the heel and EMG, which allows us to create a minimal, <b>linear,</b> <b>analogue</b> <b>control</b> system for controlling walking. The derived transfer functions were applied to RunBot II as a proof of concept. The gait cycle produced was stable and controlled, which is a positive indication that the transfer functions have potential for use in the control of assistive devices for the retraining of an efficient and effective gait with potential applications in SCI rehabilitation...|$|E

50|$|The {{architecture}} of photoresists has typically {{been dominated by}} linear polymers. Star-shaped polymers, however, {{have been shown to}} display more advantageous properties when compared to their <b>linear</b> <b>analogues.</b> They are able to decrease roughness of photoresist sidewalls without a decrease in sensitivity or resolution. This is due to star-shaped polymers' decreased tendency to form chain entanglements relative to their <b>linear</b> <b>analogues</b> of similar molecular weights, which leads to insolubility and increased roughness.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the most}} {{interesting}} characteristics exhibited by star-shaped polymers are their unique rheological and dynamic properties compared to <b>linear</b> <b>analogues</b> of identical molecular weight and monomer composition. Generally, they have smaller hydrodynamic radii, radii of gyration and lower internal viscosities than <b>linear</b> <b>analogues</b> of the same molecular weight. Internal viscosity increases with increased functionality and molecular weight of branches with the effects of functionality eventually saturating, leaving viscosity dependent only on molecular weight of the arms. Miktoarm stars have observed viscosities and hydrodynamic radii higher than homostars. This is due to the increased repulsive interactions that occur {{as a result of a}} greater number of heterocontacts between the different arms. In addition, star-shaped polymers exhibit lower melt temperatures, lower crystallization temperatures and lower degrees of crystallinity than comparable <b>linear</b> <b>analogues.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{developed}} {{network analyser}} with four ports allows very fast measurements of S-parameters in compari-son with a conventional network analyser. This is possible because highly <b>linear</b> <b>analogue</b> frequency ramps are used. Thus the settling times of stepped frequency sweeps of con-ventional analysers are eliminated. The required high linear-ity and high {{stability of the}} frequency ramps is achieved by using fractional divider phase locked loop circuits. For a practical realization {{it is necessary to}} accept small nonlinearities for the <b>linear</b> <b>analogue</b> frequency ramps. For this reason investigations were performed to clarify effects of small nonlinearities on the measurement precision. Nonlinearities are willingly implemented by programming the fractional frequency ramps accordingly. The gained ex-pertise allows for a further improvement of measurement ac-curacy and dynamic range. ...|$|R

40|$|In this exam thesis an <b>analogue</b> <b>control</b> {{system for}} a module {{consisting}} of two half-bridge converters {{has been replaced by}} a digital control system derived in this thesis. The digital control system has been derived using the existing <b>analogue</b> <b>control</b> system as a reference to find the important functions that has to be included in the system. The digital control system should be able to handle parallel and serial connected converters as well as single converter operation. The <b>analogue</b> <b>control</b> system has been analysed in the beginning of the thesis and the important functions has been listed to serve as a guideline of how the digital control system should function. After listing the functions of the <b>analogue</b> <b>control</b> system a digital component has been chosen that can perform some of these functions, the digital components studied in this thesis are FPGAs and microcontrollers. The chosen component to replace some of the functions of the <b>analogue</b> <b>control</b> system is a microcontroller, a XC 164 CM from Infineon. This component has been programmed in assembler and C and the complete program has been tested on the module, to be able to connect the microcontroller to the module, a new PCB has been designed and constructed. Before connecting the digital control system to the module the system has been tested with the help of a step-down converter, constructed during the thesis work, to avoid damaging the module. The results from the tests of the constructed digital control system are presented in the thesis, according to the tests performed on the module the system works as intended. One of the goals with the regulation was to not increase the output voltage ripple compared to the <b>analogue</b> <b>control</b> system, this goal was not completely reached. This may have to do with the connection used in the tests, the microcontroller are not placed on the same PCB as the other components needed for the system and this may increase the system?s sensitivity to noise. To create a complete product the microcontroller and the other components has to be placed on the same PCB and some other functions, not included in this thesis, has to be implemented...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{protegrin}} PG- 1, {{belonging to}} the family of β-stranded antimicrobial peptides, exerts its activity by forming pores in the target biological membranes. <b>Linear</b> <b>analogues</b> derived from PG- 1 do not form pores in the phospholipid membranes and have been used successfully to deliver therapeutic compounds into eucaryotic cells. In this paper, the translocation of PG- 1 and of a <b>linear</b> <b>analogue</b> through artificial phospholipid membranes was investigated, leading to a possible mechanism for the activity of these peptidic vectors. We report here that [12 W]PG- 1, a fluorescent analogue of PG- 1, is able to translocate through lipid bilayers and we demonstrate that this property depends on its secondary structure. Our results agree with the recent mechanism proposed for the translocation and permeabilisation activities of several helical and β-stranded peptides. In addition, our data corroborate recent work suggesting that certain protegrin-derived vectors enter into endothelial cells by adsorptive-mediated endocytosis...|$|R

The modifications in the sequence were introduced at position 6, resulting in the four peptides, [Tyr(6) ]-KL (YKL), [Trp(6) ]-KL (WKL), cyclo-([Tyr(6) ]-KL) (YCKL) and cyclo-([Trp(6) ]-KL) (WCKL). The <b>linear</b> WRL <b>analogue</b> was significantly more potent than kallidin on rat duodenum preparations, whereas YKL was significantly less potent. Both cyclic peptides, YCKL and WCKL displayed similar activity, lower than that of the <b>linear</b> <b>analogues</b> and also of cyclo-KL. The two <b>linear</b> <b>analogues</b> display high conformational flexibility in DMSO. In the predominant conformer, for both peptides, all three X-Pro bonds adopt a traits configuration. Three out of four conformers present in YCKL and WCKL were completely assigned. The configurations at the X-Pro bonds are the same for the two analogues. All cyclic conformers show a cis configuration in at least one X-Pro bond and always opposite configuration for the two consecutive X-Pro bonds. The NOE-restrained MID calculations resulted in the detection of several elements of secondary structure in each of the conformers.
