5|$|Debian offers CD images {{specifically}} {{built for}} GNOME (the default desktop), KDE Software Compilation, Xfce and LXDE. MATE is officially supported, while Cinnamon support was added with Debian 8.0 Jessie. <b>Less</b> <b>common</b> window managers such as Enlightenment, Openbox, Fluxbox, IceWM, Window Maker {{and others are}} available.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{watershed}} of Nanticoke Creek (67.3 percent) consists of forested land. Significantly <b>less</b> <b>common</b> are urban land and mining land, {{which make up}} 12.2 and 10.3 percent of {{the watershed}}'s area. A total of 8.6 percent is grassland and 1.6 percent is wetlands.|$|E
25|$|The most commons {{species of}} fish in the river are Coregonus lavaretus, European perch and {{northern}} pike, all three which have been the basis for sustenance fishing. <b>Less</b> <b>commons</b> species include burbot, grayling and brown trout. Five thousand trouts are set out each year to sustain the population. Especially the lake Kaskamajärvi has a large trout population. The lower portion of the river previously had some Atlantic salmon, but these have all but disappeared since the hydroelectric stations were installed. Uncommon fish species include European river lamprey, three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and common minnow. Vendace is an introduced species in Lake Inari and has spread to the reserve.|$|R
50|$|In 1929 {{the larger}} but <b>less</b> prestigious <b>Common</b> Council was eliminated, leaving just the Board of Aldermen as the city's sole {{legislative}} body, in {{an arrangement that}} would become familiar to Louisvillians over the next 75 years.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{conventions}} are <b>less</b> common: <b>Common</b> Lisp and Macsyma/Maxima use Basic-like operators {{except for}} inequality, which is [...] in Common Lisp and [...] in Macsyma/Maxima. Older Lisps used , , and and negated them using [...] {{for the remaining}} operators.|$|R
5|$|Pteranodon longiceps {{would have}} shared {{the sky with}} the giant-crested {{pterosaur}} Nyctosaurus. Compared to P. longiceps, which was a very common species, Nyctosaurus was rare, making up only 3% of pterosaur fossils from the formation. Also <b>less</b> <b>common</b> was the early toothed bird, Ichthyornis.|$|E
5|$|Stay-at-home dads {{have been}} seen in {{increasing}} numbers in Western culture, especially in Canada, the UK and the United States since the late 20th century. In developed East Asian nations such as Japan and South Korea, this practice is <b>less</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E
5|$|Such {{large-scale}} {{interactions are}} rare. As time passes, mergers of two systems of equal size become <b>less</b> <b>common.</b> Most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged {{for the last}} few billion years, and the net rate of star formation probably also peaked approximately ten billion years ago.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 {{in vitro}} multi-drug {{resistant}} mouse tumor cells {{were treated with}} paclitaxel encased in exosomes. Doses 98% <b>less</b> than <b>common</b> dosing had the same effect. Also, dye-marked exosomes were able to mark tumor cells, potentially aiding in diagnosis.|$|R
50|$|Poisoning of {{palladium}} and platinum catalysts {{has been}} extensively researched. As a rule of thumb, platinum (as Adams's catalyst, finely divided on carbon) is <b>less</b> susceptible. <b>Common</b> poisons for these two metals are sulfur and nitrogen-heterocycles like pyridine and quinoline.|$|R
50|$|In the US, the three-hole punch is most <b>common.</b> <b>Less</b> {{frequently}} seen is the two-hole filebinder punch.|$|R
5|$|The American robin's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} woodland and more open farmland and urban areas. It becomes <b>less</b> <b>common</b> as a breeder in the southernmost {{part of the}} Deep South of the United States, and there prefers large shade trees on lawns. Its winter habitat is similar but includes more open areas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>less</b> <b>common</b> tiglon or tigon is a {{cross between}} a lioness and a male tiger. In {{contrast}} to ligers, tigons are often relatively small in comparison to their parents, because of reciprocal gene effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} large {{herbivore}} is the black-tailed deer, a subspecies of the mule deer. Elk and moose are <b>less</b> <b>common.</b> Mountain goats are well-adapted to steep terrain and cold temperatures, {{and are not}} usually found at lower elevations. There are eight species of bats {{that live in the}} North Cascades.|$|E
50|$|Class AB sacrifices some {{efficiency}} over class B {{in favor}} of linearity, thus is less efficient (below 78.5% for full-amplitude sine waves in transistor amplifiers, typically; much <b>less</b> is <b>common</b> in class-AB vacuum-tube amplifiers). It is typically much more efficient than class A.|$|R

50|$|Though GLARE is a {{composite}} material, its material properties and fabrication {{are very similar to}} bulk aluminium metal sheets. It has far <b>less</b> in <b>common</b> with composite structures when it comes to design, manufacture, inspection, or maintenance. GLARE parts are constructed and repaired using mostly conventional metal working techniques.|$|R
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium {{isotopes}} found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is <b>less</b> <b>common</b> {{in the solar system}} than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are <b>less</b> <b>common.</b> For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP {{provides}} {{evidence that the}} horse was an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were <b>less</b> <b>common</b> in the dire wolf diet. This indicates that the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and {{at the close of}} the late Pleistocene before its extinction it was hunting or scavenging the most available herbivores.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} Fritillaria species {{are used as}} early spring {{ornamental}} flowers. These vary from the large Fritillaria imperialis (crown imperial) available {{in a number of}} colours such as yellow or orange, to the relatively tiny species such as Fritillaria meleagris or Fritillaria uva-vulpis with their chequered patterns. Erythronium is <b>less</b> <b>common</b> but a popular cultivar is 'Pagoda' with its sulphur yellow flowers. Calochortus (mariposa lily) may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars.|$|E

5000|$|The Bessel filter is {{very similar}} to the Gaussian filter, and tends towards the same shape as filter order increases. [...] While the time-domain step {{response}} of the Gaussian filter has zero overshoot, the Bessel filter has a small amount of overshoot, but still much <b>less</b> than <b>common</b> frequency domain filters.|$|R
5|$|Advanced COPD {{leads to}} high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart. This situation {{is referred to as}} cor pulmonale, and leads to symptoms of leg swelling and bulging neck veins. COPD is more common than any other lung disease as a cause of cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale has become <b>less</b> <b>common</b> since the use of supplemental oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Although far <b>less</b> <b>common</b> {{than other}} metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme {{that occurs in}} humans and other mammals that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5|$|Among scarce plants {{found on}} Sand Point are smallflower buttercup, and honewort. The range of soils {{at the site}} support various flora and fauna. The {{calcareous}} grassland is dominated by Festuca species and Dactylis glomerata, while the scrub towards {{the west of the}} site is dominated by hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), while that to the east consists of common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg). <b>Less</b> <b>common</b> plants include the cheddar pink (Dianthus gratianopolitanus) and Somerset hair grass (Koeleria vallesiana).|$|E
