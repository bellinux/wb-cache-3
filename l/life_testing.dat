50|$|Failures {{that occur}} {{early in the}} life of a new product are vital {{information}} for the manufacturer to improve the product. New product development aims to eliminate defects by testing in the factory before launch, but some may occur during its early <b>life.</b> <b>Testing</b> products to simulate their behavior in the external environment is a difficult skill, and may involve accelerated <b>life</b> <b>testing</b> for example. The worst kind of defect to occur after launch is a safety-critical defect, a defect that can endanger life or limb. Their discovery usually leads to a product recall or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Product defects often follow the bathtub curve, with high initial failures, a lower rate during regular life, followed by another rise due to wear-out. National standards, such as those of ASTM and the British Standards Institute, and International Standards can help the designer in increasing product integrity.|$|E
