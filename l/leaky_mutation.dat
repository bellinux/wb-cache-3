This failure to create antibodies prevents most SCID mice from rejecting non-self tissues.

40|$|Two threonine-requiring mutants with derepressed {{expression}} of the threonine operon were isolated from an Escherichia coli K- 12 strain containing two copies of the thr operon. One of them carries a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> in ilvA (the structural gene for threonine deaminase), which creates an isoleucine limitation and therefore derepression of the thr operon. In the second mutant, the enzymes of the thr operon were not repressed by threonine plus isoleucine; the threonyl-transfer ribonucleic acid(tRNA) synthetase from this mutant shows an apparent Km for threonine 200 -fold {{higher than that of}} the parental strain. The gene, called thrS, coding for threonyl-tRNA synthetase was located around 30 min on the E. coli map. The regulatory properties of this mutant imply the involvement of charged threonyl-tRNA or threonyl-tRNA synthetase in the regulation of the thr operon...|$|E

Variants are examined through information-based analysis and the context of novel mutations as well as common and rare SNPs with splicing effects are displayed. Potential natural and cryptic mRNA splicing variants are identified, and inactivating mutations are distinguished from <b>leaky</b> <b>mutations.</b> Mutations and rare SNPs were predicted in genomes of three cancer cell lines (U 2 OS, U 251 and A 431), supported by expression analyses. After filtering, tractable numbers of potentially deleterious variants are predicted by the software, suitable for further laboratory investigation. In these cell lines, novel functional variants comprised 6 – 17 inactivating mutations, 1 – 5 <b>leaky</b> <b>mutations</b> and 6 – 13 cryptic splicing mutations.

We present the Shannon pipeline software for genome-scale mutation analysis and provide evidence that the software predicts variants affecting mRNA splicing.

The software has been implemented for CLC-Bio Genomics platform. Annotation indicates the context of novel mutations as well as common and rare SNPs with splicing effects. Potential natural and cryptic mRNA splicing variants are identified, and null mutations are distinguished from <b>leaky</b> <b>mutations.</b> Mutations and rare SNPs were predicted in genomes of three cancer cell lines (U 2 OS, U 251 and A 431), which were supported by expression analyses.

40|$|Fas is a 45 -kDa {{membrane}} protein that transduces an apoptotic signal. The mouse lymphoproliferation (lpr) mutation is a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> of Fas. In this study, we examined lymphocyte development in Fas-null mice generated by gene targeting. The Fas-/- mice progressively accumulated abnormal T cells (Thy 1 +, B 220 +, CD 4 -, and CD 8 -) and developed lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, which {{were much more}} accelerated and pronounced than those in lpr mice. In addition, the Fas-null mice showed lymphocytosis, accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration in the lungs and liver. The number of apparently normal B cells also increased, and large amounts of immunoglobulins, including anti-DNA antibodies, were produced. Thymic clonal deletion, assessed by deletion of T cells reactive to mouse endogenous superantigens, was apparently normal in the Fas-/- mice, whereas the peripheral clonal deletion of mature T cells against a bacterial superantigen was impaired. These results suggested that Fas plays a decisive role in peripheral clonal deletion but not in negative selection in the thymus...|$|E
40|$|The Phycomyces blakesleeanus {{wild-type}} is yellow, {{because it}} accumulates beta-carotene {{as the main}} carotenoid. A new carotenoid mutant of this fungus (A 486) was isolated, after treatment with ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), showing a whitish coloration. It accumulates large amounts of phytoene, small quantities of phytofluene, zeta-carotene and neurosporene, in decreasing amounts, and traces of beta-carotene. This phenotype indicates that it carries a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> affecting the enzyme phytoene dehydrogenase (EC 1. 3. -. -), which is specified by the gene carB. Biochemical analysis of heterokaryons showed that mutant A 486 complements two previously characterized carB mutants, C 5 (carB 10) and S 442 (carB 401). Sequence analysis of the carB gene genomic copy from these three strains revealed {{that they are all}} altered in the gene carB, giving information {{about the nature of the}} mutation in each carB mutant allele.

40|$|Salmonella typhimurium strains {{which produce}} high {{constitutive}} levels of aspartate transcarbamoylase {{due to the}} pyrH 700 mutation were found to grow more slowly in minimal medium than pyrH+ controls. The addition of arginine or citrulline but not ornithine restored normal growth rates. This requirement for arginine was completely suppressed by pyrB mutations and partially suppressed by pyrC and pyrD mutations. No suppression was observed with mutants at the pyrF locus. Introduction of <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> argI 2002 resulted in a more extreme arginine requirement and accentuated suppression by pyrB mutations. Suppression by the pyrC and pyrD mutations was reduced {{as a result of}} the incorporation of the leaky argI 2002 allele. These results indicate that in pyrH 700 strains carbamoyl phosphate is preferentially directed toward the formation of intermediates in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Arginine auxotrophy results from the reduced availability of carbamoyl phosphate for the biosynthesis of arginine. Suppression of this arginine dependence for growth is used as a convenient positive selection technique for pyrB mutations...|$|E
40|$|Protein-truncating {{mutations}} in the dystrophin gene {{lead to the}} progressive muscle wasting disorder Duchenne muscular dystrophy, whereas in-frame deletions typically manifest as the milder allelic condition, Becker muscular dystrophy. Antisense oligomer-induced exon skipping can modify dystrophin gene expression so that a disease-associated dystrophin pre-mRNA is processed into a Becker muscular dystrophy-like mature transcript. Despite genomic deletions that may encompass hundreds of kilobases of the gene, some dystrophin mutations appear “leaky”, {{and low levels of}} high molecular weight, and presumably semi-functional, dystrophin are produced. A likely causative mechanism is endogenous exon skipping, and Duchenne individuals with higher baseline levels of dystrophin may respond more efficiently to the administration of splice-switching antisense oligomers. We optimized excision of exons 8 and 9 in normal human myoblasts, and evaluated several oligomers in cells from eight Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients with deletions in a known “leaky” region of the dystrophin gene. Inter-patient variation in response to antisense oligomer induced skipping in vitro appeared minimal. We describe oligomers targeting exon 8, that unequivocally increase dystrophin above baseline in vitro, and propose that patients with <b>leaky</b> <b>mutations</b> are ideally suited for participation in antisense oligomer mediated splice-switching clinical studies...|$|R
40|$|Impotent mutant {{strains of}} Chlamydomonas reinhardi, mating-type (mt) plus, are {{described}} that have normal growth and motility but fail to differentiate into normal gametes. Procedures for their isolation and their genetic analysis are described. Five of the imp strains (imp- 2, imp- 5, imp- 6, imp- 7, and imp- 8) exhibit no flagellar agglutination when mixed with mt- or mt + gametes; these strains have been induced to form rare zygotes with mt- gametes and the mutations are {{shown to be}} unlinked to the mt locus (with {{the possible exception of}} imp- 7). Two of the strains (imp- 3 and imp- 4) carry <b>leaky</b> <b>mutations</b> that affect cell fusion; neither mutation is found by tetrad analysis to be linked to mt or to the other. Cells of the imp- 1 strain agglutinate well with mt- gametes and active agglutination continues for up to 48 hours, but cell fusion occurs only very rarely. Analysis of these rare zygotes indicates that imp- 1 is closely linked to the mt+ locus, and fine-structural studies reveal that imp- 1 gametes produce a mutant mating structure involved in zygotic cell fusion. The development of sexuality in C. reinhardi therefore appears amenable to genetic dissection...|$|R
40|$|Cumulative {{repression}} of E. coli carbamoylphosphate synthase (CPSase; EC 2. 7. 2. 9) by arginine and pyrimidine was analyzed {{in relation to}} control of enzyme synthesis in the arginine and pyrimidine pathways. The expression of carA and carB, the adjacent genes that specify the two subunits of the enzyme, was estimated {{by means of an}} in vitro complementation assay. The synthesis of each gene product was found to be under repression control. Coordinate expression of the two genes was observed under most conditions investigated. They might thus form an operon. The preparation of strains blocked in the degradation of cytidine and harboring <b>leaky</b> <b>mutations</b> affecting several steps of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis made it possible to distinguish between the effects of cytidine and uridine compounds in the {{repression of}} the pyrimidine pathway enzymes. The data obtained suggest that derivatives of both cytidine and uridine participate in the repression of CPSase. In addition, repression of CPSase by arginine did not appear to occur unless pyrimidines were present at a significant intracellular concentration. This observation, together with our previous report that argR mutations impair the cumulative repression of CPSase, suggests that this control is mediated through the concerted effects of regulatory elements specific for the arginine and pyrimidine pathways.

40|$|Plant {{growth and}} organ {{formation}} {{depend on the}} oriented deposition of load-bearing cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall. Cellulose is synthesized by a large relative molecular weight cellulose synthase complex (CSC), which comprises at least three distinct cellulose synthases. Cellulose synthesis in plants or bacteria also requires the activity of an endo- 1, 4 -beta-d-glucanase, the exact function of which in the synthesis process is not known. Here, we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) membrane-bound endo- 1, 4 -beta-d-glucanase KORRIGAN 1 (KOR 1) not only caused reduced CSC movement in the plasma membrane but also a reduced cellulose synthesis inhibitor-induced accumulation of CSCs in intracellular compartments. This suggests a role for KOR 1 both in the synthesis of cellulose microfibrils and in the intracellular trafficking of CSCs. Next, we used a multidisciplinary approach, including live cell imaging, gel filtration chromatography analysis, split ubiquitin assays in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae NMY 51), and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, to show that, in contrast to previous observations, KOR 1 {{is an integral part}} of the primary cell wall CSC in the plasma membrane...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{different}} classically generated and mapped mutations at the tryptophan synthetase locus in Neurospora crassa {{have been}} characterized {{to the level}} of the primary sequence of the gene. This sequence analysis has demonstrated that intragenic recombination is accurate to order mutations within one open reading frame. While classic genetic analysis correctly ordered the mutations, the position of mutations characterized by gene sequence analysis was more accurate. A <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> was found to have a wild-type primary sequence. The presence of unique polymorphisms in the primary sequence of the trp- 3 gene from strain 861 confirms that it has a unique history relative to the other strains studied. Most strains that were previously shown to be immunologically nonreactive with antibody preparations raised against tryptophan synthetase protein were shown to have nonsense mutations.

40|$|The F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI 1) plays {{a central}} role in jasmonate (JA) {{signaling}} and is required for all JA responses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To dissect JA signal transduction, we isolated the partially suppressing coi 1 (psc 1) mutant, which partially suppressed coi 1 insensitivity to JA inhibition of root growth. The psc 1 mutant partially restored JA sensitivity in coi 1 - 2 background and displayed JA hypersensitivity in wild-type COI 1 background. Genetic mapping, sequence analysis, and complementation tests revealed that psc 1 is a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> of DWARF 4 (DWF 4) that encodes a key enzyme in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis. Physiological analysis showed that an application of exogenous BR eliminated the partial restoration of JA sensitivity by psc 1 in coi 1 - 2 background and the JA hypersensitivity of psc 1 in wild-type COI 1 background. Exogenous BR also attenuated JA inhibition of root growth in the wild type. In addition, the expression of DWF 4 was inhibited by JA, and this inhibition was dependent on COI 1. These results indicate that (1) BR is involved in JA signaling and negatively regulates JA inhibition of root growth, and (2) the DWF 4 is down-regulated by JA and is located downstream of COI 1 in the JA-signaling pathway...|$|E
40|$|F-box protein genes {{family is}} one of the largest gene {{families}} in plants, with almost 700 predicted genes in the model plant Arabidopsis. F-box proteins are key components of the ubiquitin proteasome system that allows targeted protein degradation. Transcriptome analyses indicate that half of these F-box protein genes are found expressed in microspore and/or pollen, i. e., during male gametogenesis. To assess the role of F-box protein genes during this crucial developmental step, we selected 34 F-box protein genes recorded as highly and specifically expressed in pollen and isolated corresponding insertion mutants. We checked the expression level of each selected gene by RT-PCR and confirmed pollen expression for 25 genes, but specific expression for only 10 of the 34 F-box protein genes. In addition, we tested the expression level of selected F-box protein genes in 24 mutant lines and showed that 11 of them were null mutants. Transmission analysis of the mutations to the progeny showed that none of the single mutations was gametophytic lethal. These unaffected transmission efficiencies suggested <b>leaky</b> <b>mutations</b> or functional redundancy among F-box protein genes. Cytological observation of the gametophytes in the mutants confirmed these results. Combinations of mutations in F-box protein genes from the same subfamily did not lead to transmission defect either, further highlighting functional redundancy and/or a high proportion of pseudogenes among these F-box protein genes...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken to determine {{to what extent}} the properties of oligosporogenous (Osp) mutants allow them to be considered as a separate class of sporulation mutant, distinct from asporogenous (Sp-) mutants. Of thirty Osp mutants examined, seventeen at least had a phenotype which had previously been identified with a Sp- mutant. The majority of cells in an Osp culture either reached a particular stage in the sporulation process and then stopped, or in some cases went on to produce aberrant forms. Some of these aberrant forms have their counterparts in Sp- mutants described by other authors, but some present new features. The morphological and biochemical sequences were linked so that if the majority of cells were blocked at a certain stage, then the biochemical sequence stopped accordingly. The general similarity in behaviour between the two types of mutant is consistent with the assumption {{that at least some of}} the Osp mutants have <b>leaky</b> <b>mutations</b> in genes where mutation can also give rise to Sp- phenotypes. Evidence is presented to suggest that the ability of a cell of an Osp mutant to over-come its block, and so go on to form a spore, is a chance event when that stage in the process is reached. A mutant has been obtained in which the spores are octanol-resistant yet contain no measurable dipicolinate. In several other mutants the spores contained well-developed coat layers, but the cortex was poorly formed or com-pletely missing...|$|R

Bacteriol. 157 : 940 - 941, 1984) that nonphosphorylated enzyme IIIGlc of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system {{is required for}} full synthesis of bacterial cyclic AMP (cAMP). In crp strains of Salmonella typhimurium, cAMP synthesis by intact cells was regulated by the phosphorylation state of enzyme IIIGlc. Introduction of either a pstHI deletion mutation or a crr::Tn 10 mutation resulted in {{a low level of}} cAMP synthesis. In contrast, crp strains containing a <b>leaky</b> pstI <b>mutation</b> exhibited a high level of cAMP synthesis which was inhibited by phosphotransferase system carbohydrates. From these results, we conclude that phosphorylated enzyme IIIGlc rather than nonphosphorylated enzyme IIIGlc is required for full cAMP synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The interconversion of {{cell type}} in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is {{initiated}} by a double-stranded break (DSB) found at the mating type locus (mat 1). A heritable site- and strand-specific DNA "imprinting" event at mat 1 was recently hypothesized to be required to make the mat 1 locus cleavable, and the DSB was suggested to be produced one generation before the actual switching event. It is known that only one cell among four granddaughters of a cell ever switches, and the sister of the recently switched cell switches efficiently in consecutive cell divisions. The feature of consecutive switching creates a major difficulty of having to replicate chromosomes possessing the DSB. The mat 1 cis-acting <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation,</b> called smt-s, reduces {{the level of the}} DSB required for switching and is shown here to be a 27 -bp deletion located 50 bp away from the cut site. Determination of the pattern and frequency of switching of the mutant allele by cell lineage studies has allowed us to conclude the following: (1) the chromosome with the DSB is sealed and replicated, then one of the specific chromatids is cleaved again to generate switching-competent cells in consecutive cell divisions and (2) the smt-s mutation affects DNA cleavage and not the hypothesized DNA imprinting step...|$|E

In an attempt to identify the mechanism(s) of nitrate reduction in the mutant, nitrate reductase from nar 1 a was characterized {{to determine whether the}} residual activity is due to a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> or to the presence of a second nitrate reductase. The results obtained indicate that the nitrate reductase in nar 1 a differs from the wild-type enzyme in several important aspects. The pH optima for both the NADH and the NADPH nitrate reductase activities from nar 1 a were approximately pH 7. 7, which is slightly greater than the pH 7. 5 optimum for the NADH activity and considerably greater than the pH 6. 0 to 6. 5 optimum for the NADPH activity of the wild-type enzyme. The nitrate reductase from nar 1 a exhibits greater NADPH than NADH activity and has apparent Km values for nitrate and NADH that are approximately 10 times greater than those of the wild-type enzyme. The nar 1 a nitrate reductase has apparent Km values of 170 micromolar for NADPH and 110 micromolar for NADH. NADPH, but not NADH, inhibited the enzyme at concentrations greater than 50 micromolar...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium chelatase (EC 6. 6. 1. 1) catalyses the {{insertion}} of magnesium into protoporphyrin IX, the first unique step of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme is composed of three different subunits of approximately 40, 70 and 140 kDa. In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) the subunits are encoded by the genes Xantha-h, Xantha-g and Xantha-f. In the 1950 s, eight induced xantha-f mutants were isolated. In this work we characterized these mutations at the DNA level and provided explanations for their phenotypes. The xantha-f 10 mutation is a 3 bp deletion, resulting in a polypeptide lacking the glutamate residue at position 424. The <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> xantha-f 26 has a missense mutation leading to a M 632 R exchange. The xantha-f 27 and -f 40 are deletions of 14 and 2 bp, respectively, resulting in truncated polypeptides of 1104 and 899 amino acid residues, respectively. Mutation xantha-f 41 is an in-frame deletion that removes A 439, L 440, Q 441 and V 442 from the resulting protein. Mutation xantha-f 58 is most likely a deletion of the whole Xantha-f gene, as no DNA fragments could be detected by PCR or southern blot experiments. The slightly leaky xantha-f 60 and non-leaky -f 68 mutations each have a missense mutation causing a P 393 L and G 794 E exchange in the polypeptide, respectively...|$|E

Here, we identified an unexpected mutation in the myostatin gene which is almost fixed in Blonde d’Aquitaine cattle. In skeletal muscle, the mutant allele was highly expressed leading to an abnormal transcript consisting of a 41 -bp inclusion and premature termination codons and to residual levels of a correctly spliced transcript. This expression pattern, caused by a <b>leaky</b> intronic <b>mutation</b> with regard to spliceosome activity and its apparent stability with regard to surveillance mechanisms, could contribute to the moderate muscle hypertrophy in this cattle breed. This finding is of importance for genetic counseling for meat quantity and quality in livestock production and possibly to manipulate myostatin pre-mRNA in human muscle diseases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{anticodon}} nuclease (ACNase) PrrC is silenced in Escherichia coli by {{an associated}} DNA restriction-modification protein, activated by the phage T 4 -encoded anti-DNA restriction factor Stp and counteracted by T 4 's tRNA repair enzymes polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase 1. Hence, only tRNA repair-deficient phages succumb to PrrC's restriction. PrrC's ABC-ATPase motor domains are implicated in driving its activation by hydrolyzing GTP and in stabilizing the activated ACNase by avidly binding dTTP. The latter effect {{has been associated}} with dTTP's accumulation early in T 4 infection when PrrC is activated. In agreement, delayed dTTP accumulation caused by dCMP deaminase deficiency coincided with impaired manifestation of PrrC's ACNase activity. This impairment did not suffice to suppress the PrrC-mediated restriction of tRNA repair deficient phage but was synthetically suppressive with a <b>leaky</b> stp <b>mutation</b> that only partly impairs PrrC's activation. Presumably, ability to gauge dTTP's changing level helps confine PrrC's toxicity to its viral target...|$|R
40|$|The phage {{adsorption}} {{ability and}} serological specificity of different Salmonella strains having either complete or <b>leaky</b> <b>mutations</b> in their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis were compared, {{together with their}} genotype and sugar composition, to provide a set of standards relating these parameters to LPS structure. Strains that had T 1 -specific side chains in their LPS, both with or without O side chains, were examined {{to learn more about}} the organization of these two side chains in the LPS and a possible competition between them. It was found that (i) adsorption of O-specific antibodies was a very sensitive test for the presence of even very small amounts of O-specific structures, (ii) that phage P 22 adsorption was dependent on the presence of a nearly complete O side chain complement, and both long and numerous O side chains were required, and (iii) that the adsorption of the phages FO (Felix O- 1), 6 SR, and Br 2, which attach to structures in the LPS core, was a sensitive indicator of any defect in O-antigen synthesis, and well developed O side chains blocked their attachment efficiently. Semirough (SR) strains with only one O-specific repeating unit per side chain adsorbed FO efficiently, whereas the access of the 6 SR and Br 2 phages to their receptors was blocked. Strains with T 1 side chains adsorbed the FO and 6 SR phages efficiently, whereas the adsorption of the Br 2 phage was blocked to a large extent. The phage adsorption of four S, T 1 strains (with both O and T 1 side chains) showed that, as the amount of O side chain material increased, there was a reduction of the adsorption of phages in the following order: 6 SR, Br 2, and FO. P 22 attachment appeared with the increase of O side chains. The LPS composition of these strains revealed a 10 -fold reduction of the O-specific structures compared to the smooth parent strain, whereas the amount of T 1 -specific material was the same as in T 1 strains. The short O side chains of a SR, T 1 strain were, however, not reduced in number, suggesting that the apparent competition between O and T 1 side chains may not be a competition for available sites in the LPS...|$|R
40|$|Ribose-binding protein (RBP) is an {{exported}} protein of Escherichia coli that {{functions in}} the periplasm. The export of RBP involves the secretion machinery of the cell, consisting of a cytoplasmic protein, SecA, and the integral membrane translocation complex, including SecE and SecY. SecB protein, a chaperone known to mediate the export of some periplasmic and outer membrane proteins, was previously reported not {{to be involved in}} RBP translocation even though small amounts of in vitro complexes between SecB and RBP have been detected. In our investigation, it was shown that a dependence on SecB could be demonstrated under conditions in which export was compromised. Species of RBP which carry two mutations, one in the leader that blocks export and a second in the mature protein which partially suppresses the export defect, were shown to be affected by SecB for efficient translocation. Five different changes which suppress the effect of the signal sequence mutation - 17 LP are all located in the N domain of the tertiary structure of RBP. All species of RBP show similar interaction with SecB. Furthermore, a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation,</b> - 14 AE, generated by site-specific mutagenesis causes reduced export in the absence of SecB. These results indicate that SecB can interact with RBP during secretion, although it is not absolutely required under normal circumstances...|$|E
40|$|GCN 2 is {{a protein}} kinase that stimulates {{translation}} of GCN 4 mRNA in amino acid-starved cells by phosphorylating the a subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF- 2). We isolated multicopy plasmids that overcome the defective derepression of GCN 4 and its target genes {{caused by the}} <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> gcn 2 - 507. One class of plasmids contained tRNAHIS genes and conferred efficient suppression only when cells were starved for histidine; these plasmids suppressed a gcn 2 deletion much less efficiently than they suppressed gcn 2 - 507. This finding indicates that the reduction in GCN 4 expression caused by gcn 2 - 507 can be overcome by elevating tRNAHIS expression under conditions in which the excess tRNA cannot be fully aminoacylated. The second class of suppressor plasmids all carried the same gene encoding a mutant form of tRNAVal(AAC) with an A-to-G transition at the 3 ' encoded nucleotide, a mutation shown previously to reduce aminoacylation of tRNAVU ' in vitro. In contrast to the wild-type tRNAHiS genes, the mutant tRNAVaI gene efficiently suppressed a gcn 2 deletion, and this suppression was independent of the phosphorylation site on eIF- 2 a (Ser- 51). Overexpression of the mutant tRNAVaI did, however, stimulate GCN 4 expression at the translational level. We propose that the multicopy mutant tRNAVal construct leads to an accumulation of uncharged tRNAV 2 I that derepresses GCN 4 translation through a pathway that does not involve GCN 2 or eIF- 2 a phosphorylation. This GCN 2 -independent pathway was also stimulated {{to a lesser extent}} by the multicopy tRNAHIS constructs i...|$|E

The arcA mutations used were an internal deletion and the arcA 2 allele, a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> {{for some of the}} characteristics of the Arc phenotype which confers high respiratory capacity. PHB synthesis was not detected in the wild-type strain in shaken flask cultures under low-oxygen conditions, while ArcA mutants gave rise to polymer accumulation of up to 24 % of their cell dry weight. When grown under microaerobic conditions in a bioreactor, the arcA deletion mutant reached a PHB content of 27 % ± 2 %. Under the same conditions, higher biomass and PHB concentrations were observed for the strain bearing the arcA 2 allele, resulting in a PHB content of 35 % ± 3 %. This strain grew in a simple medium at a specific growth rate of 0. 69 ± 0. 07 h- 1, whereas the deletion mutant needed several nutritional additives and snowed a specific growth rate of 0. 56 ± 0. 06 h- 1.

Besides BRLA, the transcription factor ABAA, which is located downstream of BRLA in the developmental regulation cascade, is necessary to direct later gene expression during sporulation. We isolated a new developmental mutant and identified a <b>leaky</b> brlA <b>mutation</b> and the mutated Saccharomyces cerevisiae cyclin homologue pclA, both contributing to the developmental phenotype of the mutant. pclA {{was found to be}} 10 -fold transcriptionally upregulated during conidiation, and a pclA deletion strain was reduced three- to fivefold in production of conidia. Expression of pclA was strongly induced by ectopic expression of brlA or abaA under conidiation-suppressing conditions, indicating a direct role for brlA and abaA in pclA regulation. PCLA is homologous to yeast Pcl cyclins, which interact with the Pho 85 cyclin-dependent kinase. Although interaction with a PSTAIRE kinase was shown in vivo, PCLA function during sporulation was independent of the A. nidulans Pho 85 homologue PHOA. Besides the developmental regulation, pclA expression was cell cycle dependent with peak transcript levels in S phase. Our findings suggest a role for PCLA in mediating cell cycle events during late stages of sporulation...|$|R
40|$|Bacteriophage T 4 gene 1 and 42 amber mutants (defective in {{deoxynucleoside}} monophosphate kinase and deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase, respectively) {{are able}} to synthesize DNA in cell-free lysates prepared as described by Barry and Alberts (1972), in contrast to their inabliity {{to do so in}} plasmolyzed and toluenized cell systems. Addition of extracts containing an active gene 1 or 42 product has no effect on synthesis in lysates defective in the respective gene. Thus, if these enzymes do play additional direct roles in replication, these roles are not manifest in the lysed-cell system. The gene 42 mutant am N 122 /m, a double mutant bearing an additional defect in DNA polymerase, is unable to synthesize DNA in these lysates. This inability is overcome by addition of extracts containing an active T 4 DNA polymerase. m is a <b>leaky</b> amber <b>mutation</b> which reduces DNA polymerase activity to a very low level. However, this level is high enough to allow positive genetic complementation tests with gene 43 mutants. Two other gene 42 amber mutants contain additional defects: am 269 induces only half the normal level of DNA polymerase, and am C 87 fails to induce a detectable level of thymidylate synthetase. These defects do not result from pleiotropic effects of the gene 42 mutations. In plasmolyzed cells, temperature-sensitive gene 42 mutants fail to synthesize DNA under conditions where replication forks and 5 -hydroxymethyl-dCTP are present. This supports the idea that the gene 42 protein is directly involved in DNA synthesis...|$|R
40|$|We {{showed that}} {{sufficient}} overexpression of the wild-type recF gene interfered with three normal cell functions: (1) UV induction of transcription from the LexA-protein-repressed sulA promoter, (2) UV resistance and (3) cell viability at 42 °. To show this, we altered a low-level overexpressing recF(+) plasmid {{with a set}} of structurally neutral mutations that increased the rate of expression of recF. The resulting high-level overexpressing plasmid interfered with UV induction of the sulA promoter, as did the low-level overexpressing plasmid. It also reduced UV resistance more than its low level progenitor and decreased viability at 42 °, an effect not seen with the low-level plasmid. We used the high-level plasmid to test four recF structural mutations for residual activity. The structural alleles consisted of an insertion mutation, two single amino acid substitution mutations and a double amino acid substitution mutation. On the Escherichia coli chromosome the three substitution mutations acted similarly to a recF deletion in reducing UV resistance in a recB 21 recC 22 sbcB 15 sbcC 201 genetic background. By this test, therefore, all three appeared to be null alleles. Measurements of conjugational recombination revealed, however, that the three substitution mutations may have residual activity. On the high-level overexpressing plasmid all three substitution mutations definitely showed partial activity. By contrast, the insertion mutation on the high-level overexpressing plasmid showed no partial activity and can be considered a true null mutation. One of the substitutions, recF 143, showed a property attributable to a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation.</b> Another substitution, recF 4101, may block selectively two of the three interference phenotypes, thus allowing us to infer a mechanism for them...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The T cell antigen receptors (TCR) of αβ and γδ T {{lymphocytes}} {{are believed}} to assemble {{in a similar fashion}} in humans. Firstly, αβ or γδ TCR chains incorporate a CD 3 δε dimer, then a CD 3 γε dimer and finally a ζζ homodimer, resulting in TCR complexes with the same CD 3 dimer stoichiometry. Partial reduction in the expression of the highly homologous CD 3 γ and CD 3 δ proteins would thus be expected to have a similar impact in the assembly and surface expression of both TCR isotypes. To test this hypothesis, we compared the surface TCR expression of primary αβ and γδ T cells from healthy donors carrying a single null or <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> in CD 3 G (γ +/−) or CD 3 D (δ +/−, δ +/leaky) with that of normal controls. Results Although the partial reduction in the intracellular availability of CD 3 γ or CD 3 δ proteins was comparable {{as a consequence of the}} mutations, surface TCR expression measured with anti-CD 3 ε antibodies was significantly more decreased in γδ than in αβ T lymphocytes in CD 3 γ +/− individuals, whereas CD 3 δ +/− and CD 3 δ +/leaky donors showed a similar decrease of surface TCR in both T cell lineages. Therefore, surface γδ TCR expression was more dependent on available CD 3 γ than surface αβ TCR expression. Conclusions The results support the existence of differential structural constraints in the two human TCR isotypes regarding the incorporation of CD 3 γε and CD 3 δε dimers, as revealed by their discordant surface expression behaviour when confronted with reduced amounts of CD 3 γ, but not of the homologous CD 3 δ chain. A modified version of the prevailing TCR assembly model is proposed to accommodate these new data. </p...|$|E
40|$|Pure {{hereditary}} spastic paraplegia (SPG) type 4 is {{the most}} common form of autosomal dominant hereditary SPG, a neurodegenerative disease characterized primarily by hyperreflexia and progressive spasticity of the lower limbs. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding spastin, a member of the AAA family of ATPases. We have screened the spastin gene for mutations in 15 families consistent with linkage to the spastin gene locus, SPG 4, and have identified 11 mutations, 10 of which are novel. Five of the mutations identified are in noninvariant splice-junction sequences. Reverse transcription–PCR analysis of mRNA from patients shows that each of these five mutations results in aberrant splicing. One mutation was found to be “leaky,” or partially penetrant; that is, the mutant allele produced both mutant (skipped exon) and wild-type (full-length) transcripts. This phenomenon was reproduced in in vitro splicing experiments, with a minigene splicing-vector construct only in the context of the endogenous splice junctions flanking the splice junctions of the skipped exon. In the absence of endogenous splice junctions, only mutant transcript was detected. The existence of at least one <b>leaky</b> <b>mutation</b> suggests that relatively small differences in the level of wild-type spastin expression can have significant functional consequences. This may account, at least in part, for the wide ranges in age at onset, symptom severity, and rate of symptom progression that have been reported to occur both among and within families with SPG linked to SPG 4. In addition, these results suggest caution in the interpretation of data solely obtained with minigene constructs to study the effects of sequence variation on splicing. The lack of full genomic sequence context in these constructs can mask important functional consequences of the mutation...|$|E
40|$|Two protein release factors (RFs) showing codon specificity, RF 1 and RF 2, {{are known}} to be {{required}} for polypeptide chain termination in Escherichia coli. A third protein component has also been described that stimulates termination in vitro, but it has remained uncertain whether this protein, RF 3, participates in termination in vivo or is essential to cell growth. We report (i) the purification and N-terminal sequencing of RF 3; (ii) the isolation of transposon insertion mutants similar to miaD, a suppressor of a <b>leaky</b> UAA <b>mutation</b> affecting the gene miaA, leading to enhanced nonsense suppression; (iii) the localization of the affected gene on the physical map of the chromosome; and (iv) the cloning and sequencing of the wild-type gene, providing proof that it encodes the factor RF 3. We designate the gene prfC. Two transposon insertions were shown to interrupt the coding sequence of prfC, at codons 287 and 426. The enhanced nonsense suppression in the insertion mutants shows that the product participates in termination in vivo. The isolation of such mutants strongly suggests that the gene product is not essential to cell viability, though cell growth is affected. RF 3 is a protein with a molecular weight of 59, 460 containing 528 amino acids and displays much similarity to elongation factor EF-G, a GTP binding protein necessary for ribosomal translocation, and other GTP binding proteins known or thought to interact with the ribosome...|$|R
40|$|Random genomic Bacillus subtilis lacZ fusions were {{screened}} {{in order to}} identify the possible existence of regulons responding to the stimuli generated by partial purine starvation. A <b>leaky</b> pur <b>mutation</b> (purL 8) was isolated and used to generate the partial purine starvation conditions in the host strain used for screening. On the basis of their induction during partial purine starvation, seven genomic lacZ fusions were isolated. None of the fusions map in loci previously reported to contain purine-regulated genes. One fusion maps very close to the citB locus and may very well be a citB fusion. The fusions were divided into two types {{on the basis of their}} response to complete starvation for either ATP or GTP or both components at the same time. Except for one, type 2 fusions were induced by specific starvation for ATP and by simultaneous starvation for ATP and GTP, but not by specific GTP starvation in a gua strain or by GTP starvation induced by the addition of decoyinine. Type 1 fusions were equally well induced by all three kinds of purine starvation including GTP starvation induced by decoyinine. Further subdivisions of the fusions were obtained on the basis of their responses to the spo 0 A gene product. A total of five fusions showed that spo 0 A affected expression. One class was unable to induce lacZ expression in the absence of the spo 0 A gene product, whereas the other class had increased lacZ expression during partial purine starvation in a spo 0 A background...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} several unusual {{relationships between the}} 2 -methylthio-N 6 -(delta 2 -isopentenyl) adenosine- 37 (ms 2 i 6 A- 37) tRNA modification and spontaneous mutagenesis in Escherichia coli K- 12 (D. M. Connolly and M. E. Winkler, J. Bacteriol. 171 : 3233 - 3246, 1989). To confirm and extend these observations, we determined the structure of miaA, which mediates {{the first step of}} ms 2 i 6 A- 37 synthesis, and characterized the miaA mutator phenotype. The most likely translation start of miaA overlaps the last two codons of mutL, which encodes a protein required for methyl-directed mismatch repair. This structural arrangement confirms that miaA and mutL are in the same complex operon. The miaA gene product, delta 2 -isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase, shows extensive homology with the yeast MOD 5 gene product, and both enzymes contain a substrate binding site found in farnysyl pyrophosphate synthetase and a conserved putative ATP/GTP binding site. Insertions in miaA cause exclusively GC [...] TA transversions, which contrasts with the GC [...] AT and AT [...] GC transitions observed in mutL mutants. To correlate the absence of the ms 2 i 6 A- 37 tRNA modification directly with the mutator phenotype, we isolated a unique suppressor of a <b>leaky</b> miaA(ochre) <b>mutation.</b> The miaD suppressor mapped to 99. 75 min, restored the ms 2 i 6 A- 37 tRNA modification to miaA(ochre) mutants, and abolished the miaA mutator phenotype. We speculate that miaD causes a decrease in ms 2 i 6 A- 37 tRNA demodification or an increase in miaA gene expression but not at the level of operon transcription. Together, these observations support the idea that the ms 2 i 6 A- 37 tRNA modification acts as a physiological switch that modulates spontaneous mutation frequency and other metabolic functions...|$|R
