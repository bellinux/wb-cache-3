50|$|The USAF 1951 {{resolution}} {{test target}} {{consists of a}} pattern of 3 bar targets. Often found covering a range of 0.25 to 228 cycles/mm. Each group consists of six elements. The group is designated by a group number (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, etc.) which is the power to which 2 should be raised to obtain the spatial frequency of the first element (e.g., group -2 is 0.25 line pairs per millimeter). Each element is the 6th root of 2 smaller than the preceding element in the group (e.g. element 1 is 2^0, element 2 is 2^(-1/6), element 3 is 2(-1/3), etc.). By reading off the group and element number of the first element which cannot be resolved, the limiting resolution may be determined by inspection. The complex numbering system and use of a look-up chart can be avoided by use of an improved but not standardized <b>layout</b> <b>chart,</b> which labels the bars and spaces directly in cycles/mm using OCR-A extended font.|$|E
40|$|Background A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between letter visual acuity and word acuity at distance and between letter acuity and the minimum word size allowing maximum and fluent reading speeds. Methods Visual acuities were measured at six metres for 120 participants. Letter acuity was assessed with a logMAR <b>layout</b> <b>chart</b> with Sloan letters displayed with Thomson XPert software. A logMAR layout lowercase word chart {{was created in}} PowerPoint using {{the format of the}} MNRead near chart, with the font and colours found on United Kingdom motorway signs. Distance letter and word acuity, maximum reading speed, critical print size (CPS) and minimum print size for fluent reading were calculated. Results Word and letter acuities were significantly correlated (p < 0. 001) and showed a statistically (p = 0. 049) but not clinically significant mean difference of 0. 02 ± 0. 09 logMAR. Bland–Altman analysis showed that agreement between charts varied depending on acuity level with word acuity better than letter acuity at levels closer to the driving standard of + 0. 30 logMAR (6 / 12). Maximum reading speed was achieved from print sizes 1. 5 logMAR lines larger than the letter acuity and fluent reading at 80 words per minute from print sizes 0. 06 logMAR larger than the letter acuity. Conclusion These results allow equivalent lowercase print sizes supporting either functional reading or maximum reading speeds to be calculated based on letter chart acuities at distance. Minimum print sizes allowing either functional or maximum reading speeds are more appropriate than threshold word acuities, where groups of words or short phrases need to be identified, such as when driving. Where a driving vision standard of + 0. 30 logMAR (6 / 12) exists, a person just meeting the driving standard should be able to read fluently words on signage in lowercase x-heights equivalent to between + 0. 29 and + 0. 30 logMAR...|$|E
40|$|La Compagnie de Transport Provincial (Montréal) à cause d'une {{expansion}} rapide, a revisé certaines de ses procédures administratives. L'auteur donne le résultat de cette expérience dans le département du trésor qui comprend plus de cent employés cléricaux. Results of an experimentCENERAL APPROACHThe planning {{function in}} an organization is the one which requires the highest degree of judgment, and is the most dynamic. In the planning process decisions must be taken as regards to tasks, personnel and physical facilities or services in order to attain the proposed goal, {{and the purpose of}} the analysis of systems and procedures is to help in taking the most profitable decisions. The analysis of systems and procedure is defined as a systematic study of different systems which is usefull in all the operations of an enterprise, controling and coordinating them. EXPERIMENTDue to the rapid expansion of the Provincial Transport Company (Montreal), Management decided to revise gradually its administrative procedures. The first department to be studied was the Treasury Department. The first step undertaken was to prepare job descriptions, using the « questionnaire » method. In this « questionnaire », particular attention was brought to systems and procedures followed in the accomplishment of the tasks. The following step was to train supervisors in the techniques of analysis used in the field of clerical work:This training program was divided in eight 2 hours courses. THE COURSES AND THEIR RESULTSThe Work Distribution Chart technique brought interesting results. Many tasks had to be performed in other department: two departments had to be organized on a functionnal basis instead of a line basis, some tasks had to be centralized, some employees had to be transfered to other departments and some tasks had to be dropped. The Flow Process Chart helped in the reduction of the work required in ticket reimbursements, in the elimination of useless control procedures, verification work, reports, etc., the simplification of reports from special services, the application of better systems and a greater utilization of existing machinery. The Forms and Reports Improvement Techniques permitted the analysis of 185 forms, 25 % of them were found useless, 16 copies of forms were dropped and 30 forms were reduced or printed on a less expensive paper. 85 % of the forms studied had to be redesigned. The results were similar with the study of reports. With the application of Files and Filing Method Study, the content of 20 file drawers were destroyed, 4 systems were improved, etc. Finally, the <b>Layout</b> <b>Chart</b> brought the attention upon many gaps in the existing systems and suggestions were put forward. Policies of Purchase Department were modified, responsibilities were clearly stated and the fonctions of the Office Manager were revised. CONCLUSIONSThe analysis of systems and procedures permitted, in the Treasury Department, important changes which increased the efficiency of the department, and pointed out the necessity of having a close and maintained collaboration between line and staff people...|$|E
40|$|The art of {{prototyping}} {{has evolved}} {{from the use of}} pen-and-paper <b>layout</b> <b>charts</b> to being the basis for Evolutionary Prototyping, a full methodology for developing software systems. While prototyping is discussed in introductory systems analysis and design courses, students gain a better appreciation of the technique by actually developing different types of prototypes. For example, prototyping is an excellent vehicle for demonstrating the overlapping of phases in the SDLC. This paper reviews the ways in which prototyping may be used in the system development life cycle and then presents examples of how prototyping can be infused into an undergraduate course in systems analysis and design. Students can develop discovery and user-interface prototypes using HTML and JavaScript modules.

50|$|The year 1991 {{also saw}} the last major change to the enlisted rank insignia. In October 1991 General McPeak and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force Pfingston {{announced}} that the senior NCO tier would have new chevron layouts and that all chevrons would have a white star in the center. The change in senior NCO chevrons was the first since chevrons came into being in 1948. Until that time, Master Sergeant had been composed of six inverted chevrons (six down) with none pointing up, Senior Master Sergeant six down with one up and Chief Master Sergeant six down with two up. The new layout changed the insignia to the current <b>layout</b> (see <b>chart</b> above). The second change, changing the star color to white, was actually two changes in one. It added a star to the Airman through Senior Airman rank insignias where there had been none since 1975 (the blue star carried by these chevrons was {{the same color as}} the blue in the stripes giving the impression that the star was not there) and changing the silver star on the NCO and senior NCO chevrons to white.|$|R

As an alternative to traditional <b>chart</b> <b>layout</b> schemes, we introduce an interactive radial query language for simplifying the task of searching for and identifying subtle correlations among data. Our approach allows the user to select which entities to show relationships for, thereby decreasing the cognitive overload associated with static charts. We likewise present a compact visual representation for comparing the differences between two versions of a chart. We have also implemented an intuitive gesture-based interface for creating and removing links between entities, thus enabling users to edit data, not just view it.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{globally}} smooth parameterization method for surfaces of arbitrary topology. Our method {{does not require}} any prior partition into charts nor any cutting. A quadrilateral <b>chart</b> <b>layout</b> (i. e., the topology of the base complex) and the parameterization emerge simultaneously from a global numerical optimization process. Given two orthogonal piecewise linear vector fields (typically the principal directions of curvature), our method computes two piecewise linear periodic functions, aligned with the input vector fields, by minimizing an objective function. The bivariate function they define is a smooth parameterization almost everywhere, except {{in the vicinity of}} singular vertices, edges and triangles, where the derivatives of the parameterization vanish. These singularities can be detected by a simple criterion. We propose an automatic procedure to fix them, by splitting and re-parameterizing the charts that contain singularities. Our method can construct a quasi-conformal (angle preserving) parameterization. A more restrictive class of quasi-isometric (angle and area preserving) parameterizations can also be con-structed, at the expense of introducing more singularities. We demonstrate applications of our method to quad-dominant remeshing. Other possible ap...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{globally}} smooth parameterization method for triangulated surfaces of arbitrary topology. Given two orthogonal piecewise linear vector fields defined over the input mesh (typically the estimated principal curvature directions), our method computes two piecewise linear periodic functions, {{aligned with the}} input vector fields, by minimizing an objective function. The bivariate function they define is a smooth parameterization almost everywhere on the surface, except {{in the vicinity of}} singular vertices, edges and triangles, where the derivatives of the parameterization vanish. We extract a quadrilateral <b>chart</b> <b>layout</b> from the parameterization function and propose an automatic procedure to detect the singularities, and fix them by splitting and re-parameterizing the containing charts.

The more restrictive class of quasi-isometric parameterizations is constructed at the expense of introducing more singularities. The constructed parameterizations can be used for a variety of geometry processing applications. Since we can align the parameterization with the principal curvature directions, our result is particularly suitable for surface fitting and remeshing...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks in {{information}} visualisation research is creating visual tools to facilitate human understanding of large and complex information spaces. Hierarchies, being a good mechanism for organising such information, are ubiquitous. Although much research effort has been spent on finding useful representations for hierarchies, visualising large hierarchies is still a difficult topic. One of the difficulties is {{how to handle the}} ever increasing scale of hierarchies. Another is how to enable the user to focus on multiple selections of interest while maintaining context. This paper describes a hierarchy visualisa-tion technique called FlexTree to address these problems. It contains some important features that have not been exploited so far. A profile or contour unique to the hierarchy being visualised can be viewed in a bar <b>chart</b> <b>layout.</b> A normalised view of a common attribute of all nodes can be selected by the user. Multiple foci are consistently accessible within a global context through interaction. Furthermore it can handle a large hierarchy that contains 10, 000 nodes in a PC environment. This technique has been applied to visualise computer file system structures and decision trees from data mining results. The results from informal user evaluations against these two applications are also presented. User feedback suggests that FlexTree is suitable for visualising large decision trees...|$|R

The report is intended to furnish a plant engineer with all the basic practical information needed for the execution of an expansion project. An organized plan of attack is presented and supplemented with useful lists, instructions, sample documents, and recommended layout and scheduling aids. The first section, on the feasibility stage, includes discussions on committee organization and project function. It supplies a checklist for data input. This is followed by a consideration of the financial decision. The second section,on design stages, presents an organized method of generating a <b>layout.</b> Examples of <b>charts,</b> graphs and diagrams useful in the presentation and utilization of the input data are included, and the use of existing computer programs in the construction and improvements is discussed. Contract documents are explained. The use of certain standard forms is suggested. This section concludes with an argument for investing time in scheduling and presenting a developmental history of scheduling techniques. The final section concludes that if proper effort results in the creation of adequate contract documents, the construction and follow-up work proceed most efficiently.

40|$|Graphics, {{whether they}} are {{visually}} appealing elements or simply scribbles {{on a sheet of}} paper, are important tools used by people to convey information. They are widely used in educational and daily life materials such as newspapers, text books, web pages, electronic books, metro maps, instruction manuals etc. When appropriate they provide many cognitive benefits over text. Graphics are also becoming more sophisticated with recent advances in information visualisation applications, and now often include dynamic content such as animations and elements that can interact with the users. Unfortunately, graphics are not easily accessed by visually impaired people, in partic- ular by blind people. There have been many different approaches to solve this problem by using tactile, tactile-audio, haptic and speech/non-speech audio techniques, however, these approaches have limitations such as use of expensive tactile graphics or expensive peripheral devices, and they may not provide similar cognitive benefits to visual graphics. The main contribution of this thesis is GraVVITAS (Graphics Viewer using Vibra- tion, Interactive Touch, Audio and Speech) which addresses these limitations and presents graphics to blind people in a way which: (i) can be used effectively to read accessible versions {{of a wide range of}} graphics while preserving the cognitive benefits of visual graphics, (ii) is practical in terms of cost and portability, and (iii) provides an interactive display which allows dynamic exploration of graphics. A user- centered and participatory design methodology is used to develop GraVVITAS. A usability evaluation is then performed to investigate the interaction model of the final system. In addition to GraVVITAS the thesis has the following contributions: (i) an evaluation of assistive technologies used for presenting graphics to blind people by using theoretical analyses which assess the usability of these technologies, and to what extent they provide the cognitive benefits of graphics, (ii) a formal usability study which examines tactile and tactile-audio bar <b>chart</b> <b>layouts</b> for improving their effectiveness and readability, (iii) authoring tools developed to create accessible graphics...|$|R
