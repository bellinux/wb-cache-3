5|$|The Court {{makes it}} a federal crime for one <b>lawful</b> gun owner to buy a gun for another <b>lawful</b> gun owner. Whether or not that is a {{sensible}} result, the statutes Congress enacted do not support itâ€”especially when, as is appropriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes {{in favor of the}} accused. I respectfully dissent.|$|E
5|$|It is not <b>lawful</b> to {{take the}} ball off the ground (except in touch) for any purpose whatever.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} in the case was whether Al-Kateb's continued detention was <b>lawful.</b> That {{question in}}volved several issues, namely whether {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act allow a person to be detained even if they have no prospect of being removed from Australia, and if they did, whether those provisions were then <b>lawful</b> under the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Whether Teo's detention, even if {{originally}} <b>lawful,</b> {{had been}} rendered unlawful by {{the conditions of}} her detention.|$|E
5|$|Whether the re-detention of the appellants was <b>lawful</b> {{under section}} 10 of the ISA.|$|E
5|$|However, even {{if any of}} {{the above}} {{situations}} applies to a person, he or she will not be regarded as having <b>lawful</b> authority if he or she has the item for the purpose of using it in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order.|$|E
5|$|The case also {{received}} negative treatment in subsequent Supreme Court cases, from Carroll v. United States in 1925, on arrests and vehicle searches, to Atwater v. City of Lago Vista in 2001, holding that an arrest without a warrant, {{even for a}} misdemeanor, is <b>lawful</b> when authorized by statute.|$|E
5|$|A {{crime is}} {{committed}} if any person posts or distributes a placard, circular or other document which contains an incitement to violence, counsels disobedience {{to the law}} or a <b>lawful</b> order, or is {{likely to lead to}} a breach of the peace. Spreading false reports or making false statements likely to cause public alarm orally, in writing, or in any newspaper, periodical, book, circular or other printed publication is also an offence.|$|E
5|$|According to the Earps' {{version of}} events, {{the fight was}} in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in {{violation}} of local ordinance, aggressively threatened the lawmen and defied a <b>lawful</b> order to hand over their weapons. The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offering no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps. Sorting out who {{was telling the truth}} was difficult and remains so.|$|E
5|$|After Philip's {{visit in}} 1557, Mary {{thought she was}} {{pregnant}} again, with a baby due in March 1558. She decreed in her will that her husband would be the regent during the minority of their child. However, no child was born, and Mary was forced to accept that Elizabeth was her <b>lawful</b> successor.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding an}} empty {{treasure}} in Antioch, Raymond-Roupen increased taxation, {{which made him}} unpopular among his subjects. He also refused to assist Leo against the Seljuqs. In 1217, Raymond-Roupen tried to capture Leo, but the Templars assisted Leo to flee to Cilicia. Bohemond visited John, King of Jerusalem, in Acre in autumn 1217. John recognized Bohemond as the <b>lawful</b> prince of Antioch early the next year, but did not provide him with military assistance.|$|E
5|$|After {{her husband}} fell into captivity, Constance {{announced}} her intention {{to administer the}} principality, but most Antiochene noblemen preferred a male ruler. BaldwinIII of Jerusalem hurried to Antioch and declared Constance's fifteen-year-old son, Bohemond III, the <b>lawful</b> prince, charging Patriarch Aimery with {{the administration of the}} principality. Constance did not accept Baldwin's decision and protested against it to Emperor Manuel.|$|E
5|$|After {{her second}} husband fell into captivity around 11601161, Constance wanted to rule Antioch alone, but BaldwinIII of Jerusalem {{declared}} her fifteen-year-old son, Bohemond III, the <b>lawful</b> prince. Constance disregarded this declaration and {{took control of the}} administration of the principality with the assistance of Emperor Manuel. Constance was dethroned in favor of her son shortly before her death.|$|E
5|$|All were NAACP-sponsored cases. The Davis case, {{the only}} {{case of the}} five {{originating}} from a student protest, began when 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns organized and led a 450-student walkout of Moton High School. The Gebhart case {{was the only one}} where a trial court, affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court, found that discrimination was unlawful; in all the other cases the plaintiffs had lost as the original courts had found discrimination to be <b>lawful.</b>|$|E
5|$|Article 9(2) of the Constitution enshrines {{the right}} of persons who have been {{detained}} {{to apply to the}} High Court challenging the legality of their detention. The application is for an order for review of detention, which was formerly called a writ of habeas corpus. The Court is required to inquire into the complaint, and order the detainee to be produced before the Court and released unless it is satisfied that the detention is <b>lawful.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Romulus was {{an alleged}} usurper, Julius Nepos claimed to hold legally {{the title of}} the emperor when Odoacer took power. However, few of Nepos' contemporaries were willing to support his cause after he ran away to Dalmatia. Some historians regard Julius Nepos, who ruled in Dalmatia until being murdered in 480, as the last <b>lawful</b> Western Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|At {{both state}} and federal realms in Australia, assent is used as the means of {{enforcing}} a referendum that is required. This is done by providing {{that it will not}} be <b>lawful</b> to even submit the law for viceregal assent unless and until it has been approved by the required percentage of the voting populace at a referendum.|$|E
5|$|Dawson {{remained}} relatively <b>lawful,</b> {{protected by the}} Canadian NWMP, which meant that gambling and prostitution were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low. By contrast, especially the port of Skagway under US jurisdiction in Southeast Alaska became infamous for its criminal underworld. The extreme climate and remoteness of the region in general meant that supplies and communication {{with the outside world}} including news and mail were scarce.|$|E
5|$|If King Wyandank Pharaoh of the Montauk Tribe of Indians had {{not given}} for $10 the living members of the Montauk tribe might now be wealthy, instead of being poor and {{fighting}} for their rights with a desperate hope of regaining {{at least part of}} what they claim to be their <b>lawful</b> heritage.|$|E
5|$|On , Britain and France officially {{recognized}} Venizelos {{government as}} the only <b>lawful</b> government of Greece, effectively splitting the country. On , Venizelos' government officially declared war on the Central Powers. A royal warrant for the arrest of Venizelos was immediately issued and the Archbishop of Athens, pressured by the royal house, anathematised the prime minister.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences {{under section}} 1, where the destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as arson. It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} <b>lawful</b> excuse defence in relation to arson, as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this, he had a <b>lawful</b> excuse within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E
5|$|Section 2.5: Standards of Conduct for the Armed Forces of Liberia: Members of the AFL shall {{perform their}} duties {{at all times}} in {{accordance}} with democratic values and human rights. They shall perform their duties in a non-partisan manner, obey all <b>lawful</b> orders and commands from their superior officers in ways that command citizen respect and confidence and contribute towards the maintenance and promotion of the respect {{for the rule of}} law.|$|E
5|$|Since {{an order}} for review of {{detention}} is a remedy for establishing the legality of detention, {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is <b>lawful.</b> Moreover, an order can only be sought where a person is being physically detained, and not {{if he or she is}} merely under some other form of restriction such as being out on bail.|$|E
5|$|Stephanie died {{shortly after}} John's arrival. Contemporary sources accused John of causing her sudden death, {{claiming}} that he severely beat her when he heard that she tried to poison his daughter Isabella. Their only son died a few weeks later, ending John's claim to Cilicia. Soon after Pope Honorius learned about the deaths of Stephanie and her son, he declared Raymond-Roupen the <b>lawful</b> ruler of Cilicia and threatened John with excommunication if he fought for his late wife's inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The above {{passage from}} Mahabharata emphasises the {{cardinal}} importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa {{is the highest}} virtue, Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching. Some other examples where the phrase Ahimsa Paramo Dharma are discussed include Adi Parva, Vana Parva and Anushasana Parva. The Bhagavad Gita, among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of <b>lawful</b> violence in self-defence and the theories of just war. However, {{there is no consensus}} on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and <b>lawful</b> violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.|$|E
5|$|The case of Jaggard v. Dickinson (1980) {{held that}} even a drunken belief will support the defence even though this allows {{drunkenness}} to negate basic intent; and Lloyd v. DPP (1992) ruled that a motorist who damages a wheel clamp to free his car, having parked on another's property knowing {{of the risk of}} being clamped, does not have a <b>lawful</b> excuse under the Act even if he makes a mistake of law.|$|E
5|$|The {{killing of}} another person must be unlawful. Some defences are {{therefore}} open to the defendant, among them self-defence. Carrying a <b>lawful</b> activity, for example, a fully qualified doctor carrying out an abortion in the required circumstances, could not result in an unlawful homicide even if the child was born alive. Consent might be relevant to some forms of homicide, but not to murder.|$|E
5|$|After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with {{a report}} of his success, along with {{questions}} about the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; {{this section of the}} History is usually known as the Libellus responsionum. Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was <b>lawful</b> for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite detention of a stateless person was <b>lawful.</b> The case concerned Ahmed Al-Kateb, a Palestinian man born in Kuwait, who moved to Australia in 2000 and applied for a temporary protection visa. The Commonwealth Minister for Immigration's decision to refuse the application was upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza. However, since no country would accept Al-Kateb, he was declared stateless and detained under the policy of mandatory detention.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Fremantle Prison {{came under}} local control in 1886, a {{refractory}} block with gallows was planned. It {{was completed in}} 1888, and first used in 1889 to execute a convicted murderer, Jimmy Long, a Malayan. The gallows room was the only <b>lawful</b> place of execution in Western Australia between 1888 and 1984. At least 43 men and one woman were hanged in this period. Martha Rendell {{was the only woman}} to be hanged at the prison, in 1909. The last person to be hanged was serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke, executed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin IV died {{in early}} 1185. His successor, the child BaldwinV died {{in late summer}} 1186. The High Court of Jerusalem had ruled that neither BaldwinV's mother, Sybilla (who was Guy of Lusignan's wife), nor her sister, Isabella (who was the wife of Raynald's stepson), could be crowned without the {{decision}} of the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the kings of France and England about BaldwinV's <b>lawful</b> successor. However, Sybilla's uncle, JoscelinIII of Courtenay, took control of Jerusalem with the support of Raynald and other influential prelates and royal officials. Raynald urged the townspeople to accept Sybilla as the <b>lawful</b> monarch, according to the Estoire de Eracles. The bailli, RaymondIII of Tripoli, and his supporters tried to prevent her coronation and reminded her partisans of {{the decision of the}} High Court. Ignoring their protest, Raynald and Gerard of Ridefort, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, accompanied Sybilla to the Holy Sepulchre, where she was crowned. She also arranged the coronation of her husband, although he was unpopular even among her supporters. Her opponents tried to persuade Raynald's stepson, Humphrey, to claim the crown on his wife's behalf, but Humphrey deserted them and swore fealty to Sybilla and Guy. Raynald headed the list of secular witnesses in four royal charters issued between 21October 1186 and 7March 1187, showing that he had become a principal figure in the new king's court.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond of Tripoli {{regarded}} himself his father's <b>lawful</b> heir, {{because he}} was Bohemond's elder surviving son. He came to Antioch {{at the end of}} 1198 and persuaded the commune to accept his rule. Before long, the younger Bohemond returned to Tripoli, enabling his father to re-take control of state affairs, suggesting that the elder Bohemond had tacitly supported his son's coup. LeoI of Cilicia appealed to the Holy See to protect Raymond-Roupen's interest, but the Knights Templar submitted a complaint against him for refusing to restore Bagras to them.|$|E
5|$|Constance who {{was born}} in 1128 was the only child of Prince Bohemond II of Antioch and Alice, the second {{daughter}} of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Bohemond was killed in a battle at the Ceyhan River in February 1130. After his death, Alice assumed the regency for Constance. According to rumors spreading in Antioch, Alice was planning to send Constance to a monastery or to marry her off to a commoner. Bohemond's cousin, Roger II of Sicily, regarded himself as Bohemond's <b>lawful</b> successor because he was the senior member of the House of Hauteville.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} form of {{judicial}} review available under the ISA, whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs. This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes? â€“ who guards the guardians? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately {{in a manner that}} cripples <b>lawful</b> democratic opposition, the absence of judicial review would preclude the exposure of such abuse. It has been submitted that the voice of public opinion is most suited for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Triumph International {{came under}} fire after a female {{president}} of a local union was dismissed in Thailand. She had appeared on a Thai evening television program with a T-shirt on which a political statement could be seen. The company's management had {{the view that the}} appearance had harmed their public image and therefore laid off the staff member in question. The international work council of the company, Triumph International Labor Union, protested and collected 2,500 signatures to petition for the rehiring of the union president, supported in solidarity in Germany, inter alia, by the ver.di youth. In November 2008, the Labor Court in Bangkok found the lay-off to have been <b>lawful.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that the Court {{rejected}} the argument that Pedra Branca was terra nullius in 1847, Singapore contended that the selection of Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and the construction of the lighthouse between 1847 and 1851 constituted a taking of possession of the island Ã  titre de souverain (with the title of a sovereign). The British Crown obtained title over the island in accordance with legal principles governing the acquisition of territory at that time. This title was maintained by the United Kingdom and its <b>lawful</b> successor, the Republic of Singapore.|$|E
