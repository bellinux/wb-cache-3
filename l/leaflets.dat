5|$|The {{declaration}} {{represented the}} first public support for Zionism by a major political power – its publication galvanized Zionism, which finally had obtained an official charter. In addition to its publication in major newspapers, <b>leaflets</b> were circulated throughout Jewish communities. These <b>leaflets</b> were airdropped over Jewish communities in Germany and Austria, {{as well as the}} Pale of Settlement, which had been given to the Central Powers following the Russian withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|XXIBomber Command also {{conducted}} an intensive propaganda campaign alongside its firebombing raids. It {{has been estimated}} that B-29s dropped 10 million propaganda <b>leaflets</b> in May, 20 million in June and 30 million in July. The Japanese government implemented harsh penalties against civilians who kept copies of these <b>leaflets.</b> On the night of 27/28July, six B-29s dropped <b>leaflets</b> over 11 Japanese cities warning that they would be attacked in the future; this was intended to lower the morale of Japanese civilians and convince them that the United States was seeking to minimize civilian casualties. Six of these cities (Aomori, Ichinomiya, Tsu, Uji-Yamada Ōgaki and Uwajima) were attacked on 28July. No B-29s were lost in the raids on these cities, though six were damaged by attacks from between 40 and 50 fighters and another five were hit by anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
40|$|Genes {{that affect}} plant form and {{function}} {{may be used to}} enhance the yield of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ]. Most soybean cultivars have broad (ovate) leaf-lets. A single gene, ln, controls inheritance for the narrow <b>leaflet</b> characteristic. Narrow <b>leaflet</b> cultivars (ln/ln) also tend to have a higher percentage of four-seeded pods than ovate (Ln/Ln) <b>leaflet</b> cultivars. Heterozygous (Ln/ln) plants have a <b>leaflet</b> shape intermediate between narrow and ovate. Determining the agronomic effects of the narrow <b>leaflet</b> allele (ln) in the heterozygous (Ln/ln) condition in soybean may have applications in practical plant breeding. We studied an ovate <b>leaflet</b> and a narrow <b>leaflet</b> cultivar, crosses between them in the F 1 and F 2, and backcrosses to both cultivars. The ratio of <b>leaflet</b> width to <b>leaflet</b> length accurately distinguished among narrow, ovate, and intermediate <b>leaflet</b> plants in the F 2 and backcross gen-erations. In the F 2 generation, differences occurred among plants with different <b>leaflet</b> morphology.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{results of}} mitral valve repair for {{anterior}} <b>leaflet</b> prolapse {{have been less}} gratifying than those reported for posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse. We compared the long-term durability of 2 different surgical techniques: the edge-to-edge repair, which {{is used for the}} treatment of anterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse, and quadrangular resection, which has been adopted for correction of posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse. MethodsFrom 1991 through April 2004, 133 patients with anterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse and 605 with posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse caused by degenerative mitral disease underwent valve repair. The edge-to-edge repair was used for correction of anterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse, and quadrangular resection of the posterior <b>leaflet,</b> with or without sliding plasty, was used for correction of posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse. All patients received a concomitant annuloplasty procedure. ResultsNo hospital deaths occurred in the anterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse group, whereas 2 (0. 3 %) patients died in the posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse group (P =. 7). Follow-up was 100 % and 97. 2 % complete in the anterior and posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse groups, respectively. At 10 years, overall survival was 91 % ± 4. 06 % for anterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse and 93. 5 % ± 1. 81 % for posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse (P =. 18), and freedom from cardiac death was 95. 8 % ± 2. 83 % for anterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse and 97. 4 % ± 0. 95 % posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse (P =. 27). Freedom from reoperation was 96 % ± 2. 3 % in the anterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse group and 96. 5 % ± 1. 18 % in the posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse group (P =. 37). At follow-up (mean, 4. 5 ± 3. 12 years; range, 1 month- 13. 2 years), New York Heart Association functional class I or II was documented in 93. 2 % of patients in the anterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse group and 92. 8 % in the posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse group (P =. 98). ConclusionsThe long-term results of the edge-to-edge repair in the setting of anterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse are similar to those obtained with quadrangular resection for the treatment of posterior <b>leaflet</b> prolapse...|$|R

Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than downwards, and <b>leaflets</b> having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E

5|$|It is {{the palms}} {{that are the}} {{signature}} plants of the island as the kentia and curly palms especially dominate the landscape in many places, the kentia being of special economic importance. All four species are endemic to the island, often occurring in dense pure stands, {{the one that has}} proved such a worldwide success as an indoor plant being the kentia or thatch palm (Howea forsteriana). This is a lowland palm with drooping <b>leaflets</b> and seed branches in 'hands' of 3–5 while the curly palm (Howea belmoreana), which occurs on slightly higher ground, has upwardly directed <b>leaflets</b> and solitary 'hands'. Natural hybrids between these species occur on the island and there is a mature specimen of one growing in the island nursery. On the mountain sides higher than about 350 m there is the big mountain palm (Hedyscepe canterburyana); it has large golf-ball-sized fruits while the little mountain palm (Lepidorrhachis mooreana) has marble-sized fruits and is only found on the mountain summits.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{assess the}} effects of annuloplasty rings on {{anterior}} mitral <b>leaflet</b> dimensions. MethodsSixteen radiopaque markers were sutured evenly spaced {{over the surface of}} the anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> in 57 sheep. The following rings were implanted in a releasable fashion: size 28 -mm Cosgrove-Edwards band (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif) (n =  11), rigid saddle-shaped annuloplasty ring (St Jude Medical Inc, St Paul, Minn) (n =  12), Carpentier-Edwards Physio (Edwards Lifesciences) (n =  12), IMR-ETlogix (Edwards Lifesciences) (n =  10), and GeoForm (Edwards Lifesciences) (n =  12). Under acute open chest conditions, 4 -dimensional marker coordinates were measured using biplane videofluoroscopy with the annuloplasty ring inserted and after annuloplasty ring release. Septal-lateral and commissure-commissure dimensions were calculated from opposing marker pairs on the septal-lateral and commissure-commissure aspect of the anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> at end diastole and end systole. To assess changes in anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> shape, a “planarity index” was assessed by calculating the root mean square values as distances of the 16 anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> markers to a best fit anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> plane at end systole. ResultsAt end diastole, anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> septal-lateral and commissure-commissure dimensions did not change with the Cosgrove ring compared with control, whereas the rigid saddle-shaped annuloplasty ring and Physio, IMR-ETlogix, and GeoForm rings reduced anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> commissure-commissure but not septal-lateral anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> dimensions. At end systole, the septal-lateral anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> dimension was smaller with the IMR-ETlogix and GeoForm rings, but did not change with the Cosgrove ring, rigid saddle-shaped annuloplasty ring, and Physio ring. Anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> shape was unchanged in all 5 groups. ConclusionWith no changes in anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> planarity, the 4 complete, rigid rings (rigid saddle-shaped annuloplasty ring, Physio, IMR-ETlogix, and GeoForm) reduced the anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> commissure-commissure dimension at end diastole. The IMR-ETlogix and GeoForm rings decreased the septal-lateral anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> dimension at end systole, probably as the result of inherent disproportionate downsizing. These changes in anterior mitral <b>leaflet</b> geometry could perturb the stress patterns, which in theory may affect repair durability...|$|R
