2500|$|Virginia's {{claim was}} for a wedge from their coastal area {{all the way to}} the Pacific Ocean. Pennsylvania's was for 5 degrees of <b>longitude</b> <b>west</b> of the Delaware River. By the 1770s it was obvious that the two claims overlapped, in the area that in 1773 had been {{designated}} by Pennsylvania as Westmoreland County, because settlers were moving into the area from both directions. Both claims included the entire southwestern corner of what is now Pennsylvania, west of the Laurel Ridge (Allegheny Mountains) and south of the Kiskiminetas, Allegheny and Ohio rivers. The major prize location was the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, forming the Ohio River, at the location of Fort Pitt, now the city of Pittsburgh. The disputes over which colony had authority over the area led to overlapping land grants to settlers and battles between Virginians and Pennsylvanians in the period 1774–1775. In 1774, a Virginian militia group even attacked and captured the Westmoreland County seat at Hannastown and arrested three Westmoreland County justices who refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of Virginia.|$|E
