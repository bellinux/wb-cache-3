5000|$|Several sociolinguists {{question}} {{the validity of}} making generalizations about a group as large as [...] "women," [...] which makes up roughly half {{the population of the}} world. Penelope Eckert argues instead that women are not using prestige forms to declare {{whether or not they are}} women. A single <b>linguistic</b> <b>variable</b> can be indexical of multiple traits and women (and men) can belong to multiple social groups, each with their own linguistic traits. Language variations are chosen by their third order indexical qualities on a personal, rather than gender-wide level, reflected in the fact that no two women's speech is exactly alike. These findings challenge the idea that women's use of prestige forms is not necessarily something inherent in their biology, but could also be an external, third-order indexical quality more highly valued among women than men.|$|E

50|$|The {{sociolinguistics}} of sign languages is {{the application}} of sociolinguistic principles {{to the study of}} sign languages. It focuses on the study of the relationship between social variables and linguistic variables and their effect on sign languages. The social variables external from language include age, region, social class, ethnicity, and sex. External factors are social by nature and may correlate with the behavior of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>variable.</b> The choices made of internal linguistic variant forms are systematically constrained by a range of factors at both the linguistic and the social levels. The internal variables are linguistic in nature: a sound, a handshape, and a syntactic structure. What makes the sociolinguistics of sign language different from the sociolinguistics of spoken languages is that sign languages have several variables both internal and external to the language that are unique to the Deaf community. Such variables include the audiological status of a signer’s parents, age of acquisition, and educational background (home acquisition or residence schools). There exist perceptions of socioeconomic status and variation of “grassroots” deaf people and middle-class deaf professionals, but this has not been studied in a systematic way. “The sociolinguistic reality of these perceptions has yet to be explored”. Many variations in dialects correspond or reflect the values of particular identities of a community.|$|E
5000|$|Penny Eckert's {{characterization}} of style {{as related to}} indexicality {{marked the beginning of}} a new approach to linguistic style. She builds on Michael Silverstein's notion of indexical order: the notion that linguistic variables index a social group, which by association leads to the indexing of certain traits stereotypically associated with members of that group. For example, in New York in the 1960s, a study by Labov showed that the clear articulation of postvocalic r in words like [...] "fourth" [...] and [...] "floor" [...] indexed a higher class (in New York), whereas the absence of postvocalic r indexed a lower class. However, the presence of lack of postvocalic r can also function as a higher order indexical that points indirectly to traits stereotypically associated with members of the upper or lower class. In this way, not articulating the r in the word [...] "fourth" [...] could index, for example, a lack of education (the trait) in addition to a lower social class (the group). According to this theory, any <b>linguistic</b> <b>variable</b> has its own indexical field spanning any number of potential meanings; the meanings actually associated with the variable are determined by social context and the style in which the variable is being used. These indexical fields are fluid and often change depending on their usage in different contexts or in combination with other variables. This view of style revolves around variation, and interpretation of variation as a purely indexical system built from ideological connections.|$|E
