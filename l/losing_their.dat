40|$|Although {{private equity}} firms are often criticized for layoffs, little {{evidence}} exists regarding which employees <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs and why.

We show that workers in less productive firms who perform routine or offshorable job tasks {{are more likely to}} <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs. The opposite trend holds for workers who perform non-routine or non-offshorable job tasks. Moreover, workers who belong to aggressive labor unions are more likely to <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs...|$|R
