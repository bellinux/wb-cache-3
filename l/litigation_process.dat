5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the <b>litigation</b> <b>process</b> and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive.

500|$|Two Howard University seniors filed {{a lawsuit}} against Alpha Kappa Alpha Incorporated in 2013. [...] The women accused the {{sorority}} of barring them from membership through the most prestigious chapter of the sorority, Alpha Chapter, despite being [...] "legacies" [...] (their mothers are Alpha Chapter initiates) and in retaliation for exposing illegal hazing. The mothers initially had their AKA memberships revoked for supporting their daughters in the <b>litigation</b> <b>process</b> against the sorority, months later a judge reinstated their memberships citing that it was illegal for AKA to revoke their paid memberships for simply filing a lawsuit against their own sorority. [...] In the lawsuit, the two students stated as prospective members of the Alpha Chapter they were verbally abused by women of the sorority, could not wear sorority colors or any colors that could be blended into pink or green, they could not wear pearls, they were forced to run errands and buy items for sorority members, [...] they could not publicly socialize with their non-AKA affiliated friends, they were often humiliated in front of other students, they could not eat at a popular lunch spot on campus, they could not use the same doors as sorority members, and at one point they had to call their designated [...] "big sisters" [...] daily or suffer some type of consequence.

40|$|Extract:The Rule of Law {{requires}} {{fair and}} just resolution of disputes. However {{it also requires}} that the process, particularly in relation to civil disputes, be cost effective. The primary goal of a civil justice system is the just resolution of disputes through a fair but swift process at a reasonable expense. Delay and excessive expense will negate {{the value of an}} otherwise just resolution. Systemic delay and expense will render the system inaccessible. The public must have confidence in not only the outcomes, but in the <b>processes</b> of that <b>litigation.</b> For that reason our <b>litigation</b> <b>processes</b> must be reviewed continuously and refined as necessary...|$|R

2500|$|The first legal {{proceeding}} taken {{on behalf of}} Vietnamese victims was undertaken in January 2004 in a New York district court. Ultimately the district court held that [...] "herbicide spraying [...] [...] [...] did not constitute a war crime pre-1975" [...] and that international law prevented the companies that produced Agent Orange from being liable. Alternative models for reconciling the harms done by the dioxin on the Vietnamese people with reparations have also been proposed. Some have called for the defoliation and destruction to be deemed an [...] "environmental war crime". [...] Law reviews have even called for a revision to the <b>litigation</b> <b>process</b> in the US due to the harmful implications regarding justice, reparations, and accountability {{as a result of}} the political sway of aggregate private interests.|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} of India also was faulted since no clear guidelines were laid down to determine compensation {{to the victims}} resulting in undue delays and aggravation of their health status and/or economic survival. The secrecy surrounding the health studies undertaken by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) may initially have been instituted to protect the <b>litigation</b> <b>process,</b> but in reality made the rational medical treatment and establishment of claims almost impossible. In hindsight, {{it is clear that}} the secrecy served no purpose whatsoever and has resulted in non-publication of the information. [...] Moreover, because of the secrecy about the accident itself and the chemicals released, it was difficult for the survivors to document their claims. The Commission also noted an excessive fear among government personnel of bogus claims.|$|E

40|$|Central to Government’s {{strategy}} for separating families is {{the management and}} resolution of disputes away from courts and <b>litigation</b> <b>processes</b> wherever this is achievable. A key group of players in facilitating this vision are workers within {{the wide range of}} women’s services. This study surveyed workers at a number of Victorian women’s services that provide advice, support, and referral for women and explored their understanding of mediation processes and outcomes. The results indicate that, while generally supportive of mediation as a process that could assist their clients, workers were concerned about its appropriateness when family violence was an issue. Some of these concerns appeared to be based upon a good understanding of the limitations of mediation practices, but it is also apparent that some concerns were influenced by a misunderstanding and limited knowledge of contemporary mediation practice. It is recommended that family mediation services work proactively with women’s services in order to better inform each other of the possibilities and constraints in working with postseparation disputes...|$|R
2500|$|Not {{surprisingly}} {{many cases}} go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company {{policy is the}} first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita HR Manager at Icelerate Technologies, [...] "We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office," [...] thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing [...] " [...] woman's purity," [...] the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with [...] "loose morals". Women would rather brush away the problem or leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, [...] "I do not have exact statistics but from my experience as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported." [...] The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged <b>litigation</b> <b>process</b> for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan [...] "It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and {{there is no guarantee that}} the ruling would be in favour of the victim.

2500|$|Barnes v. Train (1974) is {{commonly}} {{viewed as the}} first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term [...] "sexual harassment" [...] was not used. The term [...] "sexual harassment" [...] was coined and popularized by Lin Farley in 1975, based on a pattern she recognized during a 1974 Cornell University class she taught on women and work. In 1976, Williams v. Saxbe established sexual harassment {{as a form of}} sex discrimination when sexual advances by a male supervisor towards a female employee, if proven, would be deemed an artificial barrier to employment placed before one gender and not another. In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1986 case of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, the Supreme Court first recognized [...] "sexual harassment" [...] as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer liability, and that speech or conduct in itself can create a [...] "hostile environment". The Civil Rights Act of 1991 added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive damages for sexual discrimination or harassment, and the case of Ellison v. Brady resulted in rejecting the reasonable person standard in favor of the [...] "reasonable woman standard" [...] which allowed for cases to be analyzed {{from the perspective of the}} complainant and not the defendant. Also in 1991, Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co. became the first sexual harassment case to be given class action status paving the way for others. Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the [...] "discovery" [...] process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the <b>litigation</b> <b>process</b> to be included in assessing damages awards. In the same year, the courts concluded in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida, and Burlington v. Ellerth, that employers are liable for harassment by their employees. Moreover, Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of [...] "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.|$|E

40|$|The role {{of family}} lawyers in non-adversarial {{processes}} such as mediation and conciliation {{is quite different from}} that in adversarial <b>litigation</b> <b>processes.</b> This article conceptualises the non-adversarial role that family lawyers can play in mediation and conciliation processes to assist their clients to reach resolution of their disputes. We will highlight how this non-adversarial role will differ depending on whether the process is a facilitative or advisory process. In facilitative processes mediators merely assist with the communication process and do not suggest options or give views about appropriate settlement outcomes. In advisory processes mediators or conciliators use the benefit of their legal expertise to express views about suitable settlement outcomes, often suggesting a range of outcomes within which courts will be likely to make orders. We term this range the 'boundaries of resolution' and explain the key role of family lawyers to assist in this range being determined accurately by thorough preparation of their clients and cases...|$|R

40|$|The New Economy {{is closely}} {{associated}} with computing & communications technology, notably the Internet. We discuss property rights to, and trade in, the difficult-to-define intangible assets increasingly dominating the New Economy, {{and the possibility of}} under-investment in these assets. For a realistic analysis we introduce a Schumpeterian market environment (the experimentally organized economy). Weak property rights prevail when the rights to access, use, and trade in intangible assets cannot be fully exercised. The trade-off between the benefits of open access on the Internet, and the incentive effects of strengthened property rights, depend both on the particular strategy a firm employs to secure property rights, and the protection offered by law. Economic property rights can be strengthened if the originator can find innovative ways to charge for the intangible assets. The extreme complexity of the New Economy and the large number of possible innovative private contract arrangements make it more important to facilitate the use and enforcement of private individualized contracts to protect intellectual property than to rely only on standard mandatory patent and copyright law. Enabling law is one proposed solution. Current patent legislation in the US has led to costly <b>litigation</b> <b>processes</b> weakening the position of small firms and individuals in patent disputes.

40|$|Clinical {{neuroscience}} {{has made}} tremendous advances {{over the last}} century. Neurology as a discipline is still considered challenging and at times risky due to the natural history and progressive course of few of the neurological diseases. Encouragingly, the patient and their caregivers are now increasingly willing {{to be actively involved}} in making decisions. The patients' relationship with the doctor {{is a reflection of the}} society. A society that is orienting itself toward “rating” and “feedback” has made this doctor–patient relationship, a consumer–service provider relationship. This perhaps is due to commercialization of health that usually accompanies globalization. Moreover, a rapid influx of information from potential erroneous sources such as the Internet has also made patient and caregivers not being hesitant to taking legal course in the case of adverse events during treatment or simply because of dissatisfaction. The purpose of the legal process initiated by patients with neurological ailments is more often to compensate for the income lost, physical and psychological anguish that accompanies disease and its treatment, and to fund treatment or rehabilitation requirements. However, it is not clearly established if monetary benefits acquired lead to better opportunities for recovery of the patient. The consumer protection act and commercialization of medical services may well have an adverse effect on the doctor and patient relationship. Hence, there is a great need for all medical professionals to mutually complement and update each other.
