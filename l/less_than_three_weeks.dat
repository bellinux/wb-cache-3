5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus.

This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates.

Methods The medical terminology systems were collected in electronic format in both English and Swedish and the rubrics were extracted in parallel language pairs. Initially, interactive word alignment was used to create training data from a sample. Then the training data were utilised in automatic word alignment in order to generate candidate term pairs. The last step was manual verification of the term pair candidates.

In the next match against Hampshire, Brown opened with Barnes and made a duck as Australia were dismissed for 117 on a damp pitch in reply to the home side's 195. It {{was the first time}} the tourists had conceded a first innings during the summer. Hampshire were subsequently bowled out in their second innings for 103 to leave Australia a target of 182. This time Barnes fell for a duck, and Brown anchored Australia to an eight-wicket win with an unbeaten 81 after a century second-wicket partnership with Ian Johnson. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex. Opening with Morris, Brown played second fiddle, accumulating 44 as the pair put on an opening stand of 153. Morris went on to 184 and Australia declared at 5/549 before completing another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|In any case, Brown {{had done}} enough to be chosen to tour England with the Invincibles in 1948, {{although}} Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination. Brown made a strong start in the tour matches preceding the Tests. In the fifth fixture, which was against Cambridge University, Brown top-scored with 200 in an innings victory. In the following match against Essex, Brown combined with Bradman in a second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes, ending with 153 as Australia scored a world-record 721 runs in one day. Australia proceeded to another innings victory, and Brown completed his third century in as many innings with 108 against Oxford University.

The monitors were not initially engaged, but Chickasaw managed to assume a position by the Tennessees stern and fired repeatedly at point-blank range.

40|$|Abstract Background Reported {{associations}} between preparing and eating home cooked food, and both diet and health, are inconsistent. Most {{previous research has}} focused on preparing, rather than eating, home cooked food; used small, non-population based samples; and studied markers of nutrient intake, rather than overall diet quality or health. We aimed to assess whether frequency of consuming home cooked meals was cross-sectionally associated with diet quality and cardio-metabolic health. Methods We used baseline data from a United Kingdom population-based cohort study of adults aged 29 to 64  years (n =  11, 396). Participants self-reported frequency of consuming home cooked main meals. Diet quality was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, fruit and vegetable intake calculated from a 130 -item food frequency questionnaire, and plasma vitamin C. Markers of cardio-metabolic health were researcher-measured body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), cholesterol and hypertension. Differences across the three exposure categories were assessed using linear regression (diet variables) and logistic regression (health variables). Results Eating home cooked meals more frequently was associated with greater adherence to DASH and Mediterranean diets, greater fruit and vegetable intakes and higher plasma vitamin C, in adjusted models. Those eating home cooked meals more than five times, compared with <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> times per <b>week,</b> consumed 62. 3  g more fruit (99 % CI 43. 2 to 81. 5) and 97. 8  g more vegetables (99 % CI 84. 4 to 111. 2) daily. More frequent consumption of home cooked meals was associated with greater likelihood of having normal range BMI and normal percentage body fat. Associations with HbA 1 c, cholesterol and hypertension were not significant in adjusted models. Those consuming home cooked meals more than five times, compared with <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> times per <b>week,</b> were 28 % less likely to have overweight BMI (99 % CI 8 to 43 %), and 24 % less likely to have excess percentage body fat (99 % CI 5 to 40 %).

5|$|The latter {{soon began}} {{to come to a}} head. Austria had {{solidified}} its control over Lombardy-Venice and extended its protection to provinces nominally under the control of Francis' daughter Marie Louise. On 18 April Metternich announced that Austria was formally at war with Murat's Naples. Austria won the Battle of Tolentino on 3 May and captured Naples <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> later.

Discussions about Germany would drag on until early June, when a joint Austrian-Prussian proposition was ratified. It left most constitutional issues to the new diet; its President would be the Emperor Francis himself. Despite criticism from within Austria, Metternich was pleased with the outcome and the degree of control it granted Habsburgs, and, through them, himself. Certainly, Metternich was able to use the diet to his own ends on numerous occasions. The arrangement was similarly popular with most German representatives. A summation treaty was signed on 19 June (the Russians signed a week later), bringing the Vienna Congress officially to an end.

40|$|Background: Population-based {{studies on}} the {{prevalence}} of encopresis in children are scarce and generally outdated. Prevalence estimates based on clinical studies are unreliable because parents tend to be reticent to seek medical help for this problem. Professional help is necessary, however, because encopresis can lead to serious psychosocial health problems. The authors examined the prevalence of encopresis in children, the frequency of visits made to general practitioners for encopresis and the psychosocial health problems of encopretic children. Methods: This population-based study involved 13, 111 parents and their 5 - to 6 -year-old children and 9, 780 parents and their 11 - to 12 -year-old children. all residents of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Results: The prevalence of encopresis was 4. 1 % in the 5 -to- 6 age group and 1. 6 % in the 11 -to- 12 age group. Encopresis was more frequent among boys and children from the very depressed areas of the city. Encopresis was less frequent among Moroccan and Turkish children. A defecation frequency of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> per <b>week</b> was found in 3. 8 % of the 5 - to 6 -year-olds and 10. 1 % of the 11 - to 12 -year-olds with encopresis.
