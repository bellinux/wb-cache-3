5|$|Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, {{was given}} a <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, {{occupied}} the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the fermentation process, and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the depression of the 1920s; by 1938, {{the great majority of}} the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised.|$|E
5|$|A descendent of John de Charlton, {{the first}} Sir Thomas de Charlton, died in 1448 whereupon Swakeleys passed to his son, also named Sir Thomas, who became Speaker of the House of Commons and Member of Parliament for Middlesex. He died in 1465, {{at which point}} his son Sir Richard became owner of the manor. Sir Richard was killed {{fighting}} {{on the side of}} Richard III during the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. The victor of the battle, Henry VII, named him in his Act of Attainder, though he granted Sir Richard's wife Elizabeth a <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> in the manor. However, Sir Thomas Bourchier was subsequently granted the manor of Swakeleys and Covelhall (Cowley). Upon Sir Thomas' death in 1510, the manor passed to Sir John Peeche as his executor. Sir John had no children, so Swakeleys passed to the Earl of Devon, Henry Courteney in 1521. The Earl granted a licence to control Swakeleys to Sir William Fitzwilliam in 1531, who was acting as trustee for Ralph Pexall.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, a {{protective}} trust is a <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> that terminates upon the happening of a specified event; {{such as the}} bankruptcy of the beneficiary, or any attempt by an individual to dispose {{of his or her}} interest. They have become comparatively rare.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the rules}} for {{distribution}} of estates without a will (the Intestacy Rules), where a child under 18 would inherit or a <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> would arise, the Court or District Probate Registry would normally appoint {{a minimum of two}} administrators. On some estates, even under an intestate, it is not clear who are the next-of-kin, and probate research may be required to find the entitled beneficiaries.|$|E
25|$|An inheritance, {{but not a}} gift, {{taken by}} a parent {{from his or her}} child is treated as group A, where it is an {{immediate}} interest (but not a <b>life</b> <b>interest)</b> in property.

40|$|AbstractMany talented {{professionals}} {{leave their}} organizations because managers {{fail to understand}} the psychology behind work satisfaction. To ensure that, in today's global scenario, employees stay in the organization and perform at peak levels, managers need to adopt a game changing strategy. Butler. T and Waldroop. J, in their article published in the Harvard Business Review, September/October, 1999 have introduced the concept of Job Sculpting i. e. matching jobs to deeply embedded <b>life</b> <b>interests.</b> Deeply embedded <b>life</b> <b>interests</b> are positively correlated to individual life motivators. Motivation induces employees to take certain actions or behave in a certain way. Motivation drives a person towards a desired goal. Individual motivators can be classified into status, power, monetary rewards, autonomy, and search for meaning, security, affiliation, achievement, and creativity. The researchers have developed a model based on the interviews of 300 employees across various job designations within 25 organizations in India in 2011, to identify the presence or otherwise of these motivators in individuals and to measure the relative importance assigned to each motivator on a subjective basis by each individual. Subsequently, the researchers have studied job satisfaction {{as a product of}} congruence between motivators, <b>life</b> <b>interests,</b> job expectations and actual job description. This model can be used by Managers in developing a game changing strategy to map the innate <b>life</b> <b>interests</b> to the job profile of each employee in the organization resulting in a sculpted job description that will greatly enhance employee productivity, reduce attrition, and help in attainment of overall organizational objectives...|$|R

25|$|The modern ETH— specifically, the {{implicit}} linking of unidentified aircraft and {{lights in the}} sky to alien life— took root during the late 1940s and took its current form during the 1950s.

25|$|In {{all these}} cases, the father might dower her. If he did not, on his death the {{brothers}} were obligated to do so, {{giving her a}} full child's share if a wife, a concubine or a vestal, but one-third of a child's share {{if she were a}} hierodule or a Marduk priestess. The latter had the privilege of exemption from state dues and absolute disposal of her property. All other daughters had only a <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> in their dowry, which reverted to their family if childless or went to their children if they had any. A father might, however, execute a deed granting a daughter power to leave her property to a favorite brother or sister.|$|E
25|$|In April 1874, Robert E. and Mary Lee's eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, petitioned Congress {{for payment}} for the Arlington estate. Lee argued that tax sale of the entire {{property}} (rather than just that portion needed to pay the tax debt) amounted to confiscation and was unconstitutional. He also argued that the tax collectors' refusal to accept payment made the proceedings null and void. Finally, he asserted {{that the federal government}} should only be able to secure a <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> in the property (in other words, seize it only as long as Mary Lee lived) and could not assert title to the estate without the consent of the state of Virginia. He offered not to litigate the seizure of Arlington if paid. Lee's petition was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on April 6, but it was not acted on.|$|E
25|$|The {{married couple}} formed a single unit {{in terms of}} {{external}} responsibility, especially for debt. The man was responsible for debts contracted by his wife, even before her marriage, {{as well as for}} his own; but he could use her as a mancipium (see above). Hence the Code allowed a proviso to be inserted in the marriage contract, that the wife should not be seized for her husband's pre-nuptial debts; but stipulated that then he was not responsible for her pre-nuptial debts, and, in any case, that both together were responsible for all debts contracted after marriage. A man might make his wife a settlement by deed of gift, which gave her a <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> in part of his property, and he might reserve to her the right to bequeath it to a favorite child; but she could in no case leave it to her family. Although married, she always remained a member of her father's house—she is rarely named wife of A, but usually daughter of B, or mother of C.|$|E

25|$|Joan Welles died about 1474/5. The exact date of {{her death}} is not known; however she likely died shortly before her father and brother were attainted, five years after their executions, by the Parliament of January–March 1475. As {{a result of the}} attainders, all their honours were forfeited, {{including}} the baronies of Welles and Willoughby, which should have been inherited, respectively, after Joan Welles' death, by her paternal uncle, John Welles, 1st Viscount Welles, and her second cousin, Christopher Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby de Eresby. According to some historians, the attainders were passed by Parliament in order to enable Edward IV to grant Joan Welles' lands after her death to her husband, 'the trusted Yorkist Sir Richard Hastings', and accordingly, on 23 January 1475, the King granted Hastings a <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> in the greater part of the Welles and Willoughby estates. Moreover, Hastings was summoned to Parliament from 14 November 1482 to 9 December 1483 by writs directed Ricardo Hastyng de Wellys, whereby he is held to have become either Lord Hastings of Welles, or Lord Welles.|$|E
