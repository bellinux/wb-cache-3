5|$|Chelsea centre back Frank Sinclair {{and left}} back Graeme Le Saux were both sidelined {{for the final}} due to their calf injuries, causing player-manager Vialli to swap them with Michael Duberry, and Danny Granville, who had {{recovered}} from an abscess pain. Central midfielder Poyet was {{also included in the}} starting <b>line-up</b> <b>to</b> join captain Dennis Wise, after returning from a damaged cruciate ligament. Together with forward and lead goalscorer Vialli, Flo began in the attack, instead of Zola, who was named as a substitute, despite making an improvement from his damaged groin, sustained in a league fixture against Liverpool in April.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 2009, O'Gara overtook Jonny Wilkinson {{to become}} the top Six Nations point scorer ever. On 20 March 2009, he scored a late drop goal in the 78th minute to beat Wales and secure for Ireland their first Grand Slam for 61 years. O'Gara started against Australia in the first match of Ireland's 2009 November Series, scoring 10 points. He then lost {{his place in the}} {{starting}} <b>line-up</b> <b>to</b> Jonathan Sexton and did not play against Fiji or South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Albert Bouchard {{had been}} {{completely}} excluded from the retooling of the album for contractual reasons, but hoped to have his long work rewarded with a credit as co-producer, and to be paid accordingly. After the disbandment of Blue Öyster Cult, he contacted the other band members {{in an attempt to}} organize a 1987 reunion tour, with the original <b>line-up,</b> <b>to</b> promote Imaginos. His economic and membership requests were both rejected, due to resistances within the label and within the band, so he filed a lawsuit in 1989 against the management of Blue Öyster Cult and Columbia Records to receive payment for his work. The lawsuit was settled out of court, but his resentment towards Sandy Pearlman for what he felt was a theft of his work never eased, eliminating any chance of future collaborations for the completion of the Imaginos saga.|$|E

5|$|In 1995 Beyoncé's father {{resigned}} {{from his job}} to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original <b>line-up</b> <b>to</b> four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly {{to work on their}} first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} no real {{restrictions}} to the batting positions. Captains {{have been known to}} experiment with the batting <b>line-up</b> <b>to</b> gain specific advantages. For example, a lower-order batsman is sometimes sent in at number 3 with instructions to pinch-hit (playing aggressively in an attempt to score more runs in fewer balls – a term borrowed from baseball) to score quick runs and shield better players, as his wicket (as a less accomplished lower-order batsman) is less valuable anyway.|$|E

25|$|In 1963, the Kent {{side was}} in {{transition}} and captain Colin Cowdrey was injured {{for much of}} the season. Luckhurst and Denness took advantage of vacancies in the batting <b>line-up</b> <b>to</b> establish themselves in the side, but Nicholls was unable to do so: although he played in 16 first-class matches, he made only 684 runs at an average of just 25. He did, however, make the highest individual score of the whole English season, 211 against Derbyshire at Folkestone in 335 minutes.|$|E

50|$|April {{brought the}} news that striker Kevin Doyle had {{suffered}} ligament damage while on international duty with the Republic of Ireland and would struggle to feature again during the season. As manager Mick McCarthy switched formations and <b>line-ups</b> <b>to</b> try to replace Doyle as the spearhead of a 4-5-1 formation, the team endured a run of just two points from a possible 15. With three games remaining the team remained in the drop zone, but {{in touch with a}} number of other clubs. The renewed goalscoring form of Steven Fletcher, helped yield two successive 3-1 victories that clawed the team out of the relegation zone before the final day.|$|R
25|$|Noted {{producer}} Jim Diamond played bass from 1997 until 2004 {{and during}} that time Diamond also recorded and co-produced the Dirtbombs output with Mick Collins at his Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit. Troy Gregory (formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, Prong, and lead singer of The Witches and Troy Gregory & The Stepsisters) played bass from June 2004 to September 5, 2008, also constituting one of the longest runs of any Dirtbombs member: the four-year line-up of Collins, Pantano, Blackwell, Melina, and Gregory is the longest lasting Dirtbombs <b>line-up</b> <b>to</b> date. For a brief time in 2002, the band featured back-up singers Deanne Iovan (also formerly of the Come Ons) and future bass player Ko, in addition to five musicians.|$|E
25|$|Salary cap {{constraints}} {{forced the}} Blackhawks to make additional trades before the 2016–17 NHL season.

The Blackhawks also traded Bryan Bickell and Teuvo Teräväinen to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for another 2016 second round pick in order to free additional salary cap space. The Blackhawks signed veteran Brian Campbell and KHL stand-out Michal Kempný during free agency. The team then turned to their farm system to replenish their depth. The Blackhawks promoted rookies Ryan Hartman, Gustav Forsling, Tyler Motte, Nick Schmaltz and Vince Hinostroza to their starting <b>line-up</b> <b>to</b> fill the vacancies left by Shaw, Bickell, and Teräväinen.|$|E
25|$|England {{began their}} run chase with openers Dick Barlow and WG Grace, but 'The Doctor' {{was unable to}} {{reproduce}} his usual heroics, clean bowled by the express pace of Fred Spofforth for 4. A steady succession of wickets followed with only George Ulyett (26 of 59 balls) and Maurice Read (19 off 54 balls) providing any real resistance as Spofforth's pure pace provided too much firepower for the England <b>line-up</b> <b>to</b> deal with. He collected 7 for 46 off 36.3 overs including an astonishing 18 maidens. Four of his seven dismissals were clean bowled. Despite Spofforth's excellent bowling, England had established a first-innings lead of 38, being all out for 101. Stumps were called {{at the end of}} England's first innings.|$|E
