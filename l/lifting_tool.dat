The present study was conducted with the objective of quantitative risk assessment of patient manual handling among nurses in wards of one of the hospitals in Tehran using MAPO method. Methods: The present study was conducted as an analytical-cross-sectional study in 26 wards of one of the hospitals in Tehran city. Samples were selected by census method from nurses and paramedics of different wards of hospital. Data collection was performed using demographic information and MAPO checklist.

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: The aim of {{the work}} is to map the {{ergonomics}} in a production cell and propose and compare the solutions to identified problems. In order to identify the problem and come up with some solutions, these questions have been answered. • What factors lead to operations that are harmful to the body?• How can a production cell be designed to be more ergonomic for employees?• What are the advantages / disadvantages of ergonomics in a production company?   Method: To perform the study and achieve the purpose of the work, the authors used a case study company where observations were made in parallel with a literature review mainly on ergonomics variety of analysis and quality. The case study company has been used {{as the basis for the}} case study where ergonomics are mapped by means of observations, interviews and data that were analyzed by means of literature study done in parallel. Study results: The study resulted in a survey of ergonomics in a production cell at the case study company and 5 different suggestions for improvement. The production cell on the case study company is a red cell today, which means that the production cell is in a non-accepted position and in need for urgent changes in ergonomics. Factors leading to bad ergonomics and a non-accepted position as Volvo's requirements have been identified. Many heavy lifting and many torque is what has the highest negative impact on the working environment and ergonomics. Lack of adequate <b>lifting</b> <b>tools</b> have led to those not used in the production cell today. This leads to repetitive work and encumbrance at the case study company. Further, also the working height of the paths contributed to an increased workload as operators are in an unnatural posture. All of these factors are the basis of the 5 suggestions for improvement as the study also resulted in. New custom <b>lifting</b> <b>tools,</b> job rotation, reverse the order of the court, new packaging and pallet to the gears and the robot turn. All these proposed solutions lead to reduced stress and improved ergonomics in the production cell as manual lifting and twists are reduced. The solutions also leads to the production cell shifting from a non-accepted position with demands of urgent change to a yellow production cell that requires an action plan for the future.   Implications: The aim of this study was to map the ergonomics in a production cell. With the study in hand, a conclusion is drawn that the aim has been achieved when all three of the questions have been addressed. Factors leading to poor ergonomics are identified. As well the advantages and disadvantages of investing in ergonomics identified and how production cells should be formed. With this information in mind, a number of proposed solutions have been developed.   Recommendations: Further studies on the subject are recommended to increase knowledge and interest. It may be appropriate to carry out more case studies at more industries to strengthen the study’s results and generalizability. Furthermore, studies are recommended where the entire work environment is studied and not only physical ergonomics. By studying the whole working environment and the many factors that interact it can lead to a greater force being created for higher efficiency and quality in production.   Keywords: Ergonomics, Ergonomics, Work, Volvo CE, Load, <b>Lifting</b> <b>Tools,</b> Body Injury, Advantages, Improvements, Qualit...|$|R

The assignment has been an investigative work connected to an investment project, where a vertical lift module used for long goods, have been purchased for the plant. Bosch Rexroth has a make-to-order approach when they manufacture their hydraulic cylinders, in other words, the hydraulic cylinders are not made to stock for later sales. By having a make-to-stock supply chain, {{there are a lot}} of variation between the different manufactured cylinder types. To respond quickly to the customer needs, a large stock level of different goods must be kept. The manufacturing plant has for some time had some problems regarding the handling of goods with lack of storage space, faulty goods picking and unsafe lifting procedures. These problem became significantly more noticeable when a new material for piston rods got introduced at the plant. To reduce the area on which stock are kept and lower the amount of faulty goods picking, the plant invested in a vertical lift module. This thesis describes a solution proposal in which large amounts of Bosch Rexroth’s long goods are placed in the vertical lift module. Instead of focusing on a fast handling, the solution focuses on a placement in which it is difficult to make picking errors and adding goods to the wrong place. The <b>lifting</b> <b>tools</b> presented are easy to use and will be a safe alternative for lifting goods...|$|R

However, this approach has some limitations {{due to the lack}} of sinus <b>lift</b> <b>tools</b> available for clinical use and the small transcrestal access to the maxillary sinus floor. We recently invented shape-memory Ni/Ti alloy wire containing tube elevators for transcrestal detaching maxillary sinus mucosa, and developed goat ex vivo models for direct visualizing the effectiveness of detaching sinus mucosa in real time during transcrestal maxillary sinus floor elevation. Methods: We evaluated our invented elevators, namely elevator 012 and elevator 014, for their effectiveness for transcrestal detaching maxillary sinus mucosa using the goat ex vivo models. We measured the length of sinus mucosa detached in mesial and distal directions or buccal and palatal directions, and the space volume created by detaching maxillary sinus mucosa in mesial, distal, buccal and palatal directions using the invented elevators. Results: Elevator 012 had a shape-memory Ni/Ti alloy wire with a diameter of 0. 012 inch, while elevator 014 had its shape-memory Ni/Ti alloy wire with a diameter of 0. 014 inch. Elevator 012 could detach the goat maxillary sinus mucosa in the mesial or distal direction for 12. 1 ± 4. 3 mm, while in the buccal or palatal direction for 12. 5 ± 6. 7 mm. The elevator 014 could detach the goat maxillary sinus mucosa for 23. 0 ± 4. 9 mm in the mesial or distal direction, and for 19. 0 ± 8. 1 mm in the buccal or palatal direction. An average space volume of 1. 7936 ± 0. 2079 ml was created after detaching the goat maxillay sinus mucosa in both mesial/distal direction and buccal/palatal direction using elevator 012; while the average space volume created using elevator 014 was 1. 8764 ± 0. 2366 ml.

Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to 21 201 subjects aged 16 - 64 years, randomly selected from the patient registers of general practices in England, Scotland, and Wales, and to 993 subjects randomly selected from pay records of the armed services. Information was collected on occupation, workplace physical activities, neck pain in the past week and year, headaches, and feelings of tiredness or stress.

Results: Among 12 907 respondents, 4348 and 2528 reported neck pain in past year (1421 with pain interfering with normal activities) and week, respectively. Symptoms were the most prevalent among male construction workers [past week and year 24 % and 38 % (pain interfering with activities 11 %), respectively], followed by nurses, armed services members, and the unemployed.

Image registration is generally formulated as an optimization problem that satisfies constraints, such as coordinate displacements that are affine or volumepreserving or that obey the laws of elasticity. Three-dimensional registration of high-resolution images is computationally complex and justifies parallel implementation. In turn, ensembles of registration tasks exploit concurrency in the simpler sense of job farming. Registration is an elementary example {{of a much larger}} class of large-scale mesh-based computations that are in principle amenable to execution on the Grid, but are sensitive to workload-to-capability balance at synchronization points. While better resource assessment and allocation <b>tools</b> <b>lift</b> all such applications, reducing sensitivity to synchronization within an individual application is also important. We therefore examine the potential for weakening the synchronization sensitivity of general mesh-based bulk synchronous computations through less restrictive programming paradigms.

40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{affecting}} the effectiveness of machining time of 5 -axis miling is the method being used. By using flank milling method, {{as one of the}} optimized processes to make a workpiece, the time required for the process becomes shorter. This research is aimed at developing the method for determining the initial orientation of the tool for a sculptured surface on the basis of faceted model. By determining cc-point as the basis for positioning the tool {{on the surface of the}} workpiece, the cutting direction is formed from the nearest cc-point in the XY flat plane direction of the faceted model at the spatial coordinate. The positioning of the tool is initially based on the Local Coordinate System developed by the cross product between the normal vector nat each cc-point and cutting direction vector Ffrom one cc-point to the other. The cross product resulted is a tangent vector Tof the plane formed from the normal vector and cutting direction. The orientation of the tool is formed and defined by an inclination angle (α) and a screw angle (β). Maximizing the cutting volume and avoiding gouging at each cc-point during the flank milling are carried out through optimal adjustment of these two rotational angles. Furthermore, when the adjustment of rotational angles cannot resolve the gouging, appropriate <b>tool</b> <b>lifting</b> along the normal vector is conductedhis method is very much applicable for flank milling having the basis of data in the form of faceted models...|$|R

Therefore, the edge control is {{regarded as one of the}} most difficult technical issues in the segment production that needs to be addressed urgently. This paper reports an active edge control technique for the mirror segments fabrication using the Precession's polishing technique. The strategy in this technique requires that the large spot be selected on the bulk area for fast polishing, and the small spot is used for edge figuring. This can be performed by <b>tool</b> <b>lift</b> and optimizing the dell time to compensate for non-uniform material removal at the edge zone.

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop tooling {{and equipment to}} remotely replace gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors to reduce personnel radiation exposure {{as compared to the}} current hands-on method. It is also expected that radiation levels will continually increase with future waste streams. The equipment is operated in the Remote Equipment Decontamination Cell (REDC), which is equipped with compressed air, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and an electro-mechanical manipulator (EMM) arm for operation of the remote tools. The REDC does not provide access to electrical power, so the equipment must be manually or pneumatically operated. The MSM's have a load limit at full extension of ten pounds, which limited the weight of the installation tool. In order to remotely replace Hanford connector gaskets several operations must be performed remotely, these include: removal of the spent gasket and retaining ring (retaining ring is also called snap ring), loading the new snap ring and gasket into the installation tool and installation of the new gasket into the Hanford connector. SRNL developed and tested tools that successfully perform all of the necessary tasks. Removal of snap rings from horizontal and vertical connectors is performed by separate air actuated retaining ring removal tools and is manipulated in the cell by the MSM. In order install a new gasket, the snap ring loader is used to load a new snap ring into a groove in the gasket installation tool. A new gasket is placed on the installation tool and retained by custom springs. An MSM <b>lifts</b> the installation <b>tool</b> and presses the mounted gasket against the connector block. Once the installation tool is in position, the gasket and snap ring are installed onto the connector by pneumatic actuation. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. Extensive testing of tooling operation was performed in the DWPF manipulator repair shop. This testing allowed the operators to gain confidence before the equipment was exposed to radioactive contamination. The testing also led to multiple design improvements. On July 17 and 29, 2008 the Remote Gasket Replacement Tooling was successfully demonstrated in the REDC at the DWPF of The Savannah River Site...|$|R
6000|$|... § 6. But {{more than}} this: {{the fact is}} that in multitudes of instances, instead of gaining greater {{fineness}} of finish by our work, we are only destroying the fine finish of nature, and substituting coarseness and imperfection. For instance, when a rock of any kind has lain for some time exposed to the weather, Nature finishes it in her own way; first, she takes wonderful pains about its forms, sculpturing it into exquisite variety of dint and dimple, and rounding or hollowing it into contours, which for fineness no human hand can follow; then she colors it; and every one of her touches of color, instead of being a powder mixed with oil, is a minute forest of living trees, glorious in strength and beauty, and concealing wonders of structure, which in all probability are mysteries even to the eyes of angels. Man comes and digs up this finished and marvellous piece of work, which in his ignorance he calls a [...] "rough stone." [...] He proceeds to finish it in his fashion, that is, to split it in two, rend it into ragged blocks, and, finally, to chisel its surface into a large number of lumps and knobs, all equally shapeless, colorless, deathful, and frightful.[39] And the block, thus disfigured, he calls [...] "finished," [...] and proceeds to build therewith, and thinks himself great, forsooth, and an intelligent animal. Whereas, all that he has really done is, to destroy with utter ravage a piece of divine art, which, under the laws appointed by the Deity to regulate his work in this world, it must take good twenty years to produce the like of again. This he has destroyed, and has himself given in its place a piece of work which needs no more intelligence to do than a pholas has, or a worm, or the spirit which throughout the world has authority over rending, rottenness, and decay. I do not say that stone must not be cut; it needs to be cut for certain uses; only I say that the cutting it is not [...] "finishing," [...] but unfinishing it; and that so far as the mere fact of chiselling goes, the stone is ruined by the human touch. It is with it as with the stones of the Jewish altar: [...] "If thou <b>lift</b> up thy <b>tool</b> upon it thou hast polluted it." [...] In like manner a tree is a finished thing. But a plank, though ever so polished, is not. We need stones and planks, as we need food; but we no more bestow an additional admirableness upon stone in hewing it, or upon a tree in sawing it, than upon an animal in killing it.|$|R
