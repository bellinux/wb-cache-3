40|$|High <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> are {{observations}} that have outlying values in covariate space. In logistic regression model, {{the identification of}} high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> becomes essential due to their gross effects on the parameter estimates. Currently, {{the distance from the}} mean diagnostic method is used to identify the high <b>leverage</b> <b>points.</b> The main limitation of the distance from the mean diagnostic method is that it tends to swamp some low <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> even though it can identify the high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> correctly. In this study, we propose a new diagnostic method for the identification of high <b>leverage</b> <b>points.</b> Robust approach is firstly used to identify suspected high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> by computing the robust mahalanobis distance based on minimum volume ellipsoid or minimum covariance determinant estimators. For confirmation, the diagnostic procedure is used by computing the group deleted potential. We called this proposed diagnostic method the robust logistic diagnostic. The performance of the proposed diagnostic method is then investigated through real examples and monte carlo simulation study. The result of this study indicates that the proposed diagnostic method ensures only correct high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> are identified and free from swamping and masking effects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: High <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> are extreme {{outliers}} in the X-direction. In regression analysis, {{the detection}} of these <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> becomes important due to their arbitrary large effects on the estimations as well as multicollinearity problems. Mahalanobis Distance (MD) {{has been used as}} a diagnostic tool for identification of outliers in multivariate analysis where it finds the distance between normal and abnormal groups of the data. Since the computation of MD relies on non-robust classical estimations, the classical MD can hardly detect outliers accurately. As an alternative, Robust MD (RMD) methods such as Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) and Minimum Volume Ellipsoid (MVE) estimators had been used to identify the existence of high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> in the data set. However, these methods tended to swamp some low <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> even though they can identify high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> correctly. Since, {{the detection of}} <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> is one of the most important issues in regression analysis, it is imperative to introduce a novel detection method of high <b>leverage</b> <b>points.</b> Approach: In this study, we proposed a relatively new two-step method for detection of high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> by utilizing the RMD (MVE) and RMD (MCD) in the first step to identify the suspected outlier points. Then, in the second step the MD was used based on the mean and covariance of the clean data set. We called this method two-step Robust Diagnostic Mahalanobi...|$|R

The standardized robust residuals from the high breakdown estimators and the robust distance measures are used to statistically and graphically depict both multivariate outliers and <b>leverage</b> <b>points.</b> Once these points are found, their relationship to those observations that exhibit strong technically efficient or inefficient behavior, scale inefficiency and/or unusual production characteristics is analyzed for three linerboard manufacturing facilities.

40|$|In this study, we {{proposed}} Robust Variance Inflation Factors (RVIFs) in {{the detection}} of multicollinearity due to the high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> or extreme outliers in the X-direction. The computation of RVIFs is based on robust coefficient determinations which we called RR 2 (MM) and RR 2 (GM (DRGP)). The RR 2 (MM) is coefficient determination of high breakdown point and efficient MM-estimators whereas RR 2 (GM (DRGP)) has been defined through an improved GM-estimators. The GM (DRGP) is a GM-estimator with the main aim as downweighting high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> with large residuals. It has been introduced by employing S-estimators as initial values, Diagnostic Robust Generalized Potential based on MVE (DRGP (MVE)) as initial weight function and an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) has been utilized as a convergence method. The numerical results and Monte Carlo simulation study indicate that the proposed RVIFs are very resistant to the high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> and unable to detect the multicollinearity in the data especially RR 2 (GM (DRGP)). Hence, this indicates that the high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> {{are the source of}} multicollinearity...|$|R

50|$|Uncovering {{leverage}} points involves understanding feedback loops {{that link}} variables, or factors, that cause behavior in other variables.

40|$|Outliers in the X-direction or high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> are {{the latest}} known source of multicollinearity. Multicollinearity is a nonorthogonality {{of two or more}} {{explanatory}} variables in multiple regression models, which may have important influential impacts on interpreting a fitted regression model. In this paper, we performed Monte Carlo simulation studies to achieve two main objectives. The first objective was to study the effect of certain magnitude and percentage of high <b>leverage</b> <b>points,</b> which are two important issues in tending the high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> to be collinearity-enhancing observations, on the multicollinarity pattern of the data. The second objective was to investigate in which situations these points do make different degrees of multicollinearity, such as moderate or severe. According to the simulation results, high <b>leverage</b> <b>points</b> should be in large magnitude for at least two explanatory variables to guarantee that they are the cause of multicollinearity problems. We also proposed some practical Lower Bound (LB) and Upper Bound (UB) for High Leverage Collinearity Influential Measure (HLCIM) which is an essential measure in detecting the degree of multicollinearity.
