According to Harry Walters, an anthropologist and former chairman of the Center for Diné Studies at Diné College in , the incident demonstrates a crucial difference between Navajo and Western culture in the way visions and supernatural experiences are handled: [...] "Rather than focus on the sightings to determine if who saw it was nuts or not – that's what a Westerner would do – we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> message: 'Are we going the way we should? Walters said.|$|E
500|$|Several players thought having over 150 players wearing number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day {{was far too}} many. [...] "This is {{supposed}} to be an honor", Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter told USA Today, [...] "and just a handful of guys wearing the number. Now you've got entire teams doing it. I think we're killing the meaning. It should be special wearing Jackie's number, not just because it looks cool." [...] Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia, who decried the lack of African-American players in the game in March 2007, told USA Today that [...] "It kind of waters it down. I could see the Dodgers since that was his team, but not everyone else." [...] "I didn't know so many guys planned to wear the number. I sure wasn't expecting whole teams to wear it", Griffey told the USA Today. [...] "But I'm not going to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> negative. This is a tribute for what the man has done, a day to celebrate." [...] Garret Anderson, Los Angeles Angels left fielder, told the USA Today that he won't wear number 42 because [...] "I just don't feel I'm worthy of it." ...|$|E

Due to the revived interest in 3-D technology {{brought on by the}} success of Avatar, talks between Paramount, ILM, and Bay had considered the possibility of the next Transformers film being filmed in 3-D, and testing was performed to bring the technology into Bay's work. Bay originally was not much interested in the format as he felt it did not fit his [...] "aggressive style" [...] of filmmaking, but he was convinced after talks with Avatar director James Cameron, who even offered the technical crew from that film. Cameron reportedly told Bay about 3-D, [...] "You gotta <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> toy, it's another fun tool to help get emotion and character and create an experience." [...] Bay was reluctant to film with 3-D cameras since in test he found them to be too cumbersome for his filming style, but {{he did not want to}} implement the technology in post-production either since he was not pleased with the results. In addition to using the 3-D Fusion camera rigs developed by Cameron's team, Bay and the team spent nine months developing a more portable 3-D camera that could be brought into location.|$|E

Referring to his stay there, he recalled: [...] "I went to all these parties and met all these people and found that, basically, it's like a big revolving door. I thought if I could <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> series of poses and extract from it what I needed for my songs, then I would survive." [...] Describing his writing process, Wainwright stated he typically {{comes up with a}} melody line and starts singing phonetically, from which words often appear. To promote the album prior to its release, Wainwright embarked on a tour throughout the United States and Canada.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the regular season, Michigan (ranked #4) {{traveled}} to Columbus, Ohio, for its annual rivalry game with Ohio State (ranked #8). Each team entered the game with one loss on its record, but Ohio State was undefeated in conference play. [...] For the eighth time in nine years, the winner of the game would become the Big Ten Conference champion and earn the conference's berth in the Rose Bowl. The Wolverines had not beaten the Buckeyes since 1971, and Bo Schembechler had not won a game in Ohio Stadium. [...] Stories ran about Schembechler being jinxed or hexed at Ohio Stadium, but Schembechler rejected the notion: [...] "I don't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> jinx." [...] On learning that his team was favored by 5-1/2 points, Schembechler said, [...] "Being the favorite doesn't put any points on the board." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{motivation}}s, Ringer responded [...] "Honestly, my number-one motivation is my family". While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, I {{grew up in the}} church, I have a very religious family. I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I never <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E
2500|$|The War of 1812 {{is often}} celebrated in Ontario as a British victory {{for what would}} become Canada in 1867, but Canadian historians in recent decades <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> defeat for the First Nations of Canada, and also for the merchants of Montreal (who lost the fur trade of the Michigan-Minnesota area). The British had a long-standing goal of {{building}} a [...] "neutral" [...] but pro-British Indian buffer state in the American Midwest. They demanded a neutral Indian state at the peace conference in 1814 but failed to gain any of it because they had {{lost control of the}} region in the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames in 1813, where Tecumseh was killed. The British then abandoned the Indians south of the lakes. The royal elite of (what is now) Ontario gained much more power in the aftermath and used that power to repel American ideas such as democracy and republicanism, especially in those areas of Ontario settled primarily by Americans. Many of those settlers returned to the states and were replaced by immigrants from Britain who were imperial-minded. W. L. Morton says the war was a [...] "stalemate" [...] but the Americans [...] "did win the peace negotiations." [...] Arthur Ray says the war made [...] "matters worse for the native people" [...] as they lost military and political power. Bumsted says the war was a stalemate but regarding the Indians [...] "was a victory for the American expansionists." [...] Thompson and Randall say [...] "the War of 1812's real losers were the Native peoples who had fought as Britain's ally." ...|$|E

60|$|The whole {{question}} of development is of great importance for our present subject.

The absolute independence of new and old structures, although corresponding in structure and function, is still more obvious when several individuals are formed within a previous form, as in the cases of alternate generation. The same important principle probably comes largely into play even in the case of apparently continuous growth, as we shall see when we consider the inheritance of modifications at corresponding ages.|$|E

But in the performance of the work I had much gratification, and was enabled {{from time to time to}} have in this way that fling at the political doings of the day which every man likes to take, if not in one fashion then in another. I look upon this string of characters,--carried sometimes into other novels than those just named,--as the best work of my life. Taking him altogether, I think that Plantagenet Palliser stands more firmly on the ground than any other personage I have created.|$|E
60|$|The perfect {{equality}} {{among the}} individuals composing the Fuegian tribes must {{for a long}} time retard their civilisation. As we see those animals, whose instinct compels them to live in society and obey a chief, are most capable of improvement, so is it with the races of mankind. Whether we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cause or a consequence, the more civilised always have the most artificial governments. For instance, the inhabitants of Otaheite, who, when first discovered, were governed by hereditary kings, had arrived at a far higher grade than another branch of the same people, the New Zealanders,--who, although benefited by being compelled to turn their attention to agriculture, were republicans in the most absolute sense. In Tierra del Fuego, until some chief shall arise with power sufficient to secure any acquired advantage, such as the domesticated animals, it seems scarcely possible that the political state of the country can be improved. At present, even a piece of cloth given to one is torn into shreds and distributed; and no one individual becomes richer than another. On the other hand, it is difficult to understand how a chief can arise till there is property of some sort by which he might manifest his superiority and increase his power.|$|E
