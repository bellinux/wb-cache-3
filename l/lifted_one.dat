5|$|The {{degree to}} which {{any one of these}} forces held sway over others is unclear. Preference for one {{explanation}} over another is sometimes predicated upon a given political viewpoint. The cumulative effect of these dynamics is that {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century the Plains Aborigines were almost completely acculturated into the larger ethnic Han group, and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese. In addition, legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until the 1990s, and cultural barriers remain. Aborigines were not permitted to use their traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using aboriginal names dating from 1946 was finally <b>lifted.</b> <b>One</b> obstacle is that household registration forms allow a maximum of 15 characters for personal names. However, aboriginal names are still phonetically translated into Chinese characters, and many names require more than the allotted space.|$|E
25|$|After an {{unexpected}} disqualification from the EuroLeague Top 8 in the 1998–99 season, Alvertis <b>lifted</b> <b>one</b> more Greek League championship by beating rival Olympiacos {{in the final}} after, breaking the home court advantage and winning the fifth decisive game at Peace and Friendship Stadium. The best was yet to come, however.|$|E
25|$|Specifics {{about the}} third phase, which {{initially}} was to involve renovations to older buildings, long remained undisclosed. In November 2009, plans were made public that LACMA's director Michael Govan was working with Swiss architect and Pritzker Prize laureate Peter Zumthor on plans for rebuilding the eastern section of the campus from the two new Renzo Piano buildings to the tar pits. With an estimated cost of $650 million, his first proposal called for a horizontal building along Wilshire Boulevard. It would be wrapped in glass on all sides and its main galleries would be <b>lifted</b> <b>one</b> floor into the air. The wide roof would be covered with solar panels. In a later concession to concerns raised by its neighbor, the Page Museum, LACMA had Zumthor alter {{the shape of his}} proposed building to stretch across Wilshire Boulevard and away from the La Brea Tar Pits.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1949 The Tom Thumb Follies staged radio {{broadcast}} performances at the Beacham.

2500|$|Nonnus, in his Dionysiaca, {{writes that}} the name Dionysus means [...] "Zeus-limp" [...] and that Hermes named the new born Dionysus this, [...] "because Zeus while he carried his burden <b>lifted</b> <b>one</b> foot with a limp from {{the weight of his}} thigh, and nysos in Syracusan langugage means limping". In his note to these lines, W. H. D. Rouse writes [...] "It need hardly be said that these etymologies are wrong". The Suda, a Byzantine {{encyclopedia}} based on classical sources, states that Dionysus was so named [...] "from accomplishing [...] for each of those who live the wild life. Or from providing [...] everything for those who live the wild life.” ...|$|E
50|$|If {{the desire}} to <b>lift</b> <b>one's</b> arm causes <b>one</b> to <b>lift</b> their arm, {{then there is no}} event such that it is non-supervenient on {{the desire to}} <b>lift</b> <b>one's</b> arm and it causes <b>one</b> to <b>lift</b> their arm.|$|R

5000|$|The {{exclusion}} principle is most commonly applied when one poses this scenario; One usually considers that {{the desire to}} <b>lift</b> <b>one’s</b> arm as a mental event, and the <b>lifting</b> on <b>one's</b> arm, a physical event. According to the {{exclusion principle}}, there must be no event that does not supervene on e while causing e*. To show this better, substitute [...] "the desire to <b>lift</b> <b>one's</b> arm" [...] for [...] "e", and [...] "one to lift their arm" [...] for [...] "e*".|$|R
2500|$|At a ruck {{early in}} the match, Mealamu and Umaga each {{attempted}} to clear O'Driscoll from the ruck. The two All-Black players each <b>lifted</b> <b>one</b> of O'Driscoll's legs before driving him towards the ground; O'Driscoll's shoulder was dislocated upon landing. While O'Driscoll was being lifted, the touch judge was heard telling Mealamu and Umaga to let O'Driscoll go, but he took no further action regarding the incident. Opinions differed on the incident. Many British and Irish commentators and fans claimed {{that it was an}} illegal [...] "spear tackle" [...] and Lions coach Clive Woodward reported the pair to the IRB-appointed citing commissioner, William Venter, who decided, {{on the basis of the}} video footage available to him at the time, not to refer the matter to a disciplinary tribunal. New Zealand commentators and fans were largely of the view that the two All Blacks were merely clearing out the ruck and that there had been no intention to injure O'Driscoll. [...] However, four months later, and following new footage of the incident, the International Rugby Board unequivocally condemned Umaga and Mealamu's actions. [...] IRB spokesman Greg Thomas said: [...] "This footage wasn't available at the time and the IRB are unable to act retrospectively because the two sides had both signed a tour agreement whereby disciplinary matters had to be resolved within 12 hours of the match. But we have subsequently been able to view the video and we are determined that such tackles are removed from the game. They're totally unacceptable and have absolutely no place in rugby." ...|$|E
