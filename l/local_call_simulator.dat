Calls between users in the same <b>local</b> <b>calling</b> area are <b>local,</b> and we allow the extension of this area to be treated as a strategic variable. We show that the extension of the calling areas which maximises the carrier's profit is the same that a welfare maximising regulator would choose. Under a price cap regime in which prices are required to meet an average price constraint, the firm is shown to manipulate strategically the extension of the <b>local</b> <b>calling</b> areas. We end the paper by considering the case of a competitive market. In this case, again, the owner of the local loop manipulates the extension of the <b>local</b> <b>calling</b> areas to increase profits. telecommunications; <b>local</b> <b>calling</b> areas; community of interest; regulation; price cap; access; interconnection. ...|$|R
