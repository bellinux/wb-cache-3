We examine 5 different realisations of the ocean's overturning circulation produced by a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model under LGM forcing and suggested changes in the atmospheric deposition of iron and phytoplankton physiology at the LGM. Measured changes in carbon- 13 and carbon- 14, as well as a qualitative reconstruction of the change in ocean carbon export are used to evaluate the results.

40|$|Background. Among all rheumatologic disea­ses, {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) accounts for 3 % of cases, {{and the number}} of such patients is increasing. RA is characteri­zed by systemic vascular lesion (angiopathy), it is determined by the international Chapel Hill classification as “vasculitis associated with systemic disease”. The {{purpose of the study was}} to improve the quality of diagnosis, to stablish new links in the pathogenesis and to identify the prognostic criteria for the clinical course of vascular disease in RA. Materials and methods. 131 patients were examined. The ratio of men and women was 1 : 2, the mild, moderate and high degree of the disease activity was 1 : 2 : 1, respectively, the average age of the examined patients was 45. 70 ± 1. 02 years, the duration of the clinical manifestation was 9. 40 ± 0. 68 years, I, II, III and IV stages were diagnosed in 8, 40, 34 and 19 % of patients. Echocardiography, sonography and ultrasonic dopplerography of vessels, conjunctival biomicroscopy, morphologi­cal examination of kidney biopsy were preformed, integrated indices of clinical and instrumental vascular pathology were determined. Results. Systemic angiopathy is observed in 61 % of patients with RA, more often in cases of high activity with the presence of osteoporosis, the development of skin vasculitis and peripheral vasoneuropathy are closely related to the serum levels of cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, which, along with the concentration of C-reactive protein, has a nega­tive prognostic significance for the vascular pathology, and the appearance of digital arteritis is determined by the activity of the joint syndrome, the appearance of glomerulonephritis — by the high content in the blood of circulating immune complexes, and angiopathy presence reflects the pressure increase in the <b>lesser</b> (pulmonary) <b>circulation.</b> Conclusions. In patients with RA, mesangial proliferative and mesangial capillary glomerulonephritis develops in a ratio of 2 : 1, with an appropriate tubulointerstitial component and the immunoglobulins and complement components deposition (in the stroma > glomeruli > tubules > vessels), at that the structural changes in the renal vessels are closely associated with clinical instrumental manifestations of systemic rheumatoid angiopathy. C-reactive protein values in the blood more than 25 mg/L and anti-citrulline antibodies more than 40 U/ml are prognostic negative criteria for systemic vascular pathology and the kidney stroma damage, severe changes in renal tubules are a risk factor for the high rates of the joint syndrome progression...|$|R

These trends, using multiple regression analysis, were then compared to changes in synoptic flow patterns based on daily surface charts for the 1929 to 1985 period. Results indicate that changes in synoptic flow pattern have a very significant impact on rainfall {{and temperature}} trends. Observed rainfall trends tend to show cyclic trends or spells of wet and dry periods. Comparison with the literature suggests {{that some of the}} observed 10 year rainfall trends were related to the sunspot cycle, such as the winter rainfall trend. However changes in synoptic flow patterns appear {{to be the most important}} factor influencing rainfall trends. Temperature trends show a much stronger relationship with synoptic flow patterns than rainfall,particularly for maximum temperature trends. Wet periods over the study area are categorised by increased cyclonic activity in combination with increased southerlies and or, easterly circulations while dry periods are related to anticyclonic conditions and increased westerly circulation. Southerly, and to a <b>lesser</b> exent easterly <b>circulations,</b> have the most significant influence on temperature trends with a negative impact. The synoptic climatology of daily rainfall patterns over the study area indicated that the dominant rain-bearing winds come from the southerly quarter, especially southwesterly airflows.

The majority of plasma S 1 P is transported bound to HDL and albumin. Although the major sources of circulating S 1 P have been identified, it remains obscure what is the contribution of different organs/tissues to S 1 P homeostasis in plasma. Answering this question was the major aim of the present study. Methods: The experiment was performed on male Wistar rats from whom blood samples were taken from either: 1) femoral vein, right ventricle of the heart, and abdominal aorta (n= 15) or 2) hepatic vein, portal vein, and abdominal aorta (n= 11). Plasma was fractionated by sequential flotation ultracentrifugation and sphingolipids were quantified by a HPLC method. Results: Compared to the mixed venous blood sampled from the right ventricle, total plasma and lipoprotein-depleted plasma (LPDP) concentration of S 1 P in the arterial blood was lower. On the other hand, the level of S 1 P increased across the leg both in plasma and LPDP. The concentration of S 1 P, sphingosine, and sphinganine in the plasma, HDL, and LPDP isolated from the blood taken from the hepatic vein was markedly higher compared to both arterial and portal blood. Conclusions: We conclude that, in contrast to HDL-bound S 1 P, albumin-associated S 1 P is very labile in the circulation. It is degraded in the pulmonary, and to a <b>lesser</b> extent, gastrointestinal <b>circulation,</b> and released across the liver and skeletal muscle.

In this preparation the collateral supply amounted to 0. 5 to 1 per cent of the total arterial flow under approximately normal conditions. The changes in this collateral flow under a variety of experimental conditions were studied. These included variable systemic, venous and pulmonary pressures, lung collapse, air embolism, and actions of CO 2 and serotonin. THE importance of collateral blood flow tothe lung has long been recognized. Oblit-eration of the bronchial arteries is often fol-lowed by necrosis of the bronchi 1 and dilata-tion of the bronchial vessels or increased collateral blood flow to the lung have been re-ported in certain types of cardiac and pulmo-nary disease. 2 ' 3 While there have been reports of the measurement of flow in isolated bron-chial arteries, 4 isolated lobes, 5 estimates of bronchial flow in dogs and humans by means of gas analysis data 6 ' 7 and measurements of bronchial arterial flow in lung-thorax and lung-esophagus preparations 8 the literature does not contain reports of experiments in which the total collateral blood flow to the normal lung was measured.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} differences between the pulmonary and systemic circulation is a considerably lower blood pressure and hemodynamic resistance in the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation.</b> After the discovery of the endogenous vasocilator, nitric oxide, it had been assumed that pulmonary vasculature is characterized by a high tonic NO production, which might contribute to the low basal tone of these vessels. Inability to maintain this high NO production would then lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension. However, numerous studies summarized in the review gradually proved that, in reality, this simple scheme does not apply. Healthy pulmonary vessels usually produce only relatively small amounts of NO. In pulmonary hypertension, NO synthesis increases. The rise in pulmonary artery pressure is partly blunted by this protective mechanism, at least until the pulmonary endothelium is damaged by the permanent and severe elevation of intravascular pressure. However, {{it is also possible that}} the increased NO production, contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension by interacting with superoxide and yielding peroxynitrite.

40|$|Abnormal {{vasoconstriction}} of the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation</b> characterizes {{a subset}} of patients with essential hypertension, a possible effect of mechanisms, such as enhanced sympathetic tone, increased delivery of blood-borne vasoconstrictor substances or abnormal local release of vasoactive factors, acting {{on both sides of}} the circulation or to backward transmission of increased pressure due to stiffer left ventricles with more advanced diastolic dysfunction. Elevated systemic pressure also associates with thickening of the right ventricle, a central element of the low-pressure system. Right ventricular remodelling develops in parallel with a similar process occurring at the left side, likely as a result of ventricular interdependence under the influence of trophic factors targeting both ventricles, though other mechanisms, including increased pulmonary afterload, may also be operative. By and large independent of the extent of structural remodelling of both ventricles, systemic hypertension also conditions an impaired filling rate of the right ventricle that accompanies a similar phenomenon at the left side. Thus, quite in contrast with the common and simplistic assumption of a separate behaviour of the two ventricles, the right-sided cardiovascular system is not immune to the effect of systemic hypertension, a concept whose clinical and pathophysiological implications require further studies.

40|$|The {{volumes of}} the dead space (anatomic and alveolar) play an {{important}} role in the physiology of external respiration and information on these volumes makes the diagnosis of different respiratory disorders easier. The volume of the anatomic dead space (the last inspiratory portions) is uninvolved in the mixing with the gas of functional residual capacity (FRC) and leaves the airways unchanged in the gas composition on expiration. Mixing of the other portion of the tidal volume with FRC gas should be regarded as preparation for an alveolar gas exchange process. The increased partial value of the anatomic dead space in the tidal volume with its decrease (tachypnea) and, accordingly, reduced alveolar ventilation volume may result in ventilation respiratory failure. The time course of changes in the volume of the alveolar dead space is easily detectable from the decrease in expiratory CO 2 concentrations as compared with PaCO 2. The increased alveolar dead space volume suggests impaired local blood flow (thromboembolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome) in the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation</b> and gives grounds to diagnose shunting and venous mixing.

At that time point the mean left ventricular systolic pressure exceeded the resting level. The mean left ventricular diastolic pressure rose by 6 mm.

A reduction in the heart rate of 13 beats/minute was found, and the calculated mean systemic vascular resistance, mean left ventricular stroke volume, and left ventricular stroke work continued to be above resting levels.

40|$|SummaryThe {{presence}} of circulating gas bubbles has been repeatedly reported after uncomplicated SCUBA dives. The clinical and pathophysiological relevance {{of this phenomenon}} is still under debate but some experimental data suggest that silent bubbles may have a damaging potential on pulmonary endothelial cells. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the possible hemodynamic effect on pulmonary circulation of post-dive circulating gas bubbles. To this aim, 16 experienced divers were studied by Doppler-echocardiography in basal conditions and 2. 0  ±  0. 15  h after an uncomplicated, unrestricted recreational SCUBA dive. At the post-dive examination, circulating bubbles were present in 10 / 16 subjects (62. 5 %). Divers with circulating bubbles showed a significant post-dive increase of pulmonary systolic arterial pressure (evaluated by the maximal velocity of the physiological tricuspid regurgitation; P <  0. 01)) and right ventricular internal dimension (P <  0. 05). Divers without circulating bubbles showed no significant change in cardiac anatomy and pulmonary arterial pressure. Both groups showed a significant post-dive decrease of transmitral E/A ratio (index of left ventricular diastolic function: subjects with bubbles P <  0. 01; subjects without bubbles P <  0. 05). These results seem to indicate that circulating gas bubbles may lead to a hemodynamically relevant increase of pulmonary arterial pressure, able to induce an acute right ventricular dilation. Post-dive diastolic function changes, observed in both groups, may be explained by a preload reduction due to immersion natriuresis. The results of the present study add some evidence that post-dive circulating bubbles, although symptomless, have an easily detectable pathogenetic potential, inducing unfavorable hemodynamic changes in the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation...</b>|$|E

Methods Fifteen mongrel dogs, anesthetized with intra-venous injections of either sodium pentobarbital (25 mg. /Kg.) or chloralose (80 mg. /Kg.), were subjected to a transverse, sternum-splitting tho-racotomy at the fourth intercostal space. The animals were air-ventilated through a cuffed endo-tracheal tube by means of intermittent positive pressure from a Harvard respirator pump. Sys-temic arterial pressure was recorded by a Statham transducer (P 23 G) on a direct-writing oscillo-graph recorder. The animals were heparinized (1. 5 mg. /Kg.). Venous blood was diverted to a common blood reservoir from the three great veins, and the systemic circulation maintained by pumping oxygenated blood into a femoral artery (Kay-Cross oxygenator with roller pumps). Coro-nary venous blood was removed from the right heart, and pulmonary collateral blood from the left atrium, by drainage tubes inserted via the atrial appendages. Since the right ventricle was drained, coronary venous blood did not accumulate in it, and, for this reason, the pressure in the right ventricle remained below normal.

Extensive hemodynamic studies have been carried out which demonstrate that narrowing of the mitral valve produces hypertension throughout the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation</b> and often an increased resistance to flow through the pulmonary arterioles. 3 - 8 However, to date there are few reports of abnormalities in pul-monary function in mitral stenosis and the majority of these have dealt with disturbances in ventilation. 1 ' 10 11 Blount and coworkers' 2 have recently demonstrated an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient i...|$|E
40|$|In 1952, Deuchar and Knebel, in 1956, Lasser and Amram applied Broemser-Ranke 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Windkessel 2 ̆ 2 {{theory to}} the {{pulmonary}} circuit {{in order to}} determine the pulmonary volume elasticity coefficient (E 2 ̆ 7 p). Deuchar and Knebel proposed to assume PV= 0, whereas Lasser and Amram PV= 5. In this report E 2 ̆ 7 p was calculated in assumption of PV=Q or PV= 5 as well as PV=PC where PC was estimated as the pulmonary wedge pressure obtained by the venous catheterization. Simultaneously as to the great circulation, Wezler 2 ̆ 7 s and Blumberger-Holldack 2 ̆ 7 s methods, as to the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation,</b> O. Bayer 2 ̆ 7 s method were adopted in order to estimate the dynamical values. 1. In 8 healthy cases, the average of PA was 22. 4 / 11. 1 mmHg, PC SmmHg, Vm 5. 751 /min, and Wp (pulmonary peripheral resistance) 243. 5 dyne sec cm^. E 2 ̆ 7 p in normal health calculated as either PV= 0 or PV= 5 was used to be found approximately same. 2. In 11 essential hypertensive patients (Keith-Wagener II) the average of E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) was 186. 0 dyne cm^, so that there existed no marked difference as compared with that of normal health. 3. In bronchial asthma not complicated with pulmonary emphysema, the average of E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) was 285. 0 dyne cm^, whereas in bronchial asthma suffered from this complication it was 454. 4 dyne cm^. 4. In 4 of 5 cases with mitral stenosis, both PA and E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) were found larger than those in normal health in an average; the wedge pressure of all cases was elevated. In 1 of 3 cases with mitral stenoinsufficiency, E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) was estimated larger than that in normal health. In mitral stenosis, E 2 ̆ 7 p determined in assumption of PV= 0 or PV= 5 showed not seldom the marked deviation from that in assumption of PV=PC. 5. In 2 of 4 cases with aortic regurgitation, E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) was found within the normal range, whereas in other two it was estimated beyond the normal. Among 3 patients suffered from aortic stenoinsufficiency complicated cardiac asthma, E 2 ̆ 7 p was observed normal in 1 case, and larger than the normal range in 2 cases. 6. In one case with Ayerza 2 ̆ 7 s disease, E 2 ̆ 7 p (PV=PC) was 4084 dyne cm^, that is, the largest value among this observation. 7. E 2 ̆ 7 p tended to increase in its amount pararell with the elevation of systolic PA, mean PA, and pulmonary pulse pressure. However there could not be seen so closed relationship between E 2 ̆ 7 p and pulmonary diastolic pressure in the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation</b> as that between E 2 ̆ 7 and arterial diastolic in the greater circulation. The reverse correlation existed roughly between the fluctuation of E 2 ̆ 7 p and that of Vs in the same individual. 8. There was calculated the ratio of E 2 ̆ 7 p to E 2 ̆ 7 in the patients in whom Vm determined by Fick-Cournand 2 ̆ 7 s method was closely approximate to that by Wezler 2 ̆ 7 s simultaneously performed. Regarding E 2 ̆ 7 p/E 2 ̆ 7, mitral stenosis or stenoinsufficiency, bronchial asthma with or without pulmonary emphysema, essential hypertension of KW II, and normal health could be arranged in the order of the magnitude. In the same individual, the, damping factor in the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation</b> tended to be observed larger than that in the greater circulation. 9. The intravenous injection of morphine (0. 1 mg per kilo) augmented the E 2 ̆ 7 p of mitral stenosis; thus resulted pulmonary hypertension, though transitory and slight, showed the type of W+E 2 ̆ 7 (Wezler-Boger), whereas in the greater circulation there appeared the tendency of 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungshypotension 2 ̆ 2 (Duesberg-Schroeder). While the right ventricular dynamical values showed 2 ̆ 2 Volumenreaktion 2 ̆ 2 (Blumberger), the left ventricular changed from 2 ̆ 2 Volumenreaktion 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 Normals Reaktion 2 ̆ 2. 10. The intravenous injection of β-oxypropyltheophylline (ca. 2 mg per kilo) showed the tendency of 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungshypotension 2 ̆ 2 both in lesser and greater circulation of the patients suffered from bronchial asthma, however the tendency seen in the greater circulation was usually somewhat more marked than that in the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation.</b> At this moment, bothsided ventricular dynamical values enhanced commonly the tendency of 2 ̆ 2 Druckreaktion 2 ̆ 2 previously existed more or less. In the essential hypertension of KW II, Vm previously augmented was not seldom rather reduced to some extent. There occurred no significant change upon PA. The intravenous injection of oxytheophylline reduced E 2 ̆ 7 p calculated in assumption of PV= 0 or PV= 5, whereas it augmented E 2 ̆ 7 p determined in assumption of PV=PC. However, in the systemic circulation, E 2 ̆ 7 as well as W tended to become smaller by the injection. As to bothsided ventricular dynamical values, in the cases with marked 2 ̆ 2 Druckreaktion 2 ̆ 2 there could be seen the tendency of the decrease in its degree. 11. The intravenous injection of 0. 25 mg of K-Strophanthin (Sandoz) augmented the Vm except for aortic regurgitation. The fluctuation of E 2 ̆ 7 p remained within normal range. After the recompensation by Strophanthin therapy, the systemic circulation showed the tendency of the normotensive 2 ̆ 2 Entspannungsregulation 2 ̆ 2 (Duesberg and Schroeder) regarding peripheral dynamics as well as that of 2 ̆ 2 Volumenreaktion 2 ̆ 2 (Blumberger) respecting bothsided cardiodynamics. The injection of Strophanthin normalized the pulmonary 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungshypertension 2 ̆ 2 observed in some cases, whereas at this moment W and E 2 ̆ 7 in systemic circulation increased slightly in their amount. In the patients with mitral stenosis or ravious kinds of valvular diseases complicated with pulmonary hypertension, the injection of Strophanthin lowered PA previously elevated, and reduced. Vm, although of slight extent. E 2 ̆ 7 p and Wp formerly augmented were also diminished a little by the injection. ASZ 2 ̆ 7 (right ventricular 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungszeit 2 ̆ 2) once prolonged tended to decrease in its degree. In the systemic circulation the high output showed the tendency to be reduced, W or E 2 ̆ 7 rather somewhat enlarged. 12. The intravenous injection of 1. 0 mg of Camphidonium salt (Ingelheim) lowered the systolic PA of mitral stenosis previously elevated, at this moment the diastolic PA remained unchanged or was rather raised although of slight extent, and Vm formerly diminished was augmented. E 2 ̆ 7 p in assumption of PV= 0 became smaller, whereas E 2 ̆ 7 p in assumption of PV=PC larger. While the total pulmonary resistance decreased, the pulmonary arteriolar resistance increased in their amount. In the systemic circulation, W and E 2 ̆ 7 were reduced, Vm remained unchanged or slightly increased in their amount. The left ventricular dynamical values showed the decrease in the extent of 2 ̆ 2 Druckreaktion 2 ̆ 2, whereas those of right ventricle rather the increase although of slight extent...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{estimate}} the implication of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the pathogenesis of hemostatic disorders, by studying the arteriovenous difference between hemostatic parameters. Subjects and methods. Venous and arterial hemostases were studied in 95 patients treated in an intensive care unit. Three groups were identified, which included: 1) 50 patients with an uncomplicated postoperative period and without any organ incompetence; 2) 21 patients with primary lung injury; and 3) 24 patients with secondary lung injury. Groups 2 and 3 patients were divided according {{to the degree of}} acute lung injury. Results. The arterial blood of patients with the uncomplicated postoperative period shows a lower coagulability than venous blood; there is no arteriovenous difference between fibrinolytic activity and platelet levels. The coagulation activity of arterial blood increases in primary lung injury; the higher fibrinolytic activity of arterial blood is a compensatory mechanism in moderate lung injury. Later on, in evolving ARDS, the hemostasiological balance between the pulmonary and systemic circulations impairs; disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) develops in both arterial and venous beds. Venous blood coagulability increases in secondary lung injury. By regulating the hemostatic system, the lungs produce a lower coagulation activity of and a higher fibrinolytic activity of arterial blood in ALI. With the development of ARDS, this function triples and DIC spreads to the arterial bed. Conclusion. The lung maintains the hemostasiological balance between the pulmonary and systemic circulations, by holding activated platelets and by enhancing the fibrinolytic activity of the blood flowing from it. The inducer of DIC is the suppressed fibrinolysis of the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation</b> in patients with primary lung injury and hyperco-agulation in the greater circulation in patients with secondary lung injury.

40|$|Pulmonary {{pressure}} and arteriolar resistance are elevated in uncomplicated primary systemic hypertension. This study {{was carried out}} in 16 men with this form of hypertension and in 9 healthy men to compare 1) their pulmonary vascular reactivity to endogenous catecholamines released during mental arithmetic and cold pressor tests, and 2) the dose-response relation to exogenous epinephrine and norepinephrine. Arithmetic and cold pressor tests were associated, respectively, with a predominant increase in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentration; changes were significantly greater in hypertensive men. During the two tests, pulmonary arteriolar resistance in the normotensive group was reduced by 13 % and augmented by 7 % of baseline, respectively, whereas it was raised by 31 and 70 %, respectively, in the hypertensive group. In normal subjects, the dose (μg) -response (Δ dynes) relation to epinephrine was 1 = − 4, 2 = − 9, 3 = − 9 and 4 = − 10; to norepinephrine it was 2 = + 3, 4 = + 6, 6 = + 7 and 8 = + 7. In hypertensive patients, the respective relations were 1 = + 18, 2 = + 44, 3 = + 59 and 4 = + 77; and 2 = + 39, 4 = + 54, 6 = + 76 and 8 = + 98. Group differences were highly significant. In each of these circumstances, the driving pressure across the lungs was significantly augmented in the hypertensive but not the normotensive group. Both epinephrine and norepinephrine have a vasoconstrictor influence on the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation</b> as a consequence of vascular over reactivity. The opposite changes in resistance between normotensive and hypertensive subjects produced by epinephrine suggest that a constrictor vascular supersensitivity becomes active in the pulmonary circuit with the development of systemic high blood pressure...|$|E
40|$|The defects {{found in}} {{congenital}} heart disease are frequently of such character as to disturb the normal pathways of circulation through the heart. The common types of congenital lesions responsi-ble for diverting {{the normal course of}} blood are interventricular septal defects with or without pul-monary stenosis, auricular septal defects, and pa-tent ductus arteriosus. In these anomalies the hemodynamic relationship between the right and left side of the heart becomes so altered as to lead to a mechanical interference with the proper oxy-genation of the blood. When this obtains, quanti-ties of blood pass unaerated (venous-arterial shunt) from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart giving rise to varying degrees of oxygen unsatura-tion, cyanosis, and anoxemia. On the other hand, the course of the blood stream may be shunted from the left to the right side of the heart (ar-terial-venous shunt), thereby permitting oxygen-ated blood to pass back into the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation.</b> Under the latter conditions there may be neither anoxemia nor cyanosis. In this study we have sought to obtain data re-garding the presence or absence of anoxemia and factors influencing its development. Information of this kind is of course important in congenital heart afflictions because prognoses, particularly of the potentially more serious defects, depend in general on the degree of anoxemia and the extent of the increase of the work of the heart. The degree of cyanosis is a valuable guide, but is not an accurate measure of anoxemia. If poly-cythemia is present, there may be a sufficient quantity of oxygen for the tissues and, in addi-tion, enough reduced hemoglobin to cause cyano-sis. Conversely, anoxemia may be present with-out visible cyanosis. We have attempted here to investigate this problem by studying the variation...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{studies are}} {{available}} concerning {{the effect of}} epinephrine upon the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation</b> of several species of animals {{and a variety of}} animal preparations. Until recently, this type of investi-gation has not been possible in man. The develop-ment of methods has now made such studies feasi-ble, and much can be learned in a quantitative and semi-quantitative way. The intracardiac catheter, the dye dilution techniques for blood flow and vol-ume, and a high frequency recording manometer are the corner-stones of the present study. The purpose of this work was to discover what changes in pulmonary circulatory dynamics re-sulted from an intramuscular injection of epineph-rine into a human. This aim was primarily clini-cal; therefore, dose, route of administration, and drug preparation were those commonly employed in therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The patients were chosen at random from the medical and surgical chest services at Lawson VA Hospital. In age they ranged from 20 to 55 years. The average age was 31 years. All were male. Diagnoses and a sum-mary of data are listed in Table I. None had clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease. With the exception of Cases 1, 2, 12, and 13, the pulmonary lesions were so sharply localized or limited in degree that no significant disturbance in the pulmonary circulation was suspected. The experiments dealing with intravenous and intra-muscular injection of epinephrine were performed on these 13 patients in the post absorptive state. The epinephrine 2 was a U. S. P. preparation and is said by its manufacturer to be a synthetic material, to exist 100 per cent in the levo-rotatory form as a hydrochloride, and to contain no traces of nor-epinephrine. 1 Reviewed in the Veterans Administration and pub-lished with the approval of the Chief Medical Director.

40|$|In {{considering}} {{the relation of}} circulatory factors to the hemo-respiratory incompetence of emphysema, attention has usually been focused on possible defects in the pulmonary circulation. Less {{attention has been paid}} to factors which hinder the return flow of venous blood. Consideration of all the evidence does not seem to justify this emphasis, and the increased intrapleural pressure which has been observed in functional emphysema indicates that the difficulty may arise from changed intrathoracic pressure quite as much as from changes in the lungs themselves. Evidence from experimental data and inferences from a consideration of the pathology of emphysema support the assumption that when there is obstructed expiration the obvious circulatory impairment is due to change in the <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation.</b> Pathologists agree that there is a diminution in the capillary bed in the lungs in emphysema, a fact which has led to the belief that there must be increased resistance to blood flow through the organ. Friedman and Jackson (1) partially obstructed expiration in dogs and found an increase in the carbon dioxide content of the alveolar air and in the blood. They attributed their results to interference of blood flow through the pulmonary capillaries, a condition supposedly resulting because the intrabronchial pressure was greater than the capillary pressure during the expiratory phase. Heinbecker (2) demonstrated that with inflation of the excised lungs of a cat by positive pressure he could decrease the flow of perfused blood. Lichtheim (3) has shown that the pulmonary capillary bed can be greatly diminished by ligation of the pulmonary artery of one lung with no change in the pul-monary blood pressure. Kountz, Alexander and Dowell (4) studied the effect of partial ob-struction of the expiration of dogs over a period of weeks. They found that as the lungs became larger the intrapleural pressure increased and that venous pressure varied directly with the pressure changes in the pleural cavity. These observations point to the possibility that periph...|$|E
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} an attempt to develop a thin airfoil theory for an airfoil which spans the gap between a pair of stream {{surfaces}} which are slowly diverging or converging, the motivation being to predict, theoretically, the effect of varying axial velocity on cascade performance of axial flow compressor rows. The procedure involves, firstly, derivation of approximate equations satisfied by suitably defined average potentials and stream functions in such quasi two-dimensional flows. The flow is assumed to be inviscid, irrotational, and incompressible, but as will be argued later, the quasi two-dimensional type equations also result from less restrictive assumptions. Next, fundamental solutions to these equations, corresponding to bound, line sources and vortices, are found. A distribution of such solutions is used to formulate the airfoil problem, using the condition that the flow be tangential to the airfoil contour. The vorticity distribution appears as the solution to a singular integral equation, which is solved by an approximate method. Simple yet physically realistic assumptions are made concerning the gap width {{as a function of the}} streamwise length, to obtain numerical results for the effect of contraction of the stream surfaces. Varying degrees of approximation, later discussed, are used in the calculation procedures. A wide variety of the location and the extent of the contraction, with respect to the airfoil, is investigated. In all cascade calculations the contraction of the stream surfaces was assumed to be in the same direction as the cascade axis. The main conclusions of the thesis can be summarized as below: 1. The theory predicts a <b>lesser</b> <b>circulation</b> round an airfoil in a contracting flow as compared to the circulation round the same airfoil in a plane flow. There is a similar reduction of circulation for a cascade of airfoils. The percentage reduction of circulation is greater for the cascade case as compared to the isolated case, assuming the contractions to be geometrically similar in both cases. The effect on the circulation of contractions, considered physically reasonable in extent and magnitude, either fully upstream or fully downstream of the airfoil, is quite small. 2. As a very rough rule of thumb, it may be stated that the reduction of circulation as compared to the two-dimensional theory, in the range of parameters applicable to compressors, has about the same magnitude as the reduction of gap between the stream surfaces taking place across the airfoil chords. 3. In a comparison with fixed mean angle of attack, the change in flow turning and deviation angles of the flow are much smaller than changes of circulation and may be stated to be of the order of one degree or less for contraction extents and magnitudes considered realistic for compressor cascades...|$|E
