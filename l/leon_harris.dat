40|$|Determining the {{position}} and order of contigs and scaffolds from a genome assembly within an organism’s genome remains a technical challenge in a majority of sequencing projects. In order to exploit contemporary technologies for DNA sequencing. We developed a strategy for whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism sequencing allowing {{the position}}ing of sequence contigs onto a linkage map using the bin mapping method. The strategy was tested on a draft genome of the fungal pathogen Venturia inaequalis, the causal agent of apple scab, and further validated using sequence contigs derived from the diploid plant genome Fragaria vesca. Using our novel method {{we were able to}} anchor 70 % and 92 % of sequences assemblies for V. inaequalis and F. vesca, respectively, to genetic linkage maps. We demonstrated the utility of this approach by accurately determining the bin map positions {{of the majority of the}} large sequence contigs from each genome sequence and validated our method by mapping single sequence repeat markers derived from sequence contigs on a full mapping population.

5000|$|... ==Background== [...] "Beggin' on Your Knees" [...] is {{the fourth}} single {{released}} from the soundtrack Victorious: Music from the Hit TV Show (2011), for the television series {{of the same name}} on Nickelodeon. It was first heard on the series's second season debut episode,"Beggin' on Your Knees", which premiered on April 2, 2011 in North America, a day after the single's release. The song was performed by Justice with backup dancers in the episode. After learning of her new partner's agenda, Tori Vega (Justice) enlists the help of Andre <b>Harris</b> (<b>Leon</b> Thomas III) to write and produced the song. The scene where the song was performed features Justice with her partner Ryder Daniels (Ryan Rottman) on stage. As Ryder is about to start singing, he recognizes that his microphone is not functioning. Tori continues singing, making gestures at him with the spotlight flashing on him the entire time, indicating who the song is written about.

40|$|A {{series of}} new neutral {{mononuclear}} or dinuclear gold(I) complexes and a cyclic cationic tetranuclear amidogold(I) complex comprising of the phosphines 1, 2 - bis(dimethylphosphino) ethane (dmpe), μ- 1, 2 –bis(diphenylphosphino) ethane (dppe), μ- 1, 3 - bis(diphenylphosphino) propane (dppp), μ- 1, 5 -bis(diphenylphosphino) pentane (dpppe), μ- 1, 6 - bis(diphenylphosphino) hexane (dpph) or trimethylphosphine, and several N-heterocyclic ring systems (imidazolate, pyrazolate, 1, 2, 3 -triazolate, 1, 2, 4 -triazolate, pyrrolate, 9 H-purine- 9 -ate or 9 H-purine- 6 -amine- 9 -ate) as ligands, reveal intermolecular aurophilic interactions and 2 D channels available for solvent molecules {{in some of}} their crystal structures. The antitumour activity of the acyclic gold(I) compounds is highly dependent on the substituents on the phosphorus atoms being highest for phenyl groups and lower for methyl groups. The activity of these compounds against selected cell lines {{is linked to the}} length of the carbon bridge between the two phosphorus atoms being highest with a bridge consisting of 5 or 6 carbons. Two compounds with the highest tumour specifities that contain dpppe and pyrazolate (a lipophilic compound) or 1, 2, 4 -triazolate (a hydrophilic compound) induce the apoptic cell death pathway and tolerate a maximum dose of 1. 5 μmol/kg when administered to Balb/C mice.
