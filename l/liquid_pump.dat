50|$|Typically, a <b>liquid</b> <b>pump</b> can't simply draw air. The {{feed line}} of the pump and the {{internal}} body surrounding the pumping mechanism must first be filled with the liquid that requires pumping: An operator must introduce liquid into the system to initiate the pumping. This is called priming the pump. Loss of prime is usually due to ingestion of air into the pump. The clearances and displacement ratios in pumps for liquids, whether thin or more viscous, usually cannot displace air due to its compressibility.

40|$|Vapor {{compression}} {{heat pumps}} which employ working fluid mixtures rather than pure substances offer significant advantages leading to larger temperature lifts at low pressure ratios or to completely new applications. The main feature of such cycles {{is the fact}} that the working fluid mixture does not evaporate completely in the evaporator. The remaining liquid phase is then recirculated by means of a <b>liquid</b> <b>pump</b> into the condenser. This yields significant improvements compared to conventional systems: -Adjustable gliding temperature intervals in desorber and absorber by merely adjusting the flow rate through the <b>liquid</b> <b>pump</b> and/or ?Dramatically reducing pressure ratios (to typically 45 % of the one for a single working fluid heat pump) for a given temperature lift due to staging of the solution circuit. The latter is accomplished when a two-stage version of this cycle is used.

40|$|AbstractSodium {{borohydride}} (NaBH 4) {{has drawn}} a great attention {{as a high}} hydrogen storage density material. Catalytic hydrolysis has been widely used to extract hydrogen from NaBH 4 alkaline solution but is still problematic {{in terms of the}} catalyst durability and byproduct disposal. In the present study, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) was used as a catalytic solution and the NaBH 4 solid particles were stored in a reacting chamber. The NaHCO 3 solution was injected when the hydrogen is needed. The rate of hydrogen production was measured as various conditions such as the temperature, NaHCO 3 concentration and injection speed. The hydrogen production was initiated immediately when the NaHCO 3 solution was injected. The rate of hydrogen production and NaBH 4 conversion increased with increasing the NaHCO 3 concentration but decreased with increasing the injection speed of NaHCO 3 solution. Based on the above results, a prototype of hydrogen generation system was developed. The system consisted of a chamber containing solid NaBH 4 particles, an aqueous NaHCO 3 chamber, a <b>liquid</b> <b>pump,</b> valves, cooling fans and sensors. The <b>liquid</b> <b>pump</b> supplied the NaHCO 3 solution to the NaBH 4 chamber through an injector. The temperature and pressure of the NaBH 4 chamber were monitored during the reaction. The temperature and pressure were maintained into 70 oC and 2 bar, respectively. The <b>liquid</b> <b>pump</b> was stopped when the pressure reached 2 bar. The <b>liquid</b> <b>pump</b> was restarted to generate hydrogen when the pressure was less than 2 bar because the fuel cell consumed hydrogen during the operation.

40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} may {{be applied to}} drive {{refrigeration}} and air-conditioning systems, e. g. solar radiation, geothermal resources, heat derived from biomass or waste heat rejected form various thermal processes. In this case absorption refrigeration systems and ejection systems {{may be used for}} cooling applications. In both these systems the crucial problemÂ is the development of a suitable <b>liquid</b> <b>pump.</b> Â Energy consumption to drive these systems is not a major problem here as in most cases amount of energy required to drive a mechanical pump is a contribution of at most a few percent of the overall energy balance of the system and in most cases is of the order of magnitude 1 %. Therefore the most important problem is a special difficulty to select of a commercially available <b>liquid</b> <b>pump</b> for the thermal driven cycle (absorption or ejection one). Such pumps should be low cost, small size and should produce sufficiently high compression rate for the discussed applications. They should also be adapted to work in particularly hard operating conditions resulting from the application in the discussed systems low boiling fluids: these are high penetrating substances, most of them are chemically aggressive and high susceptible to erosion caused by cavitation destruction. Under present conditions most of the pumps that could be applied have inadequate overall dimensions as well as are very expensive so the contribution {{of the cost of the}} relevant pump is dominant in the total cost of the system. As an effect refrigeration systems driven by renewable thermal sources are commercially unprofitable and unattractive. Â Mechanical <b>liquid</b> <b>pump</b> liquid is the only element of the refrigeration system that consume electric power. Â Therefore it is also desirable that the whole system would be fully thermal driven one, without consumption of electric power to drive. The above is another important condition to search for the alternative solution for that would be competitive to mechanical classic liquid pumps. Two-phase vapour-liquid ejectors may be thought as required alternative. The general motivations of application of the two-phase injector instead of a mechanical pump in the discussed systems are: â€¢Â Â Â two-phase injector is driven by part of vapor that is generated already in the system; in this case the refrigerationÂ system is fully thermal driven; â€¢Â Â Â two-phase injector operates also as pre-heater of liquid phase supplied to the vapour generator that additionallyÂ improve the system efficiency; â€¢Â Â Â this type of injector is more simple and reliable than mechanical <b>liquid</b> <b>pump</b> since it has no moving parts. Â Â Â Paper deals with experimental investigation of two-phase vapour-liquid injector as a <b>liquid</b> <b>pump</b> in refrigeration systems. The selected experiment results for the injector are presented for the case of isobutane as working fluid.
