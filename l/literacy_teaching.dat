In Charles Bazerman’s essay, “The Case for Writing Studies as a Major Discipline,” he states “multimodal compositions are seen in the classrooms across the country but {{there seems to be a}} lack of support from the institutions to advance what the instructors are bringing into the classroom." [...] The idea of learning has changed over the years and now, some argue, must adapt to the personal and affective needs of new students. According to Kress and Bezemer, “education has to accommodate to ‘life-long’, ‘life-wide’ learning, that is, learning at all times, by those who demand that their interests be taken with utmost seriousness, in all sites, in all phases of professional and personal life.” As a result, some administrations may be reluctant to institute wide-spread change without assurance of results. In order for classroom communities to be legitimately multimodal, all members of the community must share expectations about what can be done with through integration, requiring a [...] "shift in many educators’ thinking about what constitutes <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning in a world no longer bounded only by print text." ...|$|E
2500|$|Austin Area School District {{was awarded}} a $276,518 {{competitive}} literacy grant. It {{is to be used}} to improve reading skills birth through 12th grade. The district was required to develop a lengthy literacy plan, which included outreach into the community. The funds come from a Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, also referred to as the Keystones to Opportunity grant [...] It is a five-year, competitive federal grant program designed to assist local education agencies in developing and implementing local comprehensive literacy plans. Of the 329 pre-applications by school districts reviewed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, School District was one of only 148 entities that were invited to submit a full application. In Potter County 1 school district was awarded funding for the first year. The funds must be used for teacher training, student screening and assessment, targeted interventions for students reading below grade level and research-based methods of improving classroom instruction and practice. Districts must hire literacy coaches. The coaches work with classroom teachers to enhance their <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> skills. Pennsylvania was among six other states, out of the 35 that applied, to be awarded funding. Pennsylvania received $38 million through the federal program. The Department of Education reserved 5% of the grant for administration costs at the state level.|$|E

40|$|In Scotland adult <b>literacies</b> <b>teaching</b> treats {{language}} and literacy as social practices rather than discrete skills. There {{is a concern}} to acknowledge literacies practices that are diverse, cultural and situated. This embodies an informal, cooperative and constructivist approach to adult <b>literacies</b> learning and <b>teaching.</b> The role of the adult literacies teacher therefore is constructed {{as a means of}} engaging with the plurality of such literacies practices in communities. An adult <b>literacies</b> <b>teaching</b> course has been piloted in Scotland by a partnership group comprising three Universities and one Further Education College. Using a blended learning approach, class-room, work-based and on-line learning are aligned in the interests of continuous professional development for participants who are experienced but unqualified adult literacies tutors. The focus in teaching therefore is not on transmission but on elaborating on experiential learning, building critical reflection through shared activities and has seen the creation of both a real life and on-line community of practice. This session will seek to elaborate on the principles of the course, highlighting the successes, tensions and problems associated with this approach. The efficacy of collaborative learning and critical reflection in the context of social practices in adult literacies will be discussed. The creative tensions of matching student expectation, policy demands and the demands of the economy will be elaborated as means of questioning whether the grit in the oyster is resulting in pearls of practice...|$|R

In-depth interviews were conducted to learn about <b>teaching</b> <b>literacy</b> to ELLs among experienced, mainstream elementary teachers in the Midwest and South. Three shared experiences emerged: a) teachers negotiated a range of personal emotions, b) teachers drew on relationships as resources, and c) teachers perceptions of literacy for ELLs evolved. Findings indicated that participants realized they will probably have ELLs in their classrooms and teaching ELLs can be challenging yet satisfying. As the ELL population continues to grow, teachers will need to rely on others to help ELLs overcome their struggles with <b>literacy</b> development. <b>Teaching</b> <b>literacy</b> to ELLs is a process of discovery and teachers need to be open for potential changes in perceptions that will help them provide more effective literacy instruction.
