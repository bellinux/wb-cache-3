Concerned with that {{effects of these}} recommendations on <b>light</b> <b>levels,</b> the Governor's Office to Energy Resources asked the Georgia Tech Research Institute to quantify the change in <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> This paper summarizes the study and its findings, and suggests what conditions favor the use of reflectors. The study found that installing specular reflectors in fluorescent fixtures accompanied by 50 percent delamping resulted in reduced <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> of 60 to 80 percent of design <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> The continuous row fixtures in the study showed the greatest variation in <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> raging from 52 percent between rows to 80 percent under rows {{for an average of}} nearly 70 percent. <b>Light</b> <b>levels</b> in rooms with fixtures on an even grid spacing ranged from 73 percent between fixtures to 86 percent under fixtures for room averages of 75 to 80 percent.

5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the <b>light</b> <b>level</b> required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
5|$|Corals are sessile {{animals in}} the class Anthozoa and differ from most other cnidarians in not having a medusa stage in their life cycle. The body unit of the animal is a polyp. Most corals are colonial, the initial polyp budding to produce another and the colony {{gradually}} developing from this small start. In stony corals, also known as hard corals, the polyps produce a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate to strengthen and protect the organism. This is deposited by the polyps and by the coenosarc, the living tissue that connects them. The polyps sit in cup-shaped depressions in the skeleton known as corallites. Colonies of stony coral are very variable in appearance; a single species may adopt an encrusting, plate-like, bushy, columnar or massive solid structure, the various forms often being linked to different types of habitat, with variations in <b>light</b> <b>level</b> and water movement being significant.|$|E

At scotopic <b>light</b> <b>levels,</b> rivalry alternations were very slow and complete. Suppression spread over much larger areas of the visual field than at photopic <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> As luminances decreased from photopic to scoptopic levels there was a rod-cone break for binocular rivalry. Mean suppression durations became abruptly greater as <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> dropped below those allowing the cones to be active. Horizontal disparities allowing fusion were 4 to 6 times greater at scotopic than at photopic <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> Binocular vision at scotopic luminances was sluggish and of low resolution.

40|$|This {{research}} examined whether {{provision of}} information on the environmental impact of street lighting affects the acceptability and perceived social safety of reduced street <b>lighting</b> <b>levels.</b> We argued that such information should particularly affect acceptability and safety judgements of individuals who value these environmental benefits, that is, those with strong biospheric values. Participants viewed virtual representations of a residential street where street <b>lighting</b> <b>levels</b> were varied. As expected, low <b>lighting</b> <b>levels</b> were seen as more acceptable, while high <b>lighting</b> <b>levels</b> were seen as less acceptable when information on the environmental impact of street lighting was provided to individuals that strongly endorsed biospheric values. Support for the expectation that these increases in acceptability of lower <b>lighting</b> <b>levels</b> would trigger a process of rationalisation leading individuals with strong biospheric values to downplay consequences opposing value-driven views was mixed. Stronger effects were found when participants could compare different <b>lighting</b> <b>levels</b> directly. The study suggests that value-congruent information on the environmental benefits of reduced street lighting can increase acceptability of reduced street lighting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by vision, as prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures got the same responses from P. schultzi as live prey, and then more detailed testing with the lures showed that: if the target moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; if the target was totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the same spot, P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if a lure was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E

25|$|There are six armor slots: helmet, gauntlets, chest, legs, class item, and {{artifact}} (artifacts {{were added}} with The Taken King). Each class has armor specific {{to them with}} exotic armor that complement a character's sub-class. Each piece of armor increases overall defense. Before The Taken King, class items were only cosmetic (such as the Hunter's cloak) {{and did not have}} any stat or defense boosts. With The Taken King update, class items were given defense that contributes to players' <b>Light</b> <b>level.</b> Players' Ghost companion was also given defense with The Taken King update that contributes to their <b>Light</b> <b>level.</b> In addition to earning gear from loot drops by playing missions and other activities, players can purchase gear from faction vendors. Players can pledge their allegiance to one of three factions — Dead Orbit, Future War Cult, or New Monarchy — and earning enough reputation with a faction allows players to earn and purchase that faction's legendary items.

25|$|Players' {{equipment}} includes {{weapons and}} armor. Legendary and exotic items {{are the best}} items for players' characters, and only one exotic weapon and one exotic armor (excluding exotic class items) can be equipped at one time. There are several different classes of weapons that are categorized as either a primary, special (secondary), or heavy weapon. Several weapons have an elemental damage type. There is Arc (blue), Solar (orange), and Void (purple). All damage types will deplete enemy shields of that type faster, and the weapon will also do extra damage to enemies if the gameplay modifiers 'Arc Burn', 'Solar Burn' or 'Void Burn' are active. The original maximum attack damage for legendary and exotic weapons was 300. This increased to 331 with The Dark Below and 365 with the House of Wolves. Because of the change to the <b>Light</b> <b>level</b> system, The Taken King numerically changed weapons of 365 damage to 170, but with no loss in damage output (365 damage of Year 1 equals 170 damage of Year 2). As with armor, weapons' attack damage contributes to the <b>Light</b> <b>level</b> and all gear can be infused to increase their numbers.|$|E

50|$|Humans see {{differently}} {{at different}} <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> This is because under high <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> typical {{during the day}} (photopic vision), the eye uses cones to process light. Under very low <b>light</b> <b>levels,</b> corresponding to moonless nights without electric lighting (scotopic vision), the eye uses rods to process light.

Photopic vision facilitates excellent color discrimination ability, whereas colors are indiscriminable under scotopic vision. Mesopic vision falls between these two extremes. In most night-time environments, there is enough ambient light at night to prevent true scotopic vision.|$|R

25|$|The {{forward-facing}} {{eyes of a}} bird of prey give binocular vision, {{which is}} assisted by a double fovea. The raptor's adaptations for optimum visual resolution (an American kestrel can see a 2–mm insect {{from the top of}} an 18–m tree) has a disadvantage in that its vision is poor in low <b>light</b> <b>level,</b> and it must roost at night. Raptors may have to pursue mobile prey in the lower part of their visual field, and therefore do not have the lower field myopia adaptation demonstrated by many other birds. Scavenging birds like vultures do not need such sharp vision, so a condor has only a single fovea with about 35,000 receptors mm2. Vultures, however have high physiological activity of many important enzymes to suit their distant clarity of vision.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{discussion}} {{as to whether}} achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in The Island of the Colorblind by Oliver Sacks, some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, {{it may be that}} some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the <b>light</b> <b>level</b> during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color. One common trait is hemeralopia or blindness in full sun. In patients with achromatopsia, the cone system and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using full cutoff roadway lights to combat light pollution {{has also been}} called into question. According to design investigations, luminaires with full cutoff distributions (as opposed to cutoff or semi cutoff, compared here) have to be closer together to meet the same <b>light</b> <b>level,</b> uniformity and glare requirements specified by the IESNA. These simulations optimized the height and spacing of the lights while constraining the overall design to meet the IESNA requirements, and then compared total uplight and energy consumption of different luminaire designs and powers. Cutoff designs performed better than full cutoff designs, and semi-cutoff performed better than either cutoff or full cutoff. This indicates that, in roadway installations, over-illumination or poor uniformity produced by full cutoff fixtures may be more detrimental than direct uplight created by fewer cutoff or semi-cutoff fixtures. Therefore, the overall performance of existing systems could be improved more by {{reducing the number of}} luminaires than by switching to full cutoff designs.|$|E
