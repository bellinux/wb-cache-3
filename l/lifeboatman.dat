25|$|Tourism {{developed}} in the town during the Victorian period and is now {{an important part of}} the local economy. The town is a popular resort and acts as a touring base for the surrounding area. The coastal location means that beach holidays and fishing are important, with the beach and pier being major draws. Visitor attractions within the town include Cromer Pier and the Pavilion Theatre on the pier. Close to the town's pier the RNLI Henry Blogg Museum is housed inside the early 21st century Rocket House. The museum has the Cromer Lifeboat H F Bailey III (ON 777) as its centrepiece and illustrates the history of the town's lifeboats and <b>lifeboatman</b> Henry Blogg's most famous rescues.|$|E
500|$|During World War I, {{lifeboat}} crews launched 1,808 times, rescuing 5,332 people. With many {{younger men}} on active service, {{the average age}} of a <b>lifeboatman</b> was over 50. Many launches were to ships that had been torpedoed or struck mines, including naval or merchant vessels on war duty; a notable example was the hospital ship [...] which foundered in 1914 and was attended by six lifeboats, saving 144 lives over a 50-hour rescue mission.|$|E
500|$|In May 1908, four fish {{warehouses}} on the quayside {{designed by}} Thorvald Bindesbøll were opened. In 1932, {{on the occasion}} of the harbour's 25th anniversary, Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen's statue of the fisherman and <b>lifeboatman</b> was unveiled.

500|$|The most {{decorated}} <b>lifeboatman</b> was Henry Blogg, coxswain of [...] for 37 years, {{with three}} gold medals and four silver. He also received the George Cross and the British Empire Medal {{and is known}} as [...] "The Greatest of all Lifeboatmen". The youngest recipient was Frederick Carter (11) who with Frank Perry (16) was awarded a Silver Medal for a rescue at Weymouth in 1890. Other notable lifeboatmen include Henry Freeman of Whitby, coxswain for 22 years, Robert William Hook (1828–1911), coxswain at Lowestoft from 1853 to 1883 and credited with saving over 600 lives plus two dogs and a cat, Henry [...] "Shrimp" [...] Davies, coxswain of the Cromer Lifeboat with 45 years service and James Haylett, coxswain of Caister-on-Sea. One lifeboat has received an award: for the Daunt lightship rescue in 1936, the RNLB Mary Stanford and her entire crew were decorated (see illustration in history section, above).|$|E
500|$|The {{fishing harbour}} was built between 1904 and 1907, with {{inner and outer}} {{sections}} established {{under the supervision of}} hydraulic engineer Palle Bruun. The official inauguration was on 20 November 1907. The distinctive warehouses next to the harbour were designed by Thorvald Bindesbøll, and opened in May 1908. In 1932, {{on the occasion of the}} harbour's 25th anniversary, Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen's statue of the fisherman and <b>lifeboatman</b> was unveiled. The harbour was expanded to the east between 1935 and 1938, and in the 1950s an 11 million krone (kr) expansion took place to the west, increasing the off-shore area by [...] and the on-shore area by [...] Between 1964 and 1979 the harbour was further expanded towards the east in a 35 million kr project to facilitate growth at the port, doubling the size of the harbour and providing new facilities for auctioning the catches from the 400 fishing boats registered in Skagen.|$|E
500|$|In the 1930s, {{development}} of the town as a tourist attraction led {{to the opening of}} new hotels. In 1931, the residents of Skagen and their famous friends campaigned for a monument to be established on the square in the town, commemorating the fishermen and lifeboatmen of Jutland. Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen was commissioned to erect a [...] bronze statue of a <b>lifeboatman</b> in garb, holding a lifeline. The monument was showcased at the Free Exhibition Hall in Copenhagen in the spring of 1931, before fundraising enabled it to be brought by sea to Skagen on 10 November 1932. In October 1938, lightning struck the Skagens Badehotel, affecting the wing with the salons and music rooms. During World War II, the hotel was taken over by the Germans, until it was demolished in 1943. Further facilities were developed in the 1950s. From the 1960s, housing estates were constructed to the north, forming a built-up area extending to Højen. Anna and Michael Ancher's house was opened as a museum (1967) and the new town hall was completed in 1969. The Skagen Festival was founded in 1971, making it the oldest music festival in the country. The primary genre is folk music. In 1977, Drachmanns House was broken into and four paintings were stolen, and then in 1980, a painting by Christian Krohg was stolen from Skagens Museum.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{incorrectly}} {{quoted from}} his {{testimony to the}} coroner at the inquest into the disaster, the phrase [...] "Caister men never turn back" [...] has endured through the years to represent not only {{the spirit of the}} Caister Lifeboat crews but those of <b>lifeboatmen</b> throughout the RNLI. During the inquest [...] "Old Jimmy" [...] was asked whether the <b>lifeboatmen</b> of the Beauchamp might have abandoned the rescue and returned for shore. James' reply was unequivocal; [...] "They would never give up the ship. If they had to keep at it ‘til now, they would have sailed about until daylight to help her, Going back is against the rules when we see distress signals like that." [...] These words, when reported by journalists, became the famous [...] "Never turn Back" [...] motto adopted by <b>lifeboatmen</b> to this day.|$|R

500|$|The shipwrecks continued, nonetheless, {{with one}} of the most {{profitable}} of all being the 1931 wreck of the 6,000-ton Danish freighter Pennsylvania on the neighbouring island of Swona. The vessel was plundered by the inhabitants of Stroma, Swona and South Ronaldsay. Much of her cargo of slot machines, spark plugs, clothing, tobacco, watches and car parts was looted and concealed in haystacks, oatfields, lochs and caves. David Stogdon, a <b>lifeboatman,</b> recalled seeing what the islanders did with their illicit salvage: [...] "Every house was stuffed with wreck ... clocks, telescopes, binnacles... I seem to remember enormous dining-room tables in small cottages. And then of course from time to time they'd have cargo parts of lorries or something like that which could be put together to make a lorry and taken ashore on two or three fishing boats in calm weather. They'd land it quietly somewhere, drive it along and sell it." [...] Customs officers, policemen, coastguards and Receivers of Wreck were not generally welcome – the island had no police force – and the islanders let it be understood that unfortunate things could happen to the boats of unwanted visitors: [...] "Police boats could go missing, develop an unexpected leak or spontaneously combust." [...] The area still presents hazards to passing ships; in January 1993, the Danish coaster Bettina Danica ran aground off the southern end of Stroma. The wreck was broken apart by the action of the sea in 1997 and only her stern section is still visible.|$|E
