500|$|In 1889, a {{new plan}} was {{announced}} for the building: a thick-walled brick tower, 16 stories high, devoid of ornamentation and suggestive of an Egyptian pylon. Brooks insisted that the building have no projections, for which reason the plan did not include bay windows, but Aldis argued that more rentable space would be created by projecting oriel windows, which {{were included in the}} final design. The Monadnock's final height was calculated to be the highest economically viable for a <b>load-bearing</b> <b>wall</b> design, requiring walls [...] thick at the bottom and [...] thick at the top. Greater height would have required walls of such thickness that they would have reduced the rentable space too greatly. The final height was much dithered over by the owners, but a decision was forced when the city proposed an ordinance restricting the height of buildings to [...] To protect future income potential, Aldis sought a permit for a 16-story building immediately.

50|$|The free plan, as {{it relates}} to {{architecture}} refers to an open plan with non <b>load-bearing</b> <b>walls</b> dividing interior space. In this structural system, the building structure is separate of the interior partitions.

50|$|Walls: The {{common use}} of curtain walls or door panels to {{delineate}} rooms or enclose a building, {{with the general}} de-emphasis of <b>load-bearing</b> <b>walls</b> in most higher class construction.

25|$|One common {{feature of}} skyscrapers is a steel {{framework}} from which curtain walls are suspended, rather than <b>load-bearing</b> <b>walls</b> of conventional construction. Most skyscrapers have a steel frame that {{enables them to}} be built taller than typical <b>load-bearing</b> <b>walls</b> of reinforced concrete. Skyscrapers usually have a particularly small surface area of what are conventionally thought of as walls. Because the <b>walls</b> are not <b>load-bearing</b> most skyscrapers are characterized by surface areas of windows made possible by the concept of steel frame and curtain wall. However, skyscrapers can also have curtain walls that mimick conventional walls and have a small surface area of windows.|$|R
50|$|A <b>load-bearing</b> <b>wall</b> or {{bearing wall}} is a wall that bears {{the weight of the}} house above said wall, resting upon it by {{conducting}} its weight to a foundation structure.

50|$|Load-bearing {{walls are}} one of the {{earliest}} forms of construction. The development of the flying buttress in Gothic architecture allowed structures to maintain an open interior space, transferring more weight to the buttresses instead of to central bearing walls.

5000|$|On July 14, 1902, the 323 foot St Mark's Campanile in Venice, Italy {{collapsed}} {{after its}} northern <b>load-bearing</b> <b>wall</b> began {{to separate from}} the main structure. The cause of the separation was attributed to over 700 years of wear on the structure, including fires, earthquakes, and stress-redistribution, primarily from drying-induced shrinkage on the wooden support beams, the bells themselves swaying back and forth, and creep. No one was injured except for a cat belonging to a caretaker. The tower was a stonemasonry design.|$|E
