5|$|The player kills enemies {{by firing}} daggers from their fingers. There are two firing options: {{clicking}} the <b>left-mouse</b> <b>button</b> fires a shotgun-like blast of daggers {{with a wide}} spread, and holding the mouse button down fires a precise, continuous stream of daggers. Some enemies have weak spots indicated by red crystals on their bodies. Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can be gathered by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers. The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy or falling off the stage. At {{the top of the}} screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough has lasted. The player's best survival time is published on a global leaderboard. Accessed via the leaderboard, replays of playthroughs can be downloaded and watched from either a first-person view or a top-down perspective.|$|E

40|$|Task The first {{experiment}} {{compared the}} three methods {{and the traditional}} method in an abstract one-dimensional task {{similar to that used}} by Accot and Zhai (2002). The experimental interface consisted of a six-pixel diameter dot placed some distance from the six-pixel wide grey target line {{in the middle of the}} window (Figure 1 a). Participants clicked on the dot to start each task and then acquired the line as quickly as possible. Software logged the time between clicking the dot and acquiring the target. Acquiring the target involved clicking on the line (for normal and sticky targets), clicking on the line or expanded bubble (for bubble targets), or goal-crossing the line with the <b>left-mouse</b> <b>button</b> held down. Software also logged all missed clicks and all mouse movement...|$|E
