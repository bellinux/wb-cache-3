The painters {{had to deal with}} lead paint, so worker had to have a lead abatement area to lessen lead poisoning. A minimal amount of damaged siding and trim was replaced to maintain the historic nature of the house. When paint was sprayed, it had to be back brushed to keep the hand-painted look.

He previously used Ampeg amplifiers with Ampeg 8 x 10" [...] loaded cabinets made with real wood, but had switched to Basson cabinets prior to their going out of business. [...] The Basson cabinets were notoriously heavy (typically running 230–250lbs), using medium density fiberboard covered with indoor-outdoor carpeting and loaded with Chinese Firestorm 1075 speakers (10"/75 oz magnets) and neoprene surrounds. [...] Many of these cabinets were painted red with <b>latex</b> <b>paint</b> to match tour themes. [...] Basson gave Sixx the cabinets in a marketing move to sell to metal-playing bassists, a very limited market. [...] Basson went out of business in 2010. While recording The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack, he used a 1959 Fender Precision which was amplified through a 1964 Fender Bassman.

50|$|Water-based acrylic paints were {{subsequently}} sold as <b>latex</b> house <b>paints,</b> as <b>latex</b> is the technical {{term for a}} suspension of polymer microparticles in water.

Exterior <b>latex</b> house <b>paints</b> may also be a co-polymer blend, but the best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic, due to elasticity and other factors. Vinyl, however, costs half of what 100% acrylic resins cost, and PVA (polyvinyl acetate) is even cheaper, so paint companies make many different combinations of them to match the market.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{graphically}} that the monodisperse resins give rise to higher LCPVC values than polydispersed resins, which ultimately allows the coatings formulator to propose <b>latex</b> <b>paints</b> with higher PVCs and therefore coatings with a better cost/benefit relationship. The LCPVC model {{is a function of}} the particle size ratio between the resin and the pigmentary system, so the equation which has been derived in the work is not a function of any OAI value of the pigmentary system. There is a relatively successful model to calculate the CPVC (critical pigment volume concentration) in solvent-based paints as a function of the OAI, but there is no similar successful one for <b>latex</b> <b>paints,</b> reflecting the deep physical-chemical differences between both coating systems. Previous models proposed for latex systems may be considered unreliable because they are proposed as a function of the OAI, while this model can better represent the particles' condition (pigment as much as resin) at the LCPVC, although it could be subject to some future refinements...|$|R

50|$|The word {{surfactant}} {{is short}} for surface active agent. Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension of a liquid, the interfacial tension between two liquids, or the interfacial tension between a liquid and a solid.

Soluble surfactants are also capable of forming micelles and other aggregate structures in solution, leading to a stabilizing effect in <b>latex</b> <b>paints.</b> Surfactants in paint are used to change many end properties of a dried paint, as well as to emulsify paints in their liquid state.|$|R

50|$|Leather {{painting}} {{differs from}} leather dyeing in that paint remains {{only on the}} surface while dyes are absorbed into the leather.

However, <b>latex</b> <b>paints</b> {{can be used to}} paint such flexible leather items. In the main though, a flat piece of leather, backed with a stiff board is ideal and common, though three-dimensional forms are possible so long as the painted surface remains secured.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the time}} of the Renaissance, {{siccative}} (drying) oil paints, primarily linseed oil, have been the most commonly used kind of paints in fine art applications; oil paint is still common today. However, in the 20th century, water-based paints, including watercolors and acrylic paints, became very popular with the development of acrylic and other <b>latex</b> <b>paints.</b> Milk paints (also called casein), where the medium is derived from the natural emulsion that is milk, were popular in the 19th century and are still available today. Egg tempera (where the medium is an emulsion of raw egg yolk mixed with oil) is still in use as well, as are encaustic wax-based paints. Gouache is a variety of opaque watercolor that was also used in the Middle Ages and Renaissance for manuscript illuminations. The pigment was often made from ground semiprecious stones such as lapis lazuli and the binder made from either gum arabic or egg white. Gouache, also known as 'designer color' or 'body color' is commercially available today.|$|R
30|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) has a {{long history}} of use in {{numerous}} applications in forest products and related industries, including UV stabilization in wood coatings, as an antifouling agent in marine paints, pigment and mold inhibitor in <b>latex</b> <b>paints</b> and in coatings for paper. Eco-toxicity tests from the PAN Pesticide Database state that ZnO is moderately toxic to amphibians and fish, and highly toxic to certain types of zooplankton [1]. ZnO occurs naturally as the mineral zincite and is available commercially as either micron or submicron-sized milled powders or as pyrolyzed nano-sphere dispersions. Zinc is a key component of the wood preservative ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate (ACZA), and many wood-plastic composites are treated with zinc borate [2, 3].|$|R
