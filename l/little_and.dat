5|$|All these {{attempts}} {{to mount a}} combined offensive between the Franks and Mongols were too <b>little</b> <b>and</b> too late. In May 1291, the city of Acre was conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Acre.

But Arghun had died on , and Pope Nicholas died as well in March 1292, putting an end to their efforts towards combined action.|$|E
5|$|Although {{assault by}} the heavily armed sloop HMS Dart proved successful, the fireships {{achieved}} <b>little</b> <b>and</b> various other British craft {{involved in the}} operation {{had little effect on}} the eventual outcome. The French response was disorganised and ineffectual, losing one frigate captured. Three others were almost destroyed, only escaping by cutting their anchor cables and fleeing into the coastal shoals where they ran aground. Although all three frigates were refloated and returned to service, the operation had cost the French heavy casualties. The British force suffered minimal losses, although the exact totals are uncertain. Many of the British officers involved were highly praised and rewarded with promotions and prize money.|$|E
5|$|Broom Pit was {{the deepest}} at , and longest-lasting of the Middleton collieries. In 1896 the Middleton Broom, <b>Little</b> <b>and</b> Middleton Main Pits, all managed by John Neal, {{employed}} over 600 workers. By 1923 just the Broom Pit was working, employing more than 1,000 men and supplying coking, gas and household coal and fireclay to the brickworks. Nearly 900 men were employed there in 1940. At {{the time the}} collieries were nationalised in 1947, the workforce had reduced to 436. Operations at the pit ended in 1968 as the productivity of the colliery declined.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan also first {{accompanied}} Ella Fitzgerald in 1956, {{for around}} a month, including at the Newport Jazz Festival. Later that year he joined trombonist J. J. Johnson, {{with whom he}} recorded several albums in 1957 and then toured Europe. While in Sweden, Flanagan, with bassist Wilbur <b>Little</b> <b>and</b> drummer Elvin Jones, recorded his first album as leader, Overseas. Late in 1957 {{he was part of}} Miles Davis' band for a short period, before returning to Johnson early the following year, for another stay of 10 months. A period leading his own trio in 1958 was followed by joining trombonist Tyree Glenn.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although doctors {{told him that he}} would not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating <b>little,</b> <b>and</b> that only liquids.|$|E

5|$|In April, {{the band}} began demoing material, {{and said they}} were aiming to release a new album later in the year. In August, the band {{announced}} they would be recording in a few weeks' time, and were aiming for a spring 2011 release. After some shows in the summer, the band began recording in October. Eric Valentine produced the sessions at Barefoot Recording in Hollywood, California. Valentine also engineered the sessions with assistance from Cian Riordan. The band used Undertone Audio Consoles during recording. At the start of recording, the group had 18 songs. They whittled this number down little by <b>little,</b> <b>and</b> wrote additional songs at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington. The drums tracks were completed in early October.|$|E
5|$|In February 1834, Etty became seriously ill, and was {{incapacitated}} {{for four}} months. Unable to paint, he exhibited only two already-completed {{paintings in the}} 1834 Summer Exhibition, Elizabeth Potts and The Cardinal. In June of that year he left London to convalesce, renting a cottage in York. Weak and unable to concentrate, Etty painted very <b>little,</b> <b>and</b> spend {{the next few months}} visiting friends and touring the sights of Yorkshire. Gradually regaining his health, he returned to London in December 1834, and resumed work on those paintings he had left incomplete on the onset of his illness.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} the first ever game played by the University of Alabama, a team of Birmingham-area high school players lost to the Cadets 56â€“0 at Birmingham's Lakeview Park. Played on November 11, the game served as a {{practice}} game for Alabama's contest against the Birmingham Athletic Club scheduled for the next day. Although details of the second half are unavailable, touchdowns in the first half were scored by David Grayson, G. H. Kyser, Dan Smith (twice), William <b>Little</b> <b>and</b> T. S. Frazer. The play utilized most throughout the game was a rushing formation developed by Harvard earlier in the season called the flying wedge.|$|E

5|$|Ixodid ticks require three hosts, {{and their}} life cycle {{takes at least}} one year to complete. Up to 3,000 eggs are laid on the ground by an adult female tick. When the larvae emerge, they feed {{primarily}} on small mammals and birds. After feeding, they detach from their host and molt to nymphs on the ground, which then feed on larger hosts and molt to adults. Female adults attach to larger hosts, feed, and lay eggs, while males feed very <b>little</b> <b>and</b> occupy larger hosts primarily for mating.|$|E

The OT ran training courses to improve labour skills.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, {{the first}} {{tropical}} {{depression of the}} season formed to the southwest of Baja California, out of a tropical disturbance that had developed during May 5 within the vicinity of Panama. During May 16 the depression gradually developed, before early {{the next day the}} National Hurricane Centre declared it a tropical storm and named it Andres. The newly named tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h), later that day. After maintaining its peak intensity for 24 hours, Andres started to gradually weaken as upper level windshear over the system increased before it dissipated during May 20. Throughout its life as a tropical cyclone, Andres moved very <b>little</b> <b>and</b> slowly executed a cyclonic loop, while remaining well away from any land.|$|E
