5|$|Antigonid Macedonian kings {{relied on}} various {{regional}} officials to conduct affairs of state. This included high-ranking municipal officials, {{such as the}} military strategos and the politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) of a <b>large</b> <b>city</b> (polis), {{as well as the}} politico-religious office of the epistates. No evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been chosen among the same group of aristocratic philoi and hetairoi who filled vacancies for army officers.|$|E
5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} worn out, {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender {{to the idea of a}} long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a <b>large</b> <b>city</b> without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{was already}} a <b>large</b> <b>city</b> in the Preclassic period. The early history of Calakmul is obscure, {{although}} a dynastic list has been pieced together that extends back into an ancestral past. This dynasty has been reconstructed in part from Late Classic ceramics from the region of great Preclassic cities of El Mirador and Nakbe. This may mean that Calakmul ultimately inherited its political authority from one of these cities, with its dynasty originating in the Late Preclassic in the Mirador Basin and relocating itself to Calakmul in the Classic period {{after the collapse of}} these cities.|$|E

5|$|Further to {{the east}} of Begumpur Masjid, in the Serai Shahji village, Mughal period {{buildings}} are seen of which the Serai Shaji Mahal is a distinguishing monument. The area surrounding this is scattered with decrepit gates, graves and a large slum area. A little distance from this place is the tomb of Shiekh Farid Murtaza Khan, who during Emperor Akbar’s period, was credited with building a number of Serai's, a mosque and Faridabad village, which is now the presentday <b>large</b> <b>city</b> in Haryana.|$|E
5|$|Some {{coastal cities}} {{surrendered}} to the Romans which allowed {{them to have a}} base in the coastal regions of Laconia. Gythium was a <b>large</b> <b>city</b> and had been made by the Spartans as their main port and naval arsenal. The Romans advanced upon the city and they were joined there by the combined Rhodian and Pergamese fleets. The sailors from the Roman, Pergamese and Rhodian fleets built siege engines which had devastating effects on the walls. One of the city's joint commanders, Dexagoridas, offered to surrender the city to the Roman legate in charge of the fleet while Flamininus was gone. When the other commander Gorgopas found out he murdered Dexagoridas.|$|E
5|$|The League of American Bicyclists has rated Colorado as {{the sixth}} most bicycle-friendly {{state in the}} nation for the year 2014.

5|$|The SIRT {{discontinued}} passenger {{service on}} the North Shore Branch to Arlington and the South Beach Branch to Wentworth Avenue at midnight on March 31, 1953 because of city-operated bus competition; the South Beach Branch was abandoned shortly thereafter, while the North Shore Branch continued to carry freight. By 1955, the third rail on both of the lines were removed. On September 7, 1954, SIRT made an application to discontinue all passenger {{service on the}} Tottenville Branch on October 7, 1954. A <b>large</b> <b>city</b> subsidy allowed passenger service on the Tottenville Branch to continue.|$|E
5|$|Athens {{was chosen}} as the Greek capital for {{historical}} and sentimental reasons, not because it was a <b>large</b> <b>city.</b> At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses {{at the foot of the}} Acropolis. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University of Athens (1837, under the name Othonian University), the Athens Polytechnic University (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the National Gardens of Athens (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now the Greek Parliament Building, 1843), and the Old Parliament Building (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion, Due to the negative feelings of the Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the South Lake Union {{neighborhood}} of Seattle, located {{to the north}} of downtown and east of the Seattle Center, was a manufacturing district whose electrical power was supplied by the Broad Street Substation. After the failure of the Seattle Commons plan in the 1990s, which proposed a <b>large</b> <b>city</b> park over the neighborhood, the land was opened for development by Paul Allen's Vulcan Real Estate, which envisioned it as a hub for biotech and high tech firms. Vulcan and Seattle City Light began talks of collaborating to build a $160 million substation in Interbay or South Lake Union in 2003, expecting the additional high tech firms to put a strain on the Broad Street substation and neighborhood lines laid in the early 2000s. In 2005, Seattle City Light determined that adding capacity at the Broad Street substation through new transformer banks would be sufficient for the area's needs until the mid-2010s.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of city populations, the {{resulting}} distribution in a country, a region, or {{the world will be}} characterized by its <b>largest</b> <b>city,</b> with other cities decreasing in size respective to it, initially at a rapid rate and then more slowly. This results in a few <b>large</b> <b>cities</b> and a much <b>larger</b> number of <b>cities</b> orders of magnitude smaller. For example, a rank 3 city would have one-third the population of a country's <b>largest</b> <b>city,</b> a rank 4 city would have one-fourth the population of the <b>largest</b> <b>city,</b> and so on.|$|R
5|$|In November, Seattle averages more {{rainfall}} {{than any}} other U.S. city of more than 250,000 people; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation. Conversely, the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any <b>large</b> <b>city</b> from June to September. Seattle {{is one of the}} five rainiest major U.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation, and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states, along with some cities in the Northeast, Ohio and Michigan. Thunderstorms are rare, as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year. By comparison, Fort Myers, Florida, reports thunder on 93 days per year, Kansas City on 52, and New York City on 25.|$|E
5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a <b>large</b> <b>city</b> dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Prior to federation, {{the various}} Australian colonies could, and often did, charge tariffs on goods {{from the other}} colonies, ostensibly for the {{protection}} of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making goods purchased from Melbourne, the closest <b>large</b> <b>city,</b> more expensive and reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets. In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity. Another item of concern was the lack of adequate river crossings. Along the Riverina the Murray was—and remains—part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney.|$|E

5|$|The city {{expanded}} police protection, even temporarily having volunteer {{police officers}} to assist the three paid officers. Fire protection was expanded in 1882, with the city's first 13 paid firefighters. Former mayor Henry Vollmer accomplished several public works achievements, including large street paving and new sub-divisions being plotted. A <b>large</b> <b>city</b> budget surplus brought {{the creation of the}} Davenport City Hall. After 1900, each mayor brought new agendas for city improvement. Waldo Becker encouraged new railroads for the city. He also promised a more business-like government, in terms of financial responsibility and to depoliticize the police department. In the mid-1920s the city established the first zoning ordinances, electrical traffic signals and street lighting. The city also expanded with the incorporation of the city of Rockingham and the establishment of the Davenport Municipal Airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} legible texts {{referring to}} the kings of the Kaan dynasty come from excavations of the <b>large</b> <b>city</b> of Dzibanche in Quintana Roo, far north of Calakmul. A hieroglyphic stairway depicts bound captives, their names and the dates they were captured together {{with the name of}} king Yuknoom Che'en I, although the exact context of the king's name is unclear - the captives may have been his vassals captured by an enemy or they may have been rulers captured by the king of Calakmul. The dates are uncertain but two of them may fall within the 5th century AD. The nearby Quintana Roo site of El Resbalón has a jumbled hieroglyphic text, including a date in 529, that indicates that the city was within the control of the Kaan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{weight of}} an apothecaries' pound ranged {{generally}} between 300g and 320g, {{slightly less than}} that of a pound in the Roman Empire. An important exception to this rule is that the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was under rule of the Habsburg monarchy 1814–1859 and therefore had the extremely large Habsburg apothecaries' pound of 420g. (See below under Habsburg standard.) E.g. in the <b>large</b> <b>city</b> of Milan the apothecaries' system based on a pound of 326.8g was officially replaced by the metric system as early as 1803, because Milan was part of the Napoleonic Italian Republic. Since the successor of this little state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, fell to Habsburg in 1814 (at a time when even in France the système usuel had been introduced because the metric system was not accepted by the population), an apothecaries' system was officially introduced again, but now based on the Habsburg apothecaries' pound, which weighed almost 30% more.|$|E

5|$|There is epigraphic {{evidence}} from the Hellenistic period and Antigonid dynasty that that the Macedonian kingdom relied on various regional officials to conduct affairs of state. This included a number of high-ranking municipal officials, including the military-rooted strategos and politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) of a <b>large</b> <b>city</b> (polis), but also the politico-religious office of the epistates. Although these were highly influential members of local and regional government, Carol J. King asserts {{that they were not}} collectively powerful enough to formally challenge the authority of the Macedonian king or his right to rule. Robert Malcolm Errington affirms that no evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been picked from the available aristocratic pools of philoi and hetairoi that were used to fill vacancies of officers in the army.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{was born}} Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23, 1944. His father Benjamin died on December 6, 1948; his mother then moved {{the family to}} Little Rock, Arkansas. This move was made {{for a variety of}} reasons, {{including}} escaping the greater cost of living in a <b>large</b> <b>city</b> such as Chicago, the support Veneta's family in Arkansas could provide, and her feeling of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion. Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary at a bank. Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially adopted him on Wesley's 16th birthday. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced that of Wesley's biological father on his birth certificate, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done. Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Jewish activities of the Ku Klux Klan in the southern U.S. Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a Baptist church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.|$|E
