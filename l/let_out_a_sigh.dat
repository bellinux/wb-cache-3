The same feeling of satisfaction prevailed, more recently, when the Court of Appeal of Amsterdam rendered decision in the Miffy case. Both decisions, rendered on appeal, overruled the judgments of first instance, which had given precedence to the protection of intellectual property rights above the user’s freedom of expression in the form of parody. But freedom of expression, and parody in particular, are solidly anchored in the Dutch values and courts more often than not find in favour of the parodist. Apart from the fact that both decisions offer an interesting analysis of where the limit lies between intellectual property protection and artistic freedom, each decision deserves a few words of commentary in view of some noteworthy particularities...|$|E

While the obvious response, “don’t violate the law,” should seemingly resolve that fear, the fact is that many employment lawsuits, such as wage and hour or discrimination cases, are often difficult to defend. This may occur because: (1) the law is unclear; (2) there are shades of gray in employment decisions, (3) it is difficult to ensure compliance in large multistate or multi-national corporations, or (4) sometimes companies face “bad facts” even when they did not violate the law. Although defending the allegations of one employee or even a group is expensive, most employers are able to do this. Defending a class action, however, often requires resources beyond what many employers can marshal. In this paper, we propose a way to avoid such costly litigation: arbitration...|$|E

Ta’i'i was punished {{and was forced to}} climb the coconut tree feet first. As he was {{climbing}} the coconut tree, he <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>sigh</b> because the climb was difficult. Ta'i'i's sighs were overheard by Saveasi'uleo and Nafanua. This made Savesi’uleo angry; consequently he told Nafanua to prepare for war and to cut down the Toa tree. The wood from the tree was to be used to make weapons to drive away the High Chief Lilomaiava and his army. Immediately Nafanua cut down the Toa tree and left it there to dry. A few days later, {{she went back to the}} area where the Toa tree was cut and discovered that the tree attracted lots of Pule (seashells). [...] "E gase toa ae ola pule". Literally this means that the shells are living but the Toa tree is dead.

It takes courage to make wise decisions.|$|R
40|$|I {{followed}} Bang Cep on his nightly {{rounds of}} the food stalls surrounding the bus terminal. This was Bang Cep’s territory and he walked with an exaggerated swaggering confidence. Vendors he approached for their daily ‘protection’ fee greeted him politely, but with their eyes betraying an apprehension bordering on fear. At Pak Dede’s fried tofu stall Bang Cep loudly berated him for his lateness in paying his dues, slamming his ring encrusted hand on the flimsy wooden stall to emphasis the point. Eyes downcast, Pak Dede muttered an apology promising to pay in full, with interest, the next day. Perhaps due to my presence, Bang Cep didn’t follow up with the beatings and ‘bitch slaps’ he was infamous for. I returned to Pak Dede’s warung later that evening for dinner.

50|$|There {{are various}} {{elements}} within the story which make up the atmosphere. The description of the setting, Jijo’s Ocean, portrays the atmosphere as full of wonder and eeriness {{because it is so}} different from what the dolphins are used to. “Though it seemed a bit disloyal, Makanee felt this alien ocean had a silkier texture and finer taste than the waters of Earth, the homeworld she had not seen in years…. Unlike the clamorous sea of Earth, this fallow planet wasn’t supposed to have motor noises permeating its thermal—acoustic layers.” The thoughts of escape that run through Peepoe’s mind bring forth an atmosphere of uneasiness. Peepoe constantly thinks about how to escape from her kidnappers, Zhaki and Mopol, and whether she has any chance of not being caught. “With or without the sled, Zhaki and Mopol could track her down if she just swam away.” The language element is also vital to forming an atmosphere of wonder and inquisitiveness, particularly because there are various languages. “I can’t help feeling guilty, she commented in Underwater Anglic, a language of clicks and squeals that was well suited to a liquid realm where sound ruled over light.” The following quote also supports the importance of the language element in the story’s atmosphere. “Brookida <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> expressive <b>sigh.</b> The elderly geophysicist switched languages, to one more suited for poignant irony.” Intrigue is also part of the atmosphere, specifically when Peepoe “detects signs of something drawing near.” “This time, however, the transition did more than spare her the sled’s noise for a brief time. It also brought forth a new sound. A distant rumble, channeled by the shilly stratum. With growing excitement, Peepoe recognized the murmur of an engine! Yet the rhythms struck her as unlike any she had heard on Earth or elsewhere.” All the above are just short examples of parts in the story that bring <b>out</b> <b>a</b> description of atmosphere. Overall, the atmosphere has much wonder, uneasiness, inquisitiveness and intrigue because of the various story details and elements which portray the atmosphere as such. The particular atmosphere portrayed assists in making everything smooth and more imaginable in the story.|$|R
40|$|One of us (VC) {{was having}} a {{conversation}} with a student recently about the origins and history of thematic analysis (TA). The student had read Qualitative Research in Counselling and Psychotherapy (McLeod, 2011), a text which presents TA as a variant of grounded theory. Victoria commented that she thought that TA evolved from content analysis, and therefore predated grounded theory, and discussed her recent discovery of the use of a variant of TA in psychotherapy research in the 1930 s- 1950 s. The student <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> heavy <b>sigh</b> and slumped in her chair, bemoaning her ability to ever fully grasp qualitative research in all its complexity. This reaction is not uncommon. Students learning and implementing qualitative research at times find it bewildering and challenging; simple models of ‘how to do things’ can appear to offer reassuring certainty. But simplified models, especially if based in confidently-presented-yet-partial accounts of the field or an approach, at best obfuscate and at worst lead to poor quality research. In our discipline (psychology), students typically learn about qualitative research only after they have been fully immersed in the norms, values and methods of scientific psychology. Many find it difficult to let go of what we call a ‘quantitative sensibility’. For such students, and others not well versed in a qualitative sensibility, Fugard and Potts’ (2015) tool for determining sample sizes in TA research has great intuitive appeal; it provides a life-raft to cling to in the sea of uncertainty that is qualitative research. Thus, we share Hammersley’s (2015) concerns that their tool will be used by funding bodies and others (e. g. editors, reviewers) to determine and evaluate sample sizes in TA research. We fear it will result in further confusion about, and further distortion of, the assumptions and procedures of qualitative research. We here build on concerns expressed by others (Byrne, 2015; Emmel, 2015; Hammersley, 2015) to briefly highlight why this quantitative model for qualitative sampling in TA is problematic, based on flawed assumptions about TA, and steeped in a quantitative logic at odds with the exploratory and qualitative ethos of much TA research...|$|R
5000|$|The final Huainanzi {{context is}} a {{well-known}} story about Duke Mu of Qin, Bole, Bole's sons, and Jiufang Gao 九方皋.Duke Mu of Qin addressed Bo Le saying: [...] "You are getting on in years. Is anyone in your family who can take over for you and find me a good steed?" [...] Bo Le replied; [...] "A good horse may be judged by his physique, countenance, sinews, and bones. But in judging the best horse in the world, {{it seems as if}} it is not there at all, as if it has disappeared, as if it had lost its singular identity. A horse like that raises no dust and leaves no tracks. All my sons are lesser talents. They can judge a good horse, but they lack the talent to judge the best horse in the world. However, there is a man who is my porter and firewood gatherer who is called Nine-Cornered Hillock. In judging horses, he is not inferior to my abilities. I respectfully request that you grant him an audience."Duke Mu granted him an audience and commanded him to search <b>out</b> <b>a</b> fine steed. After three months Nine-Cornered Hillock returned and reported: [...] "The horse has been located. It is in Shaqiu." [...] Duke Mu replied: [...] "What kind of horse is it?" [...] "It is a yellow mare," [...] answered Nine-Cornered Hillock. Thereupon Duke Mu sent men to Shaqiu to obtain the horse. The horse, however, turned <b>out</b> to be <b>a</b> black stallion. Duke Mu was quite displeased. Summoning Bo Le, he inquired of him saying: [...] "What a loss! The man you sent to find me a good steed cannot distinguish the color of one coat from another nor a female from a male, what could he possibly know about horses?" [...] Bo Le <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> long <b>sigh</b> and replied: [...] "It always comes to this! This is precisely why he surpasses me by a thousand or ten thousand fold and is infinite in his capabilities. What Hillock observes is dynamism of Heaven. He recognizes the refined essence and discards the dross. He focuses on the internal and disregards the external. He looks at what is to be seen and does not look at what is not to be seen. He scrutinizes what is to be scrutinized and disregards what is not to be scrutinized. It appears that what he has judged is quality more precious than just a horse." [...] The horse arrived and ultimately proved to be an excellent horse. Therefore the Laozi says: [...] "Great straightness is as if bent; great skill is as clumsy." [...] (12, tr. Major et al. 2010:458)The (c. 3rd-4th century CE) Daoist Liezi (tr. Giles 1912:66) repeats this story about Bole recommending Jiufang Gao to Duke Mu. For comparison, [...] "A good horse can be picked out by its general build and appearance. But the superlative horse—one that raises no dust and leaves no tracks—is something evanescent and fleeting, elusive as thin air." ...|$|R
