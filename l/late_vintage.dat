60|$|But many {{disintegrating}} {{forces have}} been {{at work on the}} peasant character, and degeneration is unhappily going on at a greater pace than development. In the wine districts especially, the inability of the small proprietors to bear up under the vicissitudes of the market, or to insure a high quality of wine by running the risks of a <b>late</b> <b>vintage</b> and the competition of beer and cider with the inferior wines, have tended to produce that uncertainty of gain which, with the peasant, is the inevitable cause of demoralization. The small peasant proprietors are not a new class in Germany, but many of the evils of their position are new. They are more dependent on ready money than formerly; thus, where a peasant used to get his wood for building and firing from the common forest, he has now to pay for it with hard cash; he used to thatch his own house, with the help perhaps of a neighbor, but now he pays a man to do it for him; he used to pay taxes in kind, he now pays them in money. The chances of the market have to be discounted, and the peasant falls into the hands of money-lenders. Here is one of the cases in which social policy clashes with a purely economical policy.|$|E

40|$|Gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) and {{gross domestic income}} (GDI) are in theory estimates of the same concept, namely economic production over a defined span of time and space. Yet the two measures are compiled using different source data, and the two measures often give different indications of {{the direction of the}} economy. This raises the issue of which of the two measures is a more accurate estimate of economic production. In this paper we present a time-series statistical framework for addressing this issue. Our findings indicate that the <b>latest</b> <b>vintage</b> of GDP has been a better measure of true output over the 1983 - 2009 period than the <b>latest</b> <b>vintage</b> of GDI. Our model also implies an optimal weighting of GDP and GDI can yield a more accurate estimate of economic output than either GDP or GDI alone. Our empirical findings indicate that a weighting of approximately 60 % to GDP yields the best estimate for the 1983 - 2009 period. When we consider vintages of estimated output, we find that GDI often contains additional information to GDP regarding true output...|$|R

In this paper we try to characterise the revision process of the data of Italian GDP as published by the national statistical office (ISTAT) in the stream of the noise models literature. The analysis shows that this task can be better accomplished by concentrating on the growth rates of the data instead of the levels. Another issue tackled in the paper concerns the informative content of the preliminary releases vis a vis an intermediate vintage supposed to embody all statistical information (or no longer revisable as far as purely statistical changes are concerned) and the <b>latest</b> <b>vintage</b> of the data, {{supposed to be the}} definitive one. The analysis of the news models in differences is based on the comparison of the forecasting performance of the preliminary releases with that of a number of one step ahead forecasts computed from alternative models, ranging from very simple univariate to multivariate specifications based on indicators (bridge models). Results show that, for the intermediate vintage, the preliminary version is the better forecast, while the <b>latest</b> <b>vintage,</b> which embodies statistical as well as definitional revisions, may be better characterised by considering both the preliminary version and the bridge models forecasts. consistent vintages; predictions of 'actual' GDP; preliminary GDP forecasting; real-time data set for Italian GDP...|$|R

50|$|Sunbeam, {{the only}} British {{manufacturer}} committed to international racing {{emerged from the}} Great War well poised to amalgamate with two other firms of notable racing pedigree. Together with Talbot and Darracq they formed the S.T.D. Combine. S.T.D. {{was to become a}} dominant player in Land Speed Records, Grand Prix and Voiturette racing both in Britain and abroad. S.T.D. race cars using identical chassis and engines were to be designated variously as Sunbeam, Talbot or Talbot Darracq in response to the different events or countries they took part in. The highly evolved Experimental Departments in Wolverhampton and Suresnes cooperated on the meticulous development and construction of these fine wholly hand-crafted machines. These zero tolerance racing cars were milled, as it were, from solid billet. Racing program was extensive, tailor made alternative lightweight bodies, specific axle ratios and engines to suit each event were formed. The driving force behind the S.T.D. and its racing program was the charismatic and ingenious Breton Louis Coatalen. Designer, engineer and racer Coatalen was inspired by the belief that ‘Racing improves the breed’. Whilst catapulting S.T.D. to the highest echelons of the sport with numerous successes still legendary today, the costly racing policy may have ultimately led to the demise of the once mighty S.T.D. Combine. Its subsequent merger with the Rootes Group was less than glorious. Conversely it may be that S.T.D.’s loss of direction and withdrawal from racing in the <b>late</b> <b>Vintage</b> period was the real source of their demise.|$|E

The findings obtained during the research can be utilised in practice, too. In accordance with the results and conclusions, we have several practical suggestions. Our methodological suggestion is that the result of the cluster analysis based upon a large number of representative sample should be cross-checked with focus group tests; what is more, upon justification and verification, a detailed analysis of the given segments can also be performed better with this method. It would be worth studying the exact reasons for the popularity of wines with the name â€late vintageâ€. Such types of Tokaj Wine Specialities should be given higher priority in marketing terms.

40|$|I take a {{new look}} at the long-run {{implications}} of taxation through the lens of modern Schumpeterian growth theory. I focus on the <b>latest</b> <b>vintage</b> of models that sterilize the scale effect through a process of product proliferation that fragments the aggregate market into submarkets whose size does not increase with the size of the workforce. I show that the following interventions raise welfare: (a) granting full expensibility of R&D to incorporated firms; (b) eliminating the corporate income tax and/or the capital gains tax; (c) reducing taxes on labor and/or consumption. What makes these results remarkable is that in all three cases the endogenous increase in the tax on dividends necessary to balance the budget has a positive effect on growth. A general implication of my analysis is that corporate taxation plays a special role in Schumpeterian economies and provides novel insights on how to design welfare-enhancing tax reforms. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|If {{machines}} are indivisible, a vintage capital model must {{give rise to}} income inequality. If new {{machines are}} always better than old ones and if society cannot provide everyone with a new machine all of the time, inequality will result. I explore this mechanism in detail. If technology resides in machines and if a firm or worker must use just one technology at a time, a variety of machines will be in use, and workers' productivities will differ. This is because not everyone can be given the <b>latest</b> <b>vintage</b> machine all of the time. Inequality thus originates in the limited capacity of the capital goods sector. If machine quality and skill are complements, a worker who is paired with the best machine will acquire more skill, and inequality persists indefinitely. Moreover, if the used equipment market or the process of labor turnover function without frictions, a perfect positive assignment between the quality of labor and of capital can be maintained by a process of continual reassignment. This serves to enhance the degree of equilibrium inequality. Paradoxically, {{in this type of}} model, free migration of labor across borders raises cross-country inequality instead of lowering it as it does in some other models. (Copyright: Elsevier) ...|$|R

First, does the usefulness of a real-time dataset depend upon which release of data {{we are interested in}} forecasting; and are real-time datasets useful, in general? Second, what are the trade-offs associated with: early release inefficiency; early release measurement error; theimpactthatdefinitional change has on time series consisting of only early releases; and the calibration of prediction models using mixed releases of data, as occurs when one uses the <b>latest</b> <b>vintage</b> of data in recursive real-time forecasting experiments? Third, what is the informational content of the revision process for the variables that we examine (i. e. for output, money, and prices), and when does the revision process increase the predictability of a given release of our variables? In order to answer these questions, we construct a variety of different real-time prediction models, and evaluate their performance in a series of ex-ante prediction experiments that are designed to mimic forecasting approaches that are used when constructing forecasts in real-time for the purpose of policy setting and other sorts of real-time decision making. We also propose a new early release data efficiency test based on our prediction experiments. The test, when used in conjunction with extant rationality tests in the literature, sheds important new light on the issues raised in the three above questions.
