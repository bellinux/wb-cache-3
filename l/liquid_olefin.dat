Catalysis can offer real and potential solutions to the current challenges for a long-term sustainable energy, green chemistry, and environmental protection. In this context, one of the most important and future prosperity promising catalytic applications in the petrochemical field is hydrocarbons metathesis; it consists on the conversion of both renewable and non-petroleum fossil carbon sources to transportation fuels. Olefin metathesis has become one of the standard methodologies for constructing C-C bonds in many organic transformation reactions. This owed to the numerous types of metathesis reactions that have been developed, for example, enyne, ring-opening and closing, self and cross metathesis, etc. But the one step conversion of olefin to alkanes has not been studied much. Recently, only one such a work has been published for the hydro-metathesis of propylene by tantalum hydride supported on KCC- 1 in dynamic reactor. With this knowledge, we thought to study the hydro-metathesis using <b>liquid</b> <b>olefin</b> (1 -decene). Another aspect of using 1 -decene comes from our previous experience on metathesis of n-decane where the first step is the conversion of decane to 1 -decene and subsequently to different chain length alkanes with W-alkyl/alkylidene catalyst. In this way, it would be easy for us to use different catalysts and compare them with parent catalyst concerning TON. We found 100...|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} between liquid targets and plasmas {{provided by a}} d. c. point-to-plane corona device operated under p = 1 atm. are considered {{in terms of both}} Bronsted and Lewis acid-base reactions. The treatments of aqueous solutions by the chargeless species of air or NH 3 plasmas increase the Bronsted acidity of the target, and for an air plasma, the pH decrease is a linear function of the quantity of electricity involved in the discharge. The simplified model proposed for these water-plasma interactions involves water vapour and singlet oxygen. Analytical applications are also developed to determine the area treated by the activated neutrals, with respect to the operating conditions. The treatment of <b>liquid</b> <b>olefins</b> by a CO + H 2 plasma under corona conditions illustrates the Lewis acid-base character of the relevant plasma, and leads to the formation of carbonylated compounds...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{measuring}} the solubility of <b>liquid</b> <b>olefins</b> in solvents containing silver ions has been proposed and tested. The method includes {{the use of a}} stationary membrane contactor containing PDMS-based polymeric membranes. Silver-ion-free solvents that have been selected for experiments (e. g., ethylene glycol and 1. 3 -propanediol) and which are essentially immiscible with olefins are able to dissolve silver nitrate, making it possible for them to absorb olefins due to reversible complexation of silver ions with unsaturated olefinic double bonds. The use of polymeric membranes between the two liquid phases (e. g., olefins and solvents) simplifies the solubility measurement procedure since membranes act as a semipermeable barrier between olefins and solvents. In this study the enthalpy (ΔH°) for the complex formation reaction between 1 -hexene and silver nitrate in ethylene glycol and 1, 3 -propanediol was estimated. It was shown that 1, 3 -propanediol containing silver nitrate has greater sorption capacity for 1 -hexene than ethylene glycol.

25|$|The {{solubility}} {{of different}} species in imidazolium ionic liquids depends mainly on polarity and hydrogen bonding ability. Saturated aliphatic compounds are generally only sparingly soluble in ionic <b>liquids,</b> whereas <b>olefins</b> show somewhat greater solubility, and aldehydes can be completely miscible. This can be exploited in biphasic catalysis, such as hydrogenation and hydrocarbonylation processes, allowing for relatively easy separation of products and/or unreacted substrate(s). Gas solubility follows the same trend, with carbon dioxide gas showing exceptional solubility in many ionic liquids. Carbon monoxide is less soluble in ionic liquids than in many popular organic solvents, and hydrogen {{is only slightly}} soluble (similar to the solubility in water) and may vary relatively little between the more common ionic liquids. Different analytical techniques have yielded somewhat different absolute solubility values.|$|R
40|$|The current {{explanations}} of olefin and vinyl monomer polymerization propose that monomer molecules are successively added {{one by one}} to the growing polymer chain. This may be true if the monomer molecules exist as individual species in a polymerizing system, e. g. in dilute solutions of monomer. There are cases, however, in which monomer molecules are organized: bulk liquid monomer, solid monomer, a monomer monolayer adsorbed on a support, etc. Various supra-molecular species and particles of monomer exist in such cases. In the 1960 -ties, Semenov, Kargin and Kabanov proposed a theory of organized monomer polymerization. In the last 25 years, our research group has further developed and applied that theory to various polymerizing systems: the radical polymerization of compressed ethene gas, the radical polymerization of <b>liquid</b> methyl methacrylate, <b>olefin</b> polymerization by transition metals and by Al-based catalysts. An outline of the main achievements are presented in this article...|$|R
30|$|By gasification, {{the diesel}} of Fischer–Tropsch is {{produced}} via biomass to liquid process. Fischer–Tropsch synthesis is an industrial technology which by using synthesis gas (that {{can be produced}} from gasification) produces liquid fuels such as gasoline, diesel etc. using a catalyst (Rafati et al. 2017; Sørum et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2013; Atashi and Rezaeian, 2017; Atashi and Veiskarami 2018; Zhang et al. 2018). Using the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, a range of hydrocarbon products such as wax, <b>liquid</b> fuels, <b>olefins</b> and oxygenated hydrocarbons {{can be achieved by}} manipulating the process conditions and catalyst system. One of the great challenges of Fischer–Tropsch technology is manipulating the process conditions in order to minimize methane and maximize C 2 –C 4 olefins (Botes et al. 2016). Certainly, the reaction performance of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis depends on operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, H 2 /CO feed ratio, and gas hour space velocity etc. Increase in temperature causes the products to shift to light hydrocarbons and C 5 + products be to decrease and also increase methane (Todic et al. 2016). Cobalt catalyst produces hydrocarbon products only in a certain range of temperature and pressure, while the iron catalyst produces hydrocarbon in all ranges (Lari et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2015). In commercial production, cobalt, iron, nickel, ruthenium which have catalytic properties are used. Ruthenium and cobalt have high catalytic activity and high heavy hydrocarbon selectivity and also, high stability at low temperatures, in high H 2 /CO feed ratio. But due to limited industrial applications (e.g. low price), the cobalt catalyst is used for C 5 + hydrocarbons synthesis (Vosoughi et al. 2017). Cobalt catalyst has more activity, stability and selectivity compared to iron catalyst and also has less activity in water gas shift (WGS) reaction (Muleja et al. 2017). Many studies have been carried out on cobalt catalyst and to increase catalytic performance, different promoters have been investigated (Muleja et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2016). Taherzadeh believes that the distribution of hydrocarbon products is not only a function of process conditions but also depends on the type of catalyst. She also added that the activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalyst are higher than a single catalyst (Taherzadeh Lari et al. 2016). Nikparsa has investigated the reaction conditions on Co–Ni/Al 2 O 3 and has also studied the kinetic of Fischer–Tropsch reaction (Nikparsaa et al. 2014). Xiaoping has investigated the effect of cerium promoters and concluded that the percentage of CO conversion and C 5 + selectivity is increased (Xiaoping et al. 2006). Several studies were carried out on the effect of operating conditions in Fischer–Tropsch reaction which is evaluated qualitatively. Mandic et al. examined the process condition on catalyst and methane selectivity in Fischer–Tropsch reaction (Mandić et al. 2017). Krishnamoorthy et al. investigated the selectivity and the effect of water on Fischer–Tropsch synthesis which is studied qualitatively (Krishnamoorthy et al. 2002). Iglasia evaluated the selectivity of hydrocarbon products through the chain-growth using cobalt catalyst (Iglesia 1997).|$|R
40|$|Olefin/Paraffin separation, {{traditionally}} {{carried out}} by cryogenic distillation, is difficult to achieve due to the similar size and volatility of the components. Recently, many studies have explored membrane separation methods that utilize a metal ion to facilitate preferential olefin transport across the membrane. However, much of this work focuses on smaller molecules, C 2 -C 3, which are gaseous at room temperature, while little {{work has been done}} studying separation of larger molecules, C 5 and greater, which are generally liquid at room temperature. The processes developed to separate small molecules are not necessarily directly applicable to separate larger molecules. A polymer electrolyte membrane consisting of an active layer of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and silver tetrafluoroborate (AgBF 4) has shown high selectivity for separating gaseous olefin/paraffin mixtures. The current project investigates the feasibility of applying this membrane to the separation of pentene and pentane (<b>liquid</b> C 5 <b>olefin</b> and paraffin). Process variables investigated are the: pure component permeability ratio, equilibrium sorption uptakes, pure component diffusivities, and stable membrane lifetime. Permeation tests on individual species (n-pentane and 1 -pentene) were performed in two operating modes with membranes of varying silver concentrations: direct liquid contact to the membrane, and vapour contact to the membrane. The vapour contact mode showed improved membrane stability in comparison to the liquid contact mode. The olefin/paraffin permeability ratio increases with increasing silver content in the membrane, however, the membrane selectivity is much lower than that achieved with smaller olefin/paraffin pairs. Selective chemical interactions between pentene and the membrane were observed, as the pentene sorption uptake is higher than that of pentane. In addition, a residual fraction is observed – a fraction of the pentene does not desorb from the membrane at ambient conditions – indicating a permanent or semi-permanent interaction. Desorption of pentane is determined to follow a Fickian diffusion model, while desorption of pentene appears to be governed by pseudo-second order kinetics. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{methanol}} to hydrocarbons (MTH) {{reaction is}} an important reaction involved {{in the chain of}} processes for the conversion of alternative carbon sources into <b>liquid</b> fuel and <b>olefins.</b> One key reaction in the complex MTH mechanism was studied using benzene methylation with methanol over H-ZSM- 5 and H-Beta and monitored in-situ using FT-IR spectroscopy at comparable conditions with kinetic measurements. At steady state conditions, the Brønsted acid band for H-Beta is significantly reduced, whereas the band is nearly unaffected for H-ZSM- 5. This trend is correlated with the lower methylation rate for H-Beta as measured by the kinetic studies. During the MTH reaction, the reactive intermediates for product formation may undergo further reaction to form coke precursors and finally coke. The MTH reaction at a fairly low temperature and short reaction time over H-Beta and H-Mor was carried out to follow this transformation. Ex-situ analyses of the zeolites after the reaction suggest that hydrocarbon compounds detected by GCMS after HF dissolution are to some extent seen also with FT-IR spectroscopy. FT-IR spectra reveal the presence of other species unseen from the ex-situ analyses namely methoxy species. The MTH reaction over H-ZSM- 5, H-Beta, and H-Y at comparable conditions with the regular MTH reaction was carried out in-situ with the aim of elucidating the deactivation mechanism. The MTH reaction occurs via different pathways as revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy. Minor amounts of retained hydrocarbons are produced over H-ZSM- 5; and significant amounts of hydrogen deficient hydrocarbons are produced over H-Beta; whereas both hydrogen rich and hydrogen deficient hydrocarbons are produced over H-Y. The Brønsted acid band reduction is mainly due to formation of cationic species for all zeolites. For H-Y, the reduction is also contributed by the formation of methoxy species. Ex-situ analyses show that coked H-ZSM- 5 contains mainly polymethylbenzenes (PMBs); whereas coked H-Beta contains PMBs and large amounts of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Coked H-Y contains lower amounts of PMBs and PAHs as compared to coked H-Beta which is consistent with the trend seen in the infrared spectra. H-ITQ- 7 is a zeotype relevant to the MTH chemistry. This material was synthesized and characterized in order to get deeper insight into its acid properties. The incorporation of aluminum into the framework is proven challenging and samples with high aluminum content tend to be less stable. The calcination procedure is found to be important, where in-situ calcination is the preferred method. H-ITQ- 7 consistently display three discernible Brønsted acid bands which are all accessible by CO. H-ITQ- 7 possess a wide range of acidic strength, from the strongest (BA-I) comparable to H-Beta/H-ZSM- 5 to the weaker (BA-II and BA-III). The use of N 2 in combination with CO as probe molecules is beneficial for determination of the acidic strength of H-ITQ- 7; while the use of N 2 as single probe molecule appears not suitable due to the broad range of acidic strength.
