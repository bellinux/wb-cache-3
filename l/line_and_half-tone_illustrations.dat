40|$|Half-toning is {{the process}} by which gray-scale images are {{approximated}} with sets of black and white pixels. The process works because our eyes perceive a local average, thus half-toning seeks to approximate the local average. Ideally this approximation should be accomplished without introducing `undesirable' artifacts. In many situations the stylized display of images is desired. Often this stylized display is accomplished by the addition of semi-structured artifacts. In current applications the designer processes the image using tools provided by some image processing package. The resulting image is then half-toned <b>and</b> printed. <b>Half-toning</b> these processed images can reduce the visual impact of the special effects that have been introduced in the image. In this paper we show that the processes of controlled artifact introduction <b>and</b> <b>half-toning</b> can successfully be combined. By combining these two processes we ensure that the printed image is what the designer intended. We present a bri [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Reviewing the English edition, Cubism, T. Fisher Unwin, 1913, {{a critic}} in The Burlington {{magazine}} for Connoisseurs writes:For {{the authors of}} this book [...] "painting is not—or is no longer—the art of imitating an object by means of <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> colours, but the art of giving our instinct a plastic consciousness". Many will follow them so far who will be unable or unwilling to follow them further on the road to cubism. Yet even to the unwilling their book will prove suggestive. Their theory of painting is founded upon a philosophic idealism. It is impossible to paint things [...] "as they are", because {{it is impossible to know}} how and what they [...] "really" [...] are. Decoration must go by the board; decorative work is the antithesis of the picture, which [...] "bears its pretext, the reason for its existence, within it". The authors are not afraid of the conclusions which they find resulting from their premisses. The ultimate aim of painting is to touch the crowd; but it is no business of the painter to explain himself to the crowd. On the contrary, it is the business of the crowd to follow the painter in his transubstantiation of the object, [...] "so that the most accustomed eye has some difficulty in discovering it". Yet the authors disapprove of [...] "fantastic occultism" [...] no less than of the negative truth conveyed by the conventional symbols of the academic painters. Indeed, the object of the whole book is to condemn systems of all kinds, and to defend cubism as the liberator from systems, the means of expression of the one truth, which is the truth in the artist's mind. The short but able and suggestive essay is followed by twenty-five <b>half-tone</b> <b>illustrations,</b> from Cézanne to Picabia.|$|R

40|$|Pulsed UV laser {{machining}} is an established method for production of 2. 5 D and 3 D features {{in a wide}} variety of materials. In addition to direct laser patterning by ablation, exposure of photoresist using pulsed lasers can eliminate the need for large area contact photomasks. Half-tone machining, either by ablation or exposure, allows the production of high quality shallow features where the surface roughness from other {{laser machining}} techniques would be unacceptable. Such features could be used as anti-reflection surfaces for mobile display devices. Features produced by lithography typically exhibit low surface roughness but have more complex fabrication processes. Here, the surface roughness of shallow features produced by <b>half-tone</b> lithography <b>and</b> <b>half-tone</b> ablation is investigated for a photoresist. Similar surface profiles are achieved for each technique and roughness levels are comparable for both...|$|R
