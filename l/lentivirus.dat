5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a <b>lentivirus</b> (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus <b>Lentivirus,</b> part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lentiviruses</b> are {{widespread}} {{in a variety}} of vertebrates, often associated with chronic disease states. However, until the recent discovery of the prehistoric endogenous <b>lentiviruses</b> in rabbits (RELIK) and lemurs (PSIV), it was thought that <b>lentiviruses</b> had no capacity for germline integration and were only spread horizontally in an exogenous fashion. The existence of RELIK and PSIV refuted these ideas, revealing <b>lentiviruses</b> to be present in a range of mammals, capable of germline integration, and far more ancient than previously thought. Using Gag sequences reconstructed from the remnants of these prehistoric <b>lentiviruses,</b> we have produced chimeric <b>lentiviruses</b> capable of infecting nondividing cells and determined structures of capsid domains from PSIV and RELIK. We show that the structures from these diverse viruses are highly similar, containing features found in modern-day <b>lentiviruses,</b> including a functional cyclophilin-binding loop. Together, these data provide evidence for an ancient capsid-cyclophilin interaction preserved throughout lentiviral evolution...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lentiviruses</b> have {{recently}} attracted considerable interest for their {{potential as a}} genetic modification tool for dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we explore the ability of <b>lentiviruses</b> enveloped with alphaviral envelope glycoproteins derived from Semliki Forest virus (SFV) to mediate transduction of DCs. We found that SFV glycoprotein (SFV-G) -pseudotyped <b>lentiviruses</b> use C-type lectins (DC-SIGN and L-SIGN) as attachment factors for transduction of DCs. Importantly, SFV-G pseudotypes appear to have enhanced transduction towards C-type lectin-expressing cells when produced under conditions limiting glycosylation to simple high-mannose, N-linked glycans. These results, {{in addition to the}} natural DC tropism of SFV-G, offer evidence to support the use of SFV-G-bearing <b>lentiviruses</b> to genetically modify DCs for the study of DC biology and DC...|$|R
40|$|Ovine and caprine <b>lentiviruses</b> {{share the}} {{capacity}} to induce slowly progressive and inflammatory diseases of {{the central nervous system}} (leukoencephalitis or visna), lungs (progressive pneumonia or maedi), and joints (arthritis) in their natural hosts. Studies on their replication indicated that ovine <b>lentiviruses</b> and caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) recently isolated in the United States establish persistent infection in ovine and caprine fibroblasts, whereas older prototype ovine <b>lentiviruses</b> such as Icelandic visna virus or American progressive pneumonia virus irreversibly lyse fibroblast cultures. Since all of the recent isolates were found to be persistent, Narayan et al. (J. Gen. Virol. 59 : 345 - 356, 1982) concluded that the highly lytic viruses were only tissue-culture-adapted strains. In the present report, we isolated new ovine <b>lentiviruses</b> from French sheep with naturally occurring progressive pneumonia which are either highly lytic (five isolates), as are the Icelandic strains of visna virus, or persistent (one isolate), as are CAEV or American persistent ovine <b>lentiviruses.</b> Protein and nucleic acid content analyses of these new highly lytic (type I) and persistent (type II) isolates indicated that type I and type II ovine <b>lentiviruses</b> were genetically distinct, type I and type II viruses being closely related to the Icelandic strains of visna virus and to CAEV, respectively. We conclude that (i) highly lytic ovine <b>lentiviruses,</b> such as the Icelandic prototype strains of visna virus and persistent <b>lentiviruses</b> more related to CAEV, are naturally present in the ovine species, and (ii) irreversible cell lysis induced by highly lytic viruses does not result from a tissue culture adaptation of field isolates that were originally persistent but is instead the consequence of a genetic content distinct from that of persistent viruses...|$|R

Although many of the diseases caused by FeLV and FIV are similar, the specific ways in which they are caused also differs.

Three of the children had metachromatic leukodystrophy, which causes children to lose cognitive and motor skills.

Follow up trials with gene therapy on another six children with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome were also reported as promising.|$|E

25|$|For safety reasons lentiviral vectors never {{carry the}} genes {{required}} for their replication. To produce a <b>lentivirus,</b> several plasmids are transfected into a so-called packaging cell line, commonly HEK 293. One or more plasmids, generally {{referred to as}} packaging plasmids, encode the virion proteins, such as the capsid and the reverse transcriptase. Another plasmid contains the genetic material to be delivered by the vector. It is transcribed to produce the single-stranded RNA viral genome and is marked {{by the presence of}} the ψ (psi) sequence. This sequence is used to package the genome into the virion.|$|E
25|$|The gene {{silencing}} effects of transfected designed siRNA are generally transient, but this difficulty {{can be overcome}} through an RNAi approach. Delivering this siRNA from DNA templates can be done through several recombinant viral vectors based on retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, adenovirus, and <b>lentivirus.</b> The latter is the most efficient virus that stably delivers siRNA to target cells as it can transduce nondividing cells as well as directly target the nucleus. These specific viral vectors have been synthesized to effectively facilitate siRNA that is not viable for transfection into cells. Another aspect is {{that in some cases}} synthetic viral vectors can integrate shRNA into the cell genome which allows for stable expression of siRNA and long-term gene knockdown. This technique is advantageous because it is in vivo and effective for difficult to transfect cell. However problems arise because it can trigger antiviral responses in some cell types leading to mutagenic and immunogenic effects.|$|E
25|$|Lentiviruses are a {{subclass}} of Retroviruses. They {{are sometimes}} used as vectors for gene therapy {{thanks to their}} ability to integrate into the genome of non-dividing cells, which is the unique feature of Lentiviruses as other Retroviruses can infect only dividing cells. The viral genome in the form of RNA is reverse-transcribed when the virus enters the cell to produce DNA, which is then inserted into the genome at a random position (recent findings actually suggest that the insertion of viral DNA is not random but directed to specific active genes and related to genome organisation) by the viral integrase enzyme. The vector, now called a provirus, remains in the genome and is passed on to the progeny of the cell when it divides. The site of integration is unpredictable, which can pose a problem. The provirus can disturb the function of cellular genes and lead to activation of oncogenes promoting the development of cancer, which raises concerns for possible applications of lentiviruses in gene therapy. However, studies have shown that <b>lentivirus</b> vectors have a lower tendency to integrate in places that potentially cause cancer than gamma-retroviral vectors. More specifically, one study found that lentiviral vectors did not cause either an increase in tumor incidence or an earlier onset of tumors in a mouse strain with a much higher incidence of tumors. Moreover, clinical trials that utilized lentiviral vectors to deliver gene therapy for the treatment of HIV experienced no increase in mutagenic or oncologic events.|$|E
50|$|Visna {{virus has}} a positive-strand RNA genome {{approximately}} 9.2 kilobases in length. As a retrovirus in the genus lentivirinae, the genome is reverse transcribed into proviral DNA. The visna virus genome {{resembles that of}} other <b>lentiviruses,</b> {{in terms of the}} gene functions that are present. Visna virus is closely related to the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus but has limited nucleotide sequence similarity with other <b>lentiviruses.</b>|$|R
40|$|Naturally {{circulating}} <b>lentiviruses</b> {{are abundant}} in African primate species today, yet their origins {{and history of}} transmitting between hosts remain obscure. As a means {{to better understand the}} age of primate <b>lentiviruses,</b> we analyzed primate genomes for signatures of lentivirus-driven evolution. Specifically, we studied the adaptive evolution of host restriction factor APOBEC 3 G (A 3 G) in Old World Monkey (OWM) species. We find recurrent mutation of A 3 G in multiple primate lineages at sites that determine susceptibility to antagonism by the lentiviral accessory protein Vif. Using a broad panel of SIV Vif isolates, we demonstrate that natural variation in OWM A 3 G confers resistance to Vif-mediated degradation, suggesting that adaptive variants of the host factor were selected upon exposure to pathogenic <b>lentiviruses</b> at least 5 - 6 million years ago (MYA). Furthermore, in members of the divergent Colobinae subfamily of OWM, a multi-residue insertion event in A 3 G that arose at least 12 MYA blocks the activity of Vif, suggesting an even more ancient origin of SIV. Moreover, analysis of the <b>lentiviruses</b> associated with Colobinae monkeys reveal that the interface of the A 3 G-Vif interaction has shifted and given rise to a second genetic conflict. Our analysis of virus-driven evolution describes an ancient yet ongoing genetic conflict between simian primates and <b>lentiviruses</b> on a million-year time scale...|$|R

Those that tested negative were allowed {{to remain on the}} island and those with the disease were transported to a temporary quarantine facility. Finding a permanent, isolated area for such a large number of Bankers was a challenging task for the Foundation; eight days later the state declared all proposed locations for the herd unsuitable.

40|$|The nonprimate <b>lentiviruses</b> feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus, equine infectious anemia virus, visna virus, and caprine encephalitis virus {{contain a}} gene segment in the polymerase gene that {{is lacking in}} the primate <b>lentiviruses.</b> A related sequence has been noted in other retroviruses, most notably the type D retroviruses. Computer searches have indicated a relatedness between this unique gene segment, termed proteaselike element and elements of both the aspartate proteinase and the dUTPase enzyme families. In this report, we show that members of both nonprimate <b>lentiviruses</b> and type D retroviruses possess dUTPase activity and present a formal demonstration that in feline immunodeficiency virus, the activity is encoded by the proteaselike element.

2500|$|Scientists can use viral or non-viral {{systems for}} {{delivery}} of the Cas9 and sgRNA into target cells.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of γ-synuclein in the rewarding effects of chronic cocaine administration and its putative interaction with the dopamine transporter (DAT). For this purpose, regulatable <b>lentiviruses</b> driving overexpression of the rat γ-synuclein or DAT have been prepared, as well as <b>lentiviruses</b> expressing siRNAs, aimed at silencing either DAT or γ-synuclein mRNA expression. Overexpression of DAT in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) induced a 35 % decrease in locomotor activity, which could be abolished when the same animal was fed doxycycline. Furthermore, local inhibition of DAT in the NAc, using <b>lentiviruses</b> expressing siRNAs targeted against DAT, resulted in significant hyperlocomotion activity (72 % increase over controls). By contrast, overexpression of γ-synuclein in the NAc alone had no effect, while local silencing lead to a significant decrease in cocaine-induced locomotor activity (47 % decrease compared with controls). Surprisingly, coinjection <b>lentiviruses</b> expressing DAT and γ-synuclein − leading to overexpression of both proteins in the NAc − resulted in a strong increase in cocaine-induced rat locomotor activity (52 % increase compared with controls), which was abolished upon locally silencing these genes, suggesting a synergetic role of both proteins, possibly mediated through a direct interaction...|$|R
40|$|Serine proteases in {{the nervous}} system have {{functional}} roles in neural plasticity. Among them, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) exerts a variety of functions during development, and is involved in learning and memory. Furthermore, psychostimulants strongly induce uPA expression in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. In this study, doxycycline-regulatable <b>lentiviruses</b> expressing either uPA, a dominant-negative form of uPA, or non-regulatable <b>lentiviruses</b> expressing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted against uPA have been prepared and injected into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of rat brains. Over-expression of uPA in the VTA induces doxycycline-dependent expression of its receptor, uPAR, but not its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1). uPAR expression in the VTA is repressed upon silencing of uPA with <b>lentiviruses</b> expressing siRNAs. In addition, over-expression of uPA in the VTA promotes a 15 -fold increase in locomotion activity upon cocaine delivery. Animals expressing the dominant-negative form of uPA did not display such hyperlocomotor activity.

Neutralization of the restriction by Vpx, a primate lentiviral protein previously shown to protect primate <b>lentiviruses</b> from a macrophage restriction, rendered macrophages permissive to MLV infection. We further demonstrate that this restriction prevents transduction of quiescent monocytes by HIV- 1. Monocyte-HeLa heterokaryons were resistant to HIV- 1 infection, while heterokaryons formed between monocytes and HeLa cells expressing Vpx were permissive to HIV- 1 infection. Encapsidation of Vpx within HIV- 1 virions conferred the ability to infect quiescent monocytes.
