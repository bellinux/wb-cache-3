40|$|This project {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the co-management arrangements built into the first <b>line</b> of <b>supervision</b> (<b>module</b> advisors) at the Saturn Corporation on first time quality (FTQ) performance and improvements in first time quality. This is a very unique organizational arrangement wherein represented (i. e., unionized) and non-represented (i. e., managers) partners share responsibilities for co-managing production work teams. The purpose of this portion of our work is to test whether this co-management arrangement contributes to the performance of these work units and thereby adds value to Saturn as a whole. We focus on first time quality as the performance measure. In order to analyze the value-added to quality performance by Saturn's system of comanagement, represented and non-represented operations department-level middle managers were studied. A detailed analysis of the supervisory system at the department or module level across Saturn's three plants (called business units) allowed us to test whether the variations in the comanagement system and quality performance are systematically related. We analyzed the relationship between the behavior patterns and supervisory methods of both union and non-union middle managers, attributes of their individual union-management partnerships, differences in the patterns of communication and coordination of each group, and performance outcomes, in particular first-time-quality improvement. We also studied time use and the dynamics of partnerships, including the balancing of social and economic tasks, as well as the division of labor between represented and non-represented management. Specifically, we examined: 1) Whether represented managers were indeed managing people and technical aspects of the production process (called resources); 2) If represented managers were managing, did they manage their time, priorities, and communications differently than did their non-represented partners. 3) Whether the behaviors of represented managers added value to quality performance. 4) Whether the nature of the individual represented and non-represented manager partnerships at the department level had an impact on quality performance. These questions are important because some industry observers believe that while over half of the middle management positions at Saturn were indeed being filled by union members, Saturn had simply bought labor peace at a high price. They contended that only the non-represented managers were truly functioning in that role while the union members were either free riders or acting as grievance committeemen focusing exclusively on people issues. Another explanation for Saturn's remarkable quality performance is that a new 'effort bargain' was struck between GM and the UAW (i. e. workers simply work harder). We test our alternative hypothesis that this system of partnership and co-management systematically adds value by increasing the rate of first-time-quality improvement. These data allow us to test which, if any, of the specific attributes of the partnership (i. e. task balancing, represented and non-represented relationships, communication density, problem solving, etc.) predict quality performance. Data were collected via surveys from 150 managers across the three business units. Multiple regression techniques were used to analyze these data, and to test for the relationship of these specific aspects of the co-management system to first-time-quality improvement. Managers provided data on how they used their time during the day, how they thought they should allocate their time, and on their communications with others in the Saturn operations. The communications data were collected over a two week time period. The differences in the level and nature of communications were then analyzed to see if they affected quality performance outcomes. Two measures of quality serve as the performance outcomes {{to assess the impact of}} the Saturn partnership arrangements: 1) first time quality; and 2) quality improvement...|$|R

In the control of diabetes, i. e. the so-called artificial pancreas, modularity allows for the step-wise introduction of (and regulatory approval for) algorithmic components, starting with subsystems for assured patient safety and followed by higher-layer components that serve to modify the patients basal rate in real-time. In this paper, we introduce a three-layer modular architecture for the control of diabetes, consisting in a sensor/pump Interface Module (IM), a Continuous Safety Module (CSM), and a Real-Time Control Module (RTCM), which separates the functions of insulin recommendation (post-meal insulin for mitigating hyperglycemia) and safety (prevention of hypoglycemia).

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a Fault Diagnosis and Prognosis <b>supervision</b> <b>module</b> which can be applied to LED lighting systems for both industrial and domestic applications. Hardware redundancy is used for detecting and isolating a fault on the LED lamp (composed of a fixed number of LED strings). Residual signals are obtained as the difference between the currents circulating into two different LED strings piloted by the same input current. A signal-based approach is used for fault detection on the cooling fan subsystem, where the diagnosis system is based on the heat sink temperature. Fault detection is performed through an algorithm based on the trend of the temperature rate on the heat sink. Fault detection on the light, motion and temperature sensors is based on a straightforward evaluation of the sensor readings. In all these cases, a threshold policy has been used to trigger the faulty condition. Finally, the module integrates a model-based prognosis algorithm which is used to predict when LED maintenance should be performed. The proposed solution has been experimentally validated, showing the capability to correctly detect and isolate a fault occurring on the LED string, on the fan subsystem, or on the sensor set, and providing at the same time an estimation of the LED useful life...|$|R

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThis study was a multicenter, randomized, three-way crossover, open-label trial in 48 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least 6 months, treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Blood glucose was controlled for 23 h by the algorithm of the Universities of Pavia and Padova with a Safety <b>Supervision</b> <b>Module</b> developed at the Universities of Virginia and California at Santa Barbara (international artificial pancreas [iAP]), by the algorithm of University of Cambridge (CAM), or by patients themselves in open loop (OL) during three hospital admissions including meals and exercise. The main analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. Main outcome measures included time spent in target (glucose levels between 3. 9 and 8. 0 mmol/L or between 3. 9 and 10. 0 mmol/L after meals). RESULTSTime spent in the target range was similar in CL and OL: 62. 6 % for OL, 59. 2 % for iAP, and 58. 3 % for CAM. While mean glucose level was significantly lower in OL (7. 19, 8. 15, and 8. 26 mmol/L, respectively) (overall P = 0. 001), percentage {{of time spent in}} hypoglycemia (< 3. 9 mmol/L) was almost threefold reduced during CL (6. 4 %, 2. 1 %, and 2. 0 %) (overall P = 0. 001) with less time 2. 8 mmol/L (overall P = 0. 038).

40|$|Background Closed-loop {{control of}} type 1 {{diabetes}} is receiving increasing attention due to advancement in glucose sensor and insulin pump technology. Here the function and structure of a class of control algorithms designed to exert control to range, defined as insulin treatment optimizing glycemia within a predefined target range by preventing extreme glucose fluctuations, are studied. Methods The main contribution of the article is definition of a modular architecture for control to range. Emphasis is on system specifications rather than algorithmic realization. The key system architecture elements are two interacting modules: range correction module, which assesses the risk for incipient hyper- or hypoglycemia and adjusts insulin rate accordingly, and safety <b>supervision</b> <b>module,</b> which assesses the risk for hypoglycemia and attenuates or discontinues insulin delivery when necessary. The novel engineering concept of range correction module is that algorithm action is relative to a nominal open-loop strategy—a predefined combination of basal rate and boluses believed to be optimal under nominal conditions. Results A proof of concept of the feasibility of our control-to-range strategy is illustrated by using a prototypal implementation tested in silico on patient use cases. These functional and architectural distinctions provide several advantages, including (i) significant insulin delivery corrections are only made if relevant risks are detected; (ii) drawbacks of integral action are avoided, e. g., undershoots with consequent hypoglycemic risks; (iii) a simple linear model is sufficient and complex algorithmic constraints are replaced by safety supervision; and (iv) the nominal profile provides straightforward individualization for each patient. Conclusions We believe that the modular control-to-range system is the best approach to incremental development, regulatory approval, industrial deployment, and clinical acceptance of closed-loop control for diabetes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a new artificial pancreas that takes into account the experience accumulated during more than 5000 h of closed-loop control in several clinical research centers. The main objective is to reduce the mean glucose value without exacerbating hypo phenomena. Controller design and in silico testing were performed on a new virtual population of the University of Virginia/Padova simulator. METHODS: A new sensor model was developed based on the Comparison of Two Artificial Pancreas Systems for Closed-Loop Blood Glucose Control versus Open-Loop Control in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes trial AP@home data. The Kalman filter incorporated in the controller has been tuned using plasma and pump insulin as well as plasma and continuous glucose monitoring measures collected in clinical research centers. New constraints describing clinical knowledge not incorporated in the simulator but very critical in real patients (e. g., pump shutoff) have been introduced. The proposed model predictive control (MPC) is characterized by a low computational burden and memory requirements, and it is ready for an embedded implementation. RESULTS: The new MPC was tested with an intensive simulation study on the University of Virginia/Padova simulator equipped with a new virtual population. It was also used in some preliminary outpatient pilot trials. The obtained results are very promising in terms of mean glucose and number of patients in the critical zone of the control variability grid analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed MPC improves on the performance of a previous controller already tested in several experiments in the AP@home and JDRF projects. This algorithm complemented with a safety <b>supervision</b> <b>module</b> is a significant step toward deploying artificial pancreases into outpatient environments for extended periods of time...|$|R

The sources of burnout were explored and personality style {{was positively correlated with}} burnout development. Impact of burnout on counsellor wellness and productivity was also established. It examined whether counsellor supervision was an appropriate strategy in the management of counsellor burnout. The study utilized a pluralistic design that combined both qualitative and quantitative methods (Howard, 1983). The qualitative design permitted collection of rich data from study subjects' experiential and perceptual fields. This ensured study findings would be relevant and applicable to specific counsellor situations. The study population comprised 20 counsellors and 9 Kenya Counselling Association (KCA) accredited counsellor supervisors. The counsellor sample was drawn from 2 Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) centres, 2 rehabilitation centres and 2 educational institutions. This diverse population was a helpful representation in terms of generalizability of the study. Three data collection instruments utilized were: Questionnaires, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The study's validity and reliability were ensured through the two sample populations (counsellor and counsellor supervisors), test re-test and pre-test procedures for questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Tallying identified items checked content validity. The study findings showed that burnout seriously affected practitioner effectiveness and led to malpractice and client harm. The study predictably established that supervision is an appropriate strategy in the management of counsellor burnout. The metaphor of motor vehicle maintenance was utilized {{in the development of the}} Holistic Burnout Supervision Model (HBSM) that focussed on wellness maintenance of the counsellor in a lifecycle.
