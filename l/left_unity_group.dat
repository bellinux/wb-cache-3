In the weeks following Corbyn's election as Leader of the Labour Party, approximately 300 <b>Left</b> <b>Unity</b> members, including many prominent leadership figures, resigned and joined the Labour Party. The November 2015 <b>Left</b> <b>Unity</b> Party Conference was dominated by {{the issue of what}} to do now that the Labour Party was led by Corbyn, a leader with politics similar to those of <b>Left</b> <b>Unity,</b> but with a mass membership of socialists, compared to <b>Left</b> <b>Unity's</b> then 1,500 members - down from its 2014 peak of 2,000. Many of the motions discussed the possible dissolution of <b>Left</b> <b>Unity</b> as a political party, with party members joining either the Labour Party itself or Momentum. Following the Conference decision to remain as a formal political party but not stand in elections, Salman Shaheen, one of <b>Left</b> <b>Unity's</b> prominent National Speakers, resigned.
