5|$|The {{main event}} match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Shawn Michaels) saw Adrian Neville challenging Bo Dallas in the first-ever <b>ladder</b> {{match for the}} NXT Championship. In {{the first half of}} the match, Dallas attempted to climb a <b>ladder</b> while he pinned Neville under the <b>ladder,</b> but Neville used his legs to push the <b>ladder</b> over. Near the end of the match, Neville attempted his signature Red Arrow, but Dallas pushed him off the ropes to the apron and the floor. Neville recovered and used the ropes to springboard over a climbing Dallas and leapfrog him on the <b>ladder.</b> In response, Dallas powerbombed Neville onto a <b>ladder</b> in the corner of the ring. Dallas then charged while holding a <b>ladder,</b> but Neville kicked the <b>ladder</b> into Dallas' face and slammed Dallas onto the <b>ladder.</b> Neville climbed to the top rope and dove off with his Red Arrow while Dallas was on the <b>ladder.</b> This incapacitated Dallas long enough for Neville to set up and climb the <b>ladder</b> to retrieve the NXT Championship hanging above the ring. The show ended with Neville celebrating with his new championship.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match of}} the evening was the fourth-annual Money in the Bank <b>ladder</b> match, in which there were no {{disqualifications}} or countouts, {{and the only way}} to win the match was to climb a <b>ladder</b> in the ring and retrieve a contract briefcase hanging above. The match featured Chris Jericho, Mr. Kennedy, and Carlito from the Raw brand; CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin and John Morrison from the ECW brand; and Montel Vontavious Porter (M.V.P.) from the SmackDown brand. Jeff Hardy was supposed to be in the match, but he violated the wellness program and was taken out of the match. Early in the match, Morrison climbed a turnbuckle and performed a moonsault onto other competitors outside the ring while holding a <b>ladder</b> against his chest. Later, while Kennedy and Morrison were battling on top of a <b>ladder,</b> Benjamin climbed another <b>ladder</b> placed adjacent to the first one and performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Kennedy, who in turn superplexed Morrison from the top of the <b>ladder.</b> Later, Carlito and Kennedy flipped Benjamin off a <b>ladder</b> in the ring, sending him crashing through another <b>ladder</b> set-up between the barricade and the ring apron. When MVP was close to retrieving the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy (returning to action after suffering a legitimate injury), entered the ring from the crowd, climbed the <b>ladder,</b> and delivered a Twist of Fate to MVP off that <b>ladder.</b> As soon as Morrison started to climb a <b>ladder,</b> see-sawing with another <b>ladder,</b> Jericho flipped the other one and Morrison landed on the ring-ropes groin-first. Jericho even performed a Codebreaker on Punk using a <b>ladder.</b> In the end, Jericho and Punk fought each other on a <b>ladder,</b> but Punk trapped Jericho's one leg in the ladder's steps and retrieved the briefcase to win the match. This was an interpromotional match.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a <b>Ladder</b> {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. The goal is to climb a <b>ladder</b> and {{retrieve}} the title belts suspended above the ring. The Hardys had the advantage {{for most of the}} match, but as Jeff was climbing the <b>ladder</b> to try and grab the belts, Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked the <b>ladder</b> from underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing the <b>ladder</b> as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to fall to the floor. Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed the <b>ladder</b> to get the belts and win.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we suggest}} <b>Laddering</b> as a {{promising}} empirical method {{to evaluate the}} impact of tangibility on young childrenâ€™s user experiences. In {{the first part of}} this paper, we explain what <b>Laddering</b> is. We explicate the conceptual foundations of <b>Laddering,</b> discuss the typical <b>Laddering</b> interviewing technique and focus on the <b>Laddering</b> data treatment. Then, we argue why <b>Laddering</b> might be especially valuable in a context of UX evaluations of tangible and embedded interfaces with children. In the second part of this paper, we present a case study, comparing three cuddly toy interfaces, and we demonstrate how <b>Laddering</b> can be used with preschoolers to explain preferences between these tangible interfaces. The case study confirms that <b>Laddering</b> can contribute to verifying the assumed benefits of tangibility. <b>Laddering</b> revealed how specific cuddly toy attributes as opposed to non-cuddly toy attributes led to specific benefits for the young participants. However, contrary to research findings from developmental literature, only children aged 5 years and older proved to be capable of performing as full <b>Laddering</b> respondents. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|For the <b>Ladder</b> match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the <b>ladder</b> to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the <b>ladder</b> to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the <b>ladder.</b> Michaels then set the <b>ladder</b> up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the <b>ladder.</b> He then hit Michaels with the <b>ladder</b> several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the <b>ladder</b> and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the <b>ladder,</b> which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the <b>ladder</b> up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the <b>ladder,</b> and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the finals}} of The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament were held between Christian Cage and Kaz in a <b>ladder</b> match that lasted 15 minutes and 13 seconds. In a <b>ladder</b> match, an object is hung above {{the ring and}} the first to climb a <b>ladder</b> and {{retrieve}} the object is the winner. During the match, Cage was legitimately busted open above his eye. Midway through the encounter, the contract fell off the clipboard that hung above the ring, which changed the objective to just grabbing the clipboard to win. Kaz won the contest after causing Cage to fall off the <b>ladder</b> onto Styles and Tomko, who were interfering on Cage's behalf, and then ascending the <b>ladder</b> to grab the clipboard, becoming number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the process.|$|E
5|$|The event, {{featuring}} commentary by Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler and Booker T, {{began with}} the SmackDown Money in the Bank <b>ladder</b> match. During the bout, Sheamus slammed Sin Cara through a <b>ladder</b> propped between the ring apron and the announcers' table with a powerbomb. The <b>ladder</b> was bent in half and Cara was stretchered away from ringside. Near {{the end of the}} match, Barrett, Rhodes and Bryan were the only three in the ring. Bryan put Rhodes in a guillotine choke submission hold on top of the <b>ladder</b> {{in the middle of the}} ring while Barrett sneaked up the other side of the <b>ladder.</b> After Bryan knocked Rhodes off the <b>ladder,</b> Barrett got Bryan onto his shoulders and tried to throw him off. Bryan countered with repeated elbow strikes to Barrett's head. Bryan then kicked Barrett in the head and unhooked the briefcase to win the contest.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a unique}} and larger sample of {{companies}} from going public from 1998 - 2000 classified by both spinning and <b>laddering</b> manipulation, {{we are able to}} disentangle the effects of <b>laddering</b> and spinning and find that much of the underpricing during the internet bubble was due to <b>laddering</b> rather than spin-ning. In fact, we find that a <b>laddered</b> IPO is expected to be underpriced by 110 % compared to a non-laddered IPO. The effects of spinning are insig-nificant once <b>laddering</b> is simultaneously considered. Our study lends further support to the <b>laddering</b> theory of Aggarwal et al. (2006) as a reason for IPO underpricing during the internet bubble...|$|R
50|$|DNA <b>laddering</b> {{can only}} be used to detect {{apoptosis}} during the later stages of apoptosis. This is due to DNA fragmentation taking place in a later stage of the apoptosis process. DNA <b>laddering</b> is used to test for apoptosis of many cells, and is not accurate at testing {{for only a few}} cells that committed apoptosis. To enhance the accuracy in testing for apoptosis, other assays are used along with DNA <b>laddering</b> such as TEM and TUNEL. With recent improvements to DNA <b>laddering,</b> DNA <b>laddering</b> has become a more reliable, and reasonable technique to use when detecting apoptosis. It is also important to note that DNA <b>laddering</b> occurs differently {{depending on the type of}} cell, so there may be slight changes in the process of DNA <b>laddering</b> depending on the cell that is being investigated.|$|R

5|$|The first {{main event}} match was the TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal, {{the winner of}} which would become the number one {{contender}} to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. It involved Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Gail Kim, Jackie Moore, ODB, Salinas, Rhaka Khan, Roxxi Laveaux, Traci Brooks, and Velvet Sky. This contest involved two stages; {{the first was a}} standard battle royal. After all but two wrestlers were eliminated, stage two, a <b>ladder</b> match, began. The winner of the <b>ladder</b> match would become the number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship; the loser would have her head shaved. The final four were Kim, Laveaux, Love, and ODB. The next eliminated was ODB, followed by Love; both were eliminated by Laveaux. Only Kim and Laveaux remained for the <b>ladder</b> match portion. Kim had won immunity on the May8 episode of Impact!, so if Laveaux won the match, then Love's head would be shaven. Love and Sky interfered in the contest several times. During the bout, as Kim and Laveaux stood on the <b>ladder,</b> Kim flipped over Laveaux, grabbed her around the legs, and slammed her into the mat back-first with a powerbomb. Laveaux's head was legitimately cut open during this stage. Later, while Laxeaux climbed the <b>ladder</b> in an attempt to retrieve the contract, Love interfered by pushing the <b>ladder</b> over. Kim followed by climbing the <b>ladder</b> and grabbing the contract to win the encounter at ten minutes. Afterwards, Laveaux was forced to have her head shaven.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} match featured Paul London and Brian Kendrick, William Regal and Dave Taylor, MNM (Joey Mercury, and Johnny Nitro), and The Hardys (Matt and Intercontinental Champion Jeff) in a four-team <b>ladder</b> {{match for}} the WWE Tag Team Championship. In this match, {{the only way to}} win and capture the titles was by climbing a <b>ladder</b> and releasing the championship belts that were suspended above the ring. Towards the end of the match, while MNM and The Hardys were out of the ring, Regal and Taylor attempted to climb the <b>ladder,</b> but Kendrick managed to knock the pair off. Kendrick fought off Regal and Taylor as London climbed the <b>ladder</b> and captured the titles to win the match for his team and retain the championships. During the match, Mercury suffered a legitimate nose injury after being hit by a <b>ladder.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Victory Road was a <b>Ladder</b> {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Jeff Jarrett, and the challenger, Jeff Hardy. In a <b>Ladder</b> match, two or more {{participants}} fight to climb a <b>ladder</b> to retrieve a contract, championship belt, or some other type of object to win. Jarrett was scripted to defend the championship against Hardy on the October 15 episode of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, after Hardy won a tournament to become number one contender. Jarrett defeated Hardy to retain the championship once before, on September 6 at TNA's final weekly PPV, which set up the rivalry between the two. On the October 22 episode of Impact!, Hardy challenged Jarrett to contest their bout under <b>Ladder</b> match rules, which Jarrett accepted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In 2000 and 2005, fish <b>ladders</b> {{were built}} in Vilnia and Siesartis rivers {{providing}} fish access to another 10 and 25 km of the rivers respectively. The analysis of redd distribution and abundance in both rivers revealed that the construction of fish <b>ladders</b> significantly increased the number and share of redds above dams, however, {{a significant increase in}} redds above the dam occurred 2 - 4 years after fish <b>ladders</b> construction supporting homing behaviour {{as one of the most}} important factors for the recolonization of the newly accessible habitats. The tracking of radio tagged salmon and sea trout revealed that statis-tically, significantly more time, fishes spent in the middle part of fish <b>ladders.</b> Assessed fish <b>ladders</b> efficiency for migrating salmonids made 66 %. Minor construction defects and lack of protection were the main factors reducing fishway efficiency. Based on radio tracking data, recommendations are given for minor changes in fish <b>ladders</b> construction and operating sched-ule to increase the efficiency of fish <b>ladders...</b>|$|R
