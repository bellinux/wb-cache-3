60|$|The {{borders of}} Ratcliff and Stepney, eastward of London, and giving on the impure river, were {{the scene of}} this uncompromising dance of death, upon a drizzling November day.

A mud-desert, chiefly inhabited by a tribe from whom employment has departed, or to whom it comes but fitfully and rarely. They are not skilled mechanics in any wise.
