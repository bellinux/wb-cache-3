40|$|Log sorting is {{necessary}} when processing aspen saw-dry-rip (SDR) to select optimum log diameter and to minimize number of logs with dark-colored centers. Wetwood, which {{is difficult to}} dry, is commonly associated with these dark centers. SDR processing involves drying 7 / 4 - to 8 / 4 -thick <b>live-sawn</b> flitches. Drying the flitch and then sawing studs produces straighter studs than sawing first and drying in stud form. High-temperature kiln drying (230 o F to 240 o F) has given good results with several species (such as, basswood and yellow-poplar). For species likely to contain wetwood (aspen, cottonwood, willow), high-temperature drying is not recommended. A kiln schedule for aspen with maximum temperatures of 190 o F to 200 o F followed by equalizing at 12 percent EMC is suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of small diameter logs in the sawmilling {{sector in the}} South East Asian region cannot be underplayed, as plantation-grown fast growing tree species is {{the main source of}} wood raw material for the rapidly expanding wood products industry in the region. The aim of this study was therefore to highlight the different sawing and drying techniques used in the processing of small-diameter logs from the fast growing forest plantations. A significant difference in processing yields and also the costs of the different techniques are obvious and the industry is poised {{to take advantage of the}} benefits provided by the saw-dry-rip (SDR) method of processing small-diameter logs. As opposed to the conventional <b>live-sawing</b> method widely used in hardwood sawing in the South East Asian region, the saw-dry-rip (SDR) method offers a more viable option to process the small-diameter logs, with significant reductions in rejects, while improving the overall yield. The overall economic benefits gained through the adoption of this technique warrants serious consideration by the sawmilling sector throughout the region...|$|R
