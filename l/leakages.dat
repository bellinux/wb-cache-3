5|$|At about 7:30 PM Khartoum time (17:30 GMT), two American {{warships}} in the Red Sea fired thirteen {{missiles at}} Sudan's Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons. The entire factory was destroyed {{except for the}} administration, water-cooling, and plant laboratory sections, which were severely damaged. One night watchman was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for hazardous chemical <b>leakages,</b> analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of collateral damage. Regardless, planners added more cruise missiles to the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming to completely destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.|$|E
5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water <b>leakages</b> from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the <b>leakages,</b> but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E
40|$|The {{continued}} {{scaling of}} bulk MOSFET device dimensions {{results in an}} increase in device <b>leakage</b> and an increase in variations in the device parameters. In sub- 90 nm technologies, device <b>leakage</b> will no longer be dominated by sub-threshold <b>leakage</b> currents as gate <b>leakage</b> and source/substrate and drain/substrate junction band-to-band tunneling currents increase with each technology generation. Traditionally much of the <b>leakage</b> power reduction effort has centered on sub-threshold <b>leakage</b> reduction techniques. The effectiveness of common <b>leakage</b> techniques such as stacking and reverse body bias will be reduced as sub-threshold <b>leakage</b> contributes a smaller percentage of the total <b>leakage</b> current. We propose a new paradigm for <b>leakage</b> power reduction. By monitoring the individual <b>leakage</b> components, total <b>leakage</b> power can be reduced with appropriate <b>leakage</b> component trade-offs. We introduce a new stacking technique of input vector selection based on the relative contributions of sub-threshold <b>leakage</b> and gate <b>leakage.</b> We also propose a new optimal body bias selection technique based on the relative contributions of sub-threshold <b>leakage</b> and junction band-to-band tunneling. In addition to lowering total <b>leakage,</b> the optimal body bias selection technique is also an effective method for process variation compensation. Since these <b>leakage</b> reduction techniques weigh the relative contributions of <b>leakage</b> components, they reflect the changing requirements as technologies scale. ...|$|R

40|$|CMOS {{technology}} has scaled aggressively {{over the past}} few decades in an effort to enhance functionality, speed and packing density per chip. As the feature sizes are scaling down to sub- 100 nm regime, <b>leakage</b> power is increasing significantly and is becoming the dominant component of the total power dissipation. Major contributors to the total <b>leakage</b> current in deep submicron regime are subthreshold and gate tunneling <b>leakage</b> currents. The <b>leakage</b> reduction techniques developed so far were mostly devoted to reducing subthreshold <b>leakage.</b> However, at sub- 65 nm feature sizes, gate <b>leakage</b> current grows faster and is expected to surpass subthreshold <b>leakage</b> current. In this work, an extensive analysis of the circuit level characteristics of subthreshold and gate <b>leakage</b> currents is performed at 45 nm and 32 nm feature sizes. The analysis provides several key observations on the interdependency of gate and subthreshold <b>leakage</b> currents. Based on these observations, a new <b>leakage</b> reduction technique is proposed that optimizes both the <b>leakage</b> currents. This technique identifies minimum <b>leakage</b> vectors for a given circuit based on the number of transistors in OFF state and their position in the stack. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is compared to most of the mainstream <b>leakage</b> reduction techniques by implementing them on ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits. The proposed <b>leakage</b> reduction technique proved to be more effective in reducing gate <b>leakage</b> current than subthreshold <b>leakage</b> current. However, when combined with dual-threshold and variable-threshold CMOS techniques, substantial subthreshold <b>leakage</b> current reduction was also achieved.

The Holmenkolbanen company opened the western {{section of the}} tunnel from Majorstuen via Valkyrie plass to Nationaltheatret in 1928. In 1966, the Oslo Metro opened, including the tunnel from Tøyen via Grønland to Jernbanetorget. In 1977, the eastern end was extended to Sentrum, but the extension was closed in 1983 because of water <b>leakages.</b> In 1987, the Sentrum station reopened as Stortinget, and became the terminus of both the western and eastern lines.

40|$|Abstract—There {{are three}} {{major sources of}} <b>leakage</b> current today, namely the {{sub-threshold}} <b>leakage,</b> gate <b>leakage</b> and the reverse biased junction band-to-band-tunneling <b>leakage.</b> These currents depend on the logic state of a CMOS circuit as determined by input pattern. Consequently, there exists a pattern that will produce the highest <b>leakage</b> current. Previously, researchers have investigated the problem of finding such a pattern for maximizing sub-threshold <b>leakage</b> current. A pattern that maximizes sub-threshold <b>leakage</b> may not maximize the overall <b>leakage</b> current. In this paper, we consider all <b>leakage</b> sources together {{and try to find}} an input pattern(s) that will maximize the composite <b>leakage</b> current made up of all three components.

25|$|The first combat actions {{showed that}} the fuel {{reservoirs}} were prone to explode when the vehicle was hit by an artillery round.

This necessitated the construction of an additional safer exit, at {{the left side of the}} vehicle. On 8 September 1917 only twelve tanks had been changed to this new configuration. As of 21 March 1918 about 245 vehicles featured all three of these major improvements.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a survey}} by the {{regulatory}} body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through <b>leakages</b> of the pipes.|$|E
25|$|By 1973, {{problems}} with the estate were becoming apparent; the walkways of the deck level created dangerously isolated areas which became hotspots for crime and robbery, and provided easy escape routes for criminals.

In 1976, less than ten years after the estate opened, the Department of the Environment concluded that the estate was of such poor quality that the only solution was demolition. This decision was unwelcome to residents, and relations between the community and the local authority became increasingly confrontational.

40|$|We show carbon <b>leakage</b> {{depends on}} the type of biofuel policy (tax credit versus mandate), the {{domestic}} and foreign gasoline supply and fuel demand elasticities, and on consumption and production shares of world oil markets for the country introducing the biofuel policy.

We also distinguish domestic and international <b>leakage</b> where the latter is always positive, but domestic <b>leakage</b> can be negative with a mandate. The IPCC definition of <b>leakage</b> omits domestic <b>leakage,</b> resulting in biased estimates. <b>Leakage</b> with a tax credit always exceeds that of a mandate, while the combination of a mandate and tax credit generates lower <b>leakage</b> than a tax credit alone.
