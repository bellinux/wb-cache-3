40|$|The folding of {{a protein}} towards its native {{state is a}} rather {{complicated}} process. However there are empirical evidences that the folding time correlates with the contact order, a simple measure of the spatial organisation of the native state of the protein. Contact order {{is related to the}} average length of the main chain loops formed by amino acids which are in contact. Here we argue that folding kinetics can be influenced also by the entanglement that loops may undergo within the overall three dimensional protein structure. In order to explore such possibility, we introduce a novel descriptor, which we call "maximum intrachain contact entanglement". Specifically, we measure the maximum Gaussian entanglement between any <b>looped</b> <b>portion</b> of a protein and any other non-overlapping subchain of the same protein, which is easily computed by discretized line integrals on the coordinates of the C_α atoms. By analyzing experimental data sets of two-state and multistate folders, we show that also the new index is a good predictor of the folding rate. Moreover, being only partially correlated with previous methods, it can be integrated with them to yield more accurate predictions. Comment: 8 figures. v 2 : new titl...|$|E

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for cellular immortalization in human cells is the elongation of telomeres through the upregulation of telomerase {{or by the}} alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. In this study, telomere structure in multiple ALT cell lines was examined by electron microscopy. Nuclei were isolated from GM 847, GM 847 -Tert, and WI- 38 VA 13 ALT cells, psoralen photo-cross-linked in situ, and the telomere restriction fragments were purified by gel filtration chromatography. Examination of telomere-enriched fractions revealed frequent extrachromosomal circles, ranging from 0. 7 to 56. 8 kb. t-loops were also observed, with the <b>loop</b> <b>portion</b> ranging from 0. 5 to 70. 2 kb. The total length of the loop plus tail of the t-loops corresponded to the telomere restriction fragment length from the ALT cell lines as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The presence of extrachromosomal circles containing telomeric DNA was confirmed by two-dimensional pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. These results show that extrachromosomal telomeric DNA circles are present in ALT nuclei and suggest a roll-and-spread mechanism of telomere elongation similar to that seen in previous observations of multiple yeast species. Results presented here also indicate that expression of telomerase in GM 847 cells does not affect t-loop or extrachromosomal circle formation...|$|R
40|$|U 14 {{is a small}} {{nucleolar}} RNA (snoRNA) {{required for}} early cleavages of eukaryotic precursor rRNA. The U 14 RNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is distinguished from its vertebrate homologues {{by the presence of}} a stem-loop domain that is essential for function. This element, known as the Y-domain, is located in the U 14 sequence between two universal sequences that base pair with 18 S rRNA. Sequence data obtained for the U 14 homologues from four additional phylogenetically distinct yeasts showed the Y-domain is not unique to S. cerevisiae. Comparison of the five Y-domain sequences revealed a common stem-loop structure with a conserved loop sequence that includes eight invariant nucleotides. Conservation of these features suggests that the Y-domain is a recognition signal for an essential interaction. Several plant U 14 RNAs were found to contain similar structures, though with an unrelated consensus sequence in the <b>loop</b> <b>portion.</b> The U 14 gene from the most distantly related yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, was found to be active in S. cerevisiae, showing that Y-domain function is conserved and that U 14 function can be provided by variants in which the essential elements are embedded in dissimilar flanking sequences. This last result suggests that U 14 function may be determined solely by the essential elements...|$|R
40|$|Besides linear RNAs, pre-mRNA {{splicing}} generates three {{forms of}} RNAs: lariat introns, Y-structure introns from trans-splicing, and circular exons through exon skipping. To study {{the persistence of}} excised introns in total cellular RNA, we used three Escherichia coli 3 ? to 5 ? exoribonucleases. Ribonuclease R (RNase R) thoroughly degrades the abundant linear RNAs and the Y-structure RNA, while preserving the <b>loop</b> <b>portion</b> of a lariat RNA. Ribonuclease II (RNase II) and polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) also preserve the lariat loop, but are less efficient in degrading linear RNAs. RNase R digestion of the total RNA from human skeletal muscle generates an RNA pool consisting of lariat and circular RNAs. RT-PCR across the branch sites confirmed lariat RNAs and circular RNAs in the pool generated by constitutive and alternative splicing of the dystrophin pre-mRNA. Our results indicate that RNase R treatment {{can be used to}} construct an intronic cDNA library, in which majority of the intron lariats are represented. The highly specific activity of RNase R implies its ability to screen for rare intragenic trans-splicing in any target gene with a large background of cis-splicing. Further analysis of the intronic RNA pool from a specific tissue or cell will provide insights into the global profile of alternative splicing. © 2006 Oxford University Press...|$|R

40|$|Islet amyloid {{polypeptide}} (amylin) is {{the main}} component in amyloid deposits formed in type II diabetes. We used triplet quenching to probe the dynamics of contact formation between the N-terminal disulfide loop and a C-terminal tryptophan in monomeric amylins from human and rat. Quenching rates measured {{in the absence of}} denaturant are four times larger than those in 6 M guanidinium chloride, indicating a decrease in the average end-to-end distance (collapse) at low denaturant concentrations. We were surprised to find an even greater (sevenfold) increase in quenching rates on removal of denaturant for a hydrophilic control peptide containing the disulfide loop compared to the same peptide without the loop (twofold change). These results suggest that collapse is driven by backbone-backbone and backbone-side chain interactions involving the disulfide <b>loop</b> <b>portion</b> of the chain rather than by the formation of side-chain hydrophobic contacts. Molecular dynamics simulations of the control peptide show that the collapse results from hydrogen-bonding interactions between the central residues of the chain and the disulfide loop. The quenching experiments also indicate that the monomer of the human, amyloidogenic form of amylin is more compact than the rat form, which does not form amyloid. We discuss these newly observed differences between human and rat amylin in solution and their possible relation to aggregation and to the physiological function of amylin binding to the calcitonin receptor...|$|R

Virus particles are not present in vegetative cells but they are produced in the sporangia formed on vegetative filaments that have been transferred newly into culture. Thus, we proposed that these viruses exist in the vegetative cells in a latent form (R. G. Ivey, E. C. Henry, A. M. Lee, L. Klepper, S. K. Krueger, and R. H. Meints, Virology 220 : 267 - 273, 1996). In this article we present evidence that the two FsV genomes are integrated into the host genome during vegetative growth. The FsV genome integration sites were identified by cloning the regions where the FsV genome {{is linked to the}} host DNA. FsV- 158 and FsV- 178 are integrated into two distinct locations in the algal genome. In contrast, the integration sites in the two viral genomes are identical. Notably, the integration sites in the host and viruses contain GC and CG dinucleotide sequences, respectively, from which the GC sequences are recovered at both host-virus junctions.

40|$|The {{activity}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} Rev as a regulator of viral mRNA expression is tightly linked to its ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm; these properties are conferred by a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) and by an arginine-rich nuclear localization signal/RNA binding domain (NLS/RBD) required for binding to the Rev-responsive element (RRE) located on viral unspliced and singly spliced mRNAs. Structure predictions and biophysical measurements indicate that Rev consists of an unstructured region followed by a helix-loop-helix motif containing the NLS/RBD and sequences directing multimerization and by a carboxy-terminal tail containing the NES. We present evidence that the <b>loop</b> <b>portion</b> of the helix-loop-helix region is an essential functional determinant that is required for binding to the RRE and for correct intracellular routing. Data obtained using a protein kinase CK 2 phosphorylation assay indicated that the loop region is essential for juxtaposition of helices 1 and 2 and phosphorylation by protein kinase CK 2. Deletion of the loop resulted in partial accumulation of Rev in SC 35 -positive nuclear bodies that resembled nuclear bodies that form in response to inhibition of transcription. Accumulation of the DeltaLoop mutant in nuclear bodies depended {{on the presence of}} an intact NES, suggesting that both the loop and the NES play a role in controlling intranuclear compartmentalization of Rev and its association with splicing factors...|$|R

Two conventional swine were anesthetized, and ligated ileum loops were prepared during abdominal surgery. The loops were inoculated with 108 L. intracellularis or saline. After 60 min, samples of each loop were processed for routine histologic and electron microscopic study. Histologic and ultrathin sections of all the loops appeared normal, with no apposition of bacteria and host cells or bacterial entry events in any <b>loop.</b> <b>Portions</b> of ileum from a single gnotobiotic piglet were introduced as xenografts into the subcutis of each flank of 5 weaned mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease. After 4 wk, 108 L. intracellularis were inoculated into each of 4 viable xenografts with a sterile needle; the other 3 viable xenografts received saline. Histologic and ultrathin sections of all the xenografts 3 wk after inoculation showed relatively normal porcine intestinal architecture, with normal crypts, crypt cell differentiation, and low villous structures; the xenografts treated with the bacteria also showed intracytoplasmic L. intracellularis within crypt and villous epithelial cells. Thus, entry of L. intracellularis into target epithelial cells and multiplication may not be sufficient alone to directly cause cell proliferation. A proliferative response may require active division of crypt cells and differentiation in conjunction with L. intracellularis growth...|$|R

40|$|Alignment of {{homologous}} {{amino acid}} sequences reveals that insertion mutations are fairly common in evolution. Hitherto, the structural consequences of insertion mutations {{on the surface}} and in the interior of proteins of known structures have received little attention. We report here the high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of 2 site-directed insertion mutants of staphylococcal nuclease. The structure of the first insertion mutant, in which 2 glycine residues were inserted on the protein surface in the amino-terminal beta-strand, has been solved to 1. 70 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R value of 0. 182. The inserted residues are accommodated in a special 3 -residue beta-bulge. A bridging water molecule in the newly created cavity satisfies the hydrogen bonding requirements of the beta-sheet by forming a bifurcated hydrogen bond to 1 beta-strand, and a single hydrogen bond to the other beta-strand. The second insertion mutant contains a single leucine residue inserted {{at the end of the}} third beta-strand. The structure was solved to 2. 0 A resolution and refined to a final R value of 0. 196. The insertion is accommodated in a register shift that changes the conformation of the flexible <b>loop</b> <b>portion</b> of the molecule, relaxing and widening the omega turn. This structural alteration results in changes in position and coordination of a bound calcium ion important for catalysis.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, RNA {{silencing}} has gained significant attention {{because of its}} success in genomic scale research {{and also in the}} genetic improvement of crop plants. However, {{little is known about the}} molecular basis of siRNA processing in association with its target transcript. To reveal this process for improving hpRNA-mediated gene silencing in crop plants, the soybean GmFAD 3 gene family was chosen as a test model. We analyzed RNAi mutant soybean lines in which three members of the GmFAD 3 gene family were silenced. The silencing levels of FAD 3 A, FAD 3 B and FAD 3 C were correlated with the degrees of sequence homology between the inverted repeat of hpRNA and the GmFAD 3 transcripts in the RNAi lines. Strikingly, transgenes in two of the three RNAi lines were heavily methylated, leading to a dramatic reduction of hpRNA-derived siRNAs. Small RNAs corresponding to the <b>loop</b> <b>portion</b> of the hairpin transcript were detected while much lower levels of siRNAs were found outside of the target region. siRNAs generated from the 318 -bp inverted repeat were found to be diced much more frequently at stem sequences close to the loop and associated with the inferred cleavage sites on the target transcripts, manifesting "hot spots". The top candidate hpRNA-derived siRNA share certain sequence features with mature miRNA.

40|$|P/Q Ca 2 + channel {{activity}} is inhibited by G protein-coupled receptor activation. Channel inhibition requires a direct Gβγ binding onto the pore-forming subunit, Cav 2. 1. It {{is characterized by}} biophysical changes, including current amplitude reduction, activation kinetic slowing, and an I-V curve shift, {{which leads to a}} reluctant mode. Here, we have characterized the contribution of the auxiliary β 3 -subunit to channel regulation by G proteins. The shift in I-V to a P/Q reluctant mode is exclusively observed in the presence of β 3. Along with the observation that Gβγ has no effect on the I-V curve of Cav 2. 1 alone, we propose that the reluctant mode promoted by Gβγ corresponds to a state in which the β 3 -subunit has been displaced from its channel-binding site. We validate this hypothesis with a β 3 -I-II 2. 1 loop chimera construct. Gβγ binding onto the I-II 2. 1 <b>loop</b> <b>portion</b> of the chimera releases the β 3 -binding domain and makes it available for binding onto the I-II loop of Cav 1. 2, a G protein-insensitive channel. This finding is extended to the full-length Cav 2. 1 channel by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Gβγ injection into Xenopus oocytes displaces a Cy 3 -labeled β 3 -subunit from a GFP-tagged Cav 2. 1 channel. We conclude that β-subunit dissociation from the channel complex constitutes a key step in P/Q calcium channel regulation by G proteins that underlies the reluctant state and is an important process for modulating neurotransmission through G protein-coupled receptors...|$|R
