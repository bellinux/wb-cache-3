25|$|There are {{different}} types and shapes of dies to form various shapes of pasta. Generally, pastas are categorized into two large groups: long pasta (like spaghetti, fettuccine, linguine and etc.) and short pasta (like elbow-shaped macaroni, penne, shells and etc.). Circular dies with rotating blades underneath them {{are used for}} short products, where long rectangular dies form the <b>long</b> <b>products.</b> The dies are made of Teflon-coated bronze. The extruder pushes the dough through the dies and blades or trimmers cut the dough in the desired length.|$|E

40|$|The main {{result of}} this paper, called the Avalanche Principle (AP), relates the {{expansion}} of a <b>long</b> <b>product</b> of matrices with the product of expansions of the individual matrices. This principle was introduced by M. Goldstein and W. Schlag {{in the context of}} SL(2,C) matrices. Besides extending the AP to matrices of arbitrary dimension, possibly non-invertible, the geometric approach we use here provides a relation between the most expanding (singular) directions of such a <b>long</b> <b>product</b> of matrices and the corresponding singular directions of the first and last matrices in the product. The AP along with other estimates on the action of matrices on Grassmann manifolds will play a fundamental role in [6] to establish the continuity the Lyapunov exponents and of the Oseledets decomposition for linear cocycles. This is the draft of a chapter in our forthcoming research monograph [6]...|$|R

5000|$|When Nucor—now one of {{the largest}} steel {{producers}} in the U.S.—decided to enter the <b>long</b> <b>products</b> market in 1969, they chose to start up a mini-mill, with an EAF as its steelmaking furnace, soon followed by other manufacturers. Whilst Nucor expanded rapidly in the Eastern US, the companies that followed them into mini-mill operations concentrated on local markets for <b>long</b> <b>products,</b> where the use of an EAF allowed the plants to vary production according to local demand. This pattern was also followed globally, with EAF steel production primarily used for <b>long</b> <b>products,</b> while integrated mills, using blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces, cornered the markets for [...] "flat products"—sheet steel and heavier steel plate. In 1987, Nucor made the decision to expand into the flat products market, still using the EAF production method.|$|E

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{interpretation of}} the results obtained by eddy currents testing <b>long</b> cylindrical <b>products</b> is much easier when using long rather than short solenoids. The <b>long</b> <b>product</b> is then in an uniform state of magnetic induction. A simple model is developped to size long axial emerging rectangular defects of various widths and depths. For non-ferromagnetic materials, at relatively high frequency, the inductance L varies linearly with the cross-section of the defect and the resistance R varies also linearly with {{the depth of the}} defect. The model allows to calculate the linear coefficients of influence. Experimental tests carried on copper and aluminium rods have fully validated the theoretical model. For ferromagnetic materials, the model is modified in order to take the magnetization into account. Experimental tests are in progress and results will be presented elsewhere...|$|R
30|$|In general, {{testing a}} model needs more sample sizes and stress levels than {{estimating}} model parameters. For the ALT, {{it is difficult}} to validate the extrapolation effect of the model directly because of the <b>long</b> <b>product</b> life and high reliability. Perhaps, new ideas are required to deal with the uncertainty of the acceleration model. Besides, for some products with complicated structures, their life distribution and stress-life relationship may be difficult to describe in a simple form.|$|R
