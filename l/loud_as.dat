25|$|Shoghi Effendi {{then set}} out to {{memorize}} a number of prayers, and chanted them as <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> he could. This caused family members to ask `Abdu'l-Bahá to quieten him down, a request which he apparently refused.|$|E

25|$|The devocalization {{procedure}} {{does not}} take away a dog's ability to bark. Dogs will normally bark {{just as much as}} before the procedure. After the procedure the sound will be softer, typically about half as <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> before, or less, and it is not as sharp or piercing. So while the procedure does not stop barking or silence the animal completely, it is effective in reducing the sound level and sharpness of the dog's bark.|$|E

25|$|Although no Screamers {{are ever}} seen in the book, they are heard - their scream is so <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> {{to be able to}} deafen and daze people far away from it. They are also the primary method of alarm for {{sleeping}} Myrmidons - only a Screamer can wake a Myrmidon quickly. They do not travel in groups. It is mentioned that when a human is close to the screamer while it screams it can peel away the skin on the insides of their ears.|$|E
25|$|The Nashi king {{inviting}} the eighth Karmapa, Mikyö Dorje to Lijiang in 1516. The king, {{worried about the}} safety of the Karmapa on his long journey to Lijiang, dispatched an army of four generals and ten thousand soldiers to accompany him. On the third day of the fourth month, the Karmapa reached the border between Tibet and the Nashi kingdom. Accompanied by his brother and his uncle, who were both riding elephants and escorted by many riders on horseback, the Nashi king, riding on a palanquin, received them with this magnificent welcome. The king prostrated himself before the Karmapa, the elephants broke their tethers and bowed down three times before him, and raised their trunks to the sky trumpeting <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> thunderclaps.|$|E
25|$|Long Way to the Top was a 2001 Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) six-part {{documentary}} {{on the history of}} Australian rock and roll from 1956 to the modern era. Episode 3: Billy Killed the Fish, broadcast on 29 August, featured interviews with Loyde, Michael Chugg (Thorpe's manager / promoter) and Thorpe. They described their Sunbury festival experiences and the development of pub rock in Australia. According to Chugg, an Aztec performance at Sydney's Bondi Lifesaver club in 1974 was so <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> to kill a tankful of tropical fish in an upstairs area–hence the episode title. During August 2002, promoters Chugg and Kevin Jacobsen with Thorpe as co-producer, organised a related concert tour, Long Way to the Top. Concerts included Thorpe performing with the 'original' Aztecs line-up in one set and the 'Sunbury' Aztecs in a second. Performances at two Sydney concerts in September were recorded, broadcast on ABC-TV and subsequently released on DVD in December.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} reasonably accurate {{estimate of}} the speed of sound in air was made by William Derham, and acknowledged by Isaac Newton. Derham had a telescope {{at the top of the}} tower of the Church of St Laurence in Upminster, England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final {{estimate of the}} speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200–400 meters, and not needing something as <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> a shotgun.|$|E
500|$|Local {{residents}} have {{complained about the}} noise on the M32. A report by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs showed that traffic noise can be as <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> 75 decibels in neighbouring estates. In 2014, a petition was created to campaign Bristol City Council to install quieter road surfaces and noise barriers along the motorway.|$|E
500|$|... "Raining Men", {{was sent}} to urban radio on December 7, 2010 as an urban radio single and third track from <b>Loud</b> <b>as</b> a single in the US. The song {{featured}} female rapper Nicki Minaj. It peaked at number 48 on the US Billboard R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. [...] "Raining Men" [...] received mixed reviews from critics who praised the chemistry between Rihanna and Minaj but criticized the song for failing to create anything new or original.|$|E

500|$|Back in Liverpool, {{the group}} played an {{engagement}} on 17 December 1960, at the Casbah Coffee Club, with Chas Newby substituting for Sutcliffe, playing bass {{with them for}} four shows. Newby was shocked at the vast improvement of their playing and singing after the residency in Hamburg, and {{was struck by how}} powerful Best's drumming now was, pushing the group to play harder and louder. (It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to [...] "Crank it up" [...] = play as <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> possible).|$|E
500|$|Frusciante's tenth solo album, The Empyrean, was {{released}} on January 20, 2009 through Record Collection. The record—a concept album—was in production between December 2006 and March 2008. The Empyrean features an array of musicians including Frusciante's ex-Chili Peppers bandmate Flea, friends Josh Klinghoffer and former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, as well as guest musicians including Sonus Quartet and New Dimension Singers. Frusciante stated: [...] "I'm really happy with [...] and I've listened to it {{a lot for the}} psychedelic experience it provides," [...] suggesting the album is [...] "to be played as <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> possible and is suited to dark living rooms late at night." ...|$|E
500|$|Cui Jian {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by Western artists such as Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Talking Heads; in the late 1980s he even performed with a hair style modeled on that of John Lennon. In [...] "Nothing to My Name" [...] and other songs, he intentionally altered the sounds of traditional Chinese musical instruments by mixing them with elements of rock music, such as electric guitar. He also purposely divorced his musical style {{from that of the}} revolutionary songs and proletarian operas that were common under Chairman Mao Zedong during the Cultural Revolutionfor example, he performed his music very <b>loud,</b> <b>as</b> high as 150decibels, just because Mao had considered loud music disruptive to the social order.|$|E

500|$|Along with Sir Humphry Davy (who visited Fyne Court in 1827), Crosse {{was one of}} {{the first}} to develop large voltaic piles. Although it was not the largest he built, Henry Minchin Noad's Manual of Electricity {{describes}} a battery consisting of 50 jars containing [...] of coated surface. Using his wires Crosse was able to charge and discharge it some 20 times a minute, [...] "accompanied by reports almost as <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> those of a cannon". He became known locally as [...] "the thunder and lightning man". In 1836 Sir Richard Phillips described seeing a wide variety of voltaic piles at Fyne Court, totalling 2,500, of which 1,500 were in use when he visited.|$|E
500|$|The Mahabharata {{describes}} him thus: Kabandha was [...] "as {{big as a}} mountain, dark as a black cloud, with pointed hairs {{all over}} his body and looked fierce with a voice as <b>loud</b> <b>as</b> thunder. He had an eye on his stomach, round and yellow, emitting a glare like a fire-name. Looking wicked he thrust his big tongue out of his huge mouth licking the sides." [...] The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha. Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck. He had only one eye {{on his chest and}} a mouth on his belly. He used his long arms to draw his prey closer. Kabandha is often depicted as a tree.|$|E
500|$|... "What You Want" [...] {{contains}} {{a variety of}} musical elements and influences of several music genres: industrial rock, [...] gothic pop, nu metal, classic synth-pop, electro-pop dance and baroque metal along with a pop hook. Several critics noted {{that some of the}} gothic and metal elements were prominent in the band's previous material, mostly due to their songs' piano-driven melody. Lewis Corner of the website Digital Spy noted that the classical strings present in the song reinforced the band's medieval influences. Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters further compared the song with Korn's music while Rick Florino of Artistdirect noted similarities to works by Depeche Mode. The song's beat was further described as dynamic, [...] "slamming" [...] and <b>loud.</b> <b>As</b> the song progresses, the melody goes through [...] "dramatic crashes" [...] and crescendos.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} she could {{have told me that}} I did not know before," [...] he said, {{obviously}} to himself, but perfectly audible. [...] "Because I always did know it," [...] he added <b>louder,</b> <b>as</b> if in despair.|$|R
6000|$|The silence {{continued}} for a while, the Dresden-china {{clock on the}} mantelpiece ticking <b>louder</b> and <b>louder</b> <b>as</b> if to say, [...] "I, Time, am here. Do not make your plans forgetting me, little mortals; I change your thoughts and wills. You are but my puppets." ...|$|R
60|$|With beating hearts {{the boys}} watched the conflict, and could mark that the British fire grew feebler, {{and in some}} places ceased altogether, while the wild yells of the Russians rose <b>louder</b> <b>as</b> they pressed forward exultingly, believing that victory lay within their grasp.|$|R
