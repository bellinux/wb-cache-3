25|$|Burnaby {{occupies}} 98.60 square kilometres (38.07 sq mi) and {{is located}} at the geographical centre of the Metro Vancouver area. Situated between the city of Vancouver on the west and Port Moody, Coquitlam, and New Westminster on the east, Burnaby is further bounded by Burrard Inlet and the Fraser River on the north and south respectively. Burnaby, Vancouver and New Westminster collectively occupy the major portion of the Burrard Peninsula. The elevation of Burnaby ranges from sea level to a maximum of 370 metres (1,200ft) atop Burnaby Mountain. Due to its elevation, the city of Burnaby experiences quite a bit more snowfall during the winter months than nearby Vancouver or Richmond. Overall, the physical landscape of Burnaby is one of hills, ridges, valleys and an alluvial plain. The land features and their relative locations have had an influence on the <b>location,</b> <b>type</b> and form of development in the city.|$|E

40|$|Modelling {{distributed}} systems requires notions as locations, communication among the distributed processes, and resource access. To express time constraints for such systems, we have introduced timed distributed π-calculus called tDπ {{as an extension}} of the π-calculus with <b>locations,</b> <b>types</b> and timers. Timers define both timeouts for communication channels and timeouts for resources. We define the operational semantics of tDπ by using a reduction relation. We introduce and study several timed barbed bisimulations in the framework of tDπ. The bisimulations are compared with respect to their distinguishing power over timed located processes. The paper also emphasises the diversity of observational choices in tDπ (communication channel names, <b>locations,</b> <b>types</b> and timer values). ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRenewable {{distributed}} generation (DG) {{has become one}} of the key drivers of fast changing energy scenario around the world. A clear strategy is ardently essential to accelerate growth of grid interactive renewable DGs. This paper proposes a constrained multi objective particle swarm optimization based planning of renewable DGs for distribution network. The proposed method tries to find the best trade-off between benefit to economic ratio, voltage stability factor and network security index and then generate optimal <b>location,</b> <b>types</b> and size of renewable DGs for distribution network. Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is shown on a typical 28 -bus Indian distribution network. Test results depict that proper selection of <b>locations,</b> <b>types</b> and sizes of DGs would be helpful to maximize economical benefit, improve security and enhance voltage stability of the distribution network. The study also illustrates the effect of load modelling in planning of renewable DGs for distribution network...|$|R
