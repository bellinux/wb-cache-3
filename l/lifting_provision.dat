It emphasised diplomatic efforts by the five plus one (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and United States) to resolve the nuclear issue and encouraged further efforts. It commended the Director-General of the IAEA Yukiya Amano for a draft agreement between France, Iran and Russia and requested a report within 90 days on whether Iran had begun co-operating with the IAEA and suspended activities mentioned in Resolution 1737. On the basis of the report, the Council would review the sanctions regime and would <b>lift</b> <b>provisions</b> if compliance was reported or consider further measures in the light of non-compliance with Security Council resolutions.|$|R
25|$|After Aquino {{retired to}} private life {{following}} {{the end of}} her term she remained active in the Philippine political scene, constantly voicing opposition and dissent to government actions and policies, which she deemed as threats to the liberal traditions and democratic foundations of the country. In 1997, Aquino, together with Cardinal Jaime Sin, led a huge rally which succeeded in thwarting then President Fidel Ramos' attempt to extend his term by amending the 1987 Constitution's restriction on presidential term limits. In 1998, Aquino endorsed the candidacy of former police general and Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim for president. Lim, however, lost to then Vice-President Joseph Estrada, who won by a landslide. The following year, Aquino again with Cardinal Sin successfully opposed President Estrada's plan to amend the Constitution, which he said was intended to <b>lift</b> <b>provisions</b> that 'restrict' economic activities and investments; he denied that it was another ploy for him to extend his stay in office.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Novice {{drivers are}} at {{relatively}} {{high risk of}} road traffic injury. There is good evidence that Graduated Driving Licensing (GDL) schemes reduce collisions rates, by reducing exposure to risk and by extending learning periods. Legislation for a proposed scheme in Northern Ireland was passed in 2016, providing an opportunity for future evaluation of the full public health impacts of a scheme in a European context within a natural experiment. This qualitative {{study was designed to}} inform the logic model for such an evaluation, and provide baseline qualitative data on the role of private cars in health and wellbeing. Methods Nine group interviews with young people aged 16 – 23 (N =  43) and two group interviews with parents of young people (N =  8) were conducted in a range of settings in Northern Ireland in 2015. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Results Informal car-pooling within and beyond households led to routine expectations of <b>lift</b> <b>provision</b> and uptake. Experiences of risky driving situations were widespread. In rural areas, extensive use of farm vehicles for transport needs meant many learner drivers had both early driving experience and expectations that legislation may have to be locally adapted to meet social needs. Cars were used as a site for socialising, as well as essential means of transport. Alternative modes (public transport, walking and cycling) were held in low esteem, even where available. Recall of other transport-related public health messages and parents’ existing use of GDL-type restrictions suggested GDL schemes were acceptable in principle. There was growing awareness and use of in-car technologies (telematics) used by insurance companies to reward good driving. Conclusions Key issues to consider in evaluating the broader public health impact of GDL will include: changes in injury rates for licensed car occupants and other populations and modes; changes in exposure to risk in the licensed and general population; and impact on transport exclusion. We suggest an important pathway will be change in social norms around offering and accepting lifts and to risk-taking. The growing adoption of in-car telematics will have implications for future GDL programmes and for evaluation...|$|R

40|$|The University of Northampton (UoN) {{offers an}} {{academic}} <b>provision</b> in <b>Lift</b> Engineering {{aimed at a}} specialist engineering education {{closely linked to the}} needs of the <b>lift</b> industry. The <b>provision</b> has been developed in partnership with, and receives strong support from, the Lift and Escalator Industry Association (LEIA). The programme includes the following ‘taught’ courses: - Higher National Certificate in Lift Engineering (HNC), - Foundation Degree (FdSc) in Lift Engineering, - Masters (MSc) Lift Engineering. The Foundation Degree and Higher National Certificate awards, taught entirely by distance learning, provide educational underpinning for the Lift Engineering technician career path [1] (see the diagram in Figure 1). The HNC [2] and FdSc [3] have a modular structure covering the fundamentals of engineering, including mechanical, electrical, electronic and hydraulic engineering design and analysis. Examples used are taken from the lift industry to ensure that the course remains relevant and up to date for this diverse sector. The concepts of contract management and business are also included into the programme, and students undertake a work based project focussing on an area of their choice. The path forms a bridge to the MSc [4] and to the research degree programme (Doctorate/ Masters by research). Students are also able to proceed to a general undergraduate Engineering degree course (BSc Hons [5]) ...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{innovation}} and the decreasing costs of wireless and other technologies, combined with progressive policy and regulatory environments, {{have resulted in}} the provision of telecommunication services in remote areas thought unserviceable by incumbent telcos in Latin America, Central Europe, and Asia. In line with the increasing number of success stories {{in other parts of the}} world, the South African government, as part of the policy of "managed liberalization" of the telecommunications sector, <b>lifted</b> the monopoly <b>provision</b> of telephone services in under-serviced areas by permitting smaller-scale entrants into the telecommunications market. Emerging from the second round of telecommunications policy reform in 2001, following the initial reforms to the sector in 1996, it was anticipated that these special operators would be licensed in 2002. Although licenses were finally granted following several licensing delays in June 2004 to seven applicants (three conditionally) from the ten areas demarcated in the first round, further delays in the final issuing of these licenses meant these licensees were only able to become operational in 2005. With the Ministry of Communications' latest policy directives on further liberalization of the market, which allows for some of the services previously reserved for Under-Serviced Area Licensees (USALs) to be more widely available from February 2005, just prior to the underserviced area licensees coming on stream, the window of opportunity for these small-scale new entrants may have closed. This paper assesses the degree to which policy and regulatory conditions promote the viability of these operators and facilitate their evolution as business and developmental models. Drawing on international experience, the policy and regulatory framework for these licenses is assessed. -super- 2 The paper focuses specifically on other jurisdictions where similar regimes have been introduced as part of a national policy rather than on the wide range of pilot projects deploying innovative technologies that may provide low-cost solutionsbut which are not scaled up or formally implemented. -super- 3 The key success factors in these jurisdictions are weighed in relation to the sustainability of the underserviced area operators (often referred to as regional or rural operators in other jurisdictions) under the conditions that exist in South Africa. Finally, it provides some lessons for other developing countries wishing to consider the South African experience. Copyright (c) 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R
