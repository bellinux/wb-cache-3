40|$|Abstract Background Identification of {{predictive}} and prognostic biomarkers {{for patients}} with disease and undergoing different therapeutic options is a very active area of investigation. Many of these studies seek biomarkers among circulating proteins accessed in blood. Many <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardization</b> in materials and procedures have been identified which can impact the resulting data. Methods Here, we have observed unexpected variability in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> commonly tested analytes in serum which were processed and stored under standardized conditions. We have identified apparent changes in cytokine, chemokine and growth factor levels detected by multiplex Luminex assay in melanoma patient and healthy donor serum samples, over storage time at - 80 °C. Controls included Luminex kit standards, multiplexed cytokine standards and WHO cytokine controls. Data were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum testing and Spearman's test for correlations. Results The interpretation of these changes is confounded by lot-to-lot kit standard curve reagent changes made by a single manufacturer of Luminex kits. Conclusions This study identifies previously unknown sources of variation in a commonly used biomarker assay, and suggests additional <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> controls needed for identification of true changes in circulating protein levels. </p...|$|R

40|$|A strategic, technical, and {{organizational}} {{examination of the}} customer enabling effort at Intel Corporation was undertaken. The context {{of this study was}} the launch of the first boxed mobile processor in the company's history. The technical component of the work consisted of the design and development of a thermal solution to complement the boxed processor. The organizational component involved an examination of the way the team was structured to execute the project. The strategic component looked at the effect of the enabling effort on the mobile computing industry at large. Thermal solutions that met the technical specifications of the boxed mobile processor were successfully designed and prototyped. The implication of a specific thermal solution design on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardization</b> of the notebook computer platform is discussed. The conclusion is that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardization</b> in the industry is already high and is unlikely to be influenced by the boxed mobile processor.

40|$|Abstract: As Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Web {{services}} are becoming widely deployed, the problematic of security {{is far from}} being solved. In an attempt to address this issue, the industry proposed several extensions to the SOAP protocol that currently reached different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardization.</b> However, no architectural guidelines have yet been proposed. In this paper we first outline the security chal-lenges and the specifications that address these challenges and then present our con-cept- the Service Oriented Security Architecture, SOSA. We argue that the different security functions (authentication, authorization, audit, etc.) should be realized as dif-ferent stand-alone Web services- security services. These security services can then be chained together by means of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) techniques such as message routing on Enterprise Services Buses (ESB). Next, we will present a prototypical implementation of this framework and describe our experiences so far. We show that by distributing the security functions, a more flexible architecture can be designed that would lower the costs associated with implementation, administration and maintenance. ...|$|R
40|$|The marine finfish {{industry}} worldwide depends greatly on {{the mass}} culture of Brachionus rotifers. Recently, molecular data have revealed {{a more complicated}} view about the species status of Brachionus rotifers than previous mainly morphological assessments. Under this view, Brachionus rotifers are comprised of many morphologically similar, albeit genetically differentiated, cryptic members of larger groups. A redefinition of the cultured rotifer species/biotypes is therefore needed if aquaculture is to reach higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardization</b> and predictability. In this work, {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) and single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) methods are applied to the COI and 16 S rRNA mitochondrial genes. A detailed COI restriction map was constructed, using sequence data from all known representatives of Brachionus phylogroups. Therefore, {{it is the first time}} that such an extended restriction database has been produced. Several restriction endonucleases are proposed for the discrimination of the different Brachionus species/biotypes. Furthermore, eight different SSCP gel alleles are described for the 16 S region. Using these data, five Brachionus species/biotypes were identified in 78 samples collected from laboratories and hatcheries around the world...|$|R

40|$|The {{demarcation}} of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from complex sequence {{data sets}} {{is a key}} step in contemporary studies of microbial ecology. However, as biologically motivated 'optimal' OTU-binning algorithms remain elusive, many conceptually distinct approaches continue to be used. Using a global data set of 887 [*] 870 bacterial 16 S rRNA gene sequences, we objectively quantified biases introduced by several widely employed sequence clustering algorithms. We found that OTU-binning methods often provided surprisingly non-equivalent partitions of identical data sets, notably when clustering to the same nominal similarity thresholds; and we quantified the resulting impact on ecological data description for a well-defined human skin microbiome data set. We observed that some methods were very robust to varying clustering thresholds, while others {{were found to be}} highly susceptible even to slight threshold variations. Moreover, we comprehensively quantified the impact of the choice of 16 S rRNA gene subregion, as well as of data set scope and context on algorithm performance.
