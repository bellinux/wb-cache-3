40|$|We {{have been}} {{developing}} new abilities of humanoid robot to realize proxy drives of a <b>lift</b> <b>truck.</b> Construction machines {{such as a}} <b>lift</b> <b>truck</b> {{play an important role}} in many tasks, but sometimes the environments are too hazardous for human operators. If a tele-operated humanoid robot can drive a construction machine, it can work at a dangerous place. This humanoid robot operator has two advantages than automated construction machine. It is much easier to carry the robot to a disaster site than moving the special construction machine. Besides, the robot may be less expensive than developing the special automated machine whose required number is relatively small. We have been developing new abilities of tele-operated humanoid robot HRP- 1 to realize the application.
