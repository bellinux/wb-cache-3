5|$|In {{terms of}} {{prosperity}} and cultural life, the Komnenian period {{was one of}} the peaks in Byzantine history, and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth, and culture. There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek. Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west during this period was enormous and of <b>long</b> <b>lasting</b> significance.|$|E
5|$|Recent evidence, however, has {{suggested}} against {{the contention that}} the use of psilocybin puts one at risk for developing <b>long</b> <b>lasting</b> mental disorders.

5|$|This bird is monogamous, forming <b>long</b> <b>lasting</b> pair bonds, with {{pairs of}} grey-necked wood rails staying {{together}} throughout the year.

In Mexico, on the other hand, the breeding season is known to start as early as January. In captivity, this wood rail is territorial.|$|E

5|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, <b>long</b> <b>lasting,</b> light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is lighter and more durable.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is <b>long</b> <b>lasting,</b> and will continue to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} two <b>long</b> <b>lasting</b> {{newspaper}} comic strips, Vandersteen {{made a number of}} other comics in these years. Most important was his work for Ons Volkske, the youth supplement of the weekly magazine Ons Volk, which from the end of 1945 on became an independent comic magazine. Marc Sleen was editor-in-chief and filled most pages together with Vandersteen. Vandersteen created a number of realistic stories of about 20 pages each, where he developed his own style after starting very much as a follower of Harold Foster. In his usual more caricatural style, he created in August 1946 the recurring gagstrip De Vrolijke Bengels (The Happy Rascals). More adult comics appeared in the magazine Ons Volk.|$|E

5|$|Moreover, it {{was during}} the Komnenian period that contact between Byzantium and the 'Latin' Christian West, {{including}} the Crusader states, was at its most crucial stage. Venetian and other Italian traders became resident in Constantinople and the empire in large numbers (60–80,000 'Latins' in Constantinople alone), and their presence together with the numerous Latin mercenaries who were employed by Manuel in particular helped to spread Byzantine technology, art, literature and culture throughout the Roman Catholic west. Above all, the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west at this period was enormous and of <b>long</b> <b>lasting</b> significance.|$|E
5|$|Reflections in {{more complex}} scenarios, such as {{found on a}} network of cables, can result in very {{complicated}} and <b>long</b> <b>lasting</b> waveforms on the cable. Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E
5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} in rural environments {{made use of}} local materials and styles. As in England, cruck construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof; however they were usually hidden from view. In rural areas there was extensive use of turf {{to fill in the}} walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not <b>long</b> <b>lasting</b> and had to be rebuilt frequently, perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing.|$|E

5|$|Gillan {{had been}} {{contacted}} by Episode Six's manager Gloria Bristow, {{who worked for}} Helmut Gordon, original manager of The Detours, later to become the Who. He replaced original lead singer Andy Ross, who left to get married, and joined keyboardist and singer Sheila Carter, guitarists Graham Carter and Tony Lander, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Harvey Shields. Gillan considers Episode Six to be his first truly professional band, and in their early days were sponsored and championed by Tony Blackburn, who occasionally accompanied Gillan on stage. Later, as well as performing concerts in the UK, Episode Six also toured Germany and Beirut., and had regular appearances on the BBC Light Programme. During his time with Episode Six, Gillan began writing songs together with Glover, forming an ultimately <b>long</b> <b>lasting</b> partnership. After a strained tour of Beirut, Shields left the band and was replaced first by John Kerrison, then by Mick Underwood. Underwood had previously played in The Outlaws with Ritchie Blackmore, and it was via him that Ian was put in touch with to form Deep Purple in 1968. Gillan originally declined the position of lead singer in the band, though by 1969, after having released nine singles, none of which charted in the UK, and finding their style of music too restrictive for him, he decided to leave Episode Six.|$|E
5|$|The {{period has}} also been used {{in a wide range}} of popular culture. William Shakespeare's plays on the lives of the medieval kings have proved to have had <b>long</b> <b>lasting</b> appeal, heavily {{influencing}} both popular interpretations and histories of figures such as King John and Henry V. Other playwrights have since taken key medieval events, such as the death of Thomas Becket, and used them to draw out contemporary themes and issues. The medieval mystery plays continue to be enacted in key English towns and cities. Film-makers have drawn extensively on the medieval period, often taking themes from Shakespeare or the Robin Hood ballads for inspiration. Historical fiction set in England during the Middle Ages remains persistently popular, with the 1980s and 1990s seeing a particular growth of historical detective fiction. The period has also inspired fantasy writers, including J. R. R. Tolkien's stories of Middle-earth. English medieval music was revived from the 1950s, with choral and musical groups attempting to authentically reproduce the original sounds. Medieval living history events were first held during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the period has inspired a considerable community of historical re-enactors, part of England's growing heritage industry.|$|E
