For example, <b>lets</b> <b>take</b> the case of Kerala, a small southern state having the above characteristics. The state has less than average (around 30m)width of major highways in the nation (45 m), though the roads are better surfaced and maintained in Kerala. This causes considerable difficulty to the road users and causes frequent mishaps, though road discipline and adherence to traffic rules (and enforcement) is considered as better in Kerala.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the day of}} the attack, Brinsley {{had tried}} to commit suicide with his gun before killing the police officers, but he was talked out of it by his girlfriend, whom he then shot. Brinsley also {{attempted}} suicide a year previously. After the shooting, Brinsley reportedly called Thompson's mother and other family members and claimed the shooting was an accident. Brinsley wrote on his Instagram account of his intentions to kill police as retribution for the recent deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. In the post, which he made later that day while on a bus to New York City, he wrote, [...] "I'm putting Wings on Pigs Today ... They Take 1 of Ours ... <b>Lets</b> <b>Take</b> 2 of Theirs.

50|$|What {{happens when}} {{there are very few}} market {{participants}} and the goods or services are not widely available to the public? <b>Lets</b> <b>take</b> surveillance systems in a military overseas contingency environment as an example. Battlefield full motion video is not something that is found in the commercial sector - Wal-Marts don't sell this; moreover, frequently there are special restrictions which impact on commercial firms ability to engage in work of this nature. For example, special FAA Administrator permission is required before a US certificated aircraft or pilot can fly in Iraq under Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 77; if there are very few, or only one, vendor who can participate in this requirement, there are no vendors out there for meanginful competition which is the bedrock assumption of FAR Parts 12 and 13. In view of the above, the airborne recon contract is NOT a commercial service - therefore use of FAR Part 12 commercial items contracting processes is wholly inappropriate and not permissible under the applicable laws governing Federal acquisition.|$|E
5000|$|A {{week later}} Haynie was {{involved}} in the investment of Fort Donelson. On February 13, a Confederate battery had been plaguing the Union position. McClernand order an assault on the battery despite orders not to bring on a general engagement. McClernand chose his 3rd Brigade under Colonel William R. Morrison to lead the attack. Morrison's brigade consisted of only two regiments and McClernand decided to temporarily attach Haynie's 48th Illinois to Morrison's brigade. As final preparations were made, Haynie realized he was now the ranking officer in the brigade. Morrison willingly consented stating it was no time to argue about rank. To that Haynie replied [...] "Colonel, <b>lets</b> <b>take</b> it together." [...] The two colonels led the men forward. Morrison was struck in the hip, taking him off the field and removing any command ambiguity between him and Haynie. The attack failed and the survivors returned to their lines. Colonel Leonard F. Ross was appointed the new permanent commander of Morrison's brigade and Haynie returned with his regiment to Wallace's brigade. McClernand and Grant were both eager to forget about the incident, but years later McClernand claimed to Haynie's son he wanted Haynie to lead the charge because he felt him an [...] "abler soldier".|$|E

5000|$|In 1861, Morrison helped {{organize}} and was appointed colonel of the 49th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Civil War. Shortly {{after it was}} as mustered into service on December 31, 1861, the regiment was attached to Ulysses S. Grant's army at Cairo, Illinois. The 49th was formed into a brigade with 17th Illinois and two artillery batteries and, being the senior colonel, Morrison was placed {{in command of the}} brigade. Morrison's brigade was designated the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, District of Cairo and joined Grant's expedition to Fort Henry. Morrison also participated in the Battle of Fort Donelson where his division commander, John A. McClernand, decided to seize a Confederate battery early in the engagement. McClernand selected Morrison's two regiments to lead the attack and decided to attach a third regiment from W.H.L. Wallace's brigade under Colonel Isham N. Haynie as support. However, Haynie outranked Morrison and decided to take command. Despite being the brigade's commander, Morrison willingly obliged to let Haynie lead the attack once it started. To that, Haynie replied, [...] "Colonel, <b>lets</b> <b>take</b> it together." [...] Shortly after the shooting started Morrison was struck in the hip, knocking him off his horse and settling the issue of command. Morrison never returned to the field and resigned his commission on December 13, 1863.|$|E
5000|$|In another {{interview}} with Democracy Now!, Suskind {{states that he}} confirmed the claims of Richer and Maguire in several interviews: [...] "The fact is, is itâ€™s {{not a matter of}} a passing conversation. We had many conversations on this specific issue, on the Habbush matter, with all of the key sources. There was never any mystery about what it was, what the Habbush letter was, what the Habbush mission entailed, in terms of the setup with the Iraq intelligence chief. I mean, exhaustive, hour after hour. And the way I do it as an investigative reporter, is you go back again and again and again." [...] And in the NPR interview, he claims that both Richer and Maguire had indicated a willingness to testify against the Administration about these allegations: [...] "both of them, frankly, are big believers in the truth process. And Ive talked to both of them about, Hey, youre never going to feel heat quite like this. And they said, both of them, Richer and Maguire, Im ready to go in front of Senate committees and House committees. Im ready to have my moment. They knew everything that was in the book. You know, once they get there and the moment arrives, sometimes their knees buckle. And then you kind of say, All right, <b>lets</b> <b>take</b> a deep breath.

So basically, revisit a bunch of stuff but give the show all its own plot. Which at first sounded like quite a head-fucker. Trey ParkerSouth Park co-creator Written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, [...] "200" [...] was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14, 2010. It was the 200th episode of the series. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone conceive, write and produce most South Park episodes within a week of their broadcast date in order to maintain a sense of energy and timeliness. The idea for [...] "200", however, was conceived before the fourteenth season began in March 2010, and before any of the season fourteen episodes that preceded it were conceived. While trying to decide how to celebrate the 200th episode, Parker and Stone started reviewing the plots and controversies of previous episodes, many of which had a common thread of mocking a particular celebrity. This led to the idea of the having all the celebrities band together in a class action lawsuit against the town. Parker said their reactions mirrored the real-life reactions some of the celebrities had to their portrayals, adding, [...] "If they could join forces, they probably would." ...|$|E

5000|$|This was the {{official}} language of the 1st and 2nd IPC in 1998 and 2000 respectively.It separated {{the model of the}} planning problem in two major parts: (1) domain description and (2) the related problem description. Such a division of the model allows for an intuitive separation of those elements, which are (1) present in every specific problem of the problem-domain (these elements are contained in the domain-description), and those elements, which (2) determine the specific planning-problem (these elements are contained in the problem-description). Thus several problem-descriptions may be connected to the same domain-description (just like several instances may exist of a class in OOP (Object Oriented Programming) or in OWL (Ontology Web Language) for example). Thus a domain and a connecting problem description forms the PDDL-model of a planning-problem, and eventually this is the input of a planner (usually domain-independent AI planner) software, which aims to solve the given planning-problem via some appropriate planning algorithm. The output of the planner is not specified by PDDL, but it is usually a totally or partially ordered plan (a sequence of actions, some of which may be executed even in parallel sometimes). Now <b>lets</b> <b>take</b> a look at the contents of a PDDL1.2 domain and problem description in general...(1) The domain description consisted of a domain-name definition, definition of requirements (to declare those model-elements to the planner which the PDDL-model is actually using), definition of object-type hierarchy (just like a class-hierarchy in OOP), definition of constant objects (which are present in every problem in the domain), definition of predicates (templates for logical facts), and also the definition of possible actions (operator-schemas with parameters, which should be grounded/instantiated during execution). Actions had parameters (variables that may be instantiated with objects), preconditions and effects. The effects of actions could be also conditional (when-effects).(2) The problem description consisted of a problem-name definition, the definition of the related domain-name, the definition of all the possible objects (atoms in the logical universe), initial conditions (the initial state of the planning environment, a conjunction of true/false facts), and the definition of goal-states (a logical expression over facts that should be true/false in a goal-state of the planning environment). Thus eventually PDDL1.2 captured the [...] "physics" [...] of a deterministic single-agent discrete fully accessible planning environment.|$|E
