Many surveys have investigated {{the health and well-being}} correlates of loudness. However these surveys have not focused on the question how some sounds, and not others, impact the lives of individuals. We have conducted a web-based survey with more than 70 questions that investigated this question. The results show that 1) sound annoyance is a multi-facetted phenomenon that indicates impaired need satisfaction and 2) that the role of <b>loudness</b> <b>in</b> <b>sound</b> annoyance is less prominent than is often (implicitly) assumed. <b>In</b> fact <b>sound</b> annoyance seems to depend on three necessary conditions: audibility, involuntary attraction of attention, and interference with need satisfaction. We present the main results of the questionnaire and provide a list of recommendations to prevent avoidable sound annoyance suitable for sound producers, exposed public, and local governments...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide some {{historical}} perspective on the so-called loudness war. Critics of the loudness war maintain that the average volume level of popular music recordings has increased dramatically since the proliferation of digital technology in the 1980 s, and that this increase has had detrimental effects on sound quality and the listening experience. My point is not to weigh in on this debate, but to suggest that the issue of <b>loudness</b> <b>in</b> <b>sound</b> recording and playback can be traced back much earlier than the 1980 s. <b>In</b> fact, <b>loudness</b> has been a source of pleasure, a target of criticism, and an engine of technological change since the very earliest days of commercial sound reproduction. Looking at the period between the turn-of-the-century format feud to the arrival of electrical amplification in the 1920 s, I situate the loudness war within a longer historical trajectory, and demonstrate a variety of ways <b>in</b> which <b>loudness</b> and volume have been controversial issues in – and constitutive elements of – the history of sound reproduction. I suggest that the loudness war can be understood in relation to a broader cultural history of volume...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{numerical}} simulation {{in the design}} and evaluation of products performance is ever increasing. To a greater extent, such estimates are needed in a early design stage, when physical prototypes are not available. When dealing with vibro-acoustic models, known to be computationally expensive, a question remains, which is related to the accuracy of such models in view of the well-know variability inherent to the mass manufacturing production techniques. In addition, both academia and industry have recently realized the importance of actually listening to a products sound, either by measurements or by virtual <b>sound</b> synthesis, <b>in</b> order to assess its performance. In this work, the scatter of significant parameter variations on a simplified vehicle vibro-acoustic model is calculated on loudness metrics using Monte Carlo analysis. The mapping from the system parameters to sound quality metric is performed by a fully-coupled vibro-acoustic finite element model. Different loudness metrics are used, including overall sound pressure level expressed in dB and Specific <b>Loudness</b> <b>in</b> Sones. <b>Sound</b> quality equivalent sources are used to excite this model and the sound pressure level at the driver's head position is acquired to be evaluated according to sound quality metrics. No significant variation has been perceived when evaluating the system using regular sound pressure level expressed in in dB and dB(A). This happens because of the third-octave filters that averages the results under some frequency bands. On the other hand, Zwicker Loudness presents important variations, arguably, due to the masking effects...|$|R

40|$|Full text: While "classical" {{loudness}} models predict <b>loudness</b> <b>in</b> sone {{using the}} concepts of Stevens' compressive power law, (subdivided) categorical loudness perception after Heller follows the compressive logarithmic Weber-Fechner law. To {{bridge the gap between}} both approaches, this contribution reviews various steps towards a loudness model that predicts categorical <b>loudness</b> (<b>in</b> categorical units, CU) for normal and hearing-impaired listeners for arbitrary sounds. It uses a (modified) classical loudness model for stationary signals to derive the <b>loudness</b> <b>in</b> sone and a nonlinear transformation from sone to CU. This transformation is approximated by a cubic polynomial equation wich is derived from categorical loudness data of 84 normal-hearing subjects. The model parameters are further set to predict the standard isophones that are in good agreement with the equal loudness level contours derived from categorical loudness data. Also, the model predicts the loudness functions near threshold both for normal and hearing-impaired listeners and can be extended to predict duration-dependent loudness perception. Since categorical loudness can be measured more easily and directly than <b>loudness</b> <b>in</b> sone, the current modelling approach can be experimentally tested and can be used in various applications, such as, e. g. hearing aid processing and fitting procedures...|$|R

25|$|A Weighting {{curve is}} a graph {{of a set}} of factors, that are used to 'weight' {{measured}} values of a variable according to their importance in relation to some outcome. An important example is frequency weighting <b>in</b> <b>sound</b> level measurement where a specific set of weighting curves known as A, B, C and D weighting as defined in IEC 61672 are used. Unweighted measurements of sound pressure do not correspond to perceived loudness because the human ear is less sensitive at low and high frequencies, with the effect more pronounced at lower sound levels. The four curves are applied to the measured sound level, for example by the use of a weighting filter <b>in</b> a <b>sound</b> level meter, to arrive at readings of <b>loudness</b> <b>in</b> Phons or in decibels (dB) above the threshold of hearing.

40|$|Reduced neural {{processing}} of a tone is observed {{when it is}} presented after a sound whose spectral range closely frames {{the frequency of the}} tone. This observation might be explained by the mechanism of lateral inhibition (LI) due to inhibitory interneurons in the auditory system. So far, several characteristics of bottom up influences on LI have been identified, while the influence of top-down processes such as directed attention on LI has not been investigated. Hence, the study at hand aims at investigating the modulatory effects of focused attention on LI in the human auditory cortex. In the magnetoencephalograph, we present two types of masking sounds (white noise vs. withe noise passing through a notch filter centered at a specific frequency), followed by a test tone with a frequency corresponding to the center-frequency of the notch filter. Simultaneously, subjects were presented with visual input on a screen. To modulate the focus of attention, subjects were instructed to concentrate either on the auditory input or the visual stimuli. More specific, on one half of the trials, subjects were instructed to detect small deviations <b>in</b> <b>loudness</b> <b>in</b> the masking <b>sounds</b> while on {{the other half of the}} trials subjects were asked to detect target stimuli on the screen. The results revealed a reduction in neural activation due to LI, which was larger during auditory compared to visual focused attention. Attentional modulations of LI were observed in two post-N 1 m time intervals. These findings underline the robustness of reduced neural activation due to LI in the auditory cortex and point towards the important role of attention on the modulation of this mechanism in more evaluative processing stages...|$|R

5000|$|According to Stevens' definition, a {{loudness}} of 1 sone {{is equivalent}} to the loudness of a signal at 40 phons, the loudness level of a 1 kHz tone at 40 dB SPL.

Rather, the <b>loudness</b> <b>in</b> sones is, at least very nearly, a power law function of the signal intensity, with an exponent of 0.3.
