25|$|It {{is clear}} that {{companies}} recognize ERM as a critical management issue. This is demonstrated through the prominence assigned to ERM within organizations and the resources devoted to building ERM capabilities. In a 2008 survey by Towers Perrin, at most life insurance companies, responsibility for ERM resides within the C-suite. Most often, the chief risk officer (CRO) or {{the chief financial officer}} (CFO) is in charge of ERM, and these individuals typically report directly to the chief executive officer. From their vantage point, the CRO and CFO are able to <b>look</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> organization and develop a perspective on the risk profile of the firm and how that profile matches its risk appetite. They act as drivers to improve skills, tools and processes for evaluating risks and to weigh various actions to manage those exposures. Companies are also actively enhancing their ERM tools and capabilities. Three quarters of responding companies said they have tools for specifically monitoring and managing enterprise-wide risk. These tools are used primarily for identifying and measuring risk and for management decision making. Respondents also reported that they have made good progress in building their ERM capabilities in certain areas.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 December 1885 {{the royal}} family, minus {{the queen mother}} and Supayagyi who were sent to Dawei, was taken to Madras where their third {{daughter}} was born, and in April the next year they were moved to Ratnagiri {{on the west coast}} where they could no longer <b>look</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Bay of Bengal to the land they had been forced to leave. Supayalat gave birth to her fourth and youngest daughter in 1887; they were not given a proper residence commensurate with their status until 1911 when Thibaw Palace was built by the government. In 1914 the royal princesses had an ear-piercing ceremony ( [...] nahtwin mingala) according to Burmese custom. Some of the family members, court officials and entertainers including the famous orchestra of Sein Beida and the harpist Deiwa Einda Maung Maung Gyi from Burma were permitted to attend the ceremony. Although Supayalat's first born was a boy he did not survive infancy, and she had also lost another daughter.|$|E

2500|$|On 9 September 2014, Mark Carney, {{governor}} of the Bank of England, said that a currency union between an independent Scotland and {{the remainder of the}} UK would be [...] "incompatible with sovereignty". Carney was involved in a [...] "Q" [...] session at the Trades Union Congress and further explained that cross-border ties on tax, spending and banking rules are a prerequisite: [...] "You only have to <b>look</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> continent to look at what happens if you don't have those components in place ... You need tax, revenues and spending flowing across those borders to help equalise, to an extent, some of the inevitable differences [...]" [...] A spokesperson for the SNP's finance minister responded, saying [...] "Successful independent countries such as France, Germany, Finland and Austria all share a currency – and they are in charge of 100% of their tax revenues, as an independent Scotland would be. At present under devolution, Scotland controls only 7% of our revenues." [...] Carney's comments received vocal support from Darling and the GMB trade union, the latter of which supports the retention of the current UK formation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{town house}} has been {{described}} as having a [...] "flat roofline, rectangular profile and somewhat delicate lintel detail - in addition to neo-classical window spacing and a main facade with spindly belfry steeple". The building has been compared to the Scottish National Library on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh for having a modern style with classical or traditional elements and recognised for Scandinavian influences. The base of the town house features Darney stone from East Woodburn, with the walls being made from Blaxter stone, both of which were brought north to the town from Northumberland quarries. The surroundings of the main entrance are made of Elverwater stone. The stone on the walls was done by retired masons from around the ages of 65 to 80. The clock tower of Nordic influence, which sits on top of the building, complete with a weather vane, shows St Bryce, the patron saint of Kirkcaldy. The unique design was done by David Carr of Edinburgh. A small copper ball, [...] in diameter, {{at the bottom of the}} vane, is supposed to represent the world. The figure is located at the top of the [...] weather vane with the intention he can <b>look</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> town as the vane turns around in the wind, with the world at his feet. The vane, probably made of wrought iron, was designed by Thomas Hadden of Edinburgh.|$|E
