40|$|The Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) ranks {{third in}} {{the world in terms of}} primary {{productivity}} and has one of the highest fisheries production of any African large marine ecosystem with an annual production ranging from 2 to 3 million tons. The CCLME waters exhibit high abundance and biomass and a rich cephalopod fauna in comparison with other areas of the world’s oceans. These waters are a transitional zone between different Atlantic zoogeographic provinces where tropical, temperate and cold water cephalopod species mix. Several assemblages can be identified in the coastal, shelf, slope and deep waters. Coastal assemblages are dominated by sepiids, <b>loliginids</b> and shallow-water octopus, while more oceanic assemblages are largely dominated by ommastrephid and deep-water octopus species. This area shows cephalopod resources that can maintain local and trawl fisheries for these resources, mainly for coastal octopus, neritic <b>loliginids</b> and more pelagic ommastrephids. This work presents a brief review of cephalopod fauna found in CCLME waters in terms of biodiversity, ecology and fisheries. MAVA (Contract 12087 Coastal West Africa C 4 / 2012) Postprin...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via [URL] recent years have seen an increase in genetic analyses that identify new species of cephalopods and phylogeographic patterns, the loliginid squid of South America remain {{one of the least}} studied groups. The suggestion that Doryteuthis plei may represent distinct lineages within its extensive distribution along the western Atlantic coasts from Cape Hatteras, USA (36 ?N) to northern Argentina (35 ?S) is consistent with significant variation in a number of environmental variables along this range including in both temperature and salinity. In the present study D. plei samples were obtained from a large number of localities along the western Atlantic coasts to investigate the distribution of these possible species in a phylogeographic context. Phylogeographic analyses were performed using the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I gene and nuclear Rhodopsin gene. Divergence times were estimated using Bayesian strict clock dating with calibrations based on fossil records for divergence from the lineage containing Vampyroteuthis infernalis (162 mya), the probable origins of the North American <b>loliginids</b> (45 mya), and the European <b>loliginids</b> (20 mya) and fossil statolith from Doryteuthis opalescens (3 mya). Our results suggest a deep genetic divergence within Doryteuthis plei. The currently described specie consists of two genetically distinct clades (pair-wise genetic divergence of between 7. 7 and 9. 1 %). One clade composed of individuals collected in northwestern Atlantic and Central Caribbean Atlantic waters and the other from southwestern Atlantic waters. The divergence time and sampling locations suggest the speciation process at approximately 16 Mya, which is in full agreement with the middle Miocene orogeny of the Caribbean plate, ending up with the formation of the Lesser Antilles and the adjacent subduction zone, coinciding with a particularly low global sea level, resulting in the practical absence of continental shelves at the area, and therefore an effective geographic barrier for D. plei. Furthermore, this study also provides evidence of previously undocumented sub-population structuring in the Gulf of Mexico. proofPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The family Loliginidae Lesueur, 1821, is {{currently}} considered to include seven genera and approximately 50 species of neritic and coastal squids. These commercially important species occur in tropical and temperate coastal waters around the world.

40|$|Luminescent {{bacteria}} in the family Vibrionaceae (Bacteria: c-Proteobacteria) are commonly found in complex, bilobed light organs of sepiolid and <b>loliginid</b> squids. Although morphology of these organs in both families of squid is similar, the species of bacteria that inhabit each host {{has yet to be}} verified. We utilized sequences of 16 S ribosomal RNA, luciferase a-subunit (luxA) and the glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (gapA) genes to determine phylogenetic relationships between 63 strains of Vibrio bacteria, which included representatives from different environments as well as unidentified luminescent isolates from <b>loliginid</b> and sepiolid squid from Thailand. A combined phylogenetic analysis was used including biochemical data such as carbon use, growth and luminescence. Results demonstrated that certain symbiotic Thai isolates found in the same geographic area were included in a clade containing bacterial species phenotypically suitable to colonize light organs. Moreover, multiple strains isolated from a single squid host were identified as more than one bacteria species in our phylogeny. This research presents evidence of species of luminescent bacteria that have not been previously described as symbiotic strains colonizing light organs of Indo-West Pacific <b>loliginid</b> and sepiolid squids, and supports the hypothesis of a non-species-specific association between certain sepiolid and <b>loliginid</b> squids and marine luminescent bacteria.

Concentrations of Cd were generally higher in the ommastrephids, in all tissues except muscle. Hg concentrations were higher in T. sagittatus than in the <b>loliginids.</b> In L. forbesi, metal concentrations differed between tissues and also varied in relation to body size, geographic origin and season. Cd levels decreased with increasing body size. This {{may be related to}} a shift in the diet with growth, since small L. forbesi feed on benthic invertebrates that have relatively high Cd concentrations, whereas larger individuals prey mainly on fish that have low Cd concentrations. Hg levels increased with body size, indicating its retention, and they were highest {{at the end of the}} spawning season and in squid from the English Channel and the Scottish West Coast. It is likely that the ambient concentration of Hg in seawater plays an important part in its accumulation in squid tissues. As it is a short-lived species, L. forbesi may therefore function as a bioindicator species for Hg contamination of the marine environment.

40|$|Male coleoid {{cephalopods}} produce elaborate spermatophores, {{which are}} {{transferred to the}} female during copulation generally {{with the aid of}} a modified appendage (the hectocotylus), or in some taxa presumably by the terminal organ (i. e. ‘penis’; Nesis, 1995). During mating, the spermatophores undergo the so-called spermatophoric reaction (Drew, 1919), a complex process of evagination of the ejaculatory apparatus that leads to the extrusion and attachment of the spermatangium (i. e. everted spermatophore containing the sperm mass) on various sites of the female body (Nesis, 1995). There seems to be a con-sensus in the literature that two types of attachment of sperma-tangia occur in decapodiforms (i. e. squids and sepioids). In one, after the spermatophoric reaction the base of the sperma-tangia attaches to the surface of the female’s body by the adhesive contents of the cement body (Drew, 1919). This type is found in several decapodiforms, including <b>loliginids</b> (e. g. Drew, 1919), sepiids (e. g. Hanlon, Ament & Gabr, 1999) and ommastrephids (e. g. Durward et al., 1980; Takahama et al., 1991), the latter also bearing a sharp arrowhead-like structure at the oral extremity of the cement body (e. g. Takahama et al., 1991). The second type of attachment involves deep implan-tation of the spermatangia into the female’s body, i. e. the sper-matangia penetrate the integument, embedding themselves completely in the female tissue; this strategy is common to some oceanic and deep-sea species, like the giant squid Architeuthis (e. g.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIPelagic squids of {{continental}} shelf ecosystems mostly include oceanic and migratory {{species of the}} family Ommastrephidae and neritic species of the family Loliginidae. These two families have contrasting life history strategies; ommastrephids spawn in the open ocean and {{are thought to have}} a high dispersal potential, while <b>loliginids</b> spawn on the bottom and are likely to have a low dispersal potential. Consequently, these squid species should display different patterns in their population dynamics, which can be inferred through commercial catches. To study the population dynamics of the Ommastrephidae and the Loliginidae families, monthly time series catches of Dosidicus gigas and Dotyteuthis gahi were used. These artisanal fishery catches were made in northern Peru from 1999 to 2010. They were standardized to construct autocorrelation functions so that the relationship between catch dynamics and short-term environmental change (thermal anomalies of sea surface temperature were used as a proxy) could be studied. The results revealed that increases in catches of D. gigas and D. gahi are not related to thermal anomalies, but rather a pattern of drastic fluctuations in D. gahi catch sizes are seen. In, both species, temporal relationships indicate that the annual growth rate and changes in abundance can modelled {{as a function of the}} catch density observed in previous years. We propose that these population differences result from the contrasting life history strategies and differential habitat use of these two squid species. Universidad de Chile 	 CONICYT-Chil...|$|E

40|$|Symbiotic {{luminous}} bacteria {{have been}} described in, and cultured from, a number of species offish and cephalopod. Indeed only in these two groups are extracellular luminous bacteria believed to be utilized {{as a source of}} light (see Buchner (1965) and Herring (1978) for references). Despite several earlier investigations of such symbioses in cephalopods the bacteria in these animals have not been adequately identified, nor has the extent of their role been clarified. The ultrastructural relationships between bacteria and the tissues of the squid accessory nidamental gland have been investigated in the non-luminous species Loligo pealei (Lesueur) (Bloodgood, 1977) and Sepia officinalis L. (Van den Branden et al. 1979) but no comparative work on luminous species has been undertaken apart from that on Heteroteuthis dispar (Rüppell), whose photophore does not contain typical luminous bacteria (Dilly & Herring, 1978; cf.

Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93 : 281307. Male coleoid cephalopods produce elaborate spermatophores, which function autonomously outside the male body during copulation, undergoing a complicated process of evagination. In order {{to contribute to the}} understanding of this unique structure, this study investigated the morphology of the spermatophore of Doryteuthis plei applying several microscopy techniques. A hitherto unreported, much more complex structural arrangement was revealed for the loliginid spermatophore, the most striking findings being: (1) the complex, layered structure of the middle membrane, which bears an additional, chemically distinct segment surrounding part of the cement body; (2) the presence of a space between the inner tunic and middle membrane filled with a fine reticulated material; (3) the presence of stellate particles not only embedded in the spiral filament, but also closely applied to the inner membrane {{at the level of the}} cement body; (4) the presence of a pre-oral chamber in the cap region; and (5) the complex organization of the cement body, formed by two distinct layers encompassing contents of different chemical and textural properties. Careful literature reassessment suggests several of these features are common to <b>loliginids,</b> and to some extent to other squids.

High salinity warm water {{was found in the}} northern area of the Gulf and rather cool water in the south. Remarkable density gradient was commonly observed in the middle layer throughout the Gulf. 2) Experimental bottom trawl operations were made at 18 stations. The total catch amounted to 592 kg, with a catch per hour of 53 kg. The catch consisted of more than 60 fish species of 27 families, 9 mollusk species of 3 families and some crustacean, of which most important were carangids, lutjanids and nemipterids of fishes and <b>loliginids</b> of mollusks. Size composition of each major fishes and mollusks seemed to consist of some groups of 2 to 6 normal distributions.

40|$|Growth and ageing {{research}} was undertaken for squid and sepioid populations in waters off the Townsville region, North Queensland, Australia. The study species were the sepioid Idiosepius pygmaeus, and the loliginid squids Loliolus noctiluca, Loligo chinensis, Loligo sp. 1 and Sepioteuthis lessoniana. Age and growth parameters {{were determined by}} enumerating growth rings within the statolith microstructure {{of each of the}} species. Various mounting and rinding/polishing techniques were employed to reveal the growth rings. Daily periodicity in statolith growth rings was demonstrated to exist in 24 individuals in four of the study species; I. pygmaeus (6), L. noctiluca (9), L. chinensis (2) and S. lessoniana (7). Ring periodicity was determined by staining the statoliths in situ with tetracycline or calcein, and then maintaining the individuals in captivity to compare the rings laid down to the number of elapsed days. Double staining techniques were also employed to determine the rings laid down between stainings. Field captured individuals of each of the study species were aged to construct growth curves. Growth was found to be rapid and maturity was found to be reached surprisingly fast. Tropical squid and sepioid growth is more correctly measured in days rather than months or years. The ageing studies with all five species did not reveal any individuals older than 200 days. The ageing techniques developed were employed to discern any seasonality in squid and sepioid growth patterns. Regular sampling of I. pygmaeus and L. chinensis revealed different patterns of abundance, with I. pygmaeus more common during the winter period while L. chinensis was more abundant during the summer period. Comparing growth based on statolith ageing to growth based on ELEFAN analysis on length frequency data revealed two diverging results. Length frequency analysis suggested that squid growth was asymptotic and that the life cycle was perennial. In contrast ageing research revealed that life span was short and that growth was rapid and non-asymptotic. Seasonal size-at-age data for I. pygmaeus and L. chinensis revealed different patterns of growth during different seasonal periods. For L. chinensis growth was considerably slower during the winter period. For I. pygmaeus slower growth was also observed during the cooler period of the year. However, there was considerable scatter in the size-at-age data, probably as a result of greater variability in the near-shore environment. Differences were also detected in the relative statolith size in individuals of L. chinensis, with winter squids having larger statoliths for any given length than their summer counterparts. Alternatively, at comparable ages, winter squids had smaller statoliths than their summer counterparts, however, with increasing age, the longer-lived winter squids eventually obtained larger relative statoliths. Determining individual size-at-age allowed for a more detailed understanding of age specific reproductive patterns. Male individuals of Loligo chinensis matured at a greater age in July (winter) than in January (summer) and no mature females were found in July. These age specific maturity patterns could not be discerned by an analysis of individual size. Development of the nidamental gland and hectocotylus was shown to follow a similar pattern to gonad development. Mature individuals of L. chinensis were found throughout the year (except July, 1989 for females). However, there was considerable fluctuations in the gonadosomatic index for both sexes with largest relative gonad sizes achieved during October for both years studied. This pattern appeared to be real and not biased by variation in the size of individuals captured during different months of the year. Idiosepius pygmaeus showed a different pattern in gonad growth with cooler season (spring) sepioids growing older and having larger gonads than warmer season (autumn) individuals, despite {{the fact that there was}} very little difference in individual size between the two seasons. Measurement of oocyte diameters within the ovaries of two I. pygmaeus females suggested that this species was a serial spawner. Maintenance experiments of captive I. pygmaeus females confirmed that this species lays its eggs in repeated batches, rather than all at once. Maximum egg output recorded was 922 eggs produced in 15 days. Moreover, histological examination of the oocyte size distribution of all five study species suggested that they were serial spawners, since a variety of oocyte sizes were present within the ovary. More relevant tropical squid growth models could be developed as a result of obtaining individual size-at-age data. All the five study species displayed allometric growth, with Loligo chinensis and Loligo sp. 1 displaying significant differences in the length-weight relationship between males and females, while Idiosepius pygmaeus revealed sex-related differences in slope elevation of the L-W relationship. Detailed growth models were developed for L. chinensis and S. lessoniana. Loligo chinensis were shown to exhibit exponential growth with a considerable proportion of the lifespan spent as juveniles. There was no significant difference between the growth curves of male and female L. chinensis in either growth in length or weight. The growth of S. lessoniana could not be modelled with a single equation. Therefore, an exponential curve was fitted to the size-at-age data (for both mantle length and weight) for the first 70 days, while growth from 70 to 153 days could be described by a linear equation. These growth models were compared to growth curves developed for other <b>loliginids</b> raised in captivity. Loligo chinensis was found to grow faster than other temperate <b>loliginids,</b> while the growth of S. lessoniana revealed a remarkable similarity to the form of growth of the tropical S. sepioidea. Length-at-age data for Loligo opalescens was found to not differ greatly from results of growth of this species in captivity, although field individuals appeared to grow somewhat faster than captive individuals. Very clear growth rings were also observed within the statolith microstructure of the giant squid Architeuthis, which suggested that ageing research and growth modelling based on size-at-age data could be expanded to a variety of other species of oceanic squids. Statolith growth ring analysis is thus one means to obtain important growth parameters for squid species in which we have little biological information for...|$|E

Sampies of Loligo gahi were {{collected}} from depths of 50 - 400 m and analysed for size composition, maturity, and starnach fullness. L. gahi increased in size and maturity with depths > 100 m. Immature and fully mature squid were found at depths < 100 m. The data {{support the hypothesis that}} this species spawns in shallow water and migrates down the continental shelf and continental slope after hatching. lt then returns to shallow water to spawn. Highest concentrations of squid appeared to occur at depths and in areas where the commercial fishery operates. Sampies were only taken during daylight hours, and starnach fullness was at its highest in the midafternoon.

40|$|Statolith and gladius were {{investigated}} for their suitability as tools for age and growth {{studies in the}} <b>loliginid</b> squid Loligo plei off southern Brazil. Statoliths when polished, revealed a series of concentric increments deposited around a nucleus. Consistent increment counts covered the squid’s entire life-time and could be considered suitable for individual age estimation. Growth increments were observed on the dorsal surface as delimited by consecutive marks formed during low growth periods. Because early growth was masked during chitin deposition, total increment counts underestimated individual age. Gladius growth was highly correlated with somatic growth, and gladius increments {{could be used to}} reconstruct individual growth histories. Both statolith and gladius increments were deposited with the same, possibly daily, periodicity. It could be inferred that L. plei off southern Brazil might live up to around nine months of age...|$|R
50|$|Like {{some other}} cephalopods, bigfin reef squids {{are capable of}} metachrosis - rapidly {{changing}} body colouration and patterns through voluntary control of chromatophores. They also possess iridophores (particularly in the head), a form of structural colouration that produces iridescent metallic greens and red when illuminated. They are also possibly one of two squid species with leucophores. Leucophores are a reflector-type structural colouration that reflects ambient light, such that they are white in white light, green in green light, and so on. Bigfin reef squids are remarkable for having the ability to produce complex body patterns {{from the moment they}} hatch. In comparison, other <b>loliginid</b> squid species do not produce complex body patterns at less than four months of age. The patterns produced by bigfin reef squids, however, are less diverse than those of the Caribbean reef squids.|$|R

Overview of prey-capture behaviour in <b>loliginid</b> squids Although the primary focus of the present study is the tentacular strike, it is useful to place the strike in the context of the typical sequence of prey-capture behaviour observed. Three sequential phases of prey capture by decapod cephalopods in the laboratory have been defined: attention, positioning and strike (Messenger, 1968, 1977). The attention phase occurs when prey is introduced into the aquarium. The squid responds by rapidly turning the head so that the arms and tentacles project towards the prey and the eyes are directed forward. While maintaining the orientation of the arms and 41 The Journal of Experimental B...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 103 {{cephalopod}} paralarvae were sampled during June 1995 in Galician waters (NW Spain). Samples were taken with Bongo nets of 300 and 500 m mesh size at 48 sampling stations along 10 transverse transects ranging from 80 to 600 m water depth. Paralarvae of <b>loliginid</b> squid were most abundant (40 %). The Rhynchoteuthion paralarvae of ommastrephid squid accounted for 25 %, whereas sepiolids comprised 23 % {{of the total}} sample. Octopods were scarce, at only 6. 6 %. Other cephalopod families accounted for 5 %. Sizes of paralarvae ranged from 1. 0 to 7. 1 mm mantle length. Temperature and salinity distribution showed {{the presence of an}} intense upwelling during the survey period. The sampling data obtained before and during the presence of upwelled water off Rias of Pontevedra and Vigo (southern zone) showed that paralarval cephalopod abundance and distribution were closely related to the upwelled Eastern North-Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) ...|$|R
40|$|Age {{and growth}} were {{estimated}} on two brood stocks of a <b>loliginid</b> squid, Photololigo edulis (Hoyle), by examining growth increments within the statoliths from 773 specimens.

Length and age data were fitted to logistic growth curves for each sex and brood, {{under the assumption that}} increments formed daily. Relationships between age and mantle length and the modelled growth curves showed that: the posthatch life span may be < 1 yr; growth rates vary considerably between individuals, especially {{in the second half of}} life; the average growth rate of the male was higher than that of the female in the warm-season brood, but almost the same in the cold-season brood. Because of the wide variation in the individual growth rate, it was presumed that warm- and cold-season broods were not genetically discrete populations...|$|R

Liver samples obtained from 44 individuals incidentally captured off Rio Grande do Sul State were analyzed by electrothermal AAS. Cadmium concentrations, age, total weight and length of the analyzed dolphins varied between 39 and 4144 µg. kg- 1 (wet weight), one and five years, 17. 5 and 49. 2 kg, and between 105. 3 and 156. 8 cm, respectively. Concerning hepatic cadmium concentrations of franciscanas, {{there was no significant difference}} between data raised by the present study and information from literature, regarding Rio de Janeiro State. The low cadmium concentrations observed may be attributed to the fact that <b>loliginid</b> squids constitute the main cephalopod prey for franciscanas. This study corroborates investigations on cadmium levels in Brazilian squids and strengthened the hypothesis that cephalopods of Loliginidae Family do not constitute important vectors of the transfer of cadmium to cetaceans...|$|R
40|$|The Southern Ocean {{cephalopod}} fauna is distinctive, {{with high}} levels of endemism in the squid and particularly in the octopodids. <b>Loliginid</b> squid, sepiids and sepiolids are absent from the Southern Ocean, and all the squid are oceanic pelagic species. The octopodids dominate the neritic cephalopod fauna, {{with high levels}} of diversity, probably associated with niche separation. In common with temperate cephalopods, Southern Ocean species appear to be semelparous, but growth rates are probably lower and longevity greater than temperate counterparts. Compared with equivalent temperate species, eggs are generally large and fecundity low, with putative long development times. Reproduction may be seasonal in the squid but is extended in the octopodids. Cephalopods {{play an important role in}} the ecology of the Southern Ocean, linking the abundant mesopelagic fish and crustaceans with higher predators such as albatross, seals and whales.

40|$|The {{embryonic}} {{development of}} Loligo gahi was observed from 4 -day-old eggs to natural hatching. Egg strands spawned in the Valparaíso Bay, Chile, were transported {{to an open}} system tank for incubation. Temperatures ranged from 12. 9 °C to 13. 5 °C, salinities from 34 ‰ to 35 ‰, and the photoperiod was 12 L: 12 D. The period from spawning to hatching ranged from 30 - 35 days. The diameter of individual eggs ranged from 2. 5 - 3. 2 mm, and the dorsal mantle length of hatchlings varied from 2. 6 - 3. 1 mm. The pattern of chronological appearance of organs was quite similar to <b>loliginid</b> species previously examined (Loligo aff. gahi, Loligo bleekeri, Loligo pealei, Loligo vulgaris reynaudii, and Loligo forbesii). However, L. gahi had a different (faster) development time and a smaller embryo and hatchling size than L. bleekeri (Japan) and L. forbesii (eastern Atlantic Ocean).

40|$|Male {{dimorphism}} {{has been}} thought to correlate with alternative reproductive behaviors. Alternative reproductive behaviors promote asymmetry in sperm competition, {{and the differences}} in fertilization success could promote adaptations in ejaculate characteristics in relation to each reproductive behavior. Here, using allometric analysis, we {{show that there is}} clear ejaculate dimorphism in males of the squid Loligo bleekeri, a species with body-size related alternative mating behaviors. A morphological switch point was detected in internal characters: larger individuals made discontinuously longer spermatophores than smaller individuals, although any switch point was not detected in external characters (fin length, fin width, head width, mantle width, tentacle length and hectocotylus length) except bimodal body size. This clear internal switch point could be an adaptation to the characteristic alternative mating behaviors of <b>loliginid</b> squid, in which males use different mating tactics to pass spermatophores to different sperm storage sites in and on the females. This study reports on clear dimorphism in ejaculate characteristics in cephalopods for the first time, to our knowledge. Our results indicated that alternative reproductive behaviors can result in morphological adjustment in internal characters...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{potential}} of the tropical <b>loliginid</b> squid Photololigo sp. to lay multiple batches of eggs and examines changes in somatic growth during reproduction. Histological analysis of the ovary and the relative size of the oviduct to mantle weight and ovary weight were used to determine the potential for multiple spawning. Ovaries of mature females always had immature and mature oocytes present, suggesting that not all the oocytes were maturing simultaneously and that multiple batches of eggs were being produced. Furthermore, poor correlations of oviduct weight with body size and ovary weight indicated that mature oocytes were not accumulating in the oviduct for a single spawning event. Both these observations supported the hypothesis that Photololigo sp. has the potential to lay multiple batches of eggs throughout its life. Specific growth rates, length-weight relationships, relative growth of somatic and reproductive tissue and microscopic assessment of muscle tissue were compared between immature and mature females. Growth rates of immature females were almost twice as fast as those of mature females. Mature females also had no large muscle fibres present, suggesting that energy for reproduction was mobilised from the muscle tissue...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} if the tropical <b>loliginid</b> squid Photololigo sp. stores energy in the form of lipid, carbohydrate or protein for reproductive investment. Individuals were examined for changes in morphometry, mantle muscle structure and concentrations of water, lipid, carbohydrate and protein in muscle tissue and the digestive gland, associated with the stage of reproductive maturation. Muscle mass was affected by reproductive maturation in females. Mature individuals were lighter for their length compared with females {{in the early stages of}} maturation. Concentrations of lipid and carbohydrate in the muscle tissue were very low, and female Photololigo sp. showed equivocal evidence of declining lipid and carbohydrate levels with egg production. There was no evidence of dramatic changes in protein concentration in the mantle muscle with reproductive maturation. Male Photololigo sp. showed a change in the digestive gland with maturation, with water content increasing and protein concentrations decreasing. The digestive gland of both male and female Photololigo sp. increased in size and contained less water with growth. There was little evidence that the storage and transfer of energy for reproduction occurred in Photololigo sp. Instead, it is probable that energy for reproduction is predominantly sourced directly from consumed food...|$|R

According to the vicariant {{hypothesis}} {{proposed by}} Brakoniecki (1986) {{the closure of}} the Sea of Tethys and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean would {{play an important role in}} the history of squids of the family Loliginidae, which is reflected in its current neritic distribution. Our study evaluated this hypothesis and alternative ideas to understand the historical biogeography of <b>loliginid</b> squids. This work is based on a phylogenetic hypothesis rebuilt with mitochondrial and nuclear sequences that incorporates the estimation of divergence times and ancestral distribution. Our results sustain that the squids of the family Loliginidae would have originated in the Western Pacific during the Late Paleocene about 59 My, following, during their diversification, at least 20 dispersion and 6 vicariant events. The first vicariant event fragments the ancestral distribution, remaining the ancestor of Sepioteuthis in the south and the subfamily Loligininae in the north. Successive events of dispersion, and some of vicariance (unrelated with the movement of tectonic plates and opening of the Atlantic Ocean), modeled it distribution. Our inference suggest a different origin compared to proposed by Brakoniecki (Tethys Sea), consistent with a center of origin that supports the most diversity of the family, with a predominance of dispersion processes over vicariant events, which explain the present distribution pattern.

40|$|Age {{and growth}} {{parameters}} of the tropical <b>loliginid</b> squid sepioteuthis lessoniana in eastern Australian waters were determined from statolith growth-ring analysis. Juvenile specimens were captured, maintained alive, and their statoliths were chemically makred in situ with either tetracycline or calcein. These chemicals produced a flourescent mark within the statolith microstructure when viewed under UV light. Statoliths were mounted in thermoplastic cement and subsequently ground and polished. This process allowed rings to be visualized without any further preparation. It was thus possible to validate that distinct statolith rings were formed daily and that less-distinct thinner rings were, in fact, subdaily rings. The results of the age analysis of field-captured individuals revealed that the population of S. lessoniana {{in the study area}} grows at a very fast rate. Maturity in both sexes was achieved in less than 100 days. All specimens aged were less than 6 months old. The size of large individuals was within the range of S. lessoniana captured in other areas, with size ranges being 75 - 213 mm and 75 - 184 mm for males and females, respectively. Growth rates determined for S. lessoniana based on statolith ageing are considerably different from previous estimates based on length frequency data...|$|R

Here, the diet of Loligo plei in inner shelf waters of the South Brazil Bight was examined, as a first step, based on the stomach contents of 2200 squid hand-jigged in shallow water (, 30 m) and taken as bycatch of shrimp trawlers in deeper water (30 – 100 m). Diet varied by size, season, and fishing zone. Stomachs were not empty in 12 %, with more empty during winter. The range of mantle lengths of squid caught by jigging (101 – 356 mm) appeared to differ from the squid trawled (30 – 236 mm), and the diet also differed. Food categories recorded in deeper water did not include amphipods or polychaetes, but in both fishing areas, fish were the most common prey. The fish prey identified included Trachurus lathami, small pelagic species, trichiurids, and Merluccius hubbsi. Demersal species, such as Ctenosciaena gracilicirrhus, and flatfish were also present. An ecosystem network model is updated through which a mixed-trophic impact matrix and “keystone-ness ” indicators were calculated.
