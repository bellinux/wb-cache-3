A receptive female may initiate mating by presenting her backside, <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> tail {{and looking at}} the desired male over her shoulder. Males may inspect the female's genitals to determine receptiveness. Females typically mate within their troop, but may seek outside males.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{not making}} the cut for the WTA Finals, Kvitová {{successfully}} qualified for the WTA Elite Trophy. As the third seed, she was drawn into the same group as Roberta Vinci and Strýcová, defeating both players in straight sets {{to advance to the}} semifinals where she sailed past wildcard Zhang Shuai. In the final, she beat Svitolina in straight sets to win the tournament on debut, thus <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> 19th career title and her first title indoors since winning the WTA Finals in 2011. Kvitová ended the season as world No. 11. She then represented her nation in the Fed Cup final where they took on France. Despite losing her only singles rubber against Caroline Garcia, the Czechs went on to successfully defend their title by winning the tie 3–2 to lift their third successive trophy, their fifth in the last six years. With that achievement, Kvitová claimed the record of most Fed Cup titles won by a Czech player, having been part of the team which took home those five crowns. Moreover, she was awarded the Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award for the fourth year in a row, her fifth overall.|$|E

500|$|Ico is {{primarily}} a three-dimensional platform game. The player controls Ico from a third-person perspective as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda. The camera is fixed [...] in each room or area but swivels to follow Ico or Yorda as they move; the player can also pan the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings. The game includes many elements of platform games; for example, the player must have Ico jump, climb, push and pull objects, and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles in order to progress within the castle. These actions are {{complicated by the fact}} that only Ico can carry out these actions; Yorda can only jump short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers. The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles, such as by <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> to a higher ledge, or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself. The player can tell Yorda to follow Ico, or to wait at a spot. The player can also have Ico take Yorda's hand and pull her along at a faster pace across the environment. Players are unable to progress in the game until they move Yorda to certain doors that only she can open.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Battlefield" [...] was {{directed}} by Philip Andelman [...] and filmed at the Golden Oak Ranch in California. On June 3, 2009, a thirty-second preview of the video was released online. The complete video premiered online on June 7, 2009. The video begins with a shot of a black car parked {{in the middle of}} a field. Sparks appears to be sitting in a car, dressed in black, as she sings the first verse. Intercut scenes of Sparks laying down in the field wearing a white dress are then shown. During the second verse, she exits the car and walks towards the camera. As the second chorus kicks in, Sparks is surrounded by smoke. During the song's bridge, she warns her love interest to get his armour, as she appears to be surrounded by flashing lights and smoke. Then intercut scenes of Sparks singing into the camera in front of a black backdrop are shown. The video then shows Sparks <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> right arm in the air as missiles shoot up into the sky. The video ends by showing Sparks covered in smoke. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the video shows that Sparks is [...] "definitely growing up". Maura of Idolator wrote that the video [...] "is a simple affair that allows her to get into maximum drama mode." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{variety of}} audacious but equally {{impractical}} schemes were put forward during the 1970s. One proposal called for 180,000 tons of molten wax (or alternatively, Vaseline) to be pumped into Titanic, <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> to the surface. Another proposal involved filling Titanic with ping-pong balls, but overlooked {{the fact that}} the balls would be crushed by the pressure long before reaching the depth of the wreck. A similar idea involving the use of Benthos glass spheres, which could survive the pressure, was scuppered when the cost of the number of spheres required was put at over $238 million. An unemployed haulage contractor from Walsall named Arthur Hickey proposed to turn Titanic into an iceberg, freezing the water around the wreck to encase it in a buoyant jacket of ice. This, being lighter than liquid water, would float to the surface and could be towed to shore. The BOC Group calculated that this would require half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to be pumped down to the sea bed. In his 1976 thriller Raise the Titanic!, author Clive Cussler's hero Dirk Pitt repairs the holes in Titanics hull, pumps it full of compressed air and succeeds in making it [...] "leap out of the waves like a modern submarine blowing its ballast tanks", a scene depicted on the posters of the subsequent film of the book. Although this was an [...] "artistically stimulating" [...] highlight of the film, made using a [...] model of Titanic, {{it would not have been}} physically possible. At the time of the book's writing, it was still believed that she sank in one piece.|$|E

Lee was the sole writer of [...] "Like You", [...] "Lithium" [...] and [...] "Good Enough", and co-wrote [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] with guitarist John LeCompt. The singer confessed that after Moody's {{departure}} she had nobody to hold her back {{in the writing process}} and that Balsamo was <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, [...] "He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with." [...] The singer further told The Sun, [...] " [...] got this sort of spooky, surreal element to his guitar writing [...] It’s really cool because it just works perfectly with what we do. He was really trying to create something so we were both discovering this new sound together and branching out [...] Writing with Terry was a unique experience in my life because I’ve never been able to just sit and write music with somebody and not be afraid of what they would say." [...] Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was [...] "really intense" [...] and that she came out [...] "feeling purified" [...] while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her [...] "to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities". She said it was only about [...] "writing great music".|$|E
500|$|Richter {{returned}} stateside {{signing with}} the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in late 1983. In April 1984, Richter teamed with Peggy Lee {{for a series}} of matches with old rivals Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria. WWF owner Vince McMahon brought in Cyndi Lauper for a feud with Lou Albano (who had appeared as Lauper's dad in her Girls Just Want to Have Fun music video). Albano seconded WWF Women's Champion Fabulous Moolah, while Lauper was in the corner of Wendi Richter. Richter defeated Moolah at MTV's The Brawl to End It All for the Women's Championship on July 23, 1984, with Richter <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> own shoulder off the canvas during a double-pinfall situation while Moolah's shoulders remained down. With the win, she ended what was billed as the longest championship reign in professional wrestling history (Moolah's 28-year reign as recognized by the WWF; in reality she had lost the title several times between 1956 and 1978, and Richter's win had in reality only ended a nearly seven-year reign by Moolah as champion). The broadcast of the women's match earned MTV its largest ratings in history up to that point. This match was also the beginning of the [...] "Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection", an era that combined both music and professional wrestling. Richter faced Moolah's protégé, Leilani Kai, who defeated Richter for the title, in early 1985 at The War to Settle the Score. She regained the title at the first WrestleMania one month later. While wrestling for the WWF, Richter referred to herself as [...] "150 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal". Richter was also animated for a CBS Saturday morning cartoon, Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling. In addition, she appeared in Lauper's music video for [...] "She Bop".|$|E

The singles from the album, [...] "Into the Blue" [...] and [...] "I Was Gonna Cancel", did not chart inside the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 12 and number 59 respectively. In August, Minogue performed a seven-song set at the closing ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games, donning a custom Jean Paul Gaultier corset. In September, she embarked on the Kiss Me Once Tour. In January 2015, Minogue appeared as a guest vocalist on Giorgio Moroder's single [...] "Right Here, Right Now" [...] providing her 12th number one hit on the U.S. Dance Chart on 18 April 2015. In March, Minogue's contract with Parlophone Records ended, leaving her future music releases with Warner Music Group in Australia and New Zealand. The same month, she parted ways with Roc Nation. In April, Minogue played tech reporter Shauna in a two episode arc on the ABC Family series, Young & Hungry. Minogue also appeared as Susan Riddick in the disaster film San Andreas, released in May and starring Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino. In September 2015, an extended play with Fernando Garibay titled Kylie + Garibay was released. Garibay and Giorgio Moroder served as producers for the extended play. In November, Minogue was a featured artist on the track, [...] "The Other Boys" [...] by Nervo, alongside Jake Shears and Nile Rodgers.

2500|$|Iijima's adult video (AV) debut was All That Sexy Venus for the Tairiku Shobo Company's FOXY label in April 1992.

In addition to adult videos in the early 1990s, Iijima also acted in a number of softcore V-cinema works including the August 1992 comedy [...] (with Hitomi Shiraishi), and the erotic suspense comedy , released in January 1993 by Japan Home Video.

2500|$|Andersen and Weir and Jerman {{think the}} figures {{may also have}} been used as {{protection}} against evil. This would cover the use of the figures on structures such as castles. They served an apotropaic function, designed to ward off evil. In Ireland, some of the figures were called [...] "The Evil Eye Stones," [...] which supported their theory. There is also some folkloric evidence of anasyrma being used by women lifting up their dresses to curse evil spirits. Andersen reproduces an 18th-century illustration by Charles Eisen from La Fontaine's Nouveaux Contes (1764) showing a demon being repulsed by the sight of a woman <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> skirt to display her genitals. Weir and Jerman relate a story from The Irish Times (23 September 1977) in which a potentially violent incident involving several men was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to them. But, they also doubt if the story was true. Weir and Jerman go on to suggest that the [...] function seems to have been gradually ascribed to the figures over time. While this theory seems to fit most of the secular and some of the religious figures, it does not apply to all of them.|$|E

The contrast between the behavior of the two have been noted.

According to contemporary witnesses, Malin Matsdotter behaved with great dignity and courage during her execution.

She [...] "did not seem to fear death much, courageously mounting the stake", and even the official execution protocol noted that she [...] "was very tough".|$|E

2500|$|Ruiz {{grew up in}} Lordsburg, New Mexico, the {{daughter}} of Mañuel and Delfina Aguilera. Her father was a sometimes-unemployed alcoholic, and her mother's business supported the household. Her father verbally and emotionally abused her mother, who in turn vented her frustration on Ruiz, on whom she relied for support. When Ruiz was sixteen, her mother made a promesa to the Virgin of Guadalupe that if her eldest son Inocensio, Ruiz's older brother, survived his illness, she would scale Mount Cristo Rey in pilgrimage. Inocensio recovered and Aguilera took Ruiz along on this climb, where Ruiz felt a [...] "mysterious force" [...] <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> up the mountain despite her fatigue. Though the family was Catholic before, following Inocensio's recovery the household devotion to the Church and to the Virgin of Guadalupe grew even stronger. [...] While in her thirties, her mother developed and recovered from endometrial cancer, which she interpreted as her [...] "cross to bear". [...] The anthropologist Kristy Nabhan-Warren views Delfina Aguilera's [...] "physical and marital suffering" [...] as an enactment [...] "in her own relationship with Jesus and the Virgin of Guadalupe." [...] The relationship between suffering and religion {{had a profound impact}} on Ruiz's understanding of life.
