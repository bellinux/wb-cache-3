They may be specialized for bulk storage of starch, lipid or protein and are then known as amyloplasts, elaioplasts, or proteinoplasts (also called aleuroplasts) respectively. However, in many cell types, <b>leucoplasts</b> {{do not have a}} major storage function and are present to provide a wide range of essential biosynthetic functions, including the synthesis of fatty acids such as palmitic acid, many amino acids, and tetrapyrrole compounds such as heme. In general, <b>leucoplasts</b> are much smaller than chloroplasts and have a variable morphology, often described as amoeboid. Extensive networks of stromules interconnecting <b>leucoplasts</b> have been observed in epidermal cells of roots, hypocotyls, and petals, and in callus and suspension culture cells of tobacco. In some cell types at certain stages of development, <b>leucoplasts</b> are clustered around the nucleus with stromules extending to the cell periphery, as observed for proplastids in the root meristem.|$|R

50|$|Polytoma is a genus {{of green}} algae, {{specifically}} of the Chlamydomonadaceae.Polytoma is a genus of colorless, free-living chlorophytes similar in form to Chlamydomonas but lacking chlorophyll. Two flagella emanate from the anterior papilla of the cell, and cells have two contractile vacuoles at the flagellar base. Polytoma possesses a leukoplast {{in place of}} a chloroplast, in which many starch grains are concentrated; there is no pyrenoid. Since they lack photosynthetic capability, Polytoma species are entirely saprotrophic, obtaining nutrients from decaying organic matter. Some species possess an eyespot apparatus (stigma) in the anterior portion of the <b>leucoplast,</b> but in others this organelle is absent.|$|E
5000|$|Proteinoplasts (sometimes called proteoplasts, aleuroplasts, and aleuronaplasts) are {{specialized}} organelles {{found only}} in plant cells. Proteinoplasts belong to a broad category of organelles known as plastids. Because they lack pigment, proteinoplasts are more specifically a kind of <b>leucoplast.</b> They contain crystalline bodies of protein and can be the sites of enzyme activity involving those proteins. Proteinoplasts are found in many seeds, such as brazil nuts, peanuts and pulses. Although all plastids contain high concentrations of protein, proteinoplasts were identified in the 1960s and 1970s as having large protein inclusions that are visible with both light microscopes and electron microscopes.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between plastids from etiolated and green leaves with the electron microscope shows {{a radically different}} structure in {{these two types of}} particles. The <b>leucoplasts</b> do not contain grana; they show a finely granular structure. They are smaller than chloroplasts. By simply exposing to light fragments of etiolated leaves, the transformation of <b>leucoplasts</b> into normal characteristic chloroplasts is induced within a few hours. This transformation is accompanied by a significant net synthesis of chloroplastic proteins that occur at the expense of free amino compounds of which etiolated leaves contain a considerable reserve.

40|$|Electron {{microscope}} {{studies have}} been made on the fine structure of the colorless biflagellate, Polytoma obtusum, with main emphasis on the structural organization of the mitochondria and the <b>leucoplast.</b> Both organelles have been demonstrated to contain DNA aggregates as well as ribosomal particles within their matrix material. Reconstructions from serial sections showed that (a) the mitochondria were highly convoluted and irregular in shape and size, and (b) the <b>leucoplast</b> was a single cup-shaped entity, with large starch grains, localized at the posterior end, and multiple sites of DNA aggregates. The starch-containing compartments appeared to be interconnected by narrow tubular or sheetlike bridges. Cytoplasmic invaginations into the plastid, often containing mitochondria, were of frequent occurrence, and membranes of mitochondria and the <b>leucoplast</b> appeared to be closely apposed. Membranous elements, both sheetlike and vesicular, were also present in the matrix. The Polytoma <b>leucoplast</b> was, in certain respects, morphologically similar to the plastids of various photosynthetic mutants of Chlamydomonas...|$|E
40|$|The colorless alga Polytoma obtusum {{has been}} found to possess leucoplasts, and two kinds of ribosomes with {{sedimentation}} values of 73 S and 79 S. The ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the 73 S but not the 79 S ribosomes was shown to hybridize with the <b>leucoplast</b> DNA (rho - 1. 682 g/ml). Nuclear DNA of Polytoma (rho = 1. 711) showed specific hybridization with rRNA from the 79 S ribosomes. Saturation hybridization indicated that only one copy of the rRNA cistrons was present per <b>leucoplast</b> genome, with an average buoyant density of rho = 1. 700. On the other hand, about 750 copies of the cytoplasmic rRNA cistrons were present per nuclear genome with a density of rho = 1. 709. Heterologous hybridization studies with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii rRNAs showed an estimated 80 % homology between the two cytoplasmic rRNAs, but only a 50 % homology between chloroplast and <b>leucoplast</b> rRNAs of the two species. We conclude that the leucoplasts of Polytoma derive from chloroplasts of a Chlamydomonas-like ancestor, but that the <b>leucoplast</b> rRNA cistrons have diverged in evolution more extensively than the cistrons for cytoplasmic rRNA...|$|E
40|$|Starch grains in callus {{cells of}} Taxus cuspidata var. nana were clearly {{detectable}} when the vesicles containing Taxol-like substances in {{the cells were}} qualitatively stained with iodine-potassium iodide reagent solution. Moreover, from observations made under a transmission electron microscope, the vesicles containing starch grains were demonstrated to be plastids wrapped with a double membrane. The plastids were divided roughly into proplastids, leucoplasts and amyloplasts. The proplastid had mainly formed around the nucleus in the juvenile callus cells right after the cell division of 1. 5 to 2. 5 -month-old callus cells. Then, the <b>leucoplast</b> that developed from the proplast moved from the nucleus to {{the vicinity of the}} vacuole. Furthermore, the <b>leucoplast</b> in 2. 5 -month-old mature callus cells was scattered around the large-hypertrophied vacuole. The <b>leucoplast</b> containing 1 to 2 starch grains was observed in the plastid of 1. 5 -month-old juvenile callus cells. Moreover, numerous amyloplasts containing 3 to 5 starch grains were observed in the 2. 5 to 3 -month-old mature and aged callus cells. The amyloplast began to invaginate into the tonoplast in the aged and browning callus cells and finally it floated in the vacuole...|$|E
50|$|Amyloplasts are plastids, {{specifically}} <b>leucoplasts.</b> Plastids are {{a specialized}} class of cellular organelles that carry their own genome and {{are believed to}} be descendants of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) which formed a symbiotic relationship with the eukaryotic cell.|$|R

Plant embryos also contain plastids and those present in oilseeds such as rapeseed (Brassica napus) have properties of both chloroplasts and <b>leucoplasts,</b> {{and are therefore}} termed embryoplasts. After isolation of plastids from developing embryos of oilseed rape (Brassica napus cv. Reston), embryoplast proteins were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. One of the proteins identified was sucrose synthase, a sucrose cleaving enzyme principally located in the cytosol. To confirm that sucrose synthase is associated with isolated embryoplasts, we performed western blots on the protein using four different sucrose synthase antibodies.

40|$|<b>Leucoplast</b> {{pyruvate}} kinase from endosperm of developing {{castor oil seeds}} (Ricinus communis L.; cv Baker) has been purified 1370 -fold to a specific activity of 41. 1 micromoles pyruvate produced per minute per milligram protein. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme resulted in a single protein staining band that co-migrated with {{pyruvate kinase}} activity. However, following sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis, two major protein staining bands of 57. 5 and 44 kilodaltons, which occurred in an approximate 2 : 1 ratio, respectively, were observed. The native molecular mass was approximately 305 kilodaltons. Rabbit antiserum raised against the final enzyme preparation effectively immunoprecipitated <b>leucoplast</b> pyruvate kinase. The 57. 5 - and 44 -kilodalton polypeptides are immunologically related as both proteins cross-reacted strongly on Western blots probed with the rabbit anti-(developing castor seed endosperm <b>leucoplast</b> pyruvate kinase) immunoglobulin that had been affinity-purified against the 57. 5 -kilodalton polypeptide. In contrast, pyruvate kinases from the following sources showed no immunological cross-reactivity with the same immunoglobulin: the cytosolic enzyme from developing or germinating castor bean endosperm; chloroplastic pyruvate kinase from expanding leaves of the castor oil plant; chloroplastic or cytosolic pyruvate kinase from the green alga, Selenastrum minutum; and mammalian or bacterial pyruvate kinases...|$|E
40|$|Leucoplasts are {{important}} organelles for the synthesis and storage of starch, lipids and proteins. However, molecular mechanism of protein import into leucoplasts {{and how it}} {{differs from that of}} import into chloroplasts remain unknown. We used pea seedlings for both chloroplast and <b>leucoplast</b> isolations to compare within the same species. We further optimized the isolation and import conditions to improve import efficiency and to permit a quantitative comparison between the two plastid types. The authenticity of the import was verified using a mitochondrial precursor protein. Our results show that, when normalized to Toc 75, most translocon proteins are less abundant in leucoplasts than in chloroplasts. A precursor shown to prefer the receptor Toc 132 indeed had relatively more similar import efficiencies between chloroplasts and leucoplasts compared to precursors that preferred Toc 159. Furthermore we found two precursors that exhibited very high import efficiency into leucoplasts. Their transit peptides may be candidates for delivering transgenic proteins into leucoplasts and for analyzing motifs important for <b>leucoplast</b> import...|$|E
40|$|Two cDNA clones, PKpÎ± and PKpÎ², for the <b>leucoplast</b> isozyme of {{pyruvate}} kinase have been isolated and characterized. A Southern blot of castor (Ricinus communis) DNA probed with PKpÎ± indicates {{the presence of}} a single gene for PKp. Most (1610 base pairs) of the sequence of both cDNAs is identical. These 1610 base pairs begin with an ATG translation initiation codon, and have 248 base pairs of 3 â²-untranslated and 1362 base pairs of coding sequence. The sequences of the two clones 5 â²- to the identical regions are different but both encode peptides with a high percentage of hydrophobic amino acids. The derived sequence of PKpÎ± encodes eight amino acid residues which have been identified as the amino-terminus of one subunit of PKp from castor seed leucoplasts when the enzyme is purified in the absence of cysteine endopeptidase inhibitors. The sequence upstream of these amino acids is possibly the transit peptide for this protein. When PKp is extracted under conditions that eliminate its proteolytic degradation, its Î±-subunit has a relative molecular weight equal to the full-length coding sequence of PKpÎ±. The data indicate that the transit peptide for the subunit of <b>leucoplast</b> {{pyruvate kinase}} encoded by PKpÎ± is not cleaved until the protein is released from the plastid. The derived amino acid sequences of PKpÎ± and PKpÎ² are most closely related to Escherichia coli pyruvate kinase. Although the residues involved in substrate binding are conserved in <b>leucoplast</b> pyruvate kinase, there is no phosphorylation site and only 5 of 15 amino acids in the E. coli fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate binding site are conserved...|$|E

40|$|Polytoma obtusum has a main band DNA (alpha) with a {{buoyant density}} in CsC 1 of rho = 1. 711 g/ml {{and a light}} DNA {{satellite}} (beta) with rho = 1. 682 g/ml. beta-DNA was substantially enriched in a fraction containing small <b>leucoplast</b> fragments and some mitochondria, which was obtained in a pellet sedimenting between 3, 000 g and 5, 000 g. A crude mitochondrial pellet was also obtained by sedimenting at 12, 000 g to recover particulates remaining in the supernate after 10 min at 5, 000 g. This fraction contained a third DNA component (gamma) with rho = 1. 714 g/ml. We {{have concluded that the}} leucoplasts of P. obtusum contain the beta-DNA (1. 6882) and the mitochondria possess the gamma- component (1. 714). Two distinct classess of ribosomes were isolated and separated by sucrose density gradients, a major 79 S species and a minor species at 75 S. The major species possessed the 25 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), characteristic of cytoplasmic ribosomes, and these particles co-sedimented in sucrose gradients with the 79 S cytoplasmic ribosomes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The minor species was present in about 2 % of the total ribosomal population but showed an eight-to- ninefold enrichment in the <b>leucoplast</b> pellet, suggesting that it was of organelle origin. These 73 S particles had RNA components migrating very closely with the 18 S and 25 S species of the 79 S ribosomes, but the base composition of the rRNA from these two classes of ribosomes was significantly different; the rRNA from the 79 S ribosomes had a G+C mole ratio of 50. 0 %, while the rRNA from the 73 S class had a ratio of 47. 5 %. By comparison, chloroplast ribosomes of C. reinhardtii were found to sediment at 70 S and contain rRNA molecules of 23 S and 16 S, with a G + C content of 51. 0 %. These findings support the concept that the Polytoma <b>leucoplast</b> possesses characteristic genetic and protein-forming systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} routes by which {{proteins}} are incorporated into organelles in plant cells. The mechanism of protein translocation into protein bodies, leucoplasts and glyoxysomes - three major types of organelle in castor bean endosperm cells - are investigated. While the synthesis of protein body and glyoxysome matrix proteins has previously been studied, nothing is currently known about the synthesis and incorporation of proteins destined for their membranes. This work describes the purification and characterization of the major integral membrane proteins of these organelles. Rabbit antisera raised against these proteins was used to follow their synthesis both in vivo and in vitro by a variety of techniques. The results of this investigation suggest that protein body membrane proteins are initially synthesized on and inserted into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and are subsequently transported to protein bodies by a process of membrane flow and vesiculation. Glyoxysome membrane proteins, however, appear to be posttranslationally imported directly into the organelle from the cytoplasm. Neither class of protein appear to be synthesized as precursors nor are any co- or post-translationa 1 modifications evident. Leucoplasts also import proteins from the cytoplasm, apparently by mechanisms similar to those operating in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Chloroplast precursor proteins are competent for translocation into leucoplasts and are apparently correctly processed on import by a <b>leucoplast</b> stromal peptidase. Other features of <b>leucoplast</b> and chloroplast protein import are also similar. The results presented suggest that plant cells utilize a variety of routes and mechanisms for transporting proteins. These mechanisms are compared with those employed, and more extensively studied, in animal and yeast cells...|$|E
40|$|Leucoplasts {{isolated}} from developing endosperm of Ricinus communis L. will import the precursor {{of the small}} subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase from pea shoots and process it to its mature molecular weight (SA Boyle, SM Hemmingsen, DT Dennis [1986] Plant Physiol 81 : 817 - 822). This process requires {{energy in the form}} of ATP. GTP, CTP, and UTP are inactive. ADP will also satisfy the energy requirement, probably through the action of adenylate kinase in the envelope. Fatty acid biosynthesis which occurs within these leucoplasts also requires ATP for maximal activity. Phosphoenolpyruvate will stimulate fatty acid biosynthesis approximately three times as effectively as ATP through the generation of ATP within the organelle by the action of the plastid pyruvate kinase. However, phosphoenolpyruvate under similar conditions will not stimulate the uptake of the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase into leucoplasts. These results indicate that ATP is required outside the <b>leucoplast</b> for protein uptake and that internally generated ATP is not effective in this process...|$|E

40|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} {{based on}} ultrastructural correlation, specific labeling, and subcellular fractionation studies indicates {{that at least}} the early steps of monoterpene biosynthesis occur in plastids. (4 S) -Limonene synthase, {{which is responsible for}} the first dedicated step of monoterpene biosynthesis in mint species, appears to be translated as a preprotein bearing a long plastidial transit peptide. Immunogold labeling using polyclonal antibodies raised to the native enzyme demonstrated the specific localization of limonene synthase to the <b>leucoplasts</b> of peppermint (Mentha Ã piperita) oil gland secretory cells during the period of essential oil production. Labeling was shown to be absent from all other plastid types examined, including the basal and stalk cell plastids of the secretory phase glandular trichomes. Furthermore, in vitro translation of the preprotein and import experiments with isolated pea chloroplasts were consistent in demonstrating import of the nascent protein to the plastid stroma and proteolytic processing to the mature enzyme at this site. These experiments confirm that the leucoplastidome of the oil gland secretory cells is the exclusive location of limonene synthase, and almost certainly the preceding steps of monoterpene biosynthesis, in peppermint leaves. However, succeeding steps of monoterpene metabolism in mint appear to occur outside the <b>leucoplasts</b> of oil gland cells...|$|R
