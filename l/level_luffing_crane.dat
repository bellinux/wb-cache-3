50|$|Normally a crane with a hinged jib {{will tend}} to have its hook also {{move up and down}} as the jib moves (or luffs). A <b>level</b> <b>luffing</b> <b>crane</b> is a crane of this common design, but with an extra {{mechanism}} to keep the hook level when luffing.|$|E
50|$|Its {{dry dock}} is 640m length and 65m breadth, It can {{accommodate}} ships up to 400,000 tonnes DWT. Two cranes with {{a span of}} 140 meters & height of 85 meters together capable of handling up to 1200 Ton block and two Level Luffing cranes are erected to service this dry dock. To facilitate afloat fit-out and commissioning of ships, including afloat repairs, a 300-meter long quay, with the capacity for berthing on both sides, has been constructed with adequate draft and serviced by a <b>Level</b> <b>Luffing</b> <b>crane.</b> The entrance of the dry dock also has a 100-meter extension track for the Goliath cranes for unloading heavy machinery and equipment weighing up to 1200 Tons directly from ships and heavy lift barges.|$|E
50|$|In 1929 both ships {{went into}} drydock for modernization. Boiler {{capacity}} was reduced by 50 percent, {{with all the}} old boilers removed and new, more efficient ones installed. The weight saved was used to increase horizontal armor and augment the protective equipment with torpedo bulges up to 6.1 ft on both sides. This would increase the ships' beam to 105.2 ft, which {{with an increase in}} displacement to 28,500 tons meant they needed one percent more power to maintain the same speed they had previously (18,125 EHP instead of 17,874). In addition, Nevada was re-engined using the turbines that had been installed in the USS North Dakota in 1917 and removed before she was scrapped. New, unarmored casemates were built on the main deck and the 5"/51 cal guns moved there to improve their tenability in rough weather. The torpedo tubes were removed, new anti-aircraft guns and gunnery control instruments installed. Bridge structures were modified and increased and tripod masts replaced the traditional lattice masts. Longer, lighter ship's cranes were fitted and the simple derrick aft was replaced by a <b>level</b> <b>luffing</b> <b>crane.</b> Finally, two aircraft catapults were fitted, one on the ships' poop and the second atop C turret.|$|E

50|$|Porrtal and semi portal <b>level</b> <b>luffing</b> <b>cranes</b> {{once served}} timber and steel framed wharf sheds, {{all but three}} {{of which have been}} demolished. The oldest, dating from 1913, were along the eastern edge and were purported to have been {{dismantled}} for future restoration of the central pier sheds, two of which survive. All the cranes have been removed but crane rails survive on some wharf aprons.|$|R
50|$|The {{first part}} of {{construction}} was the dry dock, which was then specified to length of 250 metres and width of 80 metres, and measured for two 100 000 dry weight vessels, a bridge crane of 600-tonne capacity, 70 metres operative height and 150 metres track, two 50-tonne <b>level</b> <b>luffing</b> <b>cranes,</b> a warm hall of 42 000 square metres for steelworks, paint shop, service building and an office building with dressing rooms. At this stage the headcount was 1 200; the workers were from the old yard, where the capacity was reduced respectively. Designing, administration, special ship building up to 40 000 tonnes, diesel engine production and ship repairs were decided to be kept at the old yard for then.|$|R

40|$|PT XYZ is {{a company}} {{concerned}} in the port services, {{one of which is}} the loading/unloading of goods using a mobile crane. Based on observations, a mobile crane company owned only one unit and installed capacity company are 92 tons per hour company while the load demand on average 157 tons per hour. From the above data shows that the company can not meet the load demand due to insufficient capacity. In an attempt to adjust the loading capacity and load demand is done with addition of capacity through addition of crane. Forecasting is used as a method to predict the loading demand in the future. Data of forecasting is used as reference in approximating the exact number of cranes. Based on the calculations, crane that needed to solve the problem are two units, so it required the addition one crane. The proposed alternative type of cranes are mobile crane 5 ton capacity and <b>luffing</b> <b>crane</b> 10 tons capacity. The best type of crane are selected using decision theory which use payoff approach, they are payoff profit and payoff risk. From the calculation, the best type of alternative criteria from the payoff profit is <b>Luffing</b> <b>crane</b> with a value 7. 75, 10, 2. 5, 2. 5, while for the payoff risk, the best is mobile crane with a value 4. 55; 3. 5; 7; 1, 75.

50|$|Between 1973 and 1988, a {{total of}} 53 ships were built by Govan Shipbuilders at the Govan (former Fairfield) shipyard. Investment in plant {{equipment}} at the yard during this period included expansion of the steel fabrication facilities and the installation of four 80 ton travelling rope <b>luffing</b> <b>cranes</b> in 1975 by Clarke Chapman, servicing the yard's three slipways, {{in order to increase}} the size of units that could be prefabricated. An additional three 80 ton cranes from Scotstoun Marine Ltd were dismantled and transferred to Govan after the Scotstoun yard closed in 1980; they remain distinctive due to their blue paintwork.|$|R

This paper develops a systemic optimization method for tower cranes based on Ansys OPT, combined with finite element analysis (FEA) and stability theory. This mathod is firstly used in the optimization of the boom of <b>luffing</b> jib tower <b>cranes.</b> New optimization model of the boom of <b>luffing</b> jib tower <b>cranes</b> is introduced and the corresponding optimization program is developed.

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{response}} of tower cranes {{coupled with the}} pendulum motions of the payload is studied in this paper. A simple perturbation scheme and the assumption of small pendulum angle are applied to simplify the governing equation. The tower crane is modeled by the finite element method, while the pendulum motion is represented as rigid-body kinetics. Integrated governing equations for the coupled dynamics problem are derived based on Lagrange’s equations including the dissipation function. Dynamics of a real <b>luffing</b> <b>crane</b> model with the spherical and planar pendulum motions is analyzed using the proposed formulations and computational method. It is found that the dynamic responses of the tower crane are dominated by both the first few natural frequencies of crane structure and the pendulum motion of the payload. The dynamic amplification factors generally increase {{with the increase of}} the initial pendulum angle and the changes are just slightly nonlinear for the planar pendulum motion...|$|R
