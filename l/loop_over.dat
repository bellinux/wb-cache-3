5|$|A {{tropical}} storm developed east of Nicaragua on May25, executing a counterclockwise <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> Central America. After weakening over land, Alice re-intensified over the western Caribbean, moving over western Cuba on May 21 with winds of 50mph (80km/h). On June1, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and later executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba. Alice quickly weakened {{due to a}} cold front, and advisories were discontinued by June3. While near Cuba, Alice produced drought-breaking rainfall that caused flooding and several unofficial drowning deaths.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Sandy was the second-costliest Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. It {{lasted for}} over a week in late October-early November 2012. Classified as the eighteenth named storm, tenth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Sandy originated from a tropical wave on October22. Performing a small <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> the central Caribbean Sea, the system intensified into a tropical storm a day later and became the final hurricane of the season before briefly coming ashore the coast of Jamaica on October24. After emerging between Jamaica and Cuba, Sandy began a period of rapid intensification into a Category3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). It made landfall at this intensity near Santiago de Cuba on October25.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} gradually strengthened, and by 1200UTC on June23, {{it reached}} tropical storm status. Over Texas, airborne radars and the Dow Chemical Company radar in Freeport indicated curved convective banding {{associated with the}} storm. Though no wall cloud was reported, the Kelly Air Force Base reported a cloud center. Late on June23, the storm intensified slightly further, and peaked with winds of 45mph (75km/h). Early on June24, the tropical storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression. Over the following 24hours, the depression executed a small cyclonic <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> southern Texas. On July26, the depression accelerated to the north-northeast, and eventually dissipated over northern Illinois on July29 at 0000UTC.|$|E

5|$|The extratropical cyclone {{moved away}} from the coast and {{strengthened}} to the equivalent of a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on November1. It began a weakening trend on November2 while taking a wavering path across the north Atlantic Ocean. On November4, the cyclone started a general east-southeast motion, passing near the southwest coasts of Ireland and Great Britain. It made landfall on the Cotentin Peninsula of France on November6 and dissipated, although one proposed track, which is a modified track that differs from the official record due to new evidence or theory, was given by Charles Mitchell that showed the cyclone executing a counter-clockwise <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> northwest France until dissipating the storm on November8.|$|E
5|$|The nascent system quickly organized, {{aided by}} the {{decreasing}} wind shear, {{as well as a}} surge in the monsoon. The IMD upgraded the depression to a cyclonic storm at 03:00UTC on May17. At 12:00UTC that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing warnings on the system with its own designation Tropical Cyclone 02B. With weak steering currents, the storm meandered over the central Bay of Bengal, executing a small cyclonic <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> 30hours. The cloud pattern organized into a central dense overcast that was initially irregular in nature. However, the storm quickly intensified on May18, strengthening into a severe cyclonic storm and later very severe cyclonic storm. During this time, the cyclone turned eastward under the influence of a ridge over India to the north.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Alice was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean to receive a female name. It was a rare off-season tropical cyclone that hit Central America, Cuba, and Florida in late May to early June 1953. Alice formed on May 25 in the western Caribbean, and executed a large <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> Central America. It passed over western Cuba, causing heavy rainfall and possibly several casualties from drowning. It then executed another loop in the Gulf of Mexico, reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h), and weakened before hitting the Florida panhandle on June 6. Although heavy rainfall occurred in Florida, there was little damage.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the effects}} of a larger upper-level low, Juan slowed on October 28 while {{approaching}} the Louisiana coastline. At 1200 UTC that day, the hurricane attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). After executing a loop just offshore southern Louisiana, Juan turned back to the east, making landfall at peak intensity near Morgan City at 1100 UTC on October 29. Subsequently, Juan turned sharply to the northwest, executing another <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> southern Louisiana near Lafayette. Late on October 29, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, emerging into Vermilion Bay early the next day with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Juan turned to the east, moving along the southern Louisiana coast and re-organizing slightly.|$|E
5|$|As Esther {{began to}} {{parallel}} the coastline, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal areas from Long Island to Provincetown, Massachusetts on September 20, and were extended to Eastport, Maine early on September 21. All hurricane watches were discontinued on September 21 as Esther {{moved away from}} the New England coast, and all hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings later that day as Esther passed near Nantucket and weakened to a tropical storm, and all warnings were discontinued on September 22 after the storm {{moved away from the}} coast. After Esther completed its anticyclonic <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> the northwestern Atlantic, a gale warning was again issued from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Eastport, Maine on September 25, and was discontinued the next day after Esther made its second landfall in Maine. Personnel on two offshore surveillance stations called the Texas Towers were evacuated; a third tower had collapsed during a storm in January 1961, prompting higher safety standards.|$|E
5|$|By September29, Georges had {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} storm and completed a small clockwise <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> southern Mississippi. Subsequently, the storm began tracking west-northwestward at a faster pace. Around 1200UTC, Georges weakened to a tropical depression, and the NHC issued their final advisory on the system. At this time, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) initiated public advisories. The depression maintained a well-defined circulation as it tracked close to the Gulf of Mexico; however, the center of circulation remained inland. Large quantities of tropical moisture fed the storm, allowing it to produce torrential rainfall. By September30, the low-level circulation began to detach from the upper-level circulation. The HPC issued their final advisory on the depression early on October1 as it neared the Atlantic Ocean, and it fully dissipated several hours later.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>looping</b> <b>over</b> {{observations}} can be slow and should be avoided. The objective {{of this article is to}} discuss two alternative solutions to <b>looping</b> <b>over</b> observations that can be used to overcome a particular data-management problem of merging datasets in which unique key identifiers changed over time. The ﬁrst alternative, mapch, which is introduced in this article, uses a combination of appending, indexing, and merging to solve the problem, while the second alternative uses repeated merging. Both solutions are much quicker than <b>looping</b> <b>over</b> observations. However, depending on the nature of the problem, one solution may work better than the other. It is argued that the use of such dataset-type manipulations may be suitable to overcome other data-management problems. More generally speaking, the issue that is addressed—searching for an alternative to <b>looping</b> <b>over</b> observations—may be common and illustrates the importance of balancing the costs of developing an efficient solution with the benefits accruing from that solution.

5|$|On 15 March, a {{tropical}} disturbance {{developed in the}} south-western Gulf of Carpentaria. It moved westward, drifting across Top End, and it exited into the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf on 22 March. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) office in Darwin, which is the local Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre, began issuing advisories on the system late on 23 March while it was located about 85km (50mi) east-south-east of Wyndham, Western Australia. Environmental conditions favored intensification as an anticyclone developed over the storm, which provided good outflow and low vertical wind shear. Initially, the primary inhibiting factor was land interaction. After executing a small <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> water, the disturbance continued westward, crossing over the northern portion of Western Australia before emerging into the Indian Ocean on 26 March. It began tracking west-southwestward just offshore of the Kimberley coastline, and its convection quickly concentrated. At 0000UTC on 27 March, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Cyclone 20S. Three hours later, the BoM office in Perth upgraded the storm to Tropical Cyclone Glenda about 260km (160mi) north of Derby, Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of the season, Able, formed {{prior to}} the official start of the season; before reanalysis in 2015, it was once listed as the earliest major hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. It formed on May16 and executed a counterclockwise <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> the Bahamas; later it brushed the North Carolina coastline. Hurricane Charlie was a powerful Category4 hurricane that struck Jamaica as a major hurricane, killing hundreds and becoming the worst disaster in over 50years. The hurricane later struck Mexico twice as a major hurricane, producing deadly flooding outside of Tampico, Tamaulipas. The strongest hurricane, Easy, spent its duration over the open Atlantic Ocean, briefly threatening Bermuda, and was formerly listed {{as one of a}} relatively few Category5 hurricanes on record over the Atlantic Ocean. It briefly neared Category5 status and interacted with Hurricane Fox, marking the first known instance of a hurricane affecting another's path.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Yagi was {{an intense}} typhoon, the strongest of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, which reached the {{equivalence}} of Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Forming {{out of a}} tropical depression on September16, Yagi quickly strengthened as it executed a slow clockwise <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On September19, Yagi strengthened into a typhoon as a subtropical ridge steered the storm towards the west. Two days later, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 195km/h (120mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 910hPa (mbar). The typhoon gradually weakened as it recurved towards the northeast and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on September24 and became extratropical the next day. The storm was last noted near the Aleutian Islands on September27. The typhoon caused severe damage {{on the island of}} Chichijima but no injuries were reported {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} August 10, {{computer}} models anticipated the hurricane to accelerate {{to the northeast}} and become extratropical within three days, but this did not materialize. A westerly trough that had been influencing Alberto’s motion outran the storm, and a strong ridge developed {{to the north and}} west, causing the storm to turn abruptly to the south on August 15, and to complete a large <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> the open Atlantic. Alberto turned to the southwest on August 16 and to the west on August 17. The storm then took a sharp turn toward the northwest as a large, slow-moving mid-level trough was carving out over the eastern United States. Alberto began to strengthen, and reached hurricane status for the third time on August 18. The hurricane continued to turn to the north on August 19 and to the northeast on August 20 and August 21. During this time, Alberto reached a third peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) on August 20, and a 70mi (110km) wide eye was observed. Operationally, Alberto reached a peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), but after reanalysis, it was reduced to 105mph (165km/h).|$|E
5|$|During October 20, 2006 the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression, that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{to the north}} of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands. The system was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow in its northern and eastern quadrants. Over the next day conditions surrounding the system rapidly became favourable for further development, with convection starting to wrap into a well defined low level circulation centre. As a result, the depression rapidly developed further and was named Xavier by the FMS during October 22, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After the system was named the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01P, while it was located over the Santa Cruz Islands. Throughout October 22, Xavier's rapid intensification continued with it developing an eye feature and becoming a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. During that day the system performed a small cyclonic <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> Temotu Province and passed near or over the Santa Cruz Island of Tikopia.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isbell {{was first}} {{identified}} as a weak tropical disturbance on October7, 1964 over the western Caribbean Sea. Situated {{to the south of}} a diffuse trough, the system remained weak and relatively disorganized as it moved generally northwest near Honduras and Nicaragua. Despite the presence of an upper-level anticyclone, which promotes favorable outflow for tropical cyclones and aids in tropical cyclogenesis, a lack of distinct low-level inflow inhibited intensification. Additionally, an area of warm mid-tropospheric air was present within the cyclone. Though a disheveled system, it is analyzed to have become a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on October8. The following day, the depression skirted the eastern coast of Honduras. Operationally, it was not until October10 that the Weather Bureau initiated advisories on the depression. On that date, a weather reconnaissance mission into the system found a weak low-level circulation with a barometric pressure of 1007.3mb (hPa; 29.75inHg) and winds of 20–30mph (30–45km/h) in squalls. Throughout October11 and 12, the depression slowly executed a tight cyclonic <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It finally organized into a tropical storm and was given the name Isbell by 00:00UTC on October13 after completing the loop and acquiring a north-northeast trajectory.|$|E

25|$|Late on 9 March, Gafilo made {{landfall}} {{north of}} Morombe, Madagascar, {{and the system}} started to make a three-day clockwise <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> the south part of Madagascar. For the system further weakened after landfall, JTWC analysed that Gafilo dissipated overland late on 11 March, as well as MFR issued a final warning on the overland depression which began to track southeastwards early on 12 March. Surprisingly, MFR began to issue warnings again on the completely disorganised system at noon on 12 March, as the residual centre was expected to go back overseas. Late on the same day, JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the overland remnants, because of improved deep convection over the low-level circulation centre, poleward outflow and weak vertical wind shear.|$|E
25|$|The first {{instance}} of tabulation hashing is Zobrist hashing, {{a method for}} hashing positions in abstract board games such as chess named after Albert Lindsey Zobrist, who published it in 1970. In this method, a random bitstring is generated for each game feature such as {{a combination of a}} chess piece and a square of the chessboard. Then, to hash any game position, the bitstrings for the features of that position are combined by a bitwise exclusive or. The resulting hash value can then be used as an index into a transposition table. Because each move typically changes {{only a small number of}} game features, the Zobrist value of the position after a move can be updated quickly from the value of the position before the move, without needing to <b>loop</b> <b>over</b> all of the features of the position.|$|E
