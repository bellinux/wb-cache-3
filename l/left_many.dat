5|$|Around this time, {{perhaps because}} of the great and {{definitive}} works from Cairano, the Sanmicheli left Brescia, never to return. In Casale Monferrato, Bartolomeo died two years later. Matteo, who started alongside his father, continued and ended his career in Piedmont, near Turin, where he <b>left</b> <b>many</b> of his better known works.|$|E
5|$|The pavilion's {{construction}} was {{aided by the}} French CATIA software program and internet conferencing. Early plans to incorporate a surrounding waterfall and stairway were abandoned. In the end, budget limitations led to compromises with the original architectural plan that <b>left</b> <b>many</b> elements in their most straightforward form, such as exposed pipes and conduits, or rough concrete.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the community, perpetually {{struggling}} financially, drafted {{an entirely}} new constitution and committed to following more closely the Fourierist model. Not everyone at the community supported the transition, and many <b>left.</b> <b>Many</b> were disappointed that the new, more structured daily routine de-emphasized the carefree leisure time {{that had been a}} trademark. Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{phenomenon}} {{occurring in the}} room is far older than the house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, <b>left</b> <b>many</b> thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research.|$|E
5|$|Salford's built {{environment}} {{is made up}} of a range of building stock. Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic urban decay. Salford's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it <b>left</b> <b>many</b> owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of the {{built environment}} is poor.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{came to a}} head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Ryan. The battle <b>left</b> <b>many</b> dead, and the few sane {{survivors}} barricaded themselves away. What once was a beautiful utopia had fallen into a crumbling dystopia. Some of the events described above are revisited and expanded upon in the downloadable expansion , which takes place in Rapture during the latter months of 1958 and leads up to Atlas' assault on Ryan's forces.|$|E

5|$|The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature {{requires}} {{each species}} {{to be represented}} by a type collection. The destruction of Burret's type collections <b>left</b> <b>many</b> species only known from his original descriptions, which generally lacked illustrations. Other specimens (called neotypes) were designated to replace these, either by Rodrigo Bernal and colleagues in 1989 or by Borchsenius and Bernal in their 1996 monograph of the genus. Bernal and colleagues attempted to retrace Kalbreyer's travels in northern Colombia and collect specimens from {{as close as possible}} to the location of the original collections.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{contributed to}} the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 and {{assisted}} in defensive actions as the new year neared. Acute manpower shortages in the BEF on the Western Front <b>left</b> <b>many</b> divisions understrength {{and so it was}} decided to adopt a nine-battalion system through amalgamations and disbandments. The 5th, 8th, 9th, and 10th King's integrated with their second-line, while hundreds of their men were distributed to other King's battalions. The 20th disbanded in February, with its strength dispersed to the other Liverpool Pals.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the First World War <b>left</b> <b>many</b> issues to be settled, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early interwar period, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered {{in its early years}} included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.|$|E

5|$|Watchmen is an American comic-book limited series {{published}} by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987, and collected in 1987. The series {{was created by}} a British collaboration consisting of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colorist John Higgins. Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters {{that the company had}} acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have <b>left</b> <b>many</b> of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead.|$|E
5|$|While it {{achieved}} {{successes and}} proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division {{earned a reputation}} for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia <b>left</b> <b>many</b> hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by {{the spring and summer}} of 1944.|$|E
5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 {{was the first}} manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and <b>left</b> <b>many</b> physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E

5|$|By February 1943, Himmler's {{ideals of}} Waffen-SS racial purity had been {{significantly}} diluted. The first division {{to be raised}} by Berger's recruiters that was clearly outside the Waffen-SS racial and ethnic strictures used manpower from the Muslim community of Bosnia. The 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) first went into action in February 1944, and was of limited value, especially outside of its area of operations in eastern Bosnia. While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia <b>left</b> <b>many</b> hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by {{the spring and summer}} of 1944.|$|E
5|$|Cerezeda left Trujillo {{temporarily}} and, with Vasco de Herrera also gone, Méndez de Hinostrosa {{attempted to}} seize sole power. Vasco de Herrera at length returned, but had <b>left</b> <b>many</b> of his soldiers fighting native {{resistance in the}} Valley of Olancho, led by his brother Diego Díaz de Herrera. Vasco de Herrera ordered that Méndez de Hinostrosa be executed, but he sought sanctuary in a church and his supporters soon rallied to him, outnumbering Vasco de Herrera's men in Trujillo. Cerezeda returned to Trujillo and attempted to mediate between the opposing factions, but Vasco de Herrera was assassinated and Méndez de Hinostrosa seized control of the town. Cerezeda refused to recognise him, and both parties sent urgent messages to Diego Díaz de Herrera in Olancho, requesting his support; many of his men expressed their support for Méndez de Hinostrosa. Cerezeda acted quickly and fierce fighting erupted in Trujillo. Cerezeda captured Méndez de Hinostrosa and beheaded him. Finally, {{after a year of}} Spanish infighting, Cerezeda emerged as sole governor of Honduras.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the close}} {{passage of the}} storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and {{amounted}} to $175,000. Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5hour span. The brevity of damaging winds limited {{the effects of the}} storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and power poles. Two trailers were overturned, however, and an oil barge sank in the Key West Harbor. Two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed. In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal Palms, and Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily <b>left</b> <b>many</b> customers without phone and electrical service. Residents in nearby Lee Cypress stated that the effects from Isbell were worse than Hurricane Donna which struck the region as a Category4 in September 1960.|$|E

5|$|Electricians had power {{restored}} to the Freeport area by {{the day after the}} storm, and had power {{restored to}} most of the western portion of the island within three weeks after the hurricane. Work crews quickly removed road debris and tree limbs, and by the day after the passage of Wilma most roads were cleared. The passage of the hurricane left 1,000–4,000people and hundreds of animals homeless. In response, the Grand Bahama Humane Society distributed about 340kg (750lb) of dog food and treated or euthanized injured animals, depending on their condition. The earlier effects of Wilma on Mexico <b>left</b> <b>many</b> tourist areas in that country closed, leading to a 10% increase in tourism in the Bahamas in December 2005. By about three weeks after the hurricane, the airport on Grand Bahama Island was reopened, and all but one resort were also reopened; the remaining resort was reopened about two months after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In El Dorado, Sinaloa, {{near where}} the storm made landfall, the {{hurricane}} washed out away roads and destroyed many flimsy homes. Strong winds knocked down electricity towers, trees, and traffic signs, leaving many without power. In Mazatlán, to the southeast of where Lane moved ashore, the hurricane produced strong winds and heavy rains, causing street flooding and power outages. The threat of the hurricane forced the cancellation of an Independence Day Parade. Between Mazatlán and the state capital, Culiacán, the hurricane destroyed a bridge, leaving dozens of trucks stranded. In Culiacán, one person died when he drove his car into a river, while several streets were flooded from the storm. Throughout Sinaloa, several damaged roads <b>left</b> <b>many</b> communities {{cut off from the}} rest of the country. Lane caused severe agricultural damage in the state, possibly reaching as high as $600million (2006MXN, $55million 2006USD). The hurricane also damaged water treatment facilities and distribution systems in multiple communities, prompting the Secretariat of Health to declare a sanitary alert in Sinaloa. Damage in Sinaloa totaled to around $1.2billion (2006MXN), $109.3million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his existing circle of supporters, {{many of whom were}} richly rewarded with new lands, Henry quickly co-opted many of the existing administration into his new royal household. William Giffard, William Rufus's chancellor, was made the Bishop of Winchester, and the prominent sheriffs Urse d'Abetot, Haimo Dapifer and Robert Fitzhamon continued to play a senior role in government. By contrast, the unpopular Ranulf Flambard, the Bishop of Durham and a key member of the previous regime, was imprisoned in the Tower of London and charged with corruption. The late king had <b>left</b> <b>many</b> church positions unfilled, and Henry set about nominating candidates to these, in an effort to build further support for his new government. The appointments needed to be consecrated, and Henry wrote to Anselm, apologising for having been crowned while the Archbishop was still in France and asking him to return at once.|$|E
50|$|At {{his death}} in 1997, he <b>left</b> behind <b>many</b> works of literature, {{including}} poetry, short stories, and novels. His work was rooted in both the Mediterranean and his own Belleville neighbourhood.|$|R
