5|$|In 2003, as {{preparations}} {{were being}} made for Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 173d Airborne Brigade was assigned {{to be a part}} of an assault from the north of Iraq. The original plan was for the 173d to be attached to the 4th Infantry Division as a flexible force of airborne troops to complement the heavy weapons of the division's three brigades. Supported by the 1st Infantry Division and the 10th Special Forces Group, the 4th Infantry Division was to assemble in Turkey and use its heavy mechanized brigades to attack through Tikrit and eventually assist V Corps, which would attack from the south, in surrounding Baghdad. However, this plan fell through when the government of Turkey would not allow offensive operations to be conducted from its soil, and the entire 4th Infantry Division was left stuck on ships in the Mediterranean for the opening of the operation. This meant that the entire northern front of the war would be conducted by the 173d Airborne Brigade and Army special forces operating with aircraft from Europe as their only supply line. As the brigade had no heavy or mechanized forces and only a few Humvees and an artillery battery, heavier forces were attached to it in the form of two companies of M113 Armored Personnel Carriers, M1 Abrams tanks, and M2 Bradleys from a task force of 1st Battalion, 63d Armor, which was attached to the brigade. Task Force 1-63 consisted of HHC/1-63d Armor, C/1-63d Armor and B/2-2d Infantry. The force also received force field artillery headquarters from the 2d Battalion, 15th Field Artillery, which brought a Tactical Operations Center, a Q-36 counterfire radar and Combat Observation and <b>Lasing</b> Team (COLT)a pair of Dragoneye Unmanned Aerial Vehicles from the US Marine Corps, to be operated by the Brigades Ground Surveillance Systems (GSS) team.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (<b>LASE)</b> Instrument is {{the first}} fully-engineered, {{autonomous}} Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) System for the measurement of water vapor in the troposphere (aerosol and cloud measurements are included). <b>LASE</b> uses a double-pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser for the transmitter with a 30 ns pulse length and 150 mJ/pulse. The laser beam is &quot;seeded &quot; to operate on a selected water vapor absorption line in the 815 -nm region using a laser diode and an onboard absorption reference cell. A 40 cm diameter telescope collects the backscattered signals and directs them onto two detectors. <b>LASE</b> collects DIAL data at 5 Hz while onboard a NASA/Ames ER- 2 aircraft flying at altitudes from 16 - 21 km. <b>LASE</b> was designed to operate autonomously within the environment and physical constraints of the ER- 2 aircraft and to make water vapor profile measurements across the troposphere to better than 10 % accuracy. <b>LASE</b> has flown 19 times during {{the development of the}} instrument and the validation of the science data.

40|$|Abstract—Adding {{features}} and fixing bugs in software often require systematic edits which are similar, but not identical, changes to many code locations. Finding all relevant locations {{and making the}} correct edits is a tedious and error-prone process. This paper addresses both problems by using edit scripts learned from multiple examples. We design and implement a tool called <b>LASE</b> that (1) creates context-aware edit scripts from two or more examples, and uses these scripts to (2) automatically identify edit locations and to (3) transform the code. We evaluate <b>LASE</b> on an oracle test suite of systematic edits from Eclipse JDT and SWT. <b>LASE</b> finds edit locations with 95 % precision and 88 % recall, and transforms them with 91 % accuracy. We also evaluate <b>LASE</b> on 37 example systematic edits from other open source programs and find <b>LASE</b> is accurate and effective. A key contribution {{of this paper is}} an algorithm that combines two or more edits to make a script. This feature of learning from multiple examples is critical to accuracy; edit scripts created from only one example produce too many false positives, false negatives, or both. These results illustrate that <b>LASE</b> should help developers in automating systematic editing. Whereas most prior work either suggests edit locations or performs simple edits, <b>LASE</b> is the first to do both for nontrivial program edits. I...|$|R

40|$|Water vapor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in many atmospheric processes related to radiation, climate change, atmospheric dynamics, meteorology, the global hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric chemistry, and yet our knowledge of the global distribution of water vapor is very limited. The differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique has the potential of providing needed high resolution water vapor measurements from aircraft and from space, and the Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (<b>LASE)</b> is a key step in the development of this capability. The <b>LASE</b> instrument is the first fully engineered, autonomous DIAL system, and it is designed to operate from a high-altitude aircraft (ER- 2) and to make water vapor and aerosol profile measurements across the troposphere.

However, when operated at room temperature, about 300 K, threshold current densities were two orders of magnitude greater, or 100,000 A/cm2 in the best devices. The dominant challenge {{for the remainder of}} the 1960s was to obtain low threshold current density at 300 K and thereby to demonstrate continuous-wave <b>lasing</b> at room temperature from a diode laser.|$|E

40|$|Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (<b>LASE)</b> is {{the first}} fully-engineered, modular, tunable, {{autonomous}} Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) system for the remote measurement of water vapor, aerosols and clouds across the troposphere. It was designed, built and environmentally tested at LARC. <b>LASE</b> was designed to fly aboard a NASA/Ames ER- 2 aircraft (NASA's high altitude aircraft) and operate at altitudes from 58, 000 to 70, 000 feet. Since its first flight on May 11, 1994, it has flown 28 total missions on board the ER- 2. <b>LASE</b> has been validated with results showing an accuracy better than the initial requirement for vertical profiles of water vapor in the troposphere. <b>LASE</b> can also deploy on several other aircraft including the NASA P- 3 and will fly aboard the NASA DC- 8 during the Convection And Moisture EXperiment (CAMEX) in July-September 1998. The tunable laser system of <b>LASE</b> was designed to operate in a double-pulse mode at 5 Hz, with energy outputs of up to 15 OmJ per pulse in the 813 to 819 nm wavelength region and with 99 % of the output energy within a spectral interval of 1. 06 pm. Sixteen wavelengths were selected to cover the various water vapor absorption cross sections needed for the DIAL measurement. The Ti:Sapphire laser was constructed using a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser as the pump source and a single mode diode laser as a injection seeder for the Ti:Al 2 O 3 laser. We have improved the <b>LASE</b> instrument in several important ways. Improvements to the seed source have demonstrated that DFB laser diodes {{can be used as}} reliable seed sources on airborne DIAL instruments. The DFB diode has enabled <b>LASE</b> to gather more data and significantly reduced the maintenance required to insure that the system performance requirements are met. The multiwavelength sequential seeding technique is the current method of data collection for <b>LASE.</b> It has the advantages of providing an entire atmospheric coverage of H 2 O(v) from the ground to the aircraft altitude along a single ground track.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the {{hypotheses}} that laser irradiation is equally effective for bonding as traditional acid-etch procedures, and that tooth substrate prepared either by Erbium:YAG laser or diamond bur is equally receptive to adhesive procedures. Buccal/oral enamel and mid-coronal dentin were laser-irradiated using an Erbium:YAG laser. A total-etch adhesive (OptiBond FL) applied with and without prior acid-etching and a self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond) were employed to bond the composite. The micro-tensile bond strength (microTBS) was determined after 24 h of storage in water. Failure patterns were analysed using a stereo-microscope, and samples were processed for Field-emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (Fe-SEM) evaluation. Unbonded, <b>lased</b> enamel and dentin surfaces were evaluated using Fe-SEM as well. The total-etch adhesive bonded significantly less effectively to <b>lased</b> than to bur-cut enamel/dentin. Laser 'conditioning' was clearly less effective than acid-etching. Moreover, acid etching <b>lased</b> enamel and dentin significantly improved the microTBS of OptiBond FL. The self-etch adhesive performed equally to <b>lased</b> as to bur-cut enamel, but significantly less effectively to <b>lased</b> than to bur-cut dentin.

25|$|A recent {{addition}} to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching <b>lasing</b> threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically {{on the order of}} a few percent) and also a very large free spectral range (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In {{addition to}} boosting the total signal gain, the use of the resonant cavity structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.|$|E
