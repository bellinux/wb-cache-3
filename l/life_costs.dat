40|$|Costs {{have for}} many years been an {{important}} factor in the defense industry and the analysis of military systems. Many nations have adopted different analyzes, tools and concepts for the evaluation of its expenditure of defense material in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency, were one of these is the <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis. <b>Life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis makes it possible to identify the most significant cost drivers and enable the best combination of resource utilization. Estimates based on <b>life</b> cycle <b>costs</b> also cre- ate a long-term perspective and thus facilitates a more well-made assessment of the investments. This study was carried out at Saab Dynamics in Karlskoga, which produces missile and support systems for the defense industry. Currently at Saab Dynamics, {{they do not have a}} unified approach to the use of <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis. However, the need has emerged because of increased customer demands. The study aims to create better conditions for the use of <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis in the defense industry. To meet the objective, the authors of this study have (1) examined how a reliable and flexible <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model can be designed, (2) examined how the <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model and its underlying activities in the <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis can be adapted to international standards from NATO and ISO/IEC, (3) examined the nature of the input data required to create a reliable and flexible <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model, and (4) ex- amined how a <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model can be presented. The result and the recommendations are based on interviews and a literature review. Through the literature review, the theoretical framework was adopted to international standards from NATO and ISO/IEC. The authors of the study then used this theoretical framework to create the final <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model. Interviews with stakeholders also revealed that the input data required for a <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis are both cost data in terms of purchasing costs and recurrent costs, and technical data in terms of quantity, surcharge, inflation rates, system usage, and the possible need for support systems. The interviews also showed that this type of data often is difficult to estimate accurately due to the systems complexity and long life time. The final <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model has been prepared and presented in Microsoft Excel, where the user simply can enter the re- quired data. The model will then automatically calculate the total <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> of the specific system and present the final result with predetermined pie and bar charts dis- playing purchasing costs, recurring costs and the total <b>life</b> cycle <b>costs.</b> These charts have been developed to enable the user to easily draw conclusions about the final result by realizing underlying causes and their cost impact.
