If noncooperative behavior is allowed, all players try to maximize their individual payoffs by increasing their transmission probabilities, resulting in frequent signal collisions among players; preventing them from acquiring any payoffs at worst. For instance, IEEE 80 [*] 211 applies some rules for signal transmission such as the <b>listen</b> <b>before</b> <b>talk</b> protocol and random back off control {{in order to provide}} equal signal transmit opportunity to all operators, resulting in the establishment of stable and effective shared spectrum usage.|$|R

Sensor nodes are usually battery powered and hence have strict energy constraints. As a result, energy efficiency {{is also a very}} critical problem in the CRSN. In this paper, we focus on energy consumption because of spectrum sensing. Furthermore, we present an adaptive spectrum sensing time interval strategy, in which SUs can adjust the next spectrum sensing time interval according to the current spectrum sensing results (namely, channel status). In order to find an optimal spectrum sensing time interval, we introduce the Markov model. Then, we establish a Markov model-based mathematical modeling for analyzing the relationship between spectrum sensing time interval and prior spectrum sensing results.

30|$|ETSI EN 302 208 [14] {{standard}} {{adopts a}} Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)-based approach known as <b>Listen</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Talk</b> (LBT). <b>Before</b> transmitting a query, the reader senses the channel for a specified amount of time. If the channel is sensed idle, the reader begins the reading procedure; otherwise, it waits a random back-off time {{waiting for the}} channel to become idle. Note that, as in traditional carrier sense-based protocols, LBT suffers for the hidden terminal problem and thus {{may not be able}} to detect and solve collisions. Authors in [15] propose a beaconing-based technique called Pulse that does not offer for the hidden terminal process. This protocol relies on the presence of two non-interfering channels. A control channel is reserved for reader-to-reader communication, while a data channel is used for identification process. When a reader is in the reading phase, simultaneously broadcasts a beacon over the control channel to notify the ongoing communication in order to prevent neighbor readers to transmit over a busy data channel. This protocol may result in high delay when the number of readers is large.|$|R

40|$|License Assisted Access (LAA) is the {{technology}} {{introduced by the}} Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) that enables the deployment of LTE networks in the unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum. To ensure a fair coexistence of LAA in the unlicensed spectrum with other technologies, e. g., with Wi-Fi, 3 GPP has standardized the use of <b>Listen</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Talk</b> (LBT) as the default channel-access scheme for LAA. However, the performance of Wi-Fi when coexisting with LAA mainly relies on how the LBT parameters are configured by the LAA.

We propose a Neural Network (NN) based scheme that adapts the CW size based on the predicted number of Negative Acknowledgments (NACKs) for all the subframes in a Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) of LAA. In particular, our proposed scheme learns from the past experience how many NACKs per subframe of a TXOP were received under certain channel conditions. The performance evaluation shows that our proposed scheme, when compared to the state-of-theart approaches, provides the best trade-off between the fairness to Wi-Fi and the LAA performance in terms of both throughput and latency...|$|R
40|$|The license {{assisted}} access (LAA) {{along with}} <b>listen</b> <b>before</b> <b>talk</b> (LBT) mechanism for access of unlicensed spectrum by LTE {{is a recent}} study item of the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP). The LAA-LBT {{is expected to be}} a feature in Release 13 of LTE that will allow mobile operators to utilize the unlicensed spectrum as their secondary carrier for data offloading. However, the unlicensed spectrum is primarily occupied by 802. 11 based WLAN devices. Hence, to ensure a fair sharing of this spectrum with WLAN devices, LAA should use a channel access scheme that is compatible with WLANs' distributed coordination function (DCF). Two such channel access schemes for LAA are under consideration with 3 GPP. In this work, we thoroughly evaluate these channel access schemes under various traffic scenarios. We show that the fairness of these schemes largely depends on the signal/energy detection threshold used by the LAA-LBT mechanism. Further, through simulation results, we show that there exists a trade off in selection of the detection threshold such that high sensing threshold results in improved overall network throughput at the cost of WLAN's performance; whereas, low threshold results in improved WLAN's performance at the cost of the overall network performance...|$|R

A possible solution that has attracted many telecom companies is the ability to expand their business by exploring new frequency bands, in particular the unlicensed spectrum. Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) is an LTE based technology that leverages the 5 GHz unlicensed band along with licensed spectrum to deliver a performance boost for mobile device users. A key aspect of LAA is how to regulate access to the communication channel in order to maintain fairness between LTE and other technologies already present in this spectrum section. <b>Listen</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Talk</b> (LBT) is a technique used in radiocommunications whereby radio transmitters first sense its radio environment before it starts a transmission. However, the aggressive character of LTE is not always correctly managed by LBT.

The results obtained show that our algorithm is able to better balance resource sharing by ensuring that all technologies within the frequency band have good coexistence and high performance...|$|R
30|$|The 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) proposes {{two main}} {{mechanisms}} for ensuring fair coexistence of LTE with WiFi and other technologies in the unlicensed spectrum: <b>Listen</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Talk</b> (LBT) and Carrier Sensing and Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) [11]. LBT is a random access {{scheme based on}} carrier sensing and backoff rules similar to WiFi. On the other hand, CSAT is a TDM-based scheduled scheme which is used by LTE-U small cell when no clear channel is found after long-term carrier sensing. The scheme defines a time (duty) cycle where the BS transmits in {{a fraction of the}} cycle and remains silent in the remaining duration. Therefore, when CSAT is used, TDM-based nodes (LTE network) coexist with random access-based nodes (WiFi or other technologies) on the same channel. The scope of these works is different from our work because (1) CSAT addresses coexistence in downlink LTE-U small cell, while our work is focused on an uplink scenario which is more challenging due to effects of hidden terminal problem and especially when the network has to cope with high traffic demands and (2) our work focuses on the design of a scheduling algorithm for the scheduled nodes, while in 3 GPP standards, details of scheduling algorithms are not provided because it is a vendor-specific problem [12]. Furthermore, the existing traditional scheduling algorithms for radio networks may not be appropriate to be applied directly in the scenario, since they were never designed with coexistence problem in mind.|$|R

We report herein on extensions to a popular network simulator, known as ns- 3, to model such coexistence. To our knowledge, this simulator is novel in two important ways. First, it is presently the only freely available simulator for coexistence studies, and as open source software, it offers new opportunities for reproducible research and collaborative model development. Second, we {{are not aware of}} other simulators with similar wireless models that allow full system studies to be conducted, such as performance evaluation of upper-layer protocols in a coexistence environment. We illustrate the value of a system simulator by describing a simulation campaign for the indoor scenario designed by 3 GPP RAN 1 using new ns- 3 models for Release 13 LTE <b>Listen</b> <b>Before</b> <b>Talk</b> (LBT) techniques, intended for fair coexistence with Wi-Fi. LBT models have been widely simulated at the link and physical layer by many companies in 3 GPP RAN 1. We first show that we are able to tune the scenario to reproduce similar performance metrics to those reported in the literature. We then extend the simulations by adding TCP to the file transfers and explore the different behaviour observed. Our initial study reveals that there remain many open questions about how LBT should be implemented to achieve good coexistence properties, and that a broader scope of implementation issues, traffic models, and fuller system models should be studied further before drawing final conclusions on the LBT coexistence performance.

40|$|The {{vision of}} the Internet of Things (IoT) to {{interconnect}} and Internet-connect everyday people, objects, and machines poses new challenges {{in the design of}} wireless communication networks. The design of medium access control (MAC) protocols has been traditionally an intense area of research due to their high impact on the overall performance of wireless communications. The majority of research activities in this field deal with different variations of protocols somehow based on ALOHA, either with or without <b>listen</b> <b>before</b> <b>talk,</b> i. e., carrier sensing multiple access. These protocols operate well under low traffic loads and low number of simultaneous devices. However, they suffer from congestion as the traffic load and the number of devices increase.

In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing MAC solutions for the IoT, describing current limitations and envisioned challenges for the near future. Motivated by those, we identify a family of simple algorithms based on distributed queueing (DQ), which can operate for an infinite number of devices generating any traffic load and pattern. A description of the DQ mechanism is provided and most relevant existing studies of DQ applied in different scenarios are described in this paper. In addition, we provide a novel performance evaluation of DQ when applied for the IoT. Finally, a description of the very first demo of DQ for its use in the IoT is also included in this paper...|$|R

Analyzing the impact of operating LTE in the unlicensed band on the performance of Wi-Fi and devising solutions to minimize such an impact have been the goals of a considerable amount of work carried out by the research community, standardization bodies and telecom operators. In this paper, we first present a basic overview of Wi-Fi and LTE, which serves the purpose of illustrating why the fair coexistence of the two technologies in the unlicensed band is an issue. Basically, since LTE has been designed to operate in licensed bands, the centralized scheduling performed by LTE eNodeBs saturates all the channel resources, while Wi-Fi stations refrain from transmitting if the channel is sensed busy.

40|$|One of {{the most}} contested {{questions}} in spectrum policy is whether bands of spectrum left as unlicensed will fall victim to {{the tragedy of the}} commons. Advocates of increased unlicensed spectrum often downplay what enforcement measures are necessary to minimize interference and to prevent the tragedy of the commons problem. Even imposing spectrum etiquette requirements in addition to the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s equipment certification program will fail to address this concern effectively, as the development of such measures - e. g., the requirement that devices <b>listen</b> <b>before</b> they <b>talk</b> - does not ensure that they will be followed. Indeed, if there are incentives for parties to cheat on the rules that prevent tragedy of the commons-type results, some cheaters are likely to emerge and thereby undermine the promise of new and innovative technologies that use unlicensed spectrum. Although the threat posed by cheaters does not undermine completely the commons model of spectrum management, it does underscore that the proponents of that model have focused almost entirely on one half of the issue. To date, these proponents have argued that unlicensed bands can facilitate technological innovation and more efficient uses of spectrum than would a purely private property-like approach. But they have not explained what the FCC should do to prevent deviation from the protocols (or certified equipment) that maximize the effectiveness of shared uses of spectrum. Moreover, tragedy of the commons-type concerns are not merely theoretical ones, as the experience with the citizen 2 ̆ 7 s band (CB) radio demonstrated how interference caused by unauthorized uses (such as amplifiers) can undermine a previously popular use of spectrum. In the current environment, technologies like a Wi-Fi Hog, which can take control of and fully exploit a public wi-fi network - or malicious jamming by hackers - pose the same danger. This paper both underscores the need for and develops the analytical framework to guide a new model of spectrum policy for unlicensed bands. In particular, it argues that the FCC should develop a regulatory program that integrates the efforts of end user groups, interested companies, private standard setting bodies, and its own enforcement tools. In one incarnation of this approach, the FCC can ask a private body (such as the IEEE) to report back on its progress in addressing a particular issue - understanding that it may have to pick up where the body left off (either in setting or enforcing the interference mitigation measure). To be sure, we recognize that this spectrum management strategy will require considerable effort to implement, but we believe that a failure to address these issues would be the Achilles 2 ̆ 7 heel of the commons model of spectrum management...|$|R
