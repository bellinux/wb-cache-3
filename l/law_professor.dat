40|$|Many <b>law</b> <b>professors</b> use the Socratic {{method in}} their teaching, presumably because wisdom {{is to be}} found in the {{questions}} themselves. Yet, no <b>law</b> <b>professors</b> use the Socratic method in their writing. Why? I believe it is a wise marketing decision by <b>law</b> <b>professors.</b> Anyone off the street can read a law review article and receive its wisdom for free. If <b>law</b> <b>professors</b> disclosed their full Socratic wisdom in law reviews, no one would come to law school, and <b>law</b> <b>professors</b> would be unemployed. By withholding their Socratic questions from <b>law</b> reviews, <b>law</b> <b>professors</b> have forced students to pay tuition for them. Until now, that is. I have never hesitated to offer all of my wisdom to my readers, so this article will be as profound as my actual, live, Socratic teaching. This is a first, something that has never before been written. I have included in this article some of the most profound questions I have developed in my many years as a legal educator. Feel free to learn from them without paying any tuition...|$|R

40|$|<b>Law</b> <b>professors</b> {{routinely}} accuse {{each other}} of making politically biased arguments in their scholarship. They have also helped produce a large empirical literature on judicial behavior that finds that judicial opinions sometimes reflect the ideological biases {{of the judges}} who join them. Yet no one has used statistical methods to test the parallel hypothesis that legal scholarship reflects the political biases of <b>law</b> <b>professors.</b> This paper provides the results of such a test. We find that, at a statistically significant level, <b>law</b> <b>professors</b> at elite <b>law</b> schools who make donations to Democratic political candidates write liberal scholarship and <b>law</b> <b>professors</b> who make donations to Republican political candidates write conservative scholarship. These findings raise questions about standards of objectivity in legal scholarship...|$|R

5|$|Bartholdi was {{inspired}} by a French <b>law</b> <b>professor</b> and politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples. Because of the post-war instability in France, work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.|$|E

5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of <b>Law</b> <b>professor</b> William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
