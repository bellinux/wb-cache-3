25|$|Over 95% of {{cross-border}} trade {{within the region}} is unofficial and undocumented, carried out by pastoralists trading livestock. The unofficial trade of <b>live</b> <b>cattle,</b> camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to {{other countries in the}} Horn and the wider Eastern Africa region, including Somalia and Djibouti, generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure). This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allow disease to spread more easily across national borders.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} sales of {{veterinary}} antibacterial agents between 10 European countries. Methods: Data were compiled from published reports from the 10 countries. We express the usage as amounts sold of veterinary antibacterial agents per country and year, in mg active substances per kg biomass of slaugh-tered pigs, poultry and cattle plus estimated biomass of (<b>live)</b> dairy <b>cattle</b> for the corresponding year. Results: The usage, as expressed in mg antibacterial drugs sold/kg biomass of slaughtered pigs, poultry and <b>cattle</b> and of (<b>live)</b> dairy <b>cattle,</b> varied from 18 to 188 mg/kg. The relative proportion of the various classes of antibacterial agents sold varied considerably. Conclusions: The apparent wide variations in the usage of veterinary antimicrobial agents between countries cannot be explained by differences in the animal species demographics alone.

The vessel continued to Manchester docks for further unloading, where she was met by the Lord Mayor, accompanied by a band and a festive crowd. This successful voyage did much to encourage other shipowners to use the new port.
