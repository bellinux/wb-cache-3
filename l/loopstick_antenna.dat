50|$|In electronics, a {{ferrite core}} {{is a type}} of {{magnetic}} core made of ferrite on which the windings of electric transformers and other wound components such as inductors are formed. It is used for its properties of high magnetic permeability coupled with low electrical conductivity (which helps prevent eddy currents). Because of their comparatively low losses at high frequencies, they are extensively used in the cores of RF transformers and inductors in applications such as switched-mode power supplies, and ferrite <b>loopstick</b> <b>antennas</b> for AM radio receivers.|$|R
50|$|Ferrites {{that are}} used in {{transformer}} or electromagnetic cores contain nickel, zinc, and/or manganese compounds. They have a low coercivity and are called soft ferrites. The low coercivity means the material's magnetization can easily reverse direction without dissipating much energy (hysteresis losses), while the material's high resistivity prevents eddy currents in the core, another source of energy loss. Because of their comparatively low losses at high frequencies, they are extensively used in the cores of RF transformers and inductors in applications such as switched-mode power supplies and <b>loopstick</b> <b>antennas</b> used in AM radios.|$|R
50|$|In modern radios, a ferrite {{loop antenna}} is used, {{consisting}} of fine wire wound on a ferrite rod. Litz wire {{is often used}} to reduce skin effect losses. The ferrite rod increases the magnetic permeability, allowing the physically small antenna to have a larger effective area. Other names for this type of antenna are <b>loopstick</b> <b>antenna,</b> ferrite rod antenna, ferrite rod aerial, Ferroceptor, or ferrod antenna.|$|E
50|$|Instead of triangulation, {{a second}} dipole or {{vertical}} antenna can be electrically {{combined with a}} loop or a <b>loopstick</b> <b>antenna.</b> Called a sense antenna, connecting the second antenna changes the combined radiation pattern to a cardioid, with a null in only one, less precise direction. The {{general direction of the}} transmitter can be determined using the sense antenna, and then disconnecting the sense antenna returns the sharp nulls in the loop antenna pattern, allowing a precise bearing to be determined.|$|E
50|$|Because {{at these}} {{frequencies}} atmospheric noise is {{far above the}} receiver signal to noise ratio, inefficient antennas much smaller than a wavelength {{can be used for}} receiving. For reception at frequencies below 1.6 MHz, which includes long and medium waves, loop antennas are popular because of their ability to reject locally generated noise. By far the most common antenna for broadcast reception is the ferrite-rod antenna, also known as a <b>loopstick</b> <b>antenna.</b> The high permeability ferrite core allows it to be compact enough to be enclosed inside the radio's case and still have adequate sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Normal {{low cost}} {{consumer}} grade DCF77 receivers solely {{rely on the}} amplitude-modulated time signals and use narrow band receivers (with 10 Hz bandwidth) with small ferrite <b>loopstick</b> <b>antennas</b> and circuits with non optimal digital signal processing delay and can therefore only be expected to determine {{the beginning of a}} second with a practical accuracy uncertainty of ± 0.1 second. This is sufficient for radio controlled low cost consumer grade clocks and watches using standard-quality quartz clocks for timekeeping between daily DCF77 synchronization attempts, as they will be most accurate immediately after a successful synchronization and will become less accurate from that point forward until the next synchronization.|$|R
25|$|The antenna {{converts}} {{the energy}} in the electromagnetic radio waves to an alternating electric current in the antenna, which {{is connected to the}} tuning coil. Since in a crystal radio all the power comes from the antenna, {{it is important that the}} antenna collect as much power from the radio wave as possible. The larger an antenna, the more power it can intercept. Antennas of the type commonly used with crystal sets are most effective when their length is close to a multiple of a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves they are receiving. Since the length of the waves used with crystal radios is very long (AM broadcast band waves are 182-566 m or 597–1857ft. long) the antenna is made as long as possible, from a long wire, in contrast to the whip <b>antennas</b> or ferrite <b>loopstick</b> <b>antennas</b> used in modern radios.|$|R

5000|$|Other names include <b>loopstick</b> <b>antenna,</b> ferrod, and ferrite-rod antenna. [...] "Ferroceptor" [...] is {{an older}} {{alternative}} {{name for a}} ferrite rod aerial, particularly used by Philips where the ferrite core would be called a [...] "Ferroxcube" [...] rod (a brand name acquired by Yageo from Philips in the year 2000). The short terms ferrite rod or ‘loop-stick’ sometimes refers to the coil-plus-ferrite combination that {{takes the place of}} both an external antenna and the radio’s first tuned circuit, or just the ferrite core itself (the cylindrical rod or flat ferrite slab).|$|E
50|$|Receiving antennas do {{not have}} to be as {{efficient}} as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal to noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise. The noise floor in the receiver is far below the noise in the signal, so antennas small in comparison to the wavelength, which are inefficient and produce low signal strength, can be used. The most common receiving antenna is the ferrite <b>loopstick</b> <b>antenna</b> (also known as a ferrite rod aerial), made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it. This antenna is small enough that it is usually enclosed inside the radio case. In addition to their use in AM radios, ferrite antennas are also used in portable radio direction finder (RDF) receivers. The ferrite rod antenna has a dipole reception pattern with sharp nulls along the axis of the rod, so that reception is at its best when the rod is at right angles to the transmitter, but fades to nothing when the rod points exactly at the transmitter. Other types of loop antennas and random wire antennas are also used.|$|E
50|$|Later, RDF {{sets were}} {{equipped}} with rotatable ferrite <b>loopstick</b> <b>antennas,</b> {{which made the}} sets more portable and less bulky. Some were later partially automated {{by means of a}} motorized antenna (ADF). A key breakthrough was the introduction of a secondary vertical whip or 'sense' antenna that substantiated the correct bearing and allowed the navigator to avoid plotting a bearing 180 degrees opposite the actual heading. The U.S. Navy RDF model SE 995 which used a sense antenna was in use during World War I. After World War II, there were many small and large firms making direction finding equipment for mariners, including Apelco, Aqua Guide, Bendix, Gladding (and its marine division, Pearce-Simpson), Ray Jefferson, Raytheon, and Sperry. By the 1960s, many of these radios were actually made by Japanese electronics manufacturers, such as Panasonic, Fuji Onkyo, and Koden Electronics Co., Ltd. In aircraft equipment, Bendix and Sperry-Rand were two of the larger manufacturers of RDF radios and navigation instruments.|$|R
50|$|A radio {{clock is}} a clock that {{automatically}} synchronizes itself {{by means of}} government radio time signals received by a radio receiver. Many retailers market radio clocks inaccurately as atomic clocks; although the radio signals they receive originate from atomic clocks, they are not atomic clocks themselves. Normal low cost consumer grade receivers solely rely on the amplitude-modulated time signals and use narrow band receivers (with 10 Hz bandwidth) with small ferrite <b>loopstick</b> <b>antennas</b> and circuits with non optimal digital signal processing delay and can therefore only be expected to determine {{the beginning of a}} second with a practical accuracy uncertainty of ± 0.1 second. This is sufficient for radio controlled low cost consumer grade clocks and watches using standard-quality quartz clocks for timekeeping between daily synchronization attempts, as they will be most accurate immediately after a successful synchronization and will become less accurate from that point forward until the next synchronization.Instrument grade time receivers provide higher accuracy. Such devices incur a transit delay of approximately 1 ms for every 300 kilometres (186 mi) of distance from the radio transmitter. Many governments operate transmitters for time-keeping purposes.|$|R
