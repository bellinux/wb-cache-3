40|$|Not least due {{to recent}} {{terrorist}} attempts to attack aviation traffic or mass transportation systems, e. g. in London in July 2005 or in August 2006, the secure and sensitive detection of <b>liquid</b> <b>explosives</b> is of major concern.

Besides a short look at state-of-the-art explosives detection techniques, this presentation addresses e. g.

It is a <b>liquid</b> <b>explosive</b> with properties similar to nitroglycerin but more stable to heat. It is prepared by nitration of trimethylolethane (metriol). It does not induce headaches.|$|E
5000|$|Xylitol pentanitrate is a {{rarely used}} <b>liquid</b> <b>explosive</b> {{compound}} with extremely high viscosity formed by completely nitrating xylitol, a sugar alcohol compound with five carbon atoms.

However, during synthesis lower nitrated forms are produced, which produce a viscous liquid mixture {{that is hard to}} purify.|$|E
50|$|A notable {{characteristic}} of the Astrolite family is its remarkable degree of persistency for a <b>liquid</b> <b>explosive</b> compound. Due to its low volatility, it can be dispersed in an area, be absorbed by the soil, and still retain its full explosive characteristics {{for a period of}} approximately 4 days. This has shown to be true even when rainwater had also been absorbed by the soil.|$|E

Detonations occur in both conventional solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>explosives,</b> as well as in reactive gases. The velocity of detonation in solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>explosives</b> is much higher than that in gaseous ones, which allows the wave system to be observed with greater detail (higher resolution).|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} design {{had called for}} a 100 kg warhead, but because of accuracy concerns it was replaced with a much larger one (306 kg) based on a <b>liquid</b> <b>explosive.</b> The idea {{was to create a}} large blast area effect amidst the enemy bomber stream, which would conceivably bring down several airplanes for each missile deployed. For daytime use the operator would detonate the warhead by remote control.|$|E
50|$|The M15 {{mine was}} {{originally}} intended to be fitted with the M600 single-impulse fuze, which contained a glass ampoule of <b>liquid</b> <b>explosive.</b> Unfortunately, the M600 fuze was sensitive to temperature variations and therefore unreliable. For example, freezing temperatures made the mine inert as the liquid froze, whereas temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius could cause the fuze to detonate spontaneously. Just as problematic {{was the fact that}} M600 fuzes were inherently unstable, making them dangerous to handle, particularly after having been kept in storage for some time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{specific}} group of homemade <b>liquid</b> high <b>explosives</b> in relation to aviation security. The sudden and irrefutable focus on homemade <b>explosives</b> and <b>liquid</b> <b>explosives</b> in particular after the 2006 defeated attacks in London, made the aviation security community realize that the security system and equipment were not optimized for this particular kind of substances. It is now generally accepted that hydrogen peroxide based <b>liquid</b> <b>explosives</b> (HPOM) pose a terrorist threat to civil aviation. It is easy, cheap and relatively safe to make effective HPOM IEDs. It is a high explosive of increasing and serious interest to terrorists and has been used recently. In comparison to the well-know 'old fashioned' military and commercial <b>explosives,</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>explosives</b> and in particular HPOM {{are more difficult to}} detect because they are less well-defined by their chemical properties (poorly controlled manufacturing), they contain no nitrogen and their physical appearance (like shape, color) is poorly defined an hardly unique, in part because they need a container like a bottle or can or plastic bag etc. Both Europe and USA introduced late 2006 the so-called liquids-regulations at checkpoints to counter this threat, but this may become harder to sustain in the future. Several countries contribute to the search for and development of existing and new technological solutions with the aim to relieve the measures and increase the effectiveness of the overall security process. The final solution would be to be able to detect <b>liquid</b> <b>explosives</b> inside a carry-on bag at operational speed. This is not yet possible with current technology. A second best option for the time being would be to be able to detect <b>liquid</b> <b>explosives</b> inside the 11 plastic bag. Even now existing technologies (like X-ray transmission, trace and chemical) can help in detection, sometimes after tuning to the specific problem. Inspection of single bottles or the 11 plastic bag offers the best options today, but detection inside the carry-on bag in operation (speed requirements, false alarm behavior) offers prospects too. Further development in combination with ongoing research into the characteristics of homemade <b>explosives,</b> specifically <b>liquid</b> <b>explosives,</b> will probably make the balance shift towards technological solutions in the near future. © 2008 Springer Science + Business Media B.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to present the main {{features}} of detonation generation and propagation in liquid explosives. Most of the results are related to Nitromethane (NM) since it is the most studied <b>liquid</b> <b>explosive.</b> Depending on whether they are homogeneous or heterogeneous, explosive media have specific detonic properties which are related to different heat release mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract. A multidimensional {{implementation}} of DSD, formulated {{with the level}} set method, is applied to track the propagation of a detonation wave in a heterogeneous explosive consisting of an array of inert cylindrical obstacles with a <b>liquid</b> <b>explosive</b> in the interstitial space. With the Huygens assumption, the average detonation velocity through the explosive is less than that for the <b>liquid</b> <b>explosive</b> alone, due to the increased path length. When the normal detonation velocity is assumed to depend on front curvature, there is an additional, smaller reduction in the detonation velocity, which depends on the cylinder material. The detonation velocity deficits obtained in the computations are of the same order as those observed experimentally for a heterogeneous explosive consisting of a packed bed of spherical inert beads saturated with sensitized nitromethane. The DSD computations {{are relevant to the}} experimental results in the large-bead limit in which the pore dimension is large enough to support the propagation of discrete detonation wavelets in the interstitial liquid between the beads...|$|E
