The initial versions {{were based on the}} last Stange version but with the ribbon attached through the clutch pins instead of a bar (this led to damage of the ribbon). A small number of sterling silver versions were made, marked with 925.

25|$|The regular {{international}} passport has incorporated biometric features since 1998. The {{biometric passport}} contains an 8 kB microchip which {{was developed by}} a Malaysian technology firm, IRIS Corporation. In February 2010, the passport was updated {{to comply with the}} ICAO standard on biometric and machine-readable passports, while the pages in a 32-page passport was increased to 48 pages. Beginning April 2013, the passport underwent another round of updating by introducing a polycarbonate sheet that holds the passport bearer's information. The information is <b>laser</b> <b>engraved</b> into the polycarbonate sheet for added security, including a hologram mini-photo of the passport bearer. With this the passport now holds 50 pages instead of 48 pages. There is no more 64 pages option since 2011.|$|E

The {{so-called}} <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> technology, {{by using}} laser processing system and {{computer numerical control}} technology to complete the automated processing in the pavilion, and the pavilion is where this series of processing technology completed.

When the laser intensity reaches a certain power, the material produces strong nonlinear absorption of the laser, resulting in multiphoton ionization injury and produce plasma, and finally lead to the internal injury of transparent material {{which looks like a}} white point [1, 2]. By the use of this principle <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> can form screen inside the glass and combined with 3 D imaging technology it can carve out the 3 D pattern. On this basis, this technology is applied to the core of the <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> pavilion.

In the present study, <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> was applied to denim fabric in order to evaluate its effect on some colour-related properties. Two laser process variables, namely, resolution and pixel time, were studied thoroughly. The laser power density was enhanced in response to the increased level of pixel time and resolution. Under the effect of high laser power density, a paler surface appearance was achieved for the denim fabrics with the largely reduced K/Ssum values, indicating that the amount of dye present on the denim fabric was decreased significantly.
