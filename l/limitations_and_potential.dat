"The {{economics}} profession {{appears to}} have been unaware of the long build-up to the current worldwide financial crisis and to have significantly underestimated its dimensions once it started to unfold. In our view, this lack of understanding is due to a misallocation of research efforts in economics. We trace the deeper roots of this failure to the profession's focus on models that, by design, disregard key elements driving outcomes in real-world markets. The economics profession has failed in communicating the limitations, weaknesses, and even dangers of its preferred models to the public. This state of affairs makes clear the need for a major reorientation of focus in the research economists undertake, {{as well as for the}} establishment of an ethical code that would ask economists to understand and communicate the <b>limitations</b> <b>and</b> <b>potential</b> misuses of their models." ...|$|E

Through the eyes of her Midkemian slave Kevin of Zūn, she begins to see the flaws, contradictions, <b>limitations</b> <b>and</b> <b>potential</b> of the Tsurani Empire—and finds Kevin, a love like she has never known. The Minwanabi plot to kill the Acoma military commander Keyoke and then force Mara into a campaign in the faraway desert lands of Dustari. Thanks to Mara's cho-ja warriors and Kevin's innovative [...] "barbarian" [...] tactics, Mara and her ally the Lord of the Xacatecas manage to overcome a Minwanabi ambush and secure an unprecedented treaty with the desert chiefs of Dustari. Tasaio is exiled for his failure against Mara, but ascends to Lord of the Minwanabi after Desio's death in battle on the barbarian world of Midkemia. Mara barely survives an extended overnight attack orchestrated by Tasaio and a second attack sent by powerful members of the Omechan clan who seek the office of Warlord in the Imperial capital of Kentosani. Mara continues acquiring allies and favors toward an endgame she knows is unavoidable. Her hopes of freeing Kevin from slavery are dashed by a proclamation from the Emperor Ichindar forbidding such practice, and soon she is even forced to relinquish Kevin for an Imperial exchange of prisoners with the Barbarian King. However, Mara manages to influence Ichindar and manipulate the High Council to thwart Tasaio's ambitions and destroy the Minwanabi once and for all. Mara—pregnant with Kevin's child—is named Servant of the Empire.|$|E

Regarding the research methodology, it can be classified as applied and exploratory. The data used is secondary and was used a qualitative analysis technique. To identify <b>limitations</b> <b>and</b> <b>potentials,</b> a mapping of SHP production chain structure was done at national scale. Five stages that compound the production chain were studied: natural resources; generation; transmission; distribution; and marketing.
