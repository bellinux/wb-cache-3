5|$|Due {{to several}} taxonomic {{revisions}} by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, {{the number of}} recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008. With continuing cytogenetic and molecular genetic research, as well as ongoing field studies, particularly with cryptic species such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> growing. However, the rapid {{increase in the number}} of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the species concept used, conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection. Others favor a more thorough analysis.|$|E

25|$|The {{drainage}} {{system in the}} area was rearranged and steepened as the Waterpocket Fold was uplifted. Larger streams, such as the Fremont River, were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with the uplift by downcutting into the Waterpocket Fold faster. Other streams, such as Sand Creek, changed their course by flowing parallel to the fold and cutting into less resistant formations. Yet other streams tried {{to keep up with}} the uplift by carving slot canyons only to later change course, leaving their canyons literally high and dry. A total of 7,000feet (2,100m) of overlying Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediment has been removed by erosion in the area.|$|E

Subjects that are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be able to trade are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> choose <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their item, as predicted when reference points are determined by expectations, but not when reference points are determined by the status quo or when preferences are reference-independent.

25|$|The Young Henry's affairs took a {{turn for}} the worse in 1182. He fell out with William Marshal, the leader of his tournament mesnée. The unknown author of L'Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal {{suggests}} that Marshal's disgrace was because he had indulged in a clandestine affair with Queen Margaret. David Crouch, one of the Marshal's principal modern biographers, argues that the charge against William was actually one of lèse majesté, brought on by Marshal's own arrogance and greed. By this account, the charge of adultery was only introduced in the Life of William Marshal as a distraction from the real charges, of which he was most probably guilty. Though the Young King sent his wife early in 1183 to the French court, it was done most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her safe in the impending war with his brother, Richard, rather than because she was in disgrace.|$|E

She won by [...] lengths with a final time of 1:59.77, against an {{otherwise}} all-male field of nine other horses, including 2014 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Bayern. She won in the third-fastest winning {{time in the history}} of the race, and with the second-largest margin of victory, behind the 2013 win of Game On Dude. Hughes said: [...] "She’s the first horse who has made me feel lucky to be her owner." [...] Mandella quipped, [...] "We didn’t think she would do it quite like that. We thought it was the girls she was picking on." [...] and added later, [...] "I think the boys pissed her off. I think they were telling sexist jokes on the backside." [...] After the race, her [...] connections announced that she would train with the goal of running in the Breeders' Cup Classic.

500|$|Crackdown was {{critically}} acclaimed by game critics who praised the open-world approach. [...] Reviewers commented highly on the graphics of the game, both in its detailed city and large draw distances, and the cel-like shading of the characters; 1UP said that [...] "it's just better {{to let a}} game approach reality on its own aesthetic terms than to go hyperrealistic". X-Play stated, [...] "It's an absolute blast to play, and arguably {{one of the finest}} superhero games made thus far", and IGN stated, [...] "Overall the thrill of jumping like a mutant kangaroo from rooftop to rooftop is unrivaled!" [...] The co-op play feature over Xbox Live was well received; Eurogamer wrote, [...] "Being able to pick and leap into any of your friends' or even complete strangers' cities is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> that buzz going though", and 1UP agreed, remarking [...] "That it represents the best, if not the first, online multiplayer sandbox game on a console is just gravy". Reviews did critique the lack of any appreciable story within the game, and how short the core game itself may be; IGN argued [...] "Crackdown won't last that long, it's uneven, and the story and the music are weak sauce".|$|E

Subjects that are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be able to trade are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> choose <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their item.

500|$|Arnold Judas Rimmer Bsc Ssc ("Bronze {{swimming}} certificate" [...] and [...] "Silver swimming certificate"), {{played by}} Chris Barrie, was the second-lowest ranking {{member of the}} crew while they were all alive. He is a fussy, bureaucratic, neurotic coward who, by failing to replace a drive plate properly, is responsible for the Red Dwarf cadmium II accident that kills the entire crew (including himself). Nevertheless, Holly chose him to be the ship's one available hologram because he considered him the person most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Lister sane. From the Series III episode [...] "Timeslides" [...] onwards, the timeline of the crew is adjusted and Rimmer's death is newly attributed to a moment in which he hits a cardboard box filled with explosives. During Series VII, Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become the new Ace Rimmer. Along with the Red Dwarf ship and its crew, Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots. He comes face to face with Death {{at the end of the}} series, whom he kicks in the groin. From the Back to Earth specials onwards, he is once again the original hologram Rimmer, with no explanation as to why he returned from being Ace or what happened to the human Rimmer from series VIII.|$|E
2500|$|At about 11:00 on 7 May, the Admiralty radioed another {{warning to}} all ships, {{probably}} {{as a result}} of a request by Alfred Booth who was concerned about Lusitania: [...] "U-boats active in southern part of Irish Channel. Last heard of twenty miles south of Coningbeg Light Vessel". Booth and all of Liverpool had received news of the sinkings, which the admiralty had known about by at least 3:00 that morning. Turner adjusted his heading northeast, not knowing that this report related to events of the previous day and apparently thinking submarines would be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> to the open sea, so that Lusitania would be safer close to land. At 13:00 another message was received, [...] "Submarine five miles south of Cape Clear proceeding west when sighted at 10:00am". This report was entirely inaccurate as no submarine had been at that location, but gave the impression that at least one submarine had been safely passed.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, both Cicero and Quintilian are {{sources for}} the story that Scopas, the Thassalian nobleman, refused to pay Simonides in full for a victory ode that featured too many decorative references to the mythical twins, Castor and Pollux. According {{to the rest of}} the story, Simonides was celebrating the same victory with Scopas and his relatives at a banquet when he received word that two young men were waiting outside to see him. When he got outside, however, he discovered firstly that the two young men were nowhere to be found and, secondly, that the dining hall was collapsing behind him. Scopas and a number of his relatives were killed. Apparently the two young men were the twins and they had rewarded the poet's interest in them by thus saving his life. Simonides later benefited from the tragedy by deriving a system of mnemonics from it (see The inventor). Quintilian dismisses the story as a fiction because [...] "the poet nowhere mentions the affair, although he was not in the least <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> silent on a matter which brought him such glory..." [...] This however was not the only miraculous escape that his piety afforded him. There are two epigrams in the Palatine Anthology, both attributed to Simonides and both dedicated to a drowned man whose corpse the poet and some companions are said to have found and buried on an island. The first is an epitaph in which the dead man is imagined to invoke blessings on those who had buried the body, and the second records the poet's gratitude to the drowned man for having saved his own life—Simonides had been warned by his ghost not to set sail from the island with his companions, who all subsequently drowned.|$|E

Riksdag spent much cash on conscripting new formations, and as the Russian tsar Boris Godunov gave the Swedes much {{financial}} help, <b>likely</b> attempting <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> both Sweden and the Commonwealth busy during the Time of Troubles.

50|$|The motor/adaptor {{complex is}} {{regulated}} by calcium ion levels. At high concentrations, calcium ions arrest mitochondrial transport by binding Miro, causing the complex to detach from the organelle. Considering that physiological {{factors such as}} activation of glutamate receptors in dendrites, action potentials in axons, and neuromodulators may elevate calcium ion levels, this regulatory mechanism <b>likely</b> serves <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> mitochondria in such areas to provide calcium ion buffering and active export and, thus, maintain homeostasis.|$|R

40|$|Paternal {{uncertainty}} {{has shaped}} human behavior both in evolutionary and cultural terms. There {{has been much}} research investigating parenting {{as a function of}} genetic relatedness to the child, with a focus on male behavior, but the nature of these sex differences is hard to evaluate. We devised a hypothetical scenario that was as similar as possible for men and women to test whether, even in such a scenario, sex differences would remain strong. Participants were presented with the discovery that a child that s/he believed to be theirs was not carrying their own genes. Irrespective of sex, participants (n = 1007) were more upset when the baby was not genetically related to them than when the child was genetically related but the sex gamete was not from a chosen donor. Women were more upset than men in both scenarios, but were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the baby.

40|$|In a globalised economy, new {{graduates}} often look overseas for job opportunities; indeed, it {{is considered}} {{a rite of passage}} for many Australians to do so.

Given the many universal qualities of librarianship, a job exchange creates the ideal scenario in which work and travel can be combined. There are benefits for both the individual and employer. Links are forged internationally, commonalities found and differences explored. It is an opportunity to broaden both personal and professional horizons, without having to leave a continuing position.
