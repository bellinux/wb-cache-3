In this work, we improve on the following points the seminal work as in ermentrout-cowan: 79 b,bressloff-cowan-etal: 01. We consider the problem of describing mathematically the spontaneous activity of V 1 by combining several important experimental observations including 1) {{the organization of the}} visual cortex into a spatially periodic network of hypercolumns structured around pinwheels, 2) the difference between short-range and long-range intra-cortical connections, the first ones being rather isotropic and producing naturally doubly-periodic patterns by Turing mechanisms, the second one being patchy and 3) the fact that the Turing patterns spontaneously produced by the short-range connections and the network of pinwheels have similar periods. By analyzing the Preferred Orientation (PO) map, we are able to classify all possible singular points of the PO maps (the pinwheels) as having symmetries described by a small subset of the wallpaper groups. We then propose a description of the spontaneous activity of V 1 using a classical voltage-based neural field model that features isotropic short-range connectivities modulated by non-isotropic long-range connectivities. A key observation is that, with only short-range connections and because the problem has full translational invariance in this case, a spontaneous doubly-periodic pattern generates a 2 -torus in a suitable functional space which persists as a flow-invariant manifold under small perturbations, hence when turning on the long-range connections. Through a complete analysis of the symmetries of the resulting neural field equation and motivated by a numerical investigation of the bifurcations of their solutions, we conclude that the branches of solutions which are stable over an extended set of parameters are those corresponding to patterns with an hexagonal (or nearly hexagonal) symmetry. The question of which patterns persist when turning on the long-range connections is answered by 1) analyzing the remaining symmetries on the perturbed torus and 2) combining this information with the Poincaré-Hopf theorem. We have developed a numerical implementation of the theory that has allowed us to produce the patterns of activities predicted by the theory, the planforms. In particular we generalize the contoured and non-contoured planforms predicted by previous authors ermentrout-cowan: 79 b,bressloff-cowan-etal: 01 and predict the existence of mixed contoured/non-contoured planforms. We also found that these planforms {{are most likely to be}} time evolving. Cet article étend de manière significative le travail séminal de Ermentrout-Cowan: 79 b, bressloff-Cowan-al: 01. Dans ce travail, nous améliorons les points suivants dans la théorie Ermentrout-Cowan: 79 b, bressloff-Cowan-al: 01. Nous considérons le problème de décrire mathématiquement l’activité spontanée de V 1 en combinant plusieurs observations expérimentales importantes, notamment 1) l'organisation du cortex visuel selon un réseau spatiallement périodique d'hypercolonnes structurées autour de pinwheels, 2) la différence entre les connexions intra-corticales à courtes et longues portées: les premières étant plutôt isotropes et produisant naturellement des activités doublement périodiques par le mécanisme de Turing, les secondes étant anisotropes et 3) le fait que les activités corticales générées par les connexions locales et le réseau de pinwheels ont des fréquences spatiales similaires. Nous utilisons les groupes de pavages pour produire une classification des cartes d'orientations préférées. Nous proposons ensuite une description de l’activité spontanée de V 1 en utilisant un modèle de champ neuronaux avec des connections locales isotropes modulées par des connections à longue portée non-isotropes. Une observation clé est que le tore invariant (conséquence des symétries de translation) produit par le système avec seulement <b>les</b> <b>connections</b> locales, persiste lorsque <b>les</b> <b>connections</b> longues distances sont introduites de façon perturbative. Ainsi, nous analysons d’abord le cas des connections locales et montrons que seules les branches de solutions stationnaires à symétrie presque hexagonale sont stables pour un ensemble de paramètres de mesure non nulle. La persistance de ces solutions est ensuite analysée en utilisant les symétries résiduelles du système et en combinant cette information avec le théorème de Poincaré-Hopf. Des simulations numériques montrent ensuite que les cas les plus simples analysés de façon théorique sont les seuls qui apparaissent numériquement. En conclusion, nous généralisons les hallucinations prédites par les travaux précédents Ermentrout-Cowan: 79 b, bressloff-Cowan-al: 01. Nous avons également constaté que ces nouvelles hallucinations sont plus susceptibles d’évoluer dans le temps...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The current paper {{deals with}} {{filtering}} problems where the observation process, conditioned on the unknown signal, is an elliptic diffusion in a differentiable manifold. Precisely, the observation model {{is given by}} a stochastic differential equation in the underlying manifold. The main new idea {{is to use a}} <b>Le</b> Jan-Watanabe <b>connection,</b> instead of a usual Levi-Civita connection, in performing the operation of antidevelopment (both connections can be constructed from a stochastic differential equation as in the observation model). The following results are obtained. First, it is shown that antidevelopment reduces the original filtering problem to a classical one, i. e. an additive white noise model. Second, a new form of the Zakai and filtering equations is derived which has a structure very similar to that of classical equations. Currently, there are few well understood general numerical solution methods for filtering problems with observation in a manifold. Reduction to classical filtering problems seems desirable as it allows proven existing numerical methods for classical problems to be applied immediately. In view of practical implementation of this approach, the paper also gives an explicit pathwise construction of the antidevelopment...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} locally {{stationary}} processes contains theory and methods about {{a class of}} processes that describe random phenomena whose fluctuations occur both in time and space. We consider three aspects of locally stationary processes {{that have not been}} explore in the already vast literature on these nonstationary processes. We begin by studying the asymptotic efficiency of simple hypotheses tests via large deviation principles. We establish the analogues of classic results such as Stein's lemma, Chernoff bound and the more general Hoeffding bound. These results are based on a large deviation principle for the log-likelihood ratio test statistic between two locally stationary Gaussian processes which is obtained and presented in the first chapter. In the second chapter we consider the Bayesian estimation of two parameters of a locally stationary process: trend and time-varying spectral density functions, respectively. Under smoothness conditions on the latter function, we obtain the asymptotic normality and efficiency, with respect to a broad class of loss functions, of Bayesian estimators. In passing we also show the asymptotic equivalence between Bayesian estimators and the maximum likelihood estimate. Our concluding fourth chapter explores the time-varying spectral density estimation problem {{from the point of view}} of Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments. We establish that the estimation of a time-varying spectral density function can be asymptotically construed as a white noise problem with drift. This result is based on <b>Le</b> Cam's <b>connection</b> theorem. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R

40|$|The {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) {{is the first}} processing structure in the olfactory system; it receives direct sensory input from the olfactory sensory neurons and relays processed information to the olfactory cortex and other structures in the brain. The axons from sensory neurons expressing the same olfactory receptor molecule converge onto the same discrete structure {{on the surface of}} the OB, termed glomerulus. Each glomerulus forms a modular unit which confines the single apical tufts of about 25 mitral cells (MC). Understanding how intraglomerular cells communicate with one another will therefore improve our understanding of how the glomerular network processes the olfactory signal. Using whole cell recordings from mitral cells in acute mouse {{olfactory bulb}} slices I have examined various modes of MC-MC communication. MC dendrites are known to release glutamate from their apical and lateral dendrites which has been shown to depolarize their own presynaptic dendrites (self excitation; SE). I first examined the anatomical locus of SE by investigating its properties in intact versus dendrotomized (those with amputated tufts) MCs. While dendrotomized cells lacked detectable self excitatory potentials I have found that all morphologically identified MCs with an intact apical tuft displayed robust SE. This form of SE was mediated by Ca 2 + permeable AMPA receptors as it was completely blocked by their specific antagonist Naphthyl-acethyl-spermine (NAS). Electrical coupling between MCs was assessed by injecting large hyperpolarizing pulses. I have found that MCs that shared the same glomerulus were always bidirectionally coupled via gap junctions though the magnitude of coupling (CC) was variable across different pairs. Action potentials evoked in one MC also results in EPSP-like depolarizations in intraglomerular partners (lateral excitation; LE). In contrast to the previously mentioned forms of communication LE was not reliably present in all intraglomerular pairs. I have found LE is mainly a unidirectional form of communication, although both bidirectional and complete lack of measurable LE can also occur. The magnitude of LE varied independently of that of other forms of communication (CC and SE amplitude) as well as with morphometric characteristics of the apical tufts (number of nodes, surface area). Despite being dependent on glutamate receptors LE contrasted with SE in that it was insensitive to NAS and therefore is a distinct form of chemical communication that relies on different AMPA receptor subtypes. I have also investigated whether in vivo-relevant patterns of theta-burst stimulation (TBS) could evoke significant long-term changes in LE efficacy similar to those observed at axo-dendritic connections. This form of communication showed a unique sensitivity to TBS in that the polarity and amplitude of change in efficacy was linearly and inversely correlated with the initial strength of <b>LE.</b> Small <b>connections</b> were enhanced while larger ones depressed, the change in efficacy was accompanied with a change in paired pulse ratio consistent with a presynaptic change in release probability after TBS. All together these data show that SE, electrical coupling and LE are independent forms of intraglomerular communication which might serve independent roles on glomerular processing. While SE and electrical coupling have been shown to facilitate spike synchrony across the network, LE provides the OB with a means of modulating intraglomerular excitation in response to in vivo -relevant patterns of activity...|$|R
