50|$|A rubber-soled, canvas-top Jungle boot {{was issued}} {{during the war}} for use by {{soldiers}} in the tropical and jungle environments typically encountered in the China-Burma-India (CBI) and the Pacific theaters. The 10th Mountain Division's troopers occasionally wore the Mountain Boot, a low-quarter brown <b>leather</b> <b>boot</b> with a square toe and rocker-type sole, though this boot was phased {{out in favor of}} the Type III Combat Boot {{in the last year of}} the war. In 1944, the M-44 Combat <b>Boot,</b> a high-top <b>leather</b> <b>boot</b> with full laces was adopted for service, but for the duration it was primarily worn by soldiers on stateside duty.|$|R
5|$|Football kit {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} {{since the early}} days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, knickerbockers and heavy rigid <b>leather</b> <b>boots.</b> In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for fans to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as a ponytail. The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely fitting for her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with a dusty leather jacket, and high <b>leather</b> <b>boots.</b> Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: she is always equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E

The IDF Air Corps has a dress uniform consisting of a pale blue shirt with dark blue trousers. Similarly, while most IDF soldiers are issued black <b>leather</b> <b>boots,</b> certain units issue reddish-brown <b>leather</b> <b>boots</b> for historical reasons— the paratroopers, combat medics, Nahal and Kfir Brigades, {{as well as some}} SF units (Sayeret Matkal, Oketz, Duvdevan, Maglan, and the Counter-Terror School). Women were also formerly issued sandals, but this practice has ceased.|$|E

25|$|Black safety boots, {{identical}} to those worn by United States Coast Guard personnel with their Operational Dress Uniform, are worn with the NWU Type I. Brown or tan boots can be authorized for wear with the Type II and III, though black is the standard color for sailors located in the contiguous United States. Boots come in two versions: black smooth <b>leather</b> <b>boots,</b> and black suede no-shine boots for optional wear while assigned to non-shipboard commands.|$|E
25|$|Modes {{of dress}} for Skverer Hasidim are {{generally}} {{similar to those}} of other Hasidic groups, especially that of Vizhnitz, Belz, and Klausenberg.

Married men also wear fur hats called shtreimels, and knee-high <b>leather</b> <b>boots</b> known as shtievl.|$|E

25|$|The {{shirt was}} long-sleeved and neatly folded up, unlike the short-sleeved {{versions}} adopted for the no. 3 dress of the SPF. The sleeves were rolled {{down when the}} sun sets, and rolled up again when the sun rises. GC troopers continued to wear aluminium badges of rank, which were worn on the right sleeve, 11.5 centimetres below the right shoulder strap. Constables wore aluminium bars at the outer edges of the shoulder straps. The dark blue trousers were secured by the two-pronged black leather Garrison Belt, and completed by standard-issued black <b>leather</b> <b>boots.</b>|$|E
25|$|Engineer boots, {{also known}} as engineer's boots or {{engineering}} boots, are an American type of <b>leather</b> <b>boots.</b> Their lace-less, rugged construction has made them popular among motorcycle riders. Originally developed in the 1930s for firemen working on steam locomotives, the boots gained substantial popularity in the post–World War II era among a burgeoning motorcycling culture. They became popular symbols of teenage rebellion in the 1950s and a common component of greaser wear. They were later adopted by skinheads and punks in the 1970s. By the 2010s, engineer boots were being popularly worn for fashion purposes, especially by non-traditional customers such as women, young urban professionals, and hipsters.|$|E
25|$|The Prose Merlin {{contains}} many instances of Merlin's shapeshifting. He {{appears as a}} woodcutter with an axe about his neck, big shoes, a torn coat, bristly hair, and a large beard. He is later found in the forest of Northumberland by a follower of Uther's disguised as an ugly man and tending a great herd of beasts. He then appears first as a handsome man {{and then as a}} beautiful boy. Years later, he approaches Arthur disguised as a peasant wearing <b>leather</b> <b>boots,</b> a wool coat, a hood, and a belt of knotted sheepskin. He is described as tall, black and bristly, and as seeming cruel and fierce. Finally, he appears as an old man with a long beard, short and hunchbacked, in an old torn woolen coat, who carries a club and drives a multitude of beasts before him.|$|E

25|$|Infantry uniforms were {{basically}} redesigned Zhongshan suits. Puttees were standard for soldiers and officers alike since the primary mode of movement for NRA troops was by foot. Troops were also issued sewn field caps. The helmets {{were the most}} distinguishing characteristic of these divisions. From the moment German M35 helmets (standard issue for the Wehrmacht {{until late in the}} European theatre) rolled off the production lines in 1935, and until 1936, the NRA imported 315,000 of these helmets, each with the Blue Sky with a White Sun emblem of the ROC on the sides. These helmets were worn by both elite German-trained divisions and regular Central Army divisions. Other helmets include the Adrian helmet, Brodie helmet and later M1 helmet. Other equipment included straw shoes for soldiers (cloth shoes for Central Army), leather shoes for officers and <b>leather</b> <b>boots</b> for high-ranking officers. Every soldier was issued ammunition, ammunition pouches or harness, a water flask, combat knives, food bag, and a gas mask.|$|E
25|$|Joshua Slocum {{was born}} in the family's farm house in Mount Hanley and learned to read and write at the nearby Mount Hanley School. His {{earliest}} ventures on the water were made on coastal schooners operating out of the small ports such as Port George and Cottage Cove near Mount Hanley along the Bay of Fundy. When Joshua was eight years old, the Slocombe family moved from Mount Hanley to Brier Island in Digby County, {{at the mouth of the}} Bay of Fundy. Slocum's maternal grandfather was the keeper of the lighthouse at Southwest Point there. His father, a stern man and strict disciplinarian, took up making <b>leather</b> <b>boots</b> for the local fishermen, and Joshua helped in the shop. However, the boy found the scent of salt air much more alluring than the smell of shoe leather. He yearned for a life of adventure at sea, away from his demanding father and his increasingly chaotic life at home among so many brothers and sisters.|$|E
25|$|Until 1914 the Kuban Cossack Host wore a {{full dress}} uniform {{comprising}} a dark grey/black kaftan (knee length collarless coat) with red shoulder straps and braiding {{on the wide}} cuffs. Ornamental containers (czerkeska) which had originally contained single loading measures of gunpowder for muzzle-loading muskets, were worn on the breasts of the kaftans. The kaftan had an open front, showing a red waistcoat. Wide grey trousers were worn, tucked into soft <b>leather</b> <b>boots</b> without heels. Officers wore silver epaulettes, braiding and ferrules, the latter in their czerkeskas. This Caucasian national dress was also worn by the Ural Cossack Host but in different facing colors. Tall black fur hats were worn on all occasions with red cloth tops and (for officers) silver lace. A white metal scroll was worn {{on the front of}} the fur hat. A whip was used instead of spurs. Prior to 1908, individual cossacks from all Hosts were required to provide their own uniforms (together with horses, Caucasian saddles and harness). On active service during World War I the Kuban Cossacks retained their distinctive dress but with a black waistcoat replacing the conspicuous red one and without the silver ornaments or red facings of full dress. A black felt cloak (bourki) was worn in bad weather both in peace-time and on active service.|$|E
