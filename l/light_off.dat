5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting <b>light</b> <b>off</b> the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{began to}} advance near Losheim before the artillery barrage lifted, preparing {{to cross the}} front line {{as soon as it}} ended. They marched under the glow of massive searchlights, bouncing <b>light</b> <b>off</b> the clouds. The armor was located farther back, near Blankenheim, Germany. At 8:00, as the sun rose, the American platoon heard explosions and guns around Buchholz Station and Losheimergraben to the east and north where the 3rd and 1st Battalions of the 394th Infantry Division was located. The 55 soldiers of U.S. 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 14th Cavalry Group was initially ordered south to help protect Manderfeld, but shortly afterwards were redirected to join the active battle near Buchholz Station. They withdrew from the village and left without contacting the I&R platoon. This left the platoon as the only unit in the sector and without armor support.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping <b>light</b> <b>off</b> the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E

25|$|At {{the scale}} of the {{wavelength}} of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). The glint of <b>light</b> <b>off</b> water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of the uses of gated imaging tubes. Because of {{the combination of the}} very high speeds at which a gated tube may operate and their light amplification capability, gated tubes can record specific portions of a beam of light. It is possible to capture only the portion of light reflected from a target, when a pulsed beam of light is fired at the target, by controlling the gating parameters. Gated-Pulsed-Active Night Vision (GPANV) devices are another example of an application that uses this technique. GPANV devices can allow a user to see objects of interest that are obscured behind vegetation, foliage, and/or mist. These devices are also useful for locating objects in deep water, where reflections of <b>light</b> <b>off</b> of nearby particles from a continuous light source, such as a high brightness underwater floodlight, would otherwise obscure the image.|$|E

Minor beach erosion was reported at Nantucket. Overall damage was estimated at $150,000, which was considered minor. The storm's passage was considered beneficial, due to adding sand to beaches and providing favorable rains.|$|E

Setups for the band started off simplistic compared to what they later became in the band's career. with pyrotechnics, giant screens, and elaborate stage designs. By the Rolling Stones American tour of 1969, the band began to fill large halls and arenas, such as The Forum in Inglewood, California. They were also using more equipment, such as lighting rigs and better sound equipment compared to the clubs. The 1969 tour is considered a [...] "great watershed tour" [...] by Mick Jagger {{due to the fact}} that they [...] "started hanging the sound and therefore hanging the lights".

Three Lockheed Hudsons of Coastal Command conducted a patrol at three positions. The first, named [...] "Stopper", [...] maintained surveillance between sunset and first <b>light</b> <b>off</b> the port of Brest. The Second, [...] "Line SE" [...] watched due north of the port, and the third, [...] "Habo", covered the area between Le Havre and Boulogne. The patrols lasted between 01:00 hours to dawn on 11 February. At 19:25 on the 11 February, [...] "Stopper" [...] took off as usual but was intercepted by a Bf 110 night fighter of NJG 1. The Hudson evaded the Bf 110, but its ASV equipment was unserviceable. The aircraft headed back to St. Eval, landing at 20:40. Its replacement headed over the same area, reaching the location at 22:38. It was too late, during the interlude, Ciliax and his ships had slipped their moorings. The “Line SE” Hudson should have picked up the German fleet, but in a repeat incident the ASV failed at 20:55. At 21:50 all attempts to repair it failed, and the Hudson returned to base. No replacement took its place. Everything now depended on [...] "Habo", but Ciliax’s luck held. At dawn, mist began to form over the airfield at Thorney Island.

500|$|The initial assault did {{not proceed}} entirely to plan. [...] The {{crossing}} {{was set to}} begin at 10:40pm but was delayed by the late arrival of several assault craft. Additionally several explosive charges on the eastern {{bank of the river}} designed to clear a path through landmines and the 'bund' failed to detonate. [...] The 2nd Battalion The Gloucestershire Regiment then discovered several Buffaloes were inoperative and so the companies were forced to cross separately and not in one assault as planned. Despite this the four companies of 2nd Battalion began crossing separately, their way illuminated by Monty's moonlight (searchlights reflecting their <b>light</b> <b>off</b> the clouds overhead) and Bofors guns firing coloured tracer in the direction of attack. [...] Under the cover of heavy machine guns and mortars the first company reached {{the west bank of the}} IJssel at 11.15pm. [...] They began to take their objectives in the face of light opposition along the riverbank, sustaining 32 casualties. [...] After a slight delay they secured the landing area for the prefabricated Bailey bridge and at 12.50am The Royal Canadian Engineers began floating the components of the bridge into position. [...] The second wave; the 2nd Battalion The South Wales Borderers crossed the river under heavy artillery fire. [...] Their assault craft drifted downstream in the crossing, but once ashore they advanced rapidly into the city. However their advance stalled and the 1/7th Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment, originally due to cross in Phase 3, was sent over the river to support them. [...] By 7:00am the 2nd Battalion The Essex Regiment were across the river and by 8:45am the RCE had set up a pontoon ferry to begin moving tanks of the Ontario Regiment across as well.|$|E
