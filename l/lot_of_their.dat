If the cricket boards of two individual countries reach an agreement, they can play more than two series. If a team doesn’t want to travel to a particular country for a bilateral series due to security reasons, then, by the mutual agreement of the respective boards, that series can be shifted to a neutral venue such as United Arab Emirates or any other country where the facilities are good.

[...] After the main shooting ended, producers decided to do a re-shoot to explain the [...] "Dwigt" [...] situation clearly and concisely.

500|$|This {{crossover}} occurred {{through the}} Simpsons episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (1995).

Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 {{in the morning to}} get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> great work.

[...] Reiss stated that he was a [...] "little upset" [...] by Groening's actions and that [...] "this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch The Critic all over it." [...] Jean added [...] "What bothers me about all of this, is that now people may get the impression that this Simpsons episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed." [...] On Fox, The Critic was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten Internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD.|$|E

500|$|Former showrunners Jean and Reiss {{had left}} to produce their own series, The Critic, along with The Simpsons co-creator Brooks. The Critic was a {{short-lived}} animated series that revolved around the life of movie critic Jay Sherman. For the second season of The Critic, Brooks {{cut a deal with}} the Fox network to have the series switch over. The episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] was pitched by Brooks, who had wanted a crossover that would help launch The Critic on Fox, and he thought having a film festival in Springfield would {{be a good way to}} introduce Sherman. In addition, Jean and Reiss returned to produce two episodes ("A Star is Burns" [...] and [...] "'Round Springfield") with the staff of The Critic, to relieve some of the stress on The Simpsons writing staff. Groening felt that the crossover was a thirty-minute advertisement for another show and blamed Brooks, calling it an attempt to get attention for one of his unsuccessful shows. After unsuccessful attempts to get the episode pulled, he decided to go public with his concerns shortly before the episode aired and had his name removed from the credits. In response, Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al [...] and Mike [...] were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 in the morning to get it right.

500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we {{had to figure out}} how to make a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance between male and female characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. When they said no and we asked why, they wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E
