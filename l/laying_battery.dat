40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{selected}} enterprise indicators of laying were analyzed {{in terms of}} the impact of a hen housing system. For commercial egg production in the enterprise the laying hybrid Lohmann brown-LITE hen has been used since 2011. A total of 16 laying turns were included for the observation during the period of 20112014. Due to the sufficient number of data a nine-month laying batch has been chosen. The highest average number of eggs laid by one hen for the observation period was achieved in the Profit-Tier Layer Cage System by Big Dutchman (257. 0 pcs.). In the <b>Laying</b> <b>battery</b> Cage System by Kovobel the number of eggs was by 1. 3 pcs lower (255. 7 pcs). The lowest number of eggs was set down for laying hens kept in a cage free systems (249. 2 pcs). It was 7, 8 pcs and 6, 5 pcs lower respectively than with laying hens housed in the cage systems by Big Dutchman and Kovobel. The highest average intensity of laying for 9 -month laying period was found in the cage system by Big Dutchman (93. 9 %). In the cage system by Kovobel company it was 1. 0 % lower (92. 9 %). The intensity of laying at a cage free system amounted to 89. 2 % pcs. It was 4. 7 % and 3. 7 % respectively lower than when housed in the cage systems by Big Dutchman and Kovobel. For laying hens kept in a cage system the average consumption per hen in a day, for the observed period, was found out to be lower 117. 6 g for the cage system by Big Dutchman company and 117. 4 g for Kovobel. The highest average feed consumption showed 121. 5 g with laying hens kept in a cage free system. The average mortality of laying hens during the observed period was 0. 64 %...|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>laying</b> <b>batteries</b> {{increased}} gradually, {{becoming the}} dominant method somewhat before {{the integration of}} the egg industry in the 1960s. The practice of battery cages was criticized in Ruth Harrison's landmark book Animal Machines, published in 1964. In 1990, North and Bell reported that 75% of all commercial layers in the world and 95% in the United States were kept in cages.|$|R

40|$|Responses {{of laying}} {{chickens}} to diets based on formulations following different feeding standards were investigated during March to July months under Bangladesh conditions. One hundred twenty Shaver 579 layers of 35 -week old were distributed randomly into 5 diet groups with 3 replicates, each of 8 birds. The birds were reared in <b>laying</b> <b>batteries</b> with 2 birds in each cage and 8 birds in four adjacent cages constituted a replicate. The feeding standards that constituted different dietary treatments were: Shaver 579 (1997), {{recommended by the}} breeders of the birds considered in this study; NRC (National Research Council, 1994); INSP (International Nutrition Standards for Poultry, 1983) recommended for Asiatic regions; ISI (Indian Standard Institute, 1992) and BSTI (Bangladesh Standard Testing Institute, 1988). Other cares and management were identical for birds of all diet groups. The feeding trial was conducted for 15 weeks and the data on laying performance and egg quality were evaluated. Evaluation of results revealed that responses of laying birds fed diet based on formulation following the recommendation for Shaver 579 (control) were at least equal to or better than those of other standards during March to July months under Bangladesh conditions...|$|R
40|$|THE use of wire cages {{for housing}} lay-ing birds has gained {{widespread}} favor in recent years, {{particularly in the}} western, southwestern and southern parts of the United States. Most commercial producers have a very definite preference for either cage or floor housing, but have very little experimental support of their preference. Go we (1955), in a test involving seven White Leghorn strains, found average hen-housed production of 176 eggs for birds housed on the floor compared with 154 eggs for comparable birds in <b>laying</b> <b>batteries.</b> The response differences among strains were inconsistent. Miller (1956) reported more eggs, better feed efficiency, and lower mortality for birds housed in individual cages as compared to conventional floor housing. These differences were consistent for the three strains and crosses of egg pro-duction stocks tested. Lowry et al. (1956) reported on a four year study of cages versus floor manage-ment involving 2, 176 birds. In this study full sisters, all of one White Leghorn strain, were divided equally into cage and floor housing. The floor pullets usually {{were found to be}} superior in performance for the mean production of survivors while the caged pullets showed significantly lower mortality and heavier eggs. Consistently significant differences could not be demon...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{development}} of bone fragility in caged layers {{is a major}} problem in the poultry industry. The incidence of bone breakage during the processing of spent hens substantially reduces the economic return from these birds. In two trials, a commercial strain of White Leghorn pullets was used. In each trial, one-day-old chicks were divided into two groups, wing banded, and placed in floor pens. The treated group received fluoridated water at levels up to 300 ppm. The control group of birds received only well water. At 20 weeks of age, birds from each group were trans-ferred to one of two <b>laying</b> <b>batteries.</b> One battery of birds received fluoridated water (100 ppm F). The other served as a control and those birds received only well water. Production rate, egg weight, shell strength, shell thickness, and Haugh units were determined for each bird. At 45 weeks of age, the humeri and tibiae were removed, and bone strength, percentage of bone ash, and fluoride content were determined. Combined data from both trials showed that the fluoride treatment increased the breaking strength of humeri from 6. 86 to 13. 35 kg and that of tibiae from 6. 61 to 13. 10 kg. The fluoride treatment also significantly (P<. 01) increased the percentage of bone ash. Egg quality and rate of production were not reduced by the fluoride treatment...|$|R
50|$|In 1863, the Union Army began {{operations}} {{designed to}} reduce Fort Sumter, so that the U.S. Navy could enter Charleston harbor and capture the city. On July 10, Federal forces on Folly Island, South Carolina, crossed Light House Inlet and landed by boats on {{the southern tip of}} Morris Island. Two unsuccessful infantry assaults were made against Fort Wagner, the second assault being led by the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. On July 21, General Quincy Adams Gillmore began <b>laying</b> down <b>batteries</b> for the bombardment of Fort Sumter and Fort Wagner. Later a battery was created for guns to bombard the city of Charleston.|$|R

50|$|Setting sail {{from his}} base at Litochoro, {{on the night}} of , Votsis led his vessel into the harbour of Thessaloniki, at the time still held by the Ottomans. Inside the harbour, which was {{protected}} by minefields and coastal <b>batteries,</b> <b>lay</b> a handful of Ottoman vessels: aside from four tugboats, the only warship was the old ironclad Feth-i Bülend. The ship had been disarmed and converted into a barracks ship, with its weaponry having been used to reinforce the coastal batteries.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, {{there was the}} noble street, quite eighty feet in width in its narrowest part, and {{gradually}} expanding as you looked towards the bay, until it opened into an area of {{more than twice that}} width, at the place called the Bowling-Green. [13] Then came the Fort, crowning a sharp eminence, and overlooking everything in that quarter of the town. In the rear of the Fort, or in its front, taking a water view, <b>lay</b> the <b>batteries</b> that had been built on the rocks which form the south-western termination of the island. Over these rocks, which were black and picturesque, and over the batteries they supported, was obtained a view of the noble bay, dotted here and there with some speck of a sail, or possibly with some vessel anchored on its placid bosom. Of the two rows of elegant houses, most of them of brick, and with very few exceptions principally of two stories in height, it is scarcely necessary to speak, as there are few who have not heard of, and formed some notion of Broadway; a street that all agree is one day to be the pride of the western world.|$|R
60|$|Vera Cruz, at {{the time}} of which I write and up to 1880, was a walled city. The wall {{extended}} from the water's edge south of the town to the water again on the north. There were fortifications at intervals along the line and at the angles. In front of the city, and on an island half a mile out in the Gulf, stands San Juan de Ulloa, an enclosed fortification of large dimensions and great strength for that period. Against artillery of the present day the land forts and walls would prove elements of weakness rather than strength. After the invading army had established their camps out of range of the fire from the city, batteries were established, under cover of night, far {{to the front of the}} line where the troops <b>lay.</b> These <b>batteries</b> were intrenched and the approaches sufficiently protected. If a sortie had been made at any time by the Mexicans, the men serving the batteries could have been quickly reinforced without great exposure to the fire from the enemy's main line. No serious attempt was made to capture the batteries or to drive our troops away.|$|R
25|$|Following an {{elaborate}} defensive plan proposed by Letellier, the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet was anchored in a horseshoe formation, in three lines, extending from Navarino fort {{to the southern}} tip of Sphacteria island, where the Ottoman shore <b>battery</b> <b>lay.</b> The front line consisted of the ships of the line and large frigates; the second line contained the remaining frigates and larger corvettes; the third consisted of the remaining smaller vessels. The idea was that the smaller vessels could fire through the gaps in the frontline, whilst being protected by the larger ships from Allied attack. On the ends of the horseshoe were stationed corvettes and fireships. The latter could be towed by boats into position covered by the smaller corvettes and shore batteries.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the {{batteries}} on {{and near the}} island began in mid-August 1861, directed by Captain Asa B. Gray. He began by <b>laying</b> out a <b>battery</b> on the Tennessee shore about [...] above the island. This battery, known as Battery No. 1 or the Redan Battery, commanded the approach to the bend. Vessels coming down the river {{would have to move}} directly toward its guns for more than a mile. It was not very effective, as it was sited on low ground subject to flooding. Almost as soon as work was started, however, the attention of Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk was diverted to the capture and fortification of Columbus. Work continued at Island No. 10, but it was not regarded as urgent and so was denied both equipment and workers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnimal welfare {{issues may}} involve {{different}} species and require decision-makers to compare welfare across species. Up to now applied ethologists have largely ignored questions involving cross-species comparisons. This paper discusses {{the question whether}} cross-species comparisons about animal welfare can be provided with a scientific basis, i. e., based on scientific arguments. The arguments pro and contra are reviewed. Conceptually, cross-species comparisons should be possible, but at the explanatory and operational levels substantial problems remain to be resolved. An example is given comparing the welfare of <b>laying</b> hens in <b>battery</b> cages, conventionally housed fattening pigs, conventionally housed broilers and dairy cattle at pasture.

2500|$|The fortifications {{that had}} been set up around the harbor were well-suited to repel attacks from the ocean.

These formed the first or outer defensive ring. A second ring consisted of Fort Johnson and Battery Glover on James Island, and Fort Ripley and Castle Pinckney in the harbor, and finally the White Point Battery (Battery Ramsay) at the southern end of the city itself. A third ring, formed of several batteries on the Cooper and Ashley Rivers and in Charleston, was intended to protect against land assault on the city. In all, they mounted some 385 land-based guns.|$|R
2500|$|S Beach lay {{inside the}} Straits {{at a small}} break in the cliffs {{at the north end}} of Morto Bay, [...] from V Beach.

No defences had been prepared in the area and only one Ottoman platoon guarded the beach, with another platoon [...] inland. Four trawlers, each with six lifeboats in tow, made slow progress against the Dardanelles current and mine sweepers in the Straits but Ottoman artillery on the Asiatic shore fired at other targets and the trawlers came inshore without incident and when the trawlers reached the shallows the tows were cast off. The landing party of three companies of the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers covered by the battleship Cornwallis made landfall under fire from the Ottoman platoon in a trench half-way up the cliff. Two companies landed on the beach and one escaladed the cliffs at Eski Hissarlik point to capture de Tott's Battery.|$|R

40|$|For {{several years}} {{concern has been}} raised both by the public and by {{scientists}} {{about the impact of}} battery cage housing on welfare of <b>laying</b> hens. Thus, <b>battery</b> cages have been criticized for increasing incidence of feather damage, foot lesions, and brittle bones [l, 2, 3, 41. Moreover, conventional cages restrict the movements of hens and prevent certain be-haviors, such as laying eggs in nests, scratching and bathing in sand or soil, and roosting on perches [5]. Aviaries have been identified as a possible alternative to cages, providing the hens with a larger total available area and access to nests, litter, and perches [6, 7. Al-though production may be similar in aviaries and cages, it has often been reported to be lower in the former, since the risk for feather pecking, cannibalism, disease, and parasites increases [S, 9, lo]. Egg quality, as cracks or dirties, may also be affected since the hens do not lay the eggs on a wire floor in a cage, but instead on the wire floors of the tiers, in a nest, or even in the litter [lo]...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} system using cages {{is a highly}} polemical issue in Europe, because of the space restriction imposed to laying hens. It is considered that the cage system might compromise important comfort movements, welfare and egg quality. This study evaluated egg quality and welfare of two strains of hens housed in a conventional system (<b>battery</b> <b>laying</b> cages) or litter system with nest and perches, and submitted to heat stress or comfort conditions. Two groups of 20 birds (10 Hy-line W 36 and 10 Hy-line Brown) were submitted to two environmental conditions (26 °C and 60 % RH or 35 °C and 70 % RH) and two housing systems (cages or litter) in the early production phase. Egg quality was analyzed based on egg weight, eggshell thickness, specific gravity, and Haugh units. Yolk and shell contamination by Salmonella sp was also assessed. A significant (p< 0. 05) reduction in quality parameters was observed in eggs produced by laying hens under heat stress, mainly in the birds housed in cages...|$|R

40|$|Ensuring good {{environmental}} {{conditions of the}} poultry houses can be costly for the farmers, but without it losses due to poor bird health and performance due to poor air quality can be much more detrimental to net returns. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the variations in air quality in various areas inside the laying hen houses. Ten houses with <b>laying</b> hen conventional <b>battery</b> cages were measured for O 2, H 2 S, CO, NH 3, temperature, relative humidity, CO 2, airflow and luminance. The results of the physical measures showed that temperatures in the houses were between 15. 31 – 25. 6 °C, the relative humidity 48. 03 - 81. 12 %, while the luminance rarely exceeded 8 lux. As for the gasses, the values for NH 3 rarely exceeded 8 ppm, although at some measuring points it reached 26 ppm. O 2 was generally at 20. 9 %, and the levels of CO 2 were very low. No presence of H 2 S and CO was detected. In this study it was concluded that the measurement of the air quality in a house can vary depending of the places this measures are taken. Multiple measurement points are important because they may make the staff aware of the problems connected to low ventilation and culmination of harmful gases. The air quality in different positions in the houses is of great importance not only for the animal welfare, but also for the safety of the staff...|$|R
6000|$|Amid such {{tales of}} ancient {{tradition}} I had from Macleod and his lady the courteous offer of the haunted apartment of the castle, about which, as a stranger, I might be supposed interested. Accordingly, I took possession of {{it about the}} witching hour. Except perhaps some tapestry hangings, and the extreme thickness of the walls, which argued great antiquity, nothing {{could have been more}} comfortable than the interior of the apartment; but if you looked from the windows the view was such as to correspond with the highest tone of superstition. An autumnal blast, sometimes driving mist before it, swept along the troubled billows of the lake, which it occasionally concealed, and by fits disclosed. The waves rushed in wild disorder on the shore, and covered with foam the steep piles of rock, which, rising from the sea in forms something resembling the human figure, have obtained the name of Macleod's Maidens, and in such a night seemed no bad representatives of the Norwegian goddesses called Choosers of the Slain, or Riders of the Storm. There was something of the dignity of danger in the scene; for on a platform beneath the windows <b>lay</b> an ancient <b>battery</b> of cannon, which had sometimes been used against privateers even of late years. The distant scene was a view of that part of the Quillan mountains which are called, from their form, Macleod's Dining-Tables. The voice of an angry cascade, termed the Nurse of Rorie Mhor, because that chief slept best 'in its vicinity, was heard from time to time mingling its notes with those of wind and wave. Such was the haunted room at Dunvegan, and as such it well deserved a less sleepy inhabitant. In the language of Dr. Johnson, who has stamped his memory on this remote place, [...] "I looked around me, and wondered that I was not more affected; but the mind is not at all times equally ready to be moved." [...] In a word, it is necessary to confess that, of all I heard or saw, the most engaging spectacle was the comfortable bed, in which I hoped to make amends for some rough nights on ship-board, and where I slept accordingly without thinking of ghost or goblin till I was called by my servant in the morning.|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that serotonin (5 -HT) and dopamine stimulate prolactin (PRL) release, either {{directly from the}} pituitary gland or by acting through Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP), was investigated by assessing the role of hypothalamic dopamine and 5 -HT in the control of broodiness and PRL release in Cantonese native chicken breed called the Yuehuang hen. A second objective {{was to assess the}} involvement of hypothalamic VIP in the control of broodiness and PRL release by using dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonists respectively. In Experiment 1, two hundred <b>laying</b> hens from <b>battery</b> cages were transferred to floor pens with nest boxes to induce broodiness. Starting from the second day after the onset of broodiness, sixty hens were allotted into groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively, corresponding to chlorpromazine-treated (n = 20), cyproheptadine-treated (n = 20) and control (n = 20) groups. Blood samples were collected from the wing veins of hens in each group on days 2, 5, 9, 14 and 19 respectively after the onset of broodiness for radioimmunoassay of PRL and Luteinizing Hormone (LH). Results indicate that in the drug treated hens which terminated broodiness, the concentration of plasma PRL decreased significantly (p 0. 05) changes between the chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine treated hens. Within the chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine treated hens, there were significant (p 0. 05) changes throughout the blood sampling periods. Sixteen (80 %) chlorpromazine treated hens terminated broodiness on an average of 4. 6 ± 0. 8 days but four hens (20 %) did not. However, thirteen (65 %) cyproheptadine treated hens terminated broodiness on an average of 2. 3 ± 0. 2 days while seven (35 %) did not. In Experiment 2, sixty animals were used but their management and drug treatment for group 1 (n = 10) and group 2 (n = 10) were the same as described in Experiment 1. Group 3 (n = 10) served as the control. Eight hens each from groups 1, 2 and 3 were randomly selected for immunohistochemical studies. On day 7 after the onset of broodiness, hypothalamus from anaesthetized chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine treated hens as well as control hens were processed for immunohistochemical localization of VIP neurons in the hypothalamus of Yuehuang hens. Morphological observation showed a higher number of VIP neurons in the hypothalamus of the control hens. A few VIP neurons which were very faint were also found in the hypothalamus of the chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine treated hens. Results of these studies indicate a relationship between the functions of dopamine and 5 -HT neurons in the hypothalamus and reproductive activities in domestic hens. They are consistent with the view that hypothalamic dopamine and 5 -HT are regulators of PRL release and that using drugs which inhibit the functional activities of these neurotransmitters can inhibit PRL release to disrupt broodiness in hens to maintain egg production. The results also indicate a causal relationship between hypothalamic VIP and changes in PRL secretion associated with reproductive activities in domestic hens. This is consistent with the view that VIP might be an important hypothalamic PRL releasing neuropeptide and also indicate that VIP might be a physiological PRL regulatory hormone in domestic hens...|$|R
