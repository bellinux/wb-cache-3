40|$|ABSTRACT. Order is a {{necessary}} condition for anything the hu-man mind is to understand. Arrangements such as the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> or building, a set of tools, a display of merchandise, the ver-bal exposition of facts or ideas, or a painting or piece of music are called orderly when an observer or listener can grasp their overall structure and the ramification of the structure in some detail. Or-der makes it possible to focus on what is alike and what is differ-ent, what belongs together and what is segregated. When noth-ing superfluous is included and nothing indispensable left out, one can understand the interrelation of the whole and its parts, as well as the hierarchic scale of importance and power by which some structural features are dominant, others subordinate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- We {{consider}} {{here the}} extent to which urban form (the physical <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>city,</b> e. g., sprawl versus density) can impact urban air pollution. Using available satellite-based measurements for 89 urban areas throughout the globe, we compare air pollution (nitrogen dioxide) and spatial patterns of built-up areas (urban contiguity and compactness). Linear regression modeling reveals that, as expected, air pollution is proportional to city size (urban population and land area), with larger cities having worse pollution. Consistent with Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory, the relationship between air pollution and per capita GDP is an inverse “U ” shape. Rising income increases pollution levels for per capita GDP less than US$ 23, 000 but decreases pollution for per capita GDP greater than US$ 23, 000. Urban form – specifically, a combined measure of urban contiguity and compactness – has a modest but statistically significant impact on air pollution levels: at mean values for independent variables, 1 -standard-deviation increase in contiguity/compactness yields a 14 % reduction in air pollution concentrations. This finding indicates that striving to increase the contiguity/compactness of a city may reduce air pollution, an encouraging result. Additional work is necessary to confirm these initial findings.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} poster is two-fold. On the one hand, we try to {{demonstrate}} that the axial lines constitute a true skeleton, compared to the medial axes, in capturing a hierarchical structure of open space of any urban environment, being the image of the city. On the other hand, we will demonstrate our research prototype AxialGen (www 2. hig. se/~bjg/AxialGen/) in order to show how the axial lines can be automatically generated for exploring the image of the city. Underlying Kevin Lynch’s findings about the image of the city (Lynch 1960) is two novel concepts: city legibility and city imageability. City legibility refers to the ease with which people understand the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>city.</b> All city objects such as buildings, streets, places, and squares (or whatever parts/units within a city) (Figure 1 a) demonstrate a hierarchical structure. That is, a majority of city objects can be filtered out, while only a minority of them is kept in our minds. Imageability is the quality of a physical object that gives an observer a strong, vivid image. The level of city legibility depends on the existence of imageable elements, and on their spatial configuration, i. e., the legibility comes from the imageability – a quality of the physical urban environment. We will illustrate and demonstrate that a city can also be perceived from another perspective by concentrating in open space of the city, i. e., the space between buildings or street blocks (Figure 1 b) ...|$|E
40|$|Civil Engineering {{and fluid}} {{mechanics}} are two fields {{that are not}} usually put into the same category. In reality however, {{many of the problems}} faced in Civil Engineering are caused by fluids. For example: the mixing of pollutants; the scouring of riverbanks; and the undesired oscillations of bridges and buildings caused by wind. Whilst it is possible to simulate the interactions of fluids and structures, it is computationally expensive and as a consequence experiments are needed to validate simplified models. Undertaking these experiments is not trivial, and unavoidably, the data collected can contain outlier / anomalous data points. There have been many attempts to create algorithms to automatically remove and or replace these outliers, the most effective or which are based on modal decomposition techniques. In fluid mechanics there are two prominent modal decomposition techniques. These are Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which can be use to determine modes that are spatially independent, and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) which can be used to determine modes that are temporally independent. The majority of the previous POD and DMD applications have been have been applied to mechanical and aerospace engineering problems. However, the focus of this thesis is the application of modal decomposition techniques solely in Civil Engineering. First, the modal decomposition technique POD, is used to create a novel computationally efficient method for filtering spurious points from experi- mental data. Second a method of combining POD and DMD to attain regions of spatial and temporal independence is proposed. Third, these methods are applied to a river groyne problem to explain the spatio-temporal mechanisms leading to the sudden expansion of a mixing layer. Finally, these methods are applied to a group of multi-scale square cylinders, resembling the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>city,</b> to describe the spatio-temporal behaviour of the wake. This thesis creates a suite of tools which can be applied by Civil Engineers to understand complex mechanisms, for instance, in environmental fluid mechanics...|$|E
50|$|According to {{the local}} chronicler Lambert of Hersfeld, Archbishop Anno II of Cologne in 1071 {{established}} a Benedictine abbey here, which quickly became an ecclesiastical centre in eastern Thuringia but was destroyed during the German Peasants' War in 1526.

40|$|It {{has been}} long {{recognised}} {{that the underlying}} spatial structure {{plays an important role}} when navigating in urban environments. However, the modelling of the forms and properties that emerge from the <b>city</b> is still <b>a</b> difficult issue to address. The objective of the research developed in this paper is to study and represent two important qualities of urban environments as identified by Lynch and Bentley in their respective seminal works, that is, legibility and permeability. Our objective is to identify and implement <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> metrics applied to the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>city</b> that reflects these concepts of legibility, and then to evaluate to which degree these measures are correlated to different human perceptions of the city, particularly differences between humans who have or have not had <b>an</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given urban environment. The whole approach is applied to the context <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neighbourhood <b>of</b> the <b>city</b> of Tehran in Iran. The findings show that permeability match relatively well with residents’ evaluations while legibility rather complies with newcomers’ evaluations...|$|R
40|$|The Italian <b>city</b> <b>of</b> Milan {{provides}} <b>a</b> fascinating {{laboratory for}} disentangling the historical layers that structure the spatial <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European <b>city.</b> In the last 250 years, the temporal span of this study, Milan {{has played a}} key role in Italy’s industrialization and as its gateway to the centres of economic and cultural modernization in Western Europe. This article proposes a spatial analytical methodology that incorporates geovisualization techniques to discover and map urban change in Milan. Using historical maps dating back to the eighteenth century and <b>a</b> 2005 official <b>city</b> map, we applied methods of spatial analysis and geovisualization techniques to determine which parts of the city changed the most in the time interval considered. We then drew parallels between urban changes and political changes in the history of the city. Urban change is defined here as a change in the form and structure of the city (new buildings, new or widened roads, new squares, etc.). Results indicate that morphological changes at the intra-urban scale in Milan appear to be spatially oriented to reflect national and international political events from the mid-eighteenth century to the present. Although this result was not unexpected, the extent to which changes in the built-up environment reflect historical events was somewhat surprising...|$|R

2500|$|The {{gridiron}} as {{a concept}} for the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> town or <b>city</b> is not new.

[...] When the Greek city of Miletus was sacked by the Persians in 494 BCE and then liberated by Athens in 476 BCE, over the next three centuries it was rebuilt on the grid plan, with Hippodamus [...] often called [...] "the father of European urban planning" [...] as the local originator of the rectilinear grid system for the <b>city's</b> center, <b>a</b> concept he probably did not invent, but had heard about from elsewhere. Hippodamus went on to spread the grid to Pireaus, Rhodes and other cities in Greece.|$|R
40|$|Most psychometric {{tests of}} spatial ability are paper-and-pencil tasks at the bfiguralQ scale of space, {{in that they}} involve inspecting, imagining or mentally {{transforming}} small shapes or manipulable objects. Environmental spatial tasks, such as wayfinding or learning the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building or <b>city,</b> are carried out in larger spaces that surround the body and involve integration of the sequence of views that change with one’s movement in the environment. In a correlational study, 221 participants were tested on psychometric measures of spatial abilities, spatial updating, verbal abilities and working memory. They also learned the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> large environments from direct experience walking through a real environment, and via two different media: a desktop virtual environment (VE) and <b>a</b> videotape <b>of</b> <b>a</b> walk through an environment. In an exploratory factor analysis, measures of environmental learning from direct experience defined a separate factor from measures of learning based on VE and video media. In structural-equation models, smallscale spatial abilities predicted performance on the environmental-learning tasks, but were more predictive of learning from media than from direct experience. The results indicate that spatial abilities at different scales of space are partially but not totally dissociated. They specify the degree of overlap between small-scale and large-scale spatial abilities, inform theories of sex differences in these abilities, and provide new insights about what these abilities have in common and how they differ.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} project introduces {{perception in}} motion as a design method for grounded transport networks – roads, pedestrian/ bike paths, and rail systems. To design for circulation networks that dictate the <b>layout</b> and lifestyle <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>city,</b> architects and planners {{need to understand}} the affects of current mobilescapes, which are environments that evolve from transport networks. In order to identify current issues of mobility this project documents a particular mobilescape in Honolulu, Hawai‘i – the elevated condition. I refer to the elevated condition as <b>a</b> type <b>of</b> transport system - such as the elevated highway, elevated mass transit system, and skyway - composed of two or more levels of movement. The strategy of overlapping is used to separate various modes of mobility that travel at different speeds and in different directions. Although the elevated access network can be an effective solution to organizing mobility, there is <b>a</b> modest understanding <b>of</b> the “experience” <b>of</b> moving through <b>an</b> elevated condition. Because Honolulu will begin to construct a 20 mile long elevated rail system in 2009, I wanted to understand what the experience could be. What will rail riders see and feel? How will the speed 4 of the rail affect what riders perceive? How will <b>an</b> understanding <b>of</b> the rail experience alter the way designers approach mobilescapes? In order to develop further understanding of mobilescape design, this project investigates mobility in two parts. Part one is a historical critique that explores the evolution of mobility in architecture and planning; inquiring about the effects that the automobile and other modes of surface transport have had on the urban environment. The goal is to understand how past approaches to mobilescapes have benefi ted or hindered the experience of urban cities. This exploration is not intended to address the issues of mobility within virtual space, vertical circulation in high-rise developments, nor does it include non-grounded transportation types such as air and sea travel. The fi ndings in the evolution of mobility supplement the second portion of this project that focuses on Honolulu’s elevated rail proposal. The elevated condition, within the existing context of Honolulu, is analyzed and documented in video format. The video is intended to be <b>a</b> simulated understanding <b>of</b> Honolulu’s transit experience; capturing the perception of the elevated condition at both upper and lower levels. The video documentary also highlights the issues of the projected experience and begins to introduce design suggestions that could enhance the elevated condition. The goal of the fi lm is to present planners and architects with a design tool, based on perception in motion, that can inform and influence the Honolulu rail system...|$|R
