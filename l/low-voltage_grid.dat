40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is to assess whether {{it is possible to}} create a simplified model that estimates the hosting capacity of a <b>low-voltage</b> <b>grid.</b> The Simplified model is compared with a more elaborate model created by the Built Environment Energy Systems Group (BEESG) at Uppsala University. The Simplified model takes three easily obtainable variables into account. The model created by BEESG allows us to observe both the amount of photovoltaic (PV) power that is installed as well as the voltages in each bus in a grid. The hosting capacity is found by gradually increasing the amount of PV power installed in a <b>low-voltage</b> <b>grid</b> until overvoltage is reached. Simulations with BEESG’s model are done for a week in July when the PV generation has its peak and the load is generally low. The Simplified model is created using linear regression with the calculated values from the BEESG’s model as a reference. The report shows that the Simplified model will give an estimation of the low-voltage grid’s hosting capacity that is comparable to the value calculated with BEESG’s model. The results show that it is rarely the <b>low-voltage</b> <b>grid</b> that restricts the installation of PV facilities and that a high self-consumption is advantageous regarding to the grids hosting capacity...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of many factors, {{including}} the European Union's aim to increase the share of electrical energy from renewable sources, the number of distributed-generation (DG) devices in Europe is significantly increasing.

Recently, grid connected PV micro-generation facilities in individual homes have increased due to governmental policies as well as greater attention by industry. As low voltage (LV) distribution systems were built to make energy flow in one direction, the power feed-in of PV generation in rural low-voltage grids can influence power quality (PQ) as well as facility operation and reliability.

40|$|Implementing {{heat pumps}} as an energy {{efficient}} method to provide heat and rooftop photovoltaic installations {{as a source}} of renewable energy has a possible impact on the distribution, transmission, billing and trading of electricity. Evaluating this electrification of building energy services from a building perspective as such unwittingly externalizes costs. Excluding these effects underestimates the overall societal cost of possible systems, resulting in a disproportionate trade-off between different possible policy measures. In this context, the presented work estimates the externalised effects of low-energy dwellings at the the low-voltage distribution grid based on comprehensive building and energy system simulations. The required comprehensive framework at neighbourhood level was effectuated through the development of two novel modelling environments as part of the open-source OpenIDEAS framework. The IDEAS Library allows district energy simulations which integrate all main electric and thermal aspects of the energy systems in and between buildings. The StROBe Module provides stochastic occupant behaviour as boundary conditions for all main variables, the receptacle loads, the hot water tap flows and the space heating set-points. Through the OpenIDEAS framework, the effect of integrating heat pump and photovoltaic systems in the residential built environment is evaluated for two reference neighbourhoods. The heating system design, average insulation level, system sizing and feeder strength are identified as potential system variables which influence the overall impact of the integration, and are thus kept variable. In a rural context, the possible external costs for maintaining electricity distribution at the <b>low-voltage</b> <b>grid</b> are found to lie in the same order of size as the marginal present worths of the considered dwelling designs, and cost-effective design options are available which lower or avoid the externalities.

These systems are however not suited for reliable real-time data transmission. More advanced communication methods enable narrowband PLC solutions with high data rates. The frequency range between 10 – 500 [*]kHz is regulated and intensively used in USA, Japan and Asia. In Europe, their practical use in medium- and <b>low-voltage</b> <b>grids</b> is regulated only in the frequency range below 148.5 [*]kHz in the CENELEC bands A, B, C, and D.

Measurements on MV lines in the Netherlands have shown such high emission originating from wind power plants. Nevertheless, the CENELEC bands below 148.5 [*]kHz and individual bands above are suitable for PLC solutions in grid automation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{energy has}} witnessed double-digit {{growth in the}} past decade. The penetration of PV systems as distributed generators in <b>low-voltage</b> <b>grids</b> has also seen sig-nificant attention. In addition, the need for higher overall grid efficiency and reliability has boosted the interest in the microgrid concept. High-efficiency PV-based microgrids require {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT) controllers to maximize the har-vested energy due to the nonlinearity in PV module characteris-tics. Perturb and observe (P&O) techniques, although thoroughly investigated in previous research, still suffer from several disadvan-tages, such as sustained oscillation around the MPP, fast tracking versus oscillation tradeoffs, and user predefined constants. In this paper, a modified P&O MPPT technique, applicable for PV sys-tems, is presented. The proposed technique achieves: first, adaptive tracking; second, no steady-state oscillations around the MPP; and lastly, no need for predefined system-dependent constants, hence provides a generic design core. A design example is presented by experimental implementation of the proposed technique. Practical results for the implemented setup at different irradiance levels are illustrated to validate the proposed technique.

With reactive power control, full prevention of voltage-limit violation could not be achieved but the frequency of violations was reduced. A combination of both active power-limitation and reactive power reduced the volume and frequency of power limitation. In most cases, a power limitation of 2  kW satisfied the voltage boundaries. Thus, voltage control decreases the need for conventional grid reinforcement if grid operators gain more real-time information about the state of their distribution grids...|$|R
