50|$|Nisoxetine, {{originally}} synthesized in the Lilly research laboratories {{during the}} early 1970s, is a potent and selective inhibitor for the reuptake of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) into synapses. It currently has no clinical applications in humans, although it was originally researched as an antidepressant. Nisoxetine is now widely used in scientific research as a standard selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

50|$|Local {{anesthesia}} is any {{technique to}} induce {{the absence of}} sensation in a specific part of the body, generally for the aim of inducing <b>local</b> <b>analgesia,</b> that is, local insensitivity to pain, although other local senses may be affected as well. It allows patients to undergo surgical and dental procedures with reduced pain and distress. In many situations, such as cesarean section, it is safer and therefore superior to general anesthesia. It is also used for relief of non-surgical pain and to enable diagnosis of the cause of some chronic pain conditions. Anesthetists sometimes combine both general and local anesthesia techniques.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{studied the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>local</b> infiltration <b>analgesia</b> in surgical wounds with 0. 2 % ropivacaine (50 mL), ketorolac (15 mg), and adrenaline (0. 5 mg) {{compared with that of}} <b>local</b> infiltration <b>analgesia</b> combined with continuous infusion of 0. 2 % ropivacaine as amethod of pain control after total hip arthroplasty. We hypothesized that as a component of multimodal <b>analgesia,</b> <b>local</b> infiltration <b>analgesia</b> followed by continuous infusion of ropivacaine would result in reduced postoperative opioid consumption and lower pain scores compared with infiltration alone, and that both of these tech-niques would be superior to placebo. Methods: In this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 105 patients were randomized into three groups: Group I, in which patients received infiltration with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and adrenaline followed by continuous infusion of 0. 2 % ropivacaine at 5 mL/hr; Group II, in which patients received infiltration with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and adrenaline followed by continuous infusion of saline solution at 5 mL/hr; and Group III, in which patients received infiltration with saline solution followed by continuous infusion of saline solution at 5 mL/hr. All patients received celecoxib, pregabalin, and acetaminophen perioperatively and patient-controlled analgesia; surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Before wound closure, the tissues and periarticular space were infiltrated with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and adrenaline or saline solution and a fenestrated catheter was placed. The catheter was attached to a pump prefilled with either 0. 2 % ropivacaine or saline solution set to infuse at 5 mL/hr...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cryotherapy {{is widely}} {{recognised}} {{as a simple}} and effective intervention for pain management after acute musculoskeletal injuries and remains an essential adjunct to physiotherapy practice. It {{has been suggested that}} to optimise the clinical effectiveness of cryotherapy induced analgesia, a critical level of tissue cooling must be achieved. Previous research has indicated that a skin surface temperature of 13. 6 °C is required to induce <b>local</b> <b>analgesia.</b> However there is some debate in the current research regarding the optimum temperature for inducing <b>local</b> <b>analgesia</b> and the longevity of the analgesic effect. Purpose: This study aimed to establish the optimum point in the cooling profile for cryotherapy induced analgesia using a crushed ice pack and also to map the duration of the analgesic effect as tissues re-warm. This information could then be used to inform clinical practice and to enhance soft tissue rehabilitation following the application of cryotherapy. Methods: An experimental design was used to quantify and record superficial skin temperature and pain pressure threshold following a routine cryotherapy treatment. Baseline measurements of skin temperature and pain pressure thresholds were taken from 15 healthy volunteers who had consented to be participants. Each participant underwent a twenty minute treatment with a standardised ice pack made from crushed ice contained within a wet towel and applied to the anterior thigh. Using a standardised approach, skin surface temperature and pain pressure threshold readings were taken at baseline, immediately upon removal of the ice pack and every 5 minutes thereafter until surface skin temperature had returned to baseline values. Results: The results indicated that following the crushed ice pack treatment, 13 out of 15 participants achieved a reduction in skin surface temperature sufficient to achieve <b>local</b> <b>analgesia</b> (13. 6 °C). However this state persisted for less than 5 minutes before tissues began to re-warm which diminished the cryotherapy induced effect when above the recognised minimum skin surface temperature required for analgesia. Conclusion(s) : For the majority of participants a crushed ice pack applied for 20 minutes induced <b>local</b> <b>analgesia</b> however, the duration of the analgesic effect was relatively short lived with no indication of a period of prolonged analgesia. Implications: It is clear from this research that {{there is no guarantee that}} a crushed ice pack will induce <b>local</b> <b>analgesia</b> in all recipients and of those who achieve <b>local</b> <b>analgesia</b> the effect is relatively short lived. Further research is required to test the cooling profiles of other cryotherapy modalities to determine if any produce a longer duration of analgesia which would be clinically beneficial to patients...|$|E

This meta-analysis aims to compare both analgesic treatments for analgesia and functional outcomes after total knee arthroplasty. This meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statement guidelines. The primary outcomes were cumulative i. v. morphine consumption, pain scores at rest and on movement on postoperative day one (analogue scale, 0 - 10). Secondary outcomes included range of motion, quadriceps muscle strength, length of stay and rates of complications (neurologic events, cardiovascular events, falls and knee infections). Fourteen trials, including 1122 adult patients were identified. There {{was no difference in}} i. v. morphine consumption (mean difference: - 2. 0 mg; 95 % CI: - 4. 9, 0. 9 mg; I(2) = 69 %; P= 0. 19), pain scores at rest (mean difference: - 0. 1; 95 % CI: - 0. 4, 0. 3; I(2) = 72 %; P= 0. 80) and pain scores on movement (mean difference: 0. 2; 95 % CI: - 0. 5, 0. 8; I(2) = 80 %; P= 0. 64) on postoperative day one (a negative mean difference favours <b>local</b> infiltration <b>analgesia).</b> The qualities of evidence for our primary outcomes were moderate according to the GRADE system.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} - <b>Local</b> {{infiltration}} <b>analgesia</b> (LIA) {{is well established}} for effective postoperative pain relief in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). To prolong the effect of LIA, infusion pumps with <b>local</b> intraarticular <b>analgesia</b> can be used. We evaluated the effect of such an infusion pump for the first 48 h postoperatively regarding pain, knee function, length of stay (LOS) in hospital, and complications. Patients and methods - 200 patients received peroperative LIA and a continuous intraarticular elastomeric infusion pump set at 2 mL/h. The patients were randomized either to ropivacaine (7. 5 mg/mL) or to NaCl (9 mg/mL) in the pump. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain (0 - 100 mm), analgesic consumption, side effects of medicine, range of motion (ROM), leg-raising ability, LOS, and complications during the first 3 months were recorded. Results - On the first postoperative day, the ropivacaine group had lower VAS pain (33 vs. 40 at 12 noon and 36 vs. 43 at 8 p. m.; p = 0. 02 and 0. 03, respectively), but after that all recorded variables were similar between the groups. During the first 3 months, the ropivacaine group had {{a greater number of}} superficial and deep surgical wound infections (11 patients vs. 2 patients, p = 0. 02).

40|$|Transversus {{abdominal}} plane (TAP) block has a {{long history}} and there is currently extensive clinical experience around TAP blocks. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the present evidence on the effects of TAP block and to provide suggestions for further studies. There are several approaches to performing abdominal wall blocks, with the rapid implementation of ultrasound-guided technique facilitating a major difference in TAP block performance. During surgery, an abdominal wall block may also be applied by the surgeon from inside the abdominal cavity. Today, there are more than 11 meta-analyses providing a compiled evidence base around the effects of TAP block. These analyses include different procedures, different techniques of TAP block administration and, importantly, they compare the TAP block with a variety of alternative analgesic regimes. The effects of TAP block during laparoscopic cholecystectomy seem to be equivalent to <b>local</b> infiltration <b>analgesia</b> and also seem to be beneficial during laparoscopic colon resection. The effects of TAP are more pronounced when it is provided prior to surgery and these effects are local anaesthesia dose-dependent. TAP block seems an interesting alternative in patients with, for example, severe obesity where epidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia is technically difficult and/or poses a risk. There is an obvious need for further high-quality studies comparing TAP block prior to surgery with <b>local</b> infiltration <b>analgesia,</b> single-shot spinal analgesia, and epidural analgesia.

METHODS: A search of different databases was conducted using all terms relevant to the subject. Relevant papers were identified after a review of their titles, abstracts or full papers. Three workshops were held during the corresponding EAPD interim seminar in Torino (Italy) in 2017. Several statements were agreed upon and, furthermore, knowledge gaps were identified. RESULTS: An important outcome was that when <b>local</b> <b>analgesia</b> administered appropriately-correct choice of agent(s) and dosage, proper route of administration-it is, firstly, clinically effective for pain-control in treating children and, secondly, it carries a very low risk of morbidity including adverse or side-effects. Furthermore, several gaps in knowledge were identified during the workshop which indicates future research needs. Most importantly it remains unsatisfactory that in several European countries the most frequently used injectable local analgesic agent, articaine, is not approved for usage in children below the age of 4 years.

Methods Four male piglets in each of 141 litters in five herds {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four treatments: castration without <b>local</b> anaesthesia or <b>analgesia</b> (C, controls), <b>analgesia</b> (M, meloxicam), <b>local</b> anaesthesia (L, lidocaine), or both <b>local</b> anaesthesia and <b>analgesia</b> (LM). Lidocaine (L, LM) was injected at least three minutes before castration and meloxicam (M, LM) was injected after castration. During castration, vocalisation was measured and resistance movements judged. Behaviour observations were carried out on the castration day and the following day. The day after castration, castration wounds were ranked, ear and skin temperature was measured, and blood samples were collected for analysis of acute phase protein Serum Amyloid A concentration (SAA). Piglets were weighed on the castration day and at three weeks of age. Sickness treatments and mortality were recorded until three weeks of age. Results Piglets castrated with lidocaine produced calls with lower intensity (p p p = 0. 06, n. s.) and the following day (p = 0. 02).
