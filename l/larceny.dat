30|$|Furthermore, for {{the case}} of total {{incidents}} and grand <b>larcenies,</b> we observe that models based solely on attributes of the ambient population outperform the models based on the classical demographic features—and, {{in the case of}} grand <b>larcenies,</b> even reach performance levels comparable with those of the census + POI baseline. Finally, comparing the datasource-specific models (provided in Additional file  1 —section Additional Model Specifications), we conclude that the census + FS consistently outperforms the census + subway and the census + taxi models—with the exception of the vehicle <b>larcenies</b> crime category, which performs poorly across the board. Comparing the additional predictive power of the subway vs taxi rides, we notice a significant advantage of the taxi usage data in case of the grand <b>larcenies</b> category.|$|R

5|$|On December 13, 2006, one of Ono's bodyguards {{was arrested}} {{after he was}} {{allegedly}} taped trying to extort $2million from her. The tapes revealed that he threatened to release private conversations and photographs. His bail was revoked, and he {{pleaded not guilty to}} two counts of attempted grand <b>larceny.</b> In February 16, 2007 a deal was reached where extortion charges were dropped, and he pleaded guilty to attempted grand <b>larceny</b> in the third degree, a felony, and was sentenced to the 60 days that he had already spent in jail. After reading an unapologetic statement, he was released to immigration officials because he had also been found guilty of overstaying his business visa.|$|E
5|$|She moved {{frequently}} around West London using various aliases, including Webb, Webster, Gibbs, Gibbons, and Lawler. While {{living in}} Teddington, {{she was arrested}} and convicted in May 1875 of 36 charges of <b>larceny.</b> She was sentenced to eighteen months in Wandsworth Prison. Not long after leaving prison, she was arrested again for <b>larceny</b> {{and was sentenced to}} another twelve months' imprisonment in February 1877.

5|$|As Peter {{exits the}} {{abortion}} clinic, he notices a pro-life rally nearby. At the rally, a protester shows Peter a video tape discouraging abortion (as {{a reference to}} the cult classic 1936 American propaganda exploitation film Reefer Madness), portraying it as murder, <b>larceny,</b> jaywalking and securities fraud. The tape claims that abortion prevented Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's would-be assassin, a fourth Stooge brother, of The Three Stooges, and Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden's America-loving brother from being born.|$|E

Later, Fiore pleads guilty to charges of murder and grand <b>larceny,</b> whilst Michelle seemingly recovers and goes on to become a normal little girl.|$|E
5|$|Webster {{herself was}} characterised as malicious, {{reckless}} and wilfully evil. Commentators saw her crime as both gruesome and scandalous. Servants {{were expected to}} be deferential; her act of extreme violence towards her employer was deeply disquieting. At the time, about 40% of the female labour force was employed as domestic servants for a very wide range of society, from the wealthiest to respectable working-class families. Servants and employers lived and worked in close proximity, and the honesty and orderliness of servants was a constant cause of concern. Servants were very poorly paid and <b>larceny</b> was an ever-present temptation. Had Webster succeeded in completing the deal with John Church to sell Thomas' furniture, she stood to gain the equivalent of two to three years' worth of wages.|$|E
5|$|Duane Roger Morrison (July 23, 1953 – September 27, 2006) was {{eventually}} {{identified as the}} perpetrator of the incident.

Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 35-year-old man with a camouflage backpack and a black hooded sweatshirt. Morrison had been imprisoned in 1973 for <b>larceny</b> and possession of marijuana, and was arrested on a separate occasion for obstructing police in Littleton, Colorado. Police announced that a suicide letter written by Morrison to a family member was being analyzed by the FBI. Morrison's family gave the letter to police, who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in Quantico, Virginia. In the 14-page letter, Morrison claimed that he was mentally and physically abused by his father as a child, and had suicidal thoughts since he was 21 years old.|$|E

During the lawsuit, it was revealed that Barnette had been convicted of <b>larceny</b> in Oregon. As his legal bills added up, Barnette decided to lease the Fairbanks Daily News to a group of local businessmen. On June 15, 1908, Barnette ended the lease agreement by selling the newspaper to J. Harmon Caskey and Henry Roden. That same year, the campaign to elect Alaska's first delegate to Congress was under way, and one of the candidates, Jack Corson, purchased one-third of the newspaper. Corson's campaign manager promptly was named the editor of the Daily News, and the paper switched to actively supporting Corson's candidacy.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2003, the Stellamare, a Dutch-owned ship, capsized at the port, killing three Russian crewmembers. The {{ship was}} hauling General Electric {{generators}} when it overturned. The United States Coast Guard determined that poor communication {{resulting from the}} supervisors speaking Dutch while the crew spoke Russian, with English {{being used as a}} relay, was a contributing factor to mismanagement of ballast tanks. In the early spring of 2008 a port employee was arrested for stealing copper. This in turn led to investigations of employee theft which resulted in the arrest of an operations manager and a maintenance foreman for <b>larceny.</b> In 2008 the port received two awards from the Railway Industrial Clearance Association. One award was for customer satisfaction and the other for being the most improved port in the United States for handling heavy lift cargo.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday February 24, 2007 {{at about}} 6:55a.m., Brown's Chevrolet Equinox {{was stolen from}} an on-street parking {{location}} by someone with key access and crashed into three parked vehicles before being abandoned {{a few blocks from}} the family home. Brown had driven his son to play in a basketball tournament in Jamestown, New York on Friday February 23. They returned home at approximately 10:30p.m. from the tournament. In interviews at the end of March 2007, Brown claimed that all members of his family with known key access had alibis. At the time Brown III possessed a learner's permit. Canisius College security cameras recorded parts of the accident, including the driver leaving the scene of multiple accidents. In April a second video recording with more fluid movement was revealed in contrast to the original recording of 36 frames per minute. In a news conference Brown announced that Byron Brown III took the senior Brown's car without permission and drove about the area near his house and Canisius College campus. Brown III admitted to the damage and was charged with driving without a driver's license and leaving the scenes of multiple accidents. Brown III was scheduled to appear on April 16, 2007 in Buffalo City Court on the charges. He pleaded guilty to unlicensed driving and leaving the scene of an accident. In 2010, his son was charged with petit <b>larceny</b> for leaving a store with goods that were not paid for. Byron Jr. was spared a criminal conviction when a judge granted him a delayed dismissal on shoplifting charges, as recommended by prosecutors. Buffalo City Judge David M. Manz warned him and Xavier Jemison that they have to complete a four-hour shoplifting class and stay out of trouble for the next six months. He granted each an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, meaning their petit <b>larceny</b> charges will be dismissed if they comply with his orders.|$|E
