The red lines are the wave rays; the blue <b>lines</b> are the <b>wavefronts.</b> The distances between neighboring wave rays vary towards the coast because of refraction by bathymetry (depth variations). The distance between wavefronts (i.e. the wavelength) reduces towards the coast {{because of the}} decreasing phase speed.|$|R
5000|$|Going beyond {{ordinary}} three-dimensional physical space, one {{can imagine}} a higher dimensional abstract configuration [...] "space", with a dimension a multiple of 3. In this space, {{one can imagine}} again rays as one-dimensional curved <b>lines.</b> Now the <b>wavefronts</b> are hypersurfaces of dimension one less than the dimension of the space. Such a multi-dimensional space {{can serve as a}} configuration space for a multi-particle system.|$|R

The feed current for each antenna passes through a phase shifter (φ) controlled by a computer (C). The moving red <b>lines</b> show the <b>wavefronts</b> of the radio waves emitted by each element. The individual wavefronts are spherical, but they combine (superpose) {{in front of the}} antenna to create a plane wave, a beam of radio waves travelling in a specific direction. The phase shifters delay the radio waves progressively going up the line so each antenna emits its wavefront later than the one below it. This causes the resulting plane wave to be directed at an angle to the antenna. The velocity of the radio waves is shown slowed down enormously.|$|R
40|$|The laser {{wavefront}} of the NIF Beamlet {{demonstration system}} is corrected for static aberrations with a wavefront control system. The system operates closed loop with a probe beam {{prior to a}} shot and has a loop bandwidth of about 3 Hz. However, until recently the wavefront control system was disabled several minutes prior to the shot to allow time to manually reconfigure its attenuators and probe beam insertion mechanism to shot mode. Thermally-induced dynamic variations in gas density in the Beamlet main beam <b>line</b> produce significant <b>wavefront</b> error. After about 5 - 8 seconds, the wavefront error has increased to a new, higher level due to turbulence- induced aberrations no longer being corrected- This implies {{that there is a}} turbulence-induced aberration noise bandwidth of less than one Hertz, and that the wavefront controller could correct for the majority of turbulence-induced aberration (about one- third wave) by automating its reconfiguration to occur within one second of the shot, This modification was recently implemented on Beamlet; we call this modification the t{sub 0 }- 1 system...|$|R

This causes the resulting plane wave to be directed at an angle θ to the antenna's axis. By changing the phase shifts the computer can instantly change the angle θ of the beam. Most phased arrays have two-dimensional arrays of antennas instead of the linear array shown here, and the beam can be steered in two dimensions. The velocity of the radio waves is shown slowed down enormously.|$|R

It consists of a beamforming oscillator (TX) that produces an electronic signal consisting of pulses of sine waves oscillating at an ultrasonic frequency, which is applied to an array of ultrasonic transducers (T) {{in contact with the}} skin surface that convert the electric signal into ultrasonic waves traveling through the tissue. The timing of the pulses emitted by each transducer is controlled by programmable delay units (φ) that are controlled by a microprocessor control system (C). The moving red <b>lines</b> are the <b>wavefronts</b> of the ultrasonic waves from each transducer. The wavefronts are spherical, but they combine (superpose) to form plane waves, creating a beam of sound traveling in a specific direction. Since the pulse from each transducer is progressively delayed going up the line, each transducer emits its pulse after the one below it. This results in a beam of sound waves emitted at an angle (θ) to the array. By changing the pulse delays, the computer can scan the beam of ultrasound in a raster pattern across the tissue. Echoes reflected by different density tissue, received by the transducers, build up an image of the underlying structures.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{application}} of the finite element method invariably involves the solution of large systems of sparse linear algebraic equations. The solution of these systems often represents a significant or even dominant component of the total solution time. Various sparse matrix techniques and strategies {{have been developed to}} reduce the time and cost of solving these equations. These techniques exploit both the zero-nonzero structure of the matrix problem {{and the manner in which}} the actual numerical components of the problem are computed. This thesis describes some of the direct methods, including the banded, sky <b>line</b> or profile, <b>wavefront</b> and hypermatrix schemes. The relative merits of each of these schemes are also indicated with respect to the number of arithmetical operations, data structure organization, secondary storage requirements and implementation strategy. The second section of this thesis discusses the implementation of an equation solution package for application in the finite element method. Initially a partitioning scheme for a wavefront solver was investigated but due to problems encountered and the increasing complexity of the code, it was decided to use an alternative method. A Cholesky decomposition method with a hypermatrix data storage scheme was then investigated and developed. The equation solution method was developed using a virtual paging scheme as implemented by the DAS package, and a module of general hypermatrix management routines. Finally, the package was implemented and tested in the NEW NOSTRUM development at the University of Cape Town. Suggestions for further developments are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Shearwave induced {{resonance}} elastography (SWIRE) {{is proposed}} for {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT) elasticity assess-ment. This new imaging technique takes advantage of properly polarized shear waves to induce resonance of a confined mechan-ical heterogeneity. Realistic phantoms of DVT total and partial clot occlusions with elasticities from 406 to 3561 Pa were built for in vitro experiments. An ex vivo study was also performed to evaluate the elasticity of two fresh porcine venous thrombi in a pig model. Transient shear waves at 45 – 205 Hz were generated by the vibration of a rigid plate (plane wavefront) or by a needle to simulate a radiation pressure on a <b>line</b> segment (cylindrical <b>wavefront).</b> Induced propagation of shear waves was imaged with an ultrafast ultrasound scanner and a finite element method was developed to simulate tested experimental conditions. An inverse problem was then formulated considering the first resonance frequency of the DVT inclusion. Elasticity agreements between SWIRE and a reference spectroscopy instrument (RheoSpectris) were found in vitro for total clots either in plane or cylindrical wavefront configurations. For total and partial clots, elasticity estimation errors were and, respectively. Ex vivo, the blood clot elasticity was within the inferior vena cava and in the right common iliac vein. To conclude, the SWIRE technique seems feasible to quantitatively assess blood clot elasticity {{in the context of}} DVT ultrasound imaging.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops {{and presents}} an existing but little known method {{to provide an}} exact solution to the Wavefront Difference Equation routinely encountered in the reduction of Lateral Shear Interferograms (LSI). The method first suggested by Dr. Roland Shack treats LSI as a convolution of the wavefront with an odd impulse pair. This representation casts the Lateral Shear problem in terms of Fourier optics operators and filters with a simplified treatment of {{the reduction of the}} LSI possible. This work extends the original proposal applied to <b>line</b> scans of <b>wavefronts</b> to full two-dimensional recovery of the wavefront along with developing the associated mathematical theory and computer code to efficiently execute the wavefront reduction. Further, a number of applications of the wavefront reduction technique presented here are developed. The applications of the filtering technique developed here include optical imaging systems exhibiting the primary aberrations, a model of residual tool marks after fabrication and propagation of an optical probe through atmospheric turbulence. The computer program developed in this work resides on a PC and produces accurate results to a 1 / 500 wave when compared to ray traced input wavefronts. The combination of the relatively simple concept providing the basis of the reduction technique with the highly accurate results over a wide range of input wavefronts makes this a timely effort. Finally, the reduction technique {{can be applied to the}} accurate testing of aspheric optical components...|$|R
