The programmer is provided a familiar uniform <b>logic</b> <b>address</b> space and specifies the data distribution by directives. The compiler then exploits these directives to allocate arrays in the local memories, to assign computations to elementary processors and to migrate data between processors when required. We show here that linear algebra is a convenient framework to encode hpf directives and to synthesize distributed code with space-efficient array allocation, tight loop bounds and minimal communications for INDEPENDENT loops. The systematic use of an affine framework {{makes it easy to}} prove the compilation scheme correct.

40|$|By binding logic {{addresses}} to {{the network}} topology, routing {{can be carried out}} without going through route discovery. This eliminates the initial route discovery latency, saves storage space otherwise needed for routing table, and reduces the communication overhead and energy consumption. In this paper, an adaptive block addressing (ABA) scheme is first introduced for <b>logic</b> <b>address</b> assignment as well as network auto-configuration purpose. The scheme takes into account the actual network topology and thus is fully topology-adaptive. Then a distributed link state (DLS) scheme is further proposed and put on top of the block addressing scheme {{to improve the quality of}} routes, in terms of hop count or other routing cost metrics used, robustness, and load balancing. The network topology reflected in logic addresses is used as a guideline to tell towards which direction (rather than next hop) a packet should be relayed. The next hop is derived from each relaying node’s local link state table. The routing scheme, named as topology-guided DLS (TDLS) as a whole, scales well with regard to various performance metrics. The ability of TDLS to provide multiple paths also precludes the need for explicit route repair, which is the most complicated part in many wireless routing protocols. While this paper targets low rate wireless mesh personal area networks (LR-WMPANs), including wireless mesh sensor networks (WMSNs), the TDLS itself is a general scheme and can be applied to other non-mobile wireless mesh networks...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{temperature}} sensor and thermal watchdog 1. General description The LM 75 B is a temperature-to-digital converter using an on-chip band gap {{temperature sensor}} and Sigma-Delta A-to-D conversion technique with an overtemperature detection output. The LM 75 B contains {{a number of}} data registers: Configuration register (Conf) to store the device settings such as device operation mode, OS operation mode, OS polarity and OS fault queue as described in Section 7 “Functional description”; temperature register (Temp) to store the digital temp reading, and set-point registers (Tos and Thyst) to store programmable overtemperature shutdown and hysteresis limits, that can be communicated by a controller via the 2 -wire serial I 2 C-bus interface. The device also includes an open-drain output (OS) which becomes active when the temperature exceeds the programmed limits. There are three selectable <b>logic</b> <b>address</b> pins so that eight devices can be connected on the same bus without address conflict. The LM 75 B can be configured for different operation conditions. It can be set in normal mode to periodically monitor the ambient temperature, or in shutdown mode to minimize power consumption. The OS output operates in either of two selectable modes: OS comparator mode or OS interrupt mode. Its active state can be selected as either HIGH or LOW. The fault queue that defines the number of consecutive faults in order to activate the OS output is programmable {{as well as the}} set-point limits. The temperature register always stores an 11 -bit two’s complement data giving a temperature resolution of 0. 125 C. This high temperature resolution is particularly useful in applications of measuring precisely the thermal drift or runaway. When the LM 75 B is accessed the conversion in process is not interrupted (that is, the I 2 C-bus section is totally independent of the Sigma-Delta converter section) and accessing the LM 75 B continuously without waiting at least one conversion time between communications will not prevent the device from updating the Temp register with a new conversion result. The new conversion result will be available immediately after the Temp register is updated. The LM 75 B powers up in the normal operation mode with the OS in comparator mode, temperature threshold of 80 C and hysteresis of 75 C, {{so that it can be}} used as a stand-alone thermostat with those pre-defined temperature set points...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{deletion}} of {{data from}} storage {{is an important component}} on data security. The deletion of entire disc or special files is well-known on hard drives, but this is quite different on SSDs, because they have a different architecture inside, and the main problem is if they serve the same methods like hard drives for data deletion or erasing. The built-in operations are used to do this on SSDs. The purpose of this review is to analyses some methods which are proposed to erase data form SSDs and their results too, to see which of them offers the best choice. In general we will see that the techniques of erasing data from entire disc from hard drives can be used also on SSDs, but there’s a problem with bugs. On the other hand, we cannot use the same techniques of erasing a file from hard drives and SSDs. To make this possible, there are required changes in FTL layer, which is responsible for mapping between <b>logic</b> <b>addresses</b> and physical addresses.

40|$|Abstract—The {{fabrication}} of crossbar memories with sublithographic features {{is expected to}} be feasible within several emerging technologies; in all of them, the nanowire (NW) decoder is a critical part since it bridges the sublithographic wires to the outer circuitry that is defined on the lithography scale. In this paper, we evaluate the addressing scheme of the decoder circuit for NW crossbar arrays, based on the existing technological solutions for threshold voltage differentiation of NW devices. This is equivalent to using a multivalued <b>logic</b> <b>addressing</b> scheme. With this approach, it is possible to reduce the decoder size and keep it defect tolerant. We formally define two types of multivalued codes (i. e., hot and reflexive codes), and we estimate their yield under high variability conditions. Multivalued hot decoders yield better area saving than n-ary reflexive codes, and under severe conditions, reflexive codes enable a nonvanishing part of the code space to randomly recover. The choice of the optimal combination of decoder type and logic level saves area up to 24 %. We also show that the precision of the addressing voltages when a high variability affects the threshold voltages is a crucial parameter for the decoder design and permits large savings in memory area. Moreover, a precise knowledge about the variability level improves the design of memory decoders by giving the right optimal code.
