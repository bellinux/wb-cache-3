2500|$|There {{are various}} {{classification}} systems for acute ischemic stroke. The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, {{also known as}} the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms; based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as total anterior circulation infarct (TACI), partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI), <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> (LACI) or posterior circulation infarct (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain that is affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis. The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, a stroke is classified as being due to (1) thrombosis or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery, (2) an embolism originating in the heart, (3) complete blockage of a small blood vessel, (4) other determined cause, (5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation). Users of stimulants, [...] such as cocaine and methamphetamine are at a high risk for ischemic strokes.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> have different etiologies, possibly {{related to their}} anatomical location and vascular territory. We investigated the risk factor profiles of patients with new <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in the basal ganglia and deep white matter. Within the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Magnetic Resonance study, a prospective cohort on brain changes on MRI in patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, 679 patients (57 ± 9 years) had vascular screening and MRI at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 3. 9 years. We investigated the association between vascular risk factors at baseline and appearance of new <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in the basal ganglia and deep white matter at follow-up. New <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> appeared in 44 patients in the basal ganglia and in 37 patients in the deep white matter. In multivariable analysis, older age, history of cerebrovascular disease, and baseline white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume were associated with increased risk of new <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in both locations. Hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with increased risk of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in the basal ganglia (relative risk [RR] 2. 0; 95 % CI 1. 0 - 4. 2), whereas carotid stenosis > 70 % (RR 2. 5; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 5. 0), smoking (per 10 pack-year: RR 1. 1; 95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 3), hypertension (RR 3. 4; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 9. 7), and progression of WMH volume (RR 2. 4; 95 % CI 1. 1 - 5. 2) were associated with increased risk of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in the deep white matter. The different risk factor profiles for new <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in basal ganglia and deep white matter indicate different etiologies. The independent association between progression of WMH and new deep white matter <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> suggest a common etiology for these radiological abnormalitie...|$|R
40|$|Right-to-left shunt (RLS) is {{associated}} with cryptogenic stroke and migraine. Herein we investigated the relationship between RLS and silent <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in patients with migraine. A total of 263 patients with migraine who met eligibility criteria were enrolled from January 2010 to December 2011, among which 127 subjects fell into RLS group. Baseline demographics were comparable between RLS and non-RLS groups (P> 0. 05). The incidence of silent <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in RLS group was {{not significantly different from}} that of the non-RLS group (25. 2 % versus 21. 3 %, P> 0. 05). Furthermore, we found that the incidence of silent <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in permanent and latent RLS subgroups was comparable with non-shunt RLS subgroup (28. 6 % versus 24 % versus 21. 3 %, P> 0. 05). Similarly, the incidence of silent <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in the non-RLS group, mild-shunt group, and large-shunt group was also comparable (21. 3 % versus 23. 8 % versus 29. 3 %, P> 0. 05). In addition, RLS did not increase the incidence of silent <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in migraine patients with elder age (0. 05).

5000|$|The initial {{part of the}} MCA is {{a single}} vessel called the stem or M1 segment. As it passes laterally, the stem gives off a series of six to twelve long, small-diameter, {{penetrating}} vessels that travel directly upward to supply the basal ganglia {{and much of the}} internal capsule. These are called the lenticulostriate arteries, referring to the lentiform nucleus (composed of the putamen and the globus pallidus) and the striatum. These small arteries are particularly susceptible to damage from hypertension. They may either rupture, producing an intracerebral hemorrhage that is initially centered in the region they supply, or they become occluded, producing a <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> in the tissue they supply. The lenticulostriate arteries are [...] "end arteries", meaning that the regions they supply do not have significant collateral blood supply. Occlusion of these vessels therefore leads to stereotyped stroke syndromes.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gait {{disorders}} {{are common in}} the elderly and are related to loss of functional independence and death. White matter lesions (WMLs) may be related, but {{only a minority of}} individuals with WMLs has gait disorders. Probably other factors are involved, including location and the independent effect of frequently coinciding <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> the other aspect of cerebral small vessel disease. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of both the severity and location of both WMLs and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> on gait. METHODS: Four hundred thirty-one independently living, nondemented elderly aged between 50 and 85 years with cerebral small vessel disease were included in this analysis and underwent MRI scanning. The number and location of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> were rated and WML volume was assessed by manual segmentation with automated delineating of different regions. Gait was assessed quantitatively with an electronic walkway as well as the semiquantitatively Tinetti and Timed-Up-and-Go test. RESULTS: WMLs and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> were both independently associated with most gait parameters with stride length as the most sensitive parameter related to WMLs. WMLs in the sublobar (basal ganglia/internal capsule) and limbic areas and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in the frontal lobe and thalamus were related to a lower velocity. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral small vessel disease is related to gait disturbances. Because small vessel disease may, in part, be preventable, it should be regarded as a potentially important target for postponing gait impairment...|$|R

To identify subjects at early stages of the disease, we investigated whether the presence of MPS was dependent on the severity and location of small-vessel disease, including white matter lesions and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts.</b> Methods—Four hundred thirty individuals, with small-vessel disease, aged between 50 and 85 years, without dementia or parkinsonism, were included in this analysis and underwent MRI scanning.

40|$|Background: Lacunar {{syndrome}} {{not due to}} <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> {{is poorly}} characterised. This single centre, retrospective {{study was conducted to}} describe the clinical characteristics of patients with lacunar syndrome not due to <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> and to identify clinical predictors of this variant of lacunar stroke. Methods: A total of 146 patients with lacunar syndrome not due to lacunar infarction were included in the "Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona Stroke Registry" during a period of 19 years (1986 - 2004). Data from stroke patients are entered in the stroke registry following a standardized protocol with 161 items regarding demographics, risk factors, clinical features, laboratory and neuroimaging data, complications and outcome. The characteristics of these 146 patients with lacunar syndrome not due to <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> were compared with those of the 733 patients with lacunar infarction. Results: Lacunar syndrome not due to <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> accounted for 16. 6 % (146 / 879) of all cases of lacunar stroke. Subtypes of lacunar syndromes included pure motor stroke in 63 patients, sensorimotor stroke in 51, pure sensory stroke in 14, atypical lacunar syndrome in 9, ataxic hemiparesis in 5 and dysarthria-clumsy hand in 4. Valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, sudden onset, limb weakness and sensory symptoms were significantly more frequent among patients with lacunar syndrome not due to <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> than in those with lacunar infarction, whereas diabetes was less frequent. In the multivariate analysis, atrial fibrillation (OR = 4. 62), sensorimotor stroke (OR = 4. 05), limb weakness (OR = 2. 09), sudden onset (OR = 2. 06) and age (OR = 0. 96) were independent predictors of lacunar syndrome not due to <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct.</b> Conclusions: Although lacunar syndromes are highly suggestive of small deep cerebral infarctions, lacunar syndromes not due to lacunar infarcts are found in 16. 6 % of cases. The presence of sensorimotor stroke, limb weakness and sudden onset in a patient with atrial fibrillation should alert the clinician to the possibility of a lacunar syndrome not due to a <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to earlier observations, {{recent studies have}} demonstrated that supratentorial lacunar infarcts in the white matter may cause mild neuropsychological impairments. The origin of these cognitive disturbances is yet unknown. In the current study proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H- 1 MRS) was used to elucidate the hypothesized relation between a <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct,</b> metabolic alterations, and neuropsychological function. Patients with a single supratentorial <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> (n= 26) were compared with patients with a mild myocardial infarct (n= 12) and healthy controls (n= 12) on a comprehensive neuropsychological examination, and on the N-acetyl-aspartate/creatine, choline/creatine and lactate/creatine ratios. The volume of interest of the MRI/MRS examination was located in normal-appearing white matter of the centrum semiovale at a distance from the infarct, in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere. On neuropsychological examination patients with a <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> performed worse than both patients with a myocardial infarct and healthy controls. The N-acetyl-aspartate/creatine ratio was decreased in patients with a <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> compared with the other two groups. More important, this decrease in neurometabolites was significantly correlated to the level of cognitive functioning for the ipsilateral hemisphere and, although to a lesser extent, for the contralateral hemisphere. We conclude that a single symptomatic <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> in the white matter is associated with (distant) disturbances in neurometabolites and that this decrease is related to a reduced cognitive capacity...|$|E

40|$|CADASIL is a {{hereditary}} cerebral {{small vessel}} disease, {{caused by a}} mutation in the NOTCH 3 gene, leading to migraine with aura, cerebrovascular accidents and cognitive decline at young to middle adult age. MRI scans of the brain may show <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> white matter lesions and microbleeds. In this thesis MRI scans of the brains are used to investigate the disease course in CADASIL. It is shown that <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> white matter lesions and microbleeds are progressive in CADASIL patients. Vascular risk factors are not associated with rate of progression of these MRI abnormalities. However, the rate of disease progression can be predicted by measuring the amount of MRI abnormalities at baseline. <b>Lacunar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> microbleeds and increased white ventricular volume are strongly associated with cognitive decline in CADASIL. Progression of white matter hyperintensities can be predicted by measurements of cerebrovascular reactivity. Using high-field MRI we demonstrated that luminal diameters of lenticulostriate arteries are normal in CADASIL, and that <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in CADASIL are {{not the result of}} luminal narrowing of these vessels. High-field MRI also showed that CADASIL patients have an increased diffuse iron deposition in the putamen and caudate nucleus of the brain. Promotores: M. A. van Buchem, M. D.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether severity and progression of periventricular and deep white matter lesions (WML) and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> {{were associated with}} progression of brain atrophy. Methods: Within the SMART-MR study, a prospective cohort on MRI changes in patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, 565 patients (57 +/- 9 years) without large infarcts had vascular screening and 1. 5 T MRI at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 3. 9 years. With automated brain segmentation, total brain, cortical gray matter, ventricular, and WML volumes were estimated and expressed relative to intracranial volume (%). <b>Lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> were rated manually. Results: Using linear regression analyses adjusted for demographics and vascular risk factors, periventricular WML volume at baseline was associated with greater decrease in cortical gray matter volume (B = - 1. 73 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] - 3. 15 % to - 0. 30 %, per 1 % WML volume increase) and greater increase in ventricular volume (B = 0. 12 %, 95 % CI 0. 04 % to 0. 20 %). Progression of periventricular WML volume corresponded with a greater decrease in cortical gray matter volume (B = - 0. 45 %, 95 % CI - 0. 9 % to 0 %) and greater increase in ventricular volume (B = 0. 15 %, 95 % CI 0. 1 % to 0. 2 %). Presence of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> was associated with greater decline in total brain volume (B = - 0. 25 %, 95 % CI - 0. 49 % to - 0. 01 %) and progression of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> with a greater decrease of total brain (B = - 0. 30 %, 95 % CI - 0. 59 % to 0. 01 %) and cortical gray matter volume (B = - 0. 81 %, 95 % CI - 1. 43 % to - 0. 20 %).

In a large MRI-verified cohort of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> patients, we investigated the risk factor profile of lacunar infarction and MRI-characteristics. Methods 1023 patients with lacunar infarction (mean age 56. 7 (SD 8. 5)), were recruited from 72 stroke centres throughout the UK {{as part of the}} UK Young Lacunar Stroke DNA Study. Risk factor profiles were compared with 1961 stroke-free population controls with similar age. Furthermore, we tested risk factor profiles of lacunar stroke patients for association with the presence of multiple lacunar infarcts, white matter hypertensities (WMH) and location of the acute <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct.</b> Results Hypertension (OR 2. 21 (95 % CI 1. 85 - 2. 64)), diabetes (OR 2. 10 (95 % CI 1. 61 - 2. 73)), hyperlipidaemia (OR 1. 74 (95 % CI 1. 46 - 2. 07)) and smoking (OR 1. 65 (95 % CI 1. 39 - 1. 96)) were independently associated in <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> patients compared to healthy controls. Patients with multiple lacunar infarcts {{were more likely to be}} male (OR 2. 53 (95 % CI 1. 81 - 3. 53)) and have hypertension (OR 1. 54 (95 % CI 1. 12 - 2. 04)) compared to patients with a single <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct,</b> independent of other vascular risk factors. The presence of moderate to severe WMH versus no or mild WMH was independently associated with increased age (OR 1. 54 (95 % CI 1. 12 - 2. 04)), hypertension (OR 2. 06 (95 % CI 1. 44 - 2. 95)) and impaired renal function (OR 0. 90 (95 % CI 0. 82 - 0. 98)). Conclusions In this MRI-verified lacunar stroke population we identified a distinct risk factor profile in the group as a whole.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Pulsatility index (PI) of {{the middle}} {{cerebral}} artery is postulated to reflect the vascular resistance in the artery distal of the probe, and {{has been reported to}} increase in small vessel disease, diabetes mellitus, ageing, and dementia. Lacunar infarcts are considered to be related to cognitive impairment. We therefore conducted a study to assess the association between cognitive impairment and PI in patients with a <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct.</b> METHODS Consecutive patients presenting with an acute lacunar syndrome who were admitted to the stroke unit were enrolled. The patients were examined with Doppler ultrasonography of the intracranial arteries, and the PI {{of the middle}} cerebral artery was recorded. Cognitive function was evaluated by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clock drawing test, and trail making test (TMT) A and B. RESULTS Among the 113 patients included, 85 patients had an acute <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> and 28 had one or more nonlacunar infarcts. The mean PI was 1. 46 (SD =. 33). PI was significantly (P <. 05) associated with MMSE, TMT A and TMT B in patients with <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct,</b> even after adjustment for multiple patient characteristics (age, sex, prestroke hypertension, smoking, previous stroke, and diabetes). CONCLUSIONS PI was associated with the cognitive performance in patients with lacunar infarcts and a lacunar syndrome. An elevated PI may be related to impairment in several cognitive domains. These findings suggest that transcranial Doppler ultrasonography could be an adjunct tool for early diagnosis of cognitive impairment after stroke...|$|E
40|$|Background:Whether a {{perfusion}} defect {{exists in}} <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> {{and whether it}} is related to early neurological deterioration (END) is still under debate. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether END in <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> is related to a perfusion defect using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and perfusion MR imaging. Methods: One hundred and forty-one consecutive patients had an MRI scan within 30 hours after onset of symptoms and 43 patients with acute <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> and classic lacunar syndrome were recruited. The MRI sequences included DWI, DTI and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps to respectively represent the topographic locations of acute infarcts, the corticospinal tract and perfusion defects. The END was defined in reference to the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) as an increase§ 2 within 72 hours. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient was used to examine the reliability between the 2 image readers. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed adjusting for baseline variables. Results: Ten out of the 43 patients had END. Patients having END was significantly associated with lower chances of favorable and good outcomes at 3 months (p = 0. 01 and p = 0. 002, respectively). END was predicted when the non-core hypoperfused area overlapped on the corticospinal tract, which is defined as the expected END profile. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient between the 2 image readers to define images of expected END profiles was 0. 74. In 15 patients with expecte...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the role}} of {{cerebral}} small vessel disease (SVD), including white matter lesions (WMLs) and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> in mild parkinsonian signs (MPS) is increasingly being recognized, not all individuals with SVD have MPS. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we investigated whether the presence of MPS was dependent on the microstructural integrity underlying WMLs, the early loss of integrity of the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and location of this damage. We examined 483 elderly subjects with SVD and without parkinsonism. Subjects with severe loss of integrity within their WMLs had {{a higher risk of}} MPS, regardless of WML volume (fractional anisotropy odds ratios = 1. 9; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 1 – 3. 4). The same was found in the normal-appearing white matter, but this association disappeared after adjustment for WMLs and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts.</b> The integrity of the periventricular frontal regions-of-interest was significantly lower in subjects with MPS than without, independent of WMLs and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts.</b> This study indicates that integrity of WMLs, especially in the frontal lobe, is associated with MPS.

40|$|Cerebral microbleeds · Small vessel disease · Cognition Background: Cerebral {{small vessel}} disease (SVD) {{is a leading}} cause of {{cognitive}} decline in the elderly. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) have emerged as an important manifestation of ce-rebral SVD, in addition to <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> and white matter lesions (WMLs). We investigated whether the presence and location of CMBs in elderly subjects were associated with cognitive function, independent of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> and WMLs. Methods: One hundred and forty-eight nondemented elderly with SVD, defined as the presence of <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> and/or WMLs on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were studied. Executive function and global cognition were assessed by the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively. The differences in the scores for the FAB and MMSE between CMB-positive and CMB-negative subjects were calculated after adjusting for possible confounders. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 72. 4 ± 8. 6 years. CMBs were detected in 48 sub-jects (32 %), with a mean number of CMBs per subject of 1. 6 (range 0 – 31).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral {{small vessel}} disease, {{including}} white matter lesions and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> {{is related to}} cognitive impairment. Cerebral microbleeds (MBs) are increasingly being recognized as another manifestation of small vessel disease and are also related to cognitive function. However, it remains unclear whether this relation is independent of white matter lesions and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> and if location of MB plays a role. We investigated {{the relation between the}} presence, number, and location of MB and cognitive performance adjusted for white matter lesions and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts.</b> METHODS: Presence, number, and location of MB were rated on a gradient echo T 2 *-weighted MRI in 500 nondemented elderly patients with small vessel disease. Cognitive performance was assessed in different domains. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, depressive symptoms, total brain volume, white matter lesion volume, and <b>lacunar</b> and territorial <b>infarcts.</b> RESULTS: Mean age was 65. 6 years (SD 8. 8) and 57 % were male. MBs were present in 10. 4 % of the participants. Subjects with MBs were significantly older, had a higher white matter lesion volume, and more <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> (P< 0. 001). Presence and number of MBs were related to global cognitive function (beta- 0. 10, P= 0. 008; beta- 0. 20, P= 0. 002), psychomotor speed (beta- 0. 10, P= 0. 012; beta- 0. 19, P= 0. 006), and attention (beta- 0. 10, P= 0. 02; beta- 0. 205, P= 0. 001). The relations with cognitive performance were mainly driven by frontal, temporal, and strictly deep located MB. CONCLUSIONS: Frontal and temporal located MBs correlate with cognitive performance in nondemented elderly patients independent of coexisting other small vessel disease-related lesions. MBs are clinically not silent and may help to understand the role of vascular disease in cognitive decline...|$|R
40|$|Objective Our {{study focused}} on acute <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> shapes to explore the risk factors and {{clinical}} significance of irregularly shaped lacunar infarctions. Methods Based on the shape of their acute <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct,</b> patients (n= 204) were classified into the &# 8220;regular&# 8221; group or &# 8220;irregular&# 8221; group. The characteristics of the lacunar infarction were compared between the regular and irregular groups, between patients with and without neurological deterioration, and between patients with different modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores. The risk factors for irregularly shaped lacunar infarctions, neurological deterioration, and high mRS scores were identified. Results Blood pressure variability (BPV) was an independent risk factor for irregularly shaped lacunar infarction. Infarction size, prevalence of advanced leukoaraiosis, and irregularly shaped lacunar infarcts were independent risk factors for higher mRS scores. Conclusions The irregularly shaped lacunar infarcts were correlated with BPV. Irregularly shaped lacunar infarctions and leukoaraiosis {{may be associated with}} unfavorable clinical outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Lacunar infarcts {{constitute}} a subtype of stroke with {{a diameter of}} less than 15 mm manifested {{by the presence of}} lacunar syndromes. The ischemic lesion in lacunar infarcts may often be caused by occlusion of a single, small perforating artery. However it is known that lacunar infarcts may also be associated with large artery disease, cardioembolism, and other less frequently encountered causes including antiphospholipidic syndrome, amyloid angiopathy, infectious arteritis, and inflammatory arteritis. A <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> of venous type is unusual. A 72 -year-old woman presented with left hemiparesis that developed within the last several hours. She also had mild dementia for several months. Radiological examination showed a white matter <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> evidenced by restricted diffusion and T 2 abnormality and dural arteriovenous fistula of the superior sagittal sinus. Because the segment distal to the fistula was occluded the fistulous flow was drained away from the sinus via retrograde flow through the cortical veins, which leaded to intracranial venous hypertension. The findings in our patient suggest that venous causes should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of lacunar infarcts...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—The {{long term}} outcome after a single {{symptomatic}} <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct</b> {{may be less}} favourable than is generally assumed. Patients often present with complaints such as fatigue or "being different from before the stroke", for {{which there are no}} obvious physical explanations. Although cognitive functioning is considered normal in most patients with lacunar infarction in the internal capsule or corona radiata, a study was carried out to determine if subclinical changes in mental or emotional function can explain these vague complaints characteristic for their disablement.  METHODS— Sixteen patients, each with a single symptomatic supratentorial <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct,</b> and 16 matched healthy controls were examined with an extensive neuropsychological screening battery and a standardised questionnaire aimed at emotional problems. The mean number of correct responses was calculated for each subject and averaged within each group.  RESULTS—Although, on the whole, there were no differences in performance, patients' results on the following tasks in different modalities showed evidence for decreased performance under relatively more demanding conditions: line orientation task (mean difference (MD) 261 ms; 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) 94 to 428), Rey-Osterrieth delayed recall (MD− 3. 8, 95 % CI − 7. 5 to 0. 0), visual elevator subtest of the everyday attention task (EAT) (MD − 0. 7, 95 % CI − 1. 5 to 0. 1), lottery subtest of the EAT (MD − 0. 6, 95 % CI − 1. 3 to 0. 1) and WAIS similarities (MD − 3. 2 95 % CI − 6. 3 to 0. 1). Patients also more often had emotional disturbances than controls.  CONCLUSION—Both subtle cognitive impairments and emotional disturbances may play a part in the decreased competence in everyday life of patients with a supratentorial <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarct.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral {{microvascular}} disease predominantly affects brain {{white matter}} and deep grey matter, resulting in ischaemic damage {{that ranges from}} <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> to white matter hyperintensities seen on magnetic resonance imaging. These lesions are common and result in both clinical stroke syndromes and accumulate over time, resulting in cognitive deficits and dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that these lesions progress over time, accumulate adjacent to prior lesions and have a penumbral region susceptible to further injury. The pathological correlates of this adjacent injury in surviving myelinated axons have not been previously defined. In this study, we sought to determine the molecular organization of axons in tissue adjacent to <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> and in the regions surrounding microinfarcts, by determining critical elements in axonal function: the morphology and length of node of Ranvier segments and adjacent paranodal segments. We examined post-mortem brain tissue from six patients with <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> and tissue from two patients with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy and cerebral leukoencephalopathy (previously known as hereditary endotheliopathy with retinopathy, nephropathy and stroke) who accumulate progressive white matter ischae-mic lesions {{in the form of}} lacunar and microinfarcts. In axons adjacent to <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> yet extending up to 150 % of the infarct diameter away, both nodal and paranodal length increase by 20 % and 80 %, respectively, reflecting a loss of normal cell-cell adhesion and signalling between axons and oligodendrocytes. Using premorbid magnetic resonance images, brain regions from patients with retinal vasculopathy and cerebral leukoencephalopathy that harboured periventricular white matter hyperintensities were selected and the molecular organization of axons was determined within these regions.

40|$|Disruption of the {{blood-brain barrier}} has been {{proposed}} {{to be important in}} vascular cognitive impairment. Increased cerebrospinal fluid albumin and contrast-enhanced MRI provide supporting evidence, but quantification of the blood-brain barrier permeability in patients with vascular cognitive impairment is lacking. Therefore, we acquired dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantify blood-brain barrier permeability in vascular cognitive impairment. Method- We studied 60 patients with suspected vascular cognitive impairment. They had neurological and neuropsychological testing, permeability measurements with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and lumbar puncture to measure albumin index. Patients were separated clinically into subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD), multiple and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> and leukoaraiosis. Twenty volunteers were controls for the dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI studies, and control cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from 20 individuals undergoing spinal anesthesia for nonneurological problems. Thirty-six patients were classified as SIVD, 8 as multiple and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> and 9 as leukoaraiosis. The albumin index was significantly increased in the SIVD group compared with 20 control subjects. Permeabilities for the patients with vascular cognitive impairment measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were significantly increased over control subjects (P< 0. 05). Patient age did not correlate with either the blood-brain barrier permeability or albumin index. Highest albumin index values were seen in the SIVD group (P< 0. 05) and were significantly increased over multiple and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts.</b> K(i) values were elevated over control subjects in SIVD but were similar to multiple and <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts.</b> There was abnormal permeability in white matter in patients with SIVD as shown by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and albumin index.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the effect of a}} nurse-led multidomain cardiovascular intervention on white matter hyperintensity (WMH) progression and incident <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in community-dwelling elderly with hypertension. The preDIVA trial (Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care) was an open-label, cluster-randomized controlled trial in community-dwelling individuals aged 70 to 78 years. General practices were assigned by computer-generated randomization to 6 -year nurse-led, multidomain intensive vascular care or standard care. Of 3526 preDIVA participants, 195 nondemented participants with a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm[*]Hg were consecutively recruited to undergo magnetic resonance imaging at 2 to 3 and 5 to 6 years after baseline. WMH volumes were measured automatically, <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> assessed visually, blinded to treatment allocation. One hundred and twenty-six participants were available for longitudinal analysis (64 intervention and 62 control). Annual WMH volume increase in milliliter was similar for intervention (mean= 0. 73, SD= 0. 84) and control (mean= 0. 70, SD= 0. 59) participants (adjusted mean difference, - 0. 08 mL; 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 30 to 0. 15; P= 0. 50). Analyses suggested greater intervention effects with increasing baseline WMH volumes (P for interaction= 0. 03). New <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> developed in 6 (9 %) intervention and 2 (3 %) control participants (odds ratio, 2. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 4 - 12. 1; P= 0. 36). Nurse-led vascular care in hypertensive community-dwelling older persons did not diminish WMH accumulation over 3 years. However, our results do suggest this type of intervention could be effective in persons with high WMH volumes. There was no effect on <b>lacunar</b> <b>infarcts</b> incidence but numbers were low.
