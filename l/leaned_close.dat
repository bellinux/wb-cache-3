6000|$|When he was able, he rose, and <b>leaned</b> <b>close</b> {{over the}} Wieroo, lying silent and motionless, his wings {{dropping}} limply and his great, round eyes staring blankly toward the ceiling.

6000|$|That action {{recalled}} Gale's earlier mood, {{the joy of}} the present, and {{he turned}} to Nell's sweet face.
