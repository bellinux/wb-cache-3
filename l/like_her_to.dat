5|$|On June 20, 2014, Deadline {{announced}} {{the cast of}} the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers {{wanted to write a}} Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would {{have to be able to}} film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think they would ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, Francis, a {{soap opera}} [...] "legend", reunited with her former onscreen husband, Anthony Geary, during the [...] "Soap Opera Spectacular" [...] episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. Both Francis and Geary {{were part of the}} supercouple pairing of Luke and Laura on the ABC Daytime soap opera General Hospital. When {{questioned}} by show host Oprah Winfrey if Francis would ever reprise the role of Laura Spencer, she revealed: [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be funny and {{have a little bit of}} an agenda that might look a little bit vengeful, but it really isn’t. I think she’d have a plan. If there is a way to go forward with Laura and make her into what I'd <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be now, then perhaps I would do it. There is nothing in me that is willing to play a victim anymore. I’m sort of done with the wounded dove in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Whenever we work {{together}} she always sits with me and listens to the song, and says [...] "tell me what this song is about to you." [...] She's very methodical in her thinking. We talk about it, she writes down words that I say describing what the song's about and the sentiment that I'd <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> get out there, and then she goes away and she works on it. She writes it, she comes back. She does a version of it, we talk about it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel laughed; he <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{talk that}} way, and promised he would {{hold up a}} while.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] said Henrietta, [...] "the new Clergyman approves of {{all that}} sort of thing; he <b>likes</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> teach, and puts her in the way of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me {{all that}} has happened, Father," [...] and the old priest, who <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> call him by that name, smiled again with his eyes, and squatted down {{in the corner of}} the tent.|$|R
500|$|Asked in July 2006 {{what she}} hoped for Kyla {{in the long}} run, Ayola responded: [...] "Most of all I’d {{like to see her}} laugh, big belly laughs as she has not done much of that! ...I also would <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> find a man that she is with not just because he is {{attractive}} but someone who can work her out and understand her". [...] Several months after this interview, the character was romantically linked to newcomer and former guest star, general surgical consultant Abra Durant, played by Adrian Edmondson. Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two would ever get back together, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." [...] The two ultimately left Holby together, moving to Ghana.|$|E
500|$|The single {{also drew}} {{comparisons}} to [...] "Party O'Clock," [...] a 2010 single by American singer Kat DeLuna, also produced by RedOne. In {{a statement issued}} to the New York Daily News, DeLuna said [...] "It's cool that artists like J.Lo are inspired by my musical sound and style. ... Jennifer helped {{pave the way for}} Latinas like myself. I love her", and insisted that there wasn't an issue. DeLuna also noted Lopez as someone who inspired her, and paved the way for someone <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> perform. Following previews of the music video for [...] "On the Floor," [...] DeLuna changed her mind about how she felt with the claims of copying. In another interview with the New York Daily News, several days after the first, she said [...] "I've seen this before, where the more established artist tries to take the vision and artistic ideas away from an emerging artist, and assumes no one will notice because of their bigger shadow,... Luckily, my loyal fans {{and the power of the}} Internet have let the 'Kat' out of the bag." [...] Lopez was interviewed about the issue on Hispanic-American entertainment program ¡Despierta America!. Lopez replied [...] "What? Really? I'm not aware of that...", and when pressed by the presenter a second time, insisted she had not heard rumors of the comparisons.|$|E
500|$|In late 2011, Yusef {{manages to}} win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia {{explains}} why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> <b>To</b> be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E
60|$|Margaret {{would not}} keep her long, saying she <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be with Norman, {{but she found}} him with his head sunk on his open book, fast asleep. At dinner-time, Harry and Tom, rushing in, awoke him with a violent start.|$|R

50|$|Ilona Friedman came to Vienna from Hungary in 1944, {{when she}} and her family were part of a {{transport}} of Jews. When the air strikes on Vienna intensified, children <b>like</b> <b>her</b> had <b>to</b> tidy up streets, and cemeteries, after bombings. Ilona and people <b>like</b> <b>her</b> had <b>to</b> beg for money, and food on the streets since they had nothing to eat and were hungry all the time.|$|R
500|$|After her {{break up}} with Jay, Abi becomes a much nastier and bitter person. She begins a {{relationship}} with Ben (now played by Harry Reid), which is discovered by Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) who informs Max of the relationship. [...] Max demands that Abi does not see Ben anymore, which Abi refuses to do. Abi later discovers that Max used Ben to sign over part of Phil's businesses to him. In February 2015, Abi is accused by Max of killing Lucy. Abi did not kill Lucy, but it is revealed that on the night Lucy died, Abi had a confrontation with Lucy about her affair with Max, which resulted in Abi slapping Lucy. After Max tells her that Tanya would <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> move to Devon with her, Abi refuses and instead moves in with Ben and his family. After she moves in, Ben reveals {{to her that he}} might still be gay and is worried he will never get over his homosexuality but Abi assures him that they will make things work. She continuously mocks Jay and accuses him of being jealous of her relationship with Ben. Jay tries to make Abi see that Ben is not interested in her, but she pretends not to care about what Jay says. Abi discovers a letter from Sharon's birth mother and Sharon says that she intends on meeting her birth father after discovering that her mother has died. When Paul Coker (Jonny Labey) arrives in Walford, Abi suspects Ben of cheating on her with Paul. She and Ben have sex, so Ben can convince her he is not gay. Following Ben's arrest for Lucy's murder, Abi tells Phil that Max assaulted Lucy to get Ben off. Despite being innocent, Max turns himself in and is formally charged while Ben is released. Stacey visits Max, who tells her that he thinks Abi killed Lucy. Stacey confronts Abi, who attacks Stacey, blaming her for her parents' split and Bradley's death, and later vents to Carol that she does not think Max cares about her. Carol visits Max in prison, where he informs her that the reason he thinks Abi killed Lucy is because she attacked and beat her {{on the night of the}} murder. After confronting Abi on this, Carol agrees that she has been out of control lately and advises her to call Tanya for moral support. During the phone call, Abi finds out that not only is Oscar ill, but Cora had apparently not stayed with Tanya at her house as she had earlier said. Abi, Carol and Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) find Cora living rough and bring her home. She reveals she saw Max and Abi cleaning the car lot after Lucy was killed, forcing Abi to admit that Max and Lucy had argued there and she was helping Max clean Lucy's blood. Abi then gives a statement to the police. Max is later found guilty of the murder.|$|E
2500|$|Duckworth {{fell and}} broke her leg in August 2009 while at her Quebec cottage. She was treated in {{hospital}} in Magog, Quebec where her condition deteriorated. As she received palliative care, Duckworth reportedly told visitors, [...] "I'm {{going to leave}} you now. It's time for me to go. Everything is ready." [...] Then she added: [...] "Be happy with each other. You have each other. Goodbye, I'm going now." [...] Her imminent death drew this comment from her friend, the well-known scholar and peace activist Ursula Franklin: [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be remembered as somebody who demonstrated that it's possible to change one's society, to be profoundly critical and still remain a respected member of that society." [...] Muriel Duckworth died on August 22, 2009 aged 100. Her biographer, Marion Douglas Kerans said, [...] "She showed women how to become true leaders in their community, and in the world, without losing any feminine grace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hugh Laurie as Senator Tom James: {{a charming}} senator and Selina's new running mate after Doyle leaves the ticket. He is {{extremely}} popular with his colleagues and with voters. Selina {{was reluctant to}} pick him as a running mate {{out of fear that}} he would remember a time they nearly slept together. He frustrates Meyer at his desire to be involved with the economy, {{going so far as to}} request to serve simultaneously as Vice President and Secretary of the Treasury. In the general election, loophole rules in the Constitution dictate that in certain circumstances, James could become the Acting President (and subsequently President), further angering Selina. He offers that, should this occur, he would <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be his Vice President. She later appoints him as her economy czar. Before the fourth season, Armando Iannucci met with Laurie in the UK after learning that he was a fan of Veep. The two began developing the character Tom James alongside the show's writers (also based in the UK). Iannucci describes Tom James as a [...] "normal, but ambitious operator ... this is someone who seems to outdo [...] in his ability." [...] (Seasons 4–6) ...|$|E
60|$|She {{made him}} talk of his business, {{and he told}} her of Corey's offer, and what he had done about it. She did not seem to care for his part in it, however; at which Lapham was silently {{disappointed}} a little, for he would have <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> praise him.|$|R
60|$|The {{light from}} the rose-shaded lamp fell on her neck and arms--Soames <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> dine in a low dress, it gave him an inexpressible feeling of superiority to the {{majority}} of his acquaintance, whose wives were contented with their best high frocks or with tea-gowns, when they dined at home. Under that rosy light her amber-coloured hair and fair skin made strange contrast with her dark brown eyes.|$|R

2500|$|Most significantly, {{the desire}} to {{dominate}} others is what motivates the Crawfords. Henry Crawford is attracted to Fanny Price because he cannot fathom her mind, and is obsessed with [...] "knowing" [...] her, to destroy her identity and remake her into his own image of what he wants her to be, making him in many respects in Edwards's viewpoint the most monstrous of Austen's villains as he wants to erase Fanny's identity just to please his own vanity. Mary Crawford is likewise in her relations with Edmund is not prepared to accept him as he is, but only to remade into her own image of what a man should be. Edwards argued Austen could have easily titled Mansfield Park Conscience and Consciousness as the novel's main conflict is the struggle between conscience, what people really feel in their souls, and consciousness, which understood {{at the time to}} mean [...] "having one's thoughts and attention unduly centered in one's own personality". The climactic struggle of the novel is Henry's efforts to win Fanny so he could impose his will on her, to remake her as he would <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be, and Fanny's efforts to maintain her identity. Even when Henry tries to please Fanny as when renounces acting and discusses Shakespeare, he is still acting as he keeps a careful watch on Fanny's reaction, measuring his every word and the reaction on her face. Edwards wrote that the theatrical aspect of Henry, the man who is always acting {{can be seen in the}} way in which he considers careers in the Church of England and the Royal Navy after encounters with Edmund and William respectively, a man who has no identity of his own and who constantly reinvents himself.|$|E
2500|$|In season five, {{the gang}} begins {{to settle into}} their new lives at Wolfram & Hart. [...] Gunn {{undergoes}} a special cognitive procedure that transforms him into a brilliant lawyer. [...] The group receives an amulet that resurrects a past companion of Angelus, the en-souled vampire Spike, initially as a ghost-like presence but later regains corporeal status due to the machinations of Lindsey McDonald in a surprise return. [...] Cordelia, {{who has been in}} a coma, has The Powers That Be grant her one last request, in which she helps Angel get [...] "back on track", then dies. [...] Angel is briefly reunited with his son Connor, now in a new identity thanks to the agreement between Angel and Wolfram & Hart at the end of Season Four. Connor regains the memories of his former identity, but doesn't acknowledge this to protect his new parents (though he later reveals that he remembers his previous life to Angel). [...] Fred finally declares her affections to Wesley, but shortly after is possessed by an ancient and powerful demon called Illyria. [...] Wesley is devastated by the loss of Fred, but agrees to help Illyria adjust to her new form and the unfamiliar world she's in. [...] Angel, after getting one last vision from Cordelia before her death, infiltrates the Circle of the Black Thorn, a secret society responsible for engineering the Apocalypse, and plans to take them all out in a simultaneous, hard-hitting strike. [...] Because this is probably a suicide mission, he tells each of his friends to spend the day as if it were their last. [...] That night, the team launches its attack on the Circle, dividing up their targets. [...] When Wesley is fatally stabbed, Illyria, concerned for his safety, arrives at his side after killing her targets, but is unable to save him. [...] Illyria asks Wesley if he'd <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> assume the form of Fred, and Wesley agrees, allowing him to say goodbye to the woman he loved. [...] Lorne leaves and disappears into the night, his innocence destroyed, after fulfilling Angel's last order to kill Lindsey, the former Wolfram & Hart lawyer who had turned his back on the firm. Angel confronts Senior Partners' new liaison Marcus Hamilton, and defeats him with help from Connor.|$|E
2500|$|Slim buys a {{house and}} changes her name to Erin Ann Shleeter. Although their future looks bright after a visit from Joe, Mitch's friend tracks them down, passing the {{information}} on to Mitch. Mitch comes to the area, and hides in Slim's house. As she is going about her morning routine, to her horror, Mitch suddenly appears from the shadows in her hallway, saying he wants Slim back, promising [...] "it will be different." [...] When she refuses, he attacks, waking Gracie, who runs to help her mother, and jerks on his hair. [...] Mitch flings Gracie to the floor, which creates a diversion, and allows an opportunity for Slim to retaliate with pepper spray. Snatching up Gracie, as Mitch rolls {{on the floor in}} pain, she is prepared for a fast get-away, having an escape plan. A car chase ensues between Slim and Robbie (Noah Wyle, revealed earlier as Mitch's [...] "wing man" [...] during the encounter at the diner years before) while Gracie screams in the background. Realizing she cannot live her life in fear, Slim goes into hiding in San Francisco, hires a woman who looks <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> keep her cover, and sends Gracie away to Hawaii with her best friend Ginny {{to get her out of}} harm's way. She prepares herself with a self-defense trainer (Bruce A. Young) who teaches her Krav Maga, since self-defense is not murder. During her training, he gives Slim the final lesson - if Mitch knocks her down, she is to hold on to his voice and awaken when he is about to attack or kick her. She returns to Los Angeles, breaks into Mitch's new home and waits for him there to return home from work, after hiding his guns and blocking the phone connections, so he cannot call the police. When he arrives, Slim makes her presence known once he realizes someone's there. She approaches him to begin fighting, but when he says he cannot hit her, she asks him why he could do it before when she was defenseless. She provokes him, and in the ensuing fight, Slim uses her new skills, beating Mitch until he becomes unconscious. After an opportunity to kill him with an object, she cannot bear to do it and throws the object away. She calls Ginny saying she cannot kill him, and while on the phone Mitch hits her from behind with a lamp. Slim puts into practice what she learned in her training and trips, beats and kicks him in the chest and sends him off a balcony to his death. She calls the police, who rule her actions as self-defense.|$|E

60|$|Lord Montfort was {{extremely}} fond of jewels, and held {{that you could}} not see them to advantage, or fairly judge of their water or colour, except on a beautiful woman.
