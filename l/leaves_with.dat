In the low-fruit season, they eat whatever fruit is available in addition to tree bark and <b>leaves,</b> <b>with</b> daily intake at only 2,000 calories. Together with a long lactation period, orangutans also have a long birth interval.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have <b>leaves</b> <b>with</b> red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust {{from north to}} south and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team <b>leaves</b> <b>with</b> no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team <b>leaves</b> <b>with</b> $15,000 divided equally.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aculeata, {{commonly}} known as prickly banksia, is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, it has dense foliage and <b>leaves</b> <b>with</b> very prickly serrated margins. Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981—by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics often vary by habitat, between shade-dwelling genera (such as Prosartes, Tricyrtis, Cardiocrinum, Clintonia, Medeola, Prosartes, and Scoliopus) and sun loving genera. Shade-dwelling genera {{usually have}} broader <b>leaves</b> <b>with</b> smooth edges and net venation, and fleshy fruits (berries) with animal-dispersed seeds, rhizomes, and small, {{inconspicuous}} flowers while genera native to sunny habitats usually have narrow, parallel-veined leaves, capsular fruits with wind-dispersed seeds, bulbs, and large, visually conspicuous flowers. (See also Evolution).|$|E
5|$|George placed B.aculeata in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} {{inflorescence}} {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike; in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B.ser. Tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be B.caleyi, from which it differs in having narrower <b>leaves</b> <b>with</b> fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from red to cream rather than from cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.|$|E

5|$|Roridula has a {{more complex}} {{relationship}} with its prey. The plants in this genus produce sticky <b>leaves</b> <b>with</b> resin-tipped glands that look {{similar to those of}} larger Drosera. However, the resin, unlike mucilage, is unable to carry digestive enzymes. Therefore, Roridula species do not directly benefit from the insects they catch. Instead, they form a mutualistic symbiosis with species of assassin bugs that eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' feces.|$|E
