2500|$|On March 2, 2015, {{the trial}} began in U.S. District Court for Northern Florida. On {{the first day}} of testimony, the {{prosecution}} discussed Hovind and Hansen's [...] "dozens of filings", including several <b>lis</b> <b>pendens,</b> used to resist a court-ordered forfeiture due in part to legal advice Hovind took from his [...] "cellmate in a New Hampshire prison camp". The prosecution case included numerous emails, recorded phone calls, and court filings related to the forfeited properties. The prosecution presented audio of Hovind characterizing a <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> by asking his daughter, [...] "Have you ever taken a step into dog crap and it gets stuck on your feet and it's really hard to get off?" [...] Hansen and Hovind took the stand in their own defense. According to journalist Kevin Robinson, during Hovind's testimony, he [...] "refused to give short answers" [...] and said that he believed his actions were lawful. On March 12, 2015, Hovind was found guilty on one count of criminal contempt, Hansen on two counts of criminal contempt, and jury was hung on the remaining charges.|$|E
5000|$|Pendente lite {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>lis</b> <b>pendens.</b> <b>Lis</b> <b>pendens</b> also means [...] "a pending lawsuit", but <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> is a document filed in the public records of the county where particular real property is located stating that a pending lawsuit may affect the title to the property. Because nobody wants to buy real estate if its ownership is in dispute, a <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> notice effectively ties up the property until the case is resolved. <b>Lis</b> <b>pendens</b> notices are often filed in divorce actions when there is disagreement about selling or dividing the family home.|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{has limited}} application in most civil law jurisdictions which prefer <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens,</b> although the principle behind FNC is acknowledged.

50|$|First, Article 27 (2012 recast: Article 29) of the Regulation {{contains}} the <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> rule: proceedings involving the same cause {{and between the}} same parties brought in the courts of different Member States must be stayed until {{the jurisdiction of the}} court first seised has been established, after which it must decline jurisdiction.|$|R
25|$|A concern often {{raised in}} {{applications}} of the doctrine is forum shopping, or picking a court merely to gain an advantage in the proceeding. This concern is balanced against the public policy of deferring to a plaintiff's choice of venue in claims where {{there may be more}} than one appropriate jurisdiction. The underlying principles, such as basing respect given to foreign courts on reciprocal respect or comity, also apply in civil law systems {{in the form of the}} legal doctrine of <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens.</b>|$|R
50|$|While it is {{generally}} thought of in connection with real property (land, buildings, and the like), the doctrine of <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> also applies to personal property. Frequently, <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> statutes only apply to real property, so the common-law doctrine probably still applies to personal property.|$|E
50|$|The {{recording}} {{office will}} record a <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> upon request {{of anyone who}} claims {{to be entitled to}} do so (e.g. because he has filed a lawsuit). If someone else with an interest in the property (e.g. the owner) believes the <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> is not proper, he can then file suit to have it expunged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lis</b> <b>pendens</b> {{is taken}} as {{constructive}} notice of the pending lawsuit, and it serves to place a cloud on {{the title of the}} property in question until the suit is resolved and the notice released or the <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> is expunged. Careful buyers will be unwilling to purchase land subject to a <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> or will only purchase the land at a discount, prudent lenders will not lend money against the security of the land, and title insurance companies will not insure the title to such land: title is taken subject to the outcome of the lawsuit. Because so much real property is purchased with borrowed money, this usually keeps the owner from selling the property. It also may keep the owner from borrowing money secured by the property (such as to pay the costs of defending the suit).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{attempt to}} examine whether the {{application}} of the <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> provisions {{to be found in the}} Brussels and Lugano Conventions (the former now being replaced by the Brussels I Regulation) does not unreasonably limit the right of access to court.

50|$|In the United States, Seguros Del Estado SA v. Scientific Games Inc. U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (2001) {{there was}} alleged {{parallel}} litigation in Georgia and Colombia. It was {{held that the}} threshold question was whether the two cases were genuinely parallel. Applying Finova Capital Corp. v. Ryan Helicopters U.S.A., Inc., 180 F.3d 896, 898 (7th Cir. 1999), the court concluded that the two cases were not parallel since they involved materially different issues, documents, and parties. Thus, <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> {{did not apply to}} terminate the proceedings.|$|R
50|$|The {{reference}} for a preliminary ruling {{were made on}} 25 March 2002, and observations were made -in addition to the parties in the dispute- by Italy, the United Kingdom and the European Commission. While Italy, the Commission and Misat contended that the <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> doctrine needed to take precedence, and that thus the court second seized should stay its proceedings until the first court had decided on its position, the UK and Gasser argued that {{the choice of the}} parties should take immediate precedence over the <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> rule.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lis</b> <b>pendens</b> is Latin for [...] "suit pending". This may {{refer to}} any pending lawsuit or to a {{specific}} situation with a public notice of litigation that has been recorded in the same location where the title of real property has been recorded. This notice secures a plaintiff's claim on the property so that a sale, mortgage, or encumbrance of the property will not diminish plaintiff's rights to the property, should the plaintiff prevail in its case. In some jurisdictions, when the notice is properly recorded, <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> is considered constructive notice to other litigants or other unrecorded or subordinate lienholders.|$|E
50|$|In United States law, a <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> is {{a written}} notice that a lawsuit has been filed {{concerning}} real estate, involving either the {{title to the}} property or a claimed ownership interest in it. The notice is usually filed in the county land records office. Recording a <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> against a piece of property alerts a potential purchaser or lender that the property’s title is in question, which makes the property less attractive to a buyer or lender. Once the notice is filed, the legal title of anyone who nevertheless purchases the land or property described in the notice {{is subject to the}} ultimate decision of the lawsuit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{doctrine}} of FNC gained little footing {{in the civil}} law world, which prefers the approach of <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> (see Articles 21-23 Brussels Convention). The civil law jurisdictions generally base jurisdiction on the residence of the defendant and on choice of law rules favouring the habitual residence of the parties, the lex situs, and the lex loci solutionis (applying actor sequitur forum rei). This reflects an expectation that a defendant should be sued at his [...] "own" [...] courts, modified to reflect different priorities in certain types of case.

50|$|The use of anchor {{defendants}} as a litigation strategy relies upon {{two basic}} principles common to most legal systems. The {{first is that}} where a cause of action involves claims against multiple parties, it is convenient {{for all of those}} claims to be tried together to avoid the risk of inconsistent results. The second is that courts in different jurisdictions should seek to avoid holding concurrent trials relating to the same claims (this is usually referred to as the doctrine of <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens),</b> both the avoid the risk of inconsistent results and to avoid defendants having to respond to the same claims in different courts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} {{has limited}} application in most civil law jurisdictions which prefer <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens,</b> although the principle behind FNC is acknowledged. As {{a member of}} the European Union, the United Kingdom signed the Brussels Convention. The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act (1982) as amended by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act (1991) states: Nothing in this Act shall prevent any court in the UK from staying, sisting or stopping a process, or summoning a party, striking out or dismissing any proceedings before it on the ground of forum non conveniens or otherwise, where to do so is not inconsistent with the 1968 Brussels Convention or, as the case may be, the Lugano Convention.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that the presence of a <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> does not prevent or necessarily invalidate a transfer of the property, although it makes such a transfer subject to the outcome of the litigation. Thus, the owner is not prevented from selling the land for (non-borrowed) cash, pledging it as security for a speculative loan, or giving it away, all subject to the outcome of the lawsuit. However, once the <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> is recorded, the recipient (a [...] "purchaser" [...] or [...] "grantee pendente lite") would be deemed to have notice of the litigation and might lose their title to the property if the plaintiff's suit prevails.|$|E
50|$|A civil fraud {{case against}} {{them has been}} filed on behalf of Louis Paolino, Jr. who lost more than $5.8 million, and a <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> {{has been placed on}} the Sarasota {{waterfront}} residences owned by both men.|$|E
50|$|Some states' <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> {{statutes}} {{require the}} filer of the notice, {{in the event}} of a challenge to the notice, to establish that it has probable cause or a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of its case in the underlying lawsuit. Other states do not have such a requirement.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principle}} of <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> (Latin for [...] "dispute elsewhere pending") applies both in municipal law, public international law, and {{private international law}} {{to address the problem}} of potentially contradictory judgments. If two courts were to hear the same dispute, it is possible they would reach inconsistent decisions. To avoid the problem, there are two rules. Res judicata provides that once a case has been determined, it produces a judgment either inter partes or in rem depending on the subject matter of the dispute, i.e. although there can be an appeal on the merits, neither party can recommence proceedings on the same set of facts in another court. If this rule were not in place, litigation might never come to an end. The second rule is that proceedings on the same facts cannot be commenced in a second court if the lis i.e. action, is already pendens, i.e. pending, in another court. <b>Lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> arises from international comity and it permits a court to refuse to exercise jurisdiction when there is parallel litigation pending in another jurisdiction. Shany (2003) considers the problem within the public international law field where, for example, the Southern Bluefin Tuna dispute could have been determined either by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or by tribunals established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the Swordfish dispute, which was submitted simultaneously to both the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and a dispute settlement panel of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Kwak and Marceau (2002) consider the jurisdiction between the dispute settlement mechanisms of regional trade agreements (RTAs) and that of the WTO.|$|R

5000|$|MISAT {{relied on}} Article 21 of the Brussels Convention, a {{convention}} {{to which all}} members of the European Community were party, and which regulates which court within those states has jurisdiction. The convention contains a lis alibi pendens-rule: where proceedings involving the same issue and between the same parties are brought before the courts of different Member States, the court seised second must stay proceedings up until the jurisdiction of the court first seised has been established - after which the court second seised must decline jurisdiction if the court first seised is indeed found to have jurisdiction. Consequently, Article 21 of the Convention establishes a type of [...] "first come, first served"-rule: when there is a triple identity in parties, object, as well as cause of action, the court that has been seised second will only be able to decide in the case when it has been decided in the first court that the latter has no jurisdiction. The Report Jenard cites the need to [...] "facilitate the proper administration of justice within the Community" [...] as the underlying idea behind this <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> rule, as irreconcilable judgments would obstruct such proper administration and ultimately be detrimental to the [...] "mutual trust in the administration of justice in the Community". Consequently, the lis pendens-rule can be considered as an expression of the Regulation's search for both certainty and the preservation of mutual trust amongst Member States.|$|R

40|$|The European Union Succession Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 650 / 2012) (hereafter Succession Regulation) {{provides}} a comprehensive {{treatment of the}} diverse private international law issues concerning succession, encompassing within the same instrument rules on jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions and authentic instruments in succession matters. At the same time, each of these sets of rules coexisting within the Regulation bears its own regime in terms of spatial applicability. As concerns the rules on jurisdiction, these tend to regulate comprehensively all succession disputes, including those more closely connected to a third country, by providing for subsidiary jurisdiction rules and for a rule on forum necessitatis. Still, the rules contained in the Regulation as concerns choice of forum, as well as <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> and related actions, are conceived from a purely inter partes perspective. This causes {{on the one hand}} the impossibility of re-establishing Gleichlauf where the deceased made a professio iuris in favour of the law of a third country, and, on the other hand, does not ensure a satisfactory coordination with parallel proceedings pending before third country courts. The subsidiary jurisdiction rules may in turn cause an excessive enlargement of the scope of the jurisdiction of Member States’ courts, and could also hinder the unity of the succession. The latter concern is likely to arise also in respect of the mechanism embodied in Article 12 (1) of the Regulation, which achieves a rather incomplete coordination with the jurisdiction exercised by third country courts. Some suggestions will be submitted for amendments to be made to the Succession Regulation in order to overcome these shortcomings...|$|R
40|$|The Court Jurisdiction and Proceedings Transfer Act (CJPTA) codifies the {{substantive}} law of jurisdiction in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. One {{of the questions}} that may be posed by the future of the CJPTA is how the jurisdictional system that it enacts would function in relation to two potential international conventions that are contemplated by the Hague Conference on Private International Law. One, a convention on the enforcement of judgments, is in an advanced stage of negotiation and may well be adopted by the Hague Conference. It deals with jurisdiction indirectly, by defining jurisdictional standards or “filters” that must be satisfied for civil and commercial judgments to be recognized under its rules. A remoter possibility, but expressly on the Conference’s agenda, is a further convention dealing with jurisdiction directly, potentially including acceptable standards of jurisdiction and dealing with issues of forum non conveniens (declining jurisdiction) and <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> (parallel proceedings pursued concurrently in a foreign court). This paper compares the CJPTA’s jurisdictional rules with those included as “filters” in the latest draft of the judgments convention in February 2017, and with those that might form part of a further convention to harmonize jurisdictional rules directly. It concludes that the CJPTA could operate without difficulty in relation to the proposed judgments convention and, very probably, an eventual jurisdiction convention, because its jurisdictional standards are, almost without exception, more liberal than those incorporated in the Hague models. The paper also suggests that {{there is no reason to}} modify the CJPTA so as to bring it closer to the rules being developed in The Hague, since the CJPTA regulates jurisdiction, not just in international, but also in interprovincial cases, where different standards are appropriate...|$|R
40|$|In the {{legislative}} acts {{adopted by the}} EU {{in the field of}} private international law different approaches are present as concerns the spatial applicability of the rules addressing, respectively, issues of jurisdiction and of applicable law. Whereas the latter rules tend to apply universally or erga omnes, that is, also in the event in which they designate the law of a third country, the former rules usually apply purely inter partes, in such terms as to address only the jurisdiction of Member States' courts. The tension between these two approaches is particularly evident within Regulation (EU) No. 650 / 2012 (the European Succession Regulation), which provides within a single text a comprehensive set of rules addressing the various private international law issues concerning succession. Also within this Regulation, in fact, different approaches are adopted concerning the spatial aplicability of its rules. As concerns the rules on jurisdiction, these tend to regulate comprehensively all succession disputes, including those more closely connected to a third country, by providing for subsidiary jurisdiction rules and for a rule on forum necessitatis. Nonetheless, the rules contained in the Regulation as concerns choice of forum, as well as <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> and related actions, apply purely inter partes. This causes on the one hand the impossibility of re-establishing a correspondence between forum and ius in case the deceased made a professio iuris in favour of the law of a third country, and, on the other hand, does not ensure a satisfactory coordination with parallel proceedings pending before third country courts. The subsidiary jurisdiction rules may in turn cause an excessive enlargement of the scope of the jurisdiction of Member States’ courts, and could also bring attempt to unity of the succession. The latter concern is likely to arise also in respect of the mechanism embodied in Article 12, para. 1, of the Regulation, which achieves a rather incomplete coordination with the jurisdiction exercised by third country courts...|$|R
5000|$|Where a {{fraudulent}} conveyance is alleged, the judgment creditor {{must make a}} [...] "motion in equity" [...] to attack that conveyance. A general creditor, who has not reduced the debt owed to a judgment, must file a [...] "bill in equity" [...] with the court and must file a notice of <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> on the property alleged {{to have been the}} subject of a fraudulent or voluntary conveyance. The issue of whether the conveyance is one that can be upset will then be tried in court.|$|E
5000|$|Chapter II, Section 9 of the Regulation {{deals with}} the {{hypothesis}} of <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> and related actions. The common objective and background rationality of all these articles is to [...] "avoid the risk of conflicting judgments and thus to facilitate the proper administration of justice in the Community" [...] by preventing that the same or related actions be decided upon by courts in different Member States. For {{the purposes of the}} articles under this section, Article 30 (2012 recast: Article 32(1)) defines what it constitutes for a court to be ‘seised’.|$|E
5000|$|The harsh {{effect of}} this rule, {{and its effect on}} {{innocent}} purchasers, led many jurisdictions to enact <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> statutes requiring a written notice, usually recorded in the land records where the real estate is located, for the notice provisions of the rule to be effective. Typically, a separate recorded instrument is required by statute if the lawsuit in question affects title to real property. If the statutory requirements are met, the world is put on [...] "constructive notice" [...] of the existence of the suit, and any person acquiring an interest later does so subject to the outcome of the suit.|$|E
5000|$|Arising out of comity which {{requires}} each Member State {{to respect the}} courts and judgments of other Members, the theory underpinning Article 27 is a blunt and inflexible instrument because its effect is to stimulate each party to initiate proceedings before the court most likely to produce a favourable outcome. Thus, instead of avoiding forum shopping, it actually turns it into a race (Hartley: 1988). Where one party in a legal relationship foresees that action may be brought against them, they can pre-empt this and bring their own action {{to the court of}} their choice. This will result in the delaying of proceedings while jurisdiction is established. It may also mean that the case is decided in the court they wish, if it is established that the court has jurisdiction. This strategy has become known as a [...] "torpedo" [...] proceeding. The abuse of Article 27 was first described by Franzosi (1997 and 2002) in intellectual property disputes where a party infringing a patent commenced proceedings for a declaration before a court with long delays {{because of the number of}} cases waiting to be heard. Thus, no other European court could accept jurisdiction in cases alleging infringement by the patent holder. One possible response to this abuse of process might arise from the relationship between exclusive jurisdiction granted under Article 16 and the Article 27(2) mandatory duty. Article 29 reserves the priority for the first court when both courts have exclusive jurisdiction under Article 16. But the ECJ has not ruled on the situation where only the second court has exclusive jurisdiction. Article 35 provides that a judgment that conflicts with the provisions on exclusive jurisdiction cannot be recognised and enforced. Since Article 16(4) allows exclusive jurisdiction to the forum in the place of registration, this might provide an arguable case that the second court could review the ground upon which the first court had accepted the action. A further interesting development lies in the application of Article 6 which provides for multi-party proceedings and allows a person domiciled in a Member State to be sued in the state of any one of the defendants so long as there is a real connection between the cause of action and that state. The justification of this provision is one of efficiency. If an action involving many defendants and states can be consolidated, a single judgment enforced in all the relevant states saves costs and time and some Member States are now issuing cross-border injunctions in intellectual property (IP) disputes (see Eisengraeber (2004) for a detailed evaluation of this option). A final option to consider is that the IP licensor should include exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the grant of all licences. Although such clauses almost certainly do not prevail over <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens,</b> some courts have been persuaded to prefer the parties' choice over torpedo actions. However, this approach will potentially create conflicting judgments and Article 35 will deny recognition to the subsequent forum's decisions. This situation may represent a breach of Article 6 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights which stipulates that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time. As it stands, one party's selection of a forum suffering from inordinate delays, effectively denies all the other parties a hearing. But it is uncertain whether the European Court of Human Rights would find this prejudice to be a breach of Article 6.|$|R
50|$|Even when a clear {{choice of}} court {{agreement}} is in place (and thus only that court would have exclusive jurisdiction), that court must stay its proceedings if another court within the Brussels regime was seized earlier until that court has determined {{that it has no}} jurisdiction according to the <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> doctrine. The new Article 31(2) in the 2012 recast regulation allows courts to take jurisdiction in such cases even if it is not the court first seized. This clause is consistent with the 2005 Hague Choice of Court Agreements convention, which the Union has signed, and for which the approval regulation is currently evaluated by the European Parliament.|$|E
