40|$|The {{analysis}} of anamnestic and clinical indices, and also morphological investigation of biopsy materials of mucous coat of stomach and duodenum {{in children with}} chronic gastroduodenitis of different etiology including <b>lambliasis</b> invasion is carried out {{with the purpose of}} detecting features of clinicopathologic presentations of chronic gastroduodenitis in children with and without <b>lambliasis</b> invasion. Material and methods. 100 patients (50 children with confirmed <b>lambliasis</b> invasion and 50 patients without <b>lambliasis</b> invasion) aged from 2 up to 16 were under observation. The material for histologic study was received as a result of fibrogastroduodenoscopy carried out with target biopsy of fundic, antrum and duodenum mucosa. Results. As a result of the findings moderate pains sited in epigastric and periumbilical regions are characteristic for children with <b>lambliasis</b> invasion; irradiation and cramping characteristics of pains are typical. Conclusion. Manifestation of pains is not connected with the time of day and food intake, manifestation of seasonal prevalence is not typical as well, and progression of inflammatory process in the mucous coat of the stomach and duodenum is declared itself as a diffuse gastritis of the fundic part, a diffuse gastritis of the antral part, subatrophic duodenitis with cyst formation of Brunner&# 039;s glands, and also the presence of eosinophilic leucocytes in the cellular infiltrat...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: There {{is little}} {{information}} about diagnosis of concurrent <b>lambliasis</b> {{in patients with}} rosacea and urticaria. We used method of polarized fluorescence to diagnose liambliasis, taking into account belonging of macromolecular structures of unicellular parasites Giardia lamblia to the optically active substances with the properties of liquid crystals. Material and Methods: <b>Lambliasis</b> was diagnosed {{on the basis of}} feces parasitological research and duodenal contents by methods of light and optic microscopy and polarized fluorescence in 105 patients with rosacea and urticaria. Research results were processed by the method of variation statistics in the Statgraf program by using Student’s criterion. Results: Search results of lamblia in patients with rosacea and urticaria depended on the conditions of its holding, patients’ preparation and from the previously received basic therapy if it consisted absorbents. Due {{to the fact that the}} fluorescence polarization as a physical method does not require the use of any generally toxic, dye- fluorochromes, qualitative cyto fluorescent analysis of lamblia in greeting microdrugs enables to distinguish vegetative forms of cysts. Conclussions: Polarized fluorescence method allows optimize the microscopic diagnosis of <b>lambliasis,</b> increasing its sensitivity. Previous preparation for the laboratory examination of Giardia lamblia is needed for the best exposure of vermin for patients with rosacea and urticaria...|$|E
40|$|The {{developed}} {{technique of}} “loading” test in vitro {{was used for}} choice of biological agent for correction of the intestinal dysbacteriosis (ID) in 75 children with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) associated with <b>lambliasis.</b> There was established direct proportional decrease in ability of lymphocytes to E-rosette forming in dependence on severity degree of intestinal dysbacteriosis. Bifilax-immuno (62. 7 %) appeared to be most sensitive biological agent in the test in vitro which was differed by qualitative and quantitative contents in comparison with Lacto-G (48. 0 %) and Narimax-plus (38. 7 %),, p< 0, 05. The evaluation of {{the efficacy of the}} directed therapy allowed increase in efficacy of the treatment by 40. 1 %. Development of clinical, biochemical and microbiological remission was achieved in 76. 5 %, 64. 4 % and 62. 0 % respectively. In this connection the children with chronic hepatitis B associated with <b>lambliasis</b> were recommended to examine intestinal microflora and to use test in vitro before choice of biological agents for effective correction of the intestinal dysbacteriosis taking onto account body individual sensitivity. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{comparative}} {{analysis of results}} of complex clinic-laboratory examination of 156 children at the age from  1 мес till 14 years, with a salmonellosis (n= 39) and a salmonellosis, associated with a <b>lambliasis</b> (n= 117), which were in intestinal infections clinic the Research Institute of Children Infections (Saint-Petersburg) to the period with 2008 on 2010  are presented in the article. It is established that the basic originators admixed salmonella-lambliosis infections at children till 3 th years are Salmonella of group B, at children is more senior 3 th years – Salmonella of group D (Salmonella enteritidis). Leading diagnostic criteria for statement of the early etiological diagnosis admixed salmonella-lambliosis infections at children are defined. The received results confirm that salmonellosis infection, mixt with a lambliosis, at children is the admixed form of the infection caused by two originators (salmonella and lamblia), and is defined by their quantitative parity in an ecological niche, character of mutual relations, in particular, adhesive activity of salmonella in relation to cysts of lamblia, and also clinico-anamnestic and clinico-laboratory features. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Unusual {{clinical}} course Background: Protein-losing enteropathy {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} hypoproteinemia. Erosive and non-erosive gastrointestinal diseas-es as well as vascular disorders that result in increased central venous pressure or mesenteric lymphatic ob-struction may result in protein loss via the gastrointestinal tract. Case Report: We present {{the case of a}} 50 -year-old man with protein-losing enteropathy, who had profuse diarrhea, abdom-inal pain, lymphadenopathy, fever, and a weight loss of 10 kg in the preceding 2 months. Extensive work-up revealed infection with Giardia lamblia. We review clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, and imag-ing studies, and discuss potential pitfalls in establishing the diagnosis. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this represents one of the few published cases of intestinal giardiasis as a cause of protein-losing enteropathy in an immunocompetent adult. The diagnosis of <b>lambliasis</b> should be based on a combination of stool cultures and serum serology, and in cases of high clinical suspicion, an endoscopy and biopsy of the upper GI tract is recommended.

40|$|Acute {{diarrhea}} (AD) is {{the most}} frequent gastroenterological disorder, and {{the main cause of}} dehydration in childhood. It is manifested by a sudden occurrence of three or more watery or loose stools per day lasting for seven to 10 days, 14 days at most. It mainly occurs in children until five years of age and particularly in neonates in the second half-year and children until the age of three years. Its primary causes are gastrointestinal infections, viral and bacterial, and more rarely alimentary intoxications and other factors. As dehydration and negative nutritive balance are the main complications of AD, {{it is clear that the}} compensation of lost body fluids and adequate diet form the basis of the child’s treatment. Other therapeutic measures, except antipyretics in high febrility, antiparasitic drugs for intestinal <b>lambliasis,</b> anti-amebiasis and probiotics are rarely necessary. This primarily regards uncritical use of antibiotics and intestinal antiseptics in the therapy of bacterial diarrhea. The use of antiemetics, antidiarrhetics and spasmolytics is unnecessary and potentially risky, so that it is not recommended for children with AD...|$|E
