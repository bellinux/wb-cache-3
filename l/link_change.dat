40|$|Abstract — Understanding {{the impacts}} of node {{mobility}} on topology dynamics is essential to design a mobility resilient ad hoc network. Current research showed that mobility models can heavily affect the study of network topology due to different mobility patterns. In this paper, we analyze topology dynamics based on the smooth model [1], because it generates smooth nodal movements, has no speed decay problem, and maintains a uniform spatial node distribution. Specifically, we study two topology metrics: expected link lifetime and expected <b>link</b> <b>change</b> rate by using a distance transition probability matrix P, in which an element represents the distance change between two neighboring nodes. By this means, we predict {{the existence of a}} link based on the present distance between a pair of nodes and their relative speed. The analytical results of topology dynamics are validated by extensive simulations. In addition, by combing graph theory and queuing theory, we apply the topology metrics expected link lifetime and expected <b>link</b> <b>change</b> rate to formulate the upper bound connectivity of a mobile ad hoc network.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{advancement}} and extensive spread of mobile devices, es-tablishing a network with those devices {{has become more}} important than ever before. MANETs (Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks) have become a promising solution to set up a network with any mobile device. Routing in MANET is still a difficult task since the mobility of the nodes affects the local con-nections and makes the network topology change constantly. Traditional routing protocols in MANET work sending periodic messages to realize the changes in the topology {{in order to maintain the}} local connections up-to-date. However, sending periodic messages at a fixed rate can cause overhead in situations where it can be prevented and thus reduced. In this paper, we introduce a scheme to improve the performance of the routing protocols used in MANET focusing on the reduction of the overhead. In the pro-posed scheme, instead of sending periodic messages at a fixed rate, we use a <b>link</b> <b>change</b> rate estimation to dynamically adjust the rate at which each node sends the control messages. The <b>link</b> <b>change</b> rate estimation is base...|$|E

Applications of these expressions to protocol design are discussed. As an example application, the link model is used to find an optimal balance between reactive and proactive routing strategies. It is shown that when control traffic generated through proactive route updating is matched to link lifetimes, control traffic is significantly reduced while the goodput and delay benefits of the proactive approach are retained.

40|$|In typical Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) applications, {{the network}} {{topology}} changes frequently due to device movement, or link failure. Consequently, a fast response to connectivity changes {{is one of}} the most important challenges in MANETs. Most proactive routing protocols detect changes by exchanging control messages. The Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) specifies the exchange of these kind of messages. As shown in prior studies, the proposed fixed intervals of NHDP cause unnecessary protocol overhead or late link detection. Our Adaptive HELLO (AH) scheme adapts the interval dynamically with respect to the actual situation and coordinates it between the nodes when necessary. The result is a fast <b>link</b> <b>change</b> detection and an overhead reduction in certain scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{radio link}} between {{a pair of}} {{wireless}} nodes is determined by radio channels, transmission range, node mobility and node-pair distance, which form a set of random factors in multihop wireless networks. The properties of such radio links can be characterized by link lifetime, residual link lifetime and <b>link</b> <b>change</b> rate, which, in fact, {{have been widely used}} for network design and performance evaluation. In this paper, we take a new modeling approach that captures the dynamics of radio channels and node movements in small-scale. More specifically, distance transition probability matrix is designed in order to describe the joint effects of dynamic transmission range due to radio channel fading and relative distance of a node-pair resulting from random movements. We find that the PDF of link lifetime can be approximated by an exponential distribution with parameter characterized by the ratio of average node speed ¯ to effective transmission rang...|$|E

40|$|Anomaly {{detection}} {{in mobile}} ad hoc network (MANET) {{is a relatively}} new area of research. The lack of fixed infrastructure, limited resources, and dynamic topology present numerous problems in MANET security. Recently, several machine learning and data mining techniques have been proposed for anomaly detection in MANETs. In addition, researchers continue to examine new unsupervised detection techniques. As the number of unsupervised learning techniques grows, {{there is a lack of}} evidence to support the use of one technique over another. This dissertation research conducted a set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different unsupervised learning techniques for anomaly detection in MANETs, more specifically, the K-means, the C-means, the Fixed-width clustering, the Principal Component Analysis, and the One-class Support Vector Machine. While the main goal of the research was to compare performance of the unsupervised learning techniques, this dissertation research also investigated: i) tradeoffs between competing factors such as high detection performance and limited resource utilization, ii) the impact of normal profile selection models on anomaly detection, iii) the influence of the <b>link</b> <b>change</b> rate as the weighting function on the unsupervised learning algorithms and iv) the influence of decision thresholds on the detection techniques. The results of this dissertation research showed that both K-means and C-means delivered the best performance when using different normal profile models. The results indicated that direct application of clustering techniques provided a worse average performance than that of trained clusters. This dissertation research found that a small value for the time slot was preferred for all techniques. Moreover, a short training interval was also preferred. These preferences appeared to provide better performance while minimizing resource usage (e. g. execution time, CPU, and memory usages). Additionally, the method of using only the initial training data set was found to provide a comparable performance to that of random, recent, and adaptive normal profile models, but required the least resource usage. Finally, the study found that the application of <b>link</b> <b>change</b> rate as the weighting function to adjust the importance of the time slot had no influence on all techniques. Choosing appropriate parameter and decision thresholds for each detection algorithm had a significant influence on maximizing the performance results...|$|E
40|$|With the explosively {{increasing}} of web-based applications’ workloads, Web {{server cluster}} encounters challenge in response time for requests. Request distribution among servers in web server cluster {{is the key}} to address such challenge, especially under heavy workloads. In this paper, we propose a new request distribution algorithm named llac (least load active cache) for load balancing switch in web server cluster. The goal of llac is to improve the cache hit rate and reduce response time. Packets are parsed in IP level, and back-end servers are notified to cache hot files using <b>link</b> <b>change</b> technology, neither changing URL information nor modifying the service program. This avoids switching overhead between user mode and kernel mode. The load balancing switch directly creates connection with the selected server, avoiding migrating connection overhead. This policy estimates the current composited load of each server and selects the server with the least load to serve the request. It also improves the resource utilization of web servers. Experimental results show that llac achieves better performance for web applications than wrr (weight round robin) which is a popular request distribution.   </p...|$|E

Whenever a <b>link</b> <b>change</b> is received as the input, the algorithm utilizes existing facts about the calculation to update centrality values with minimal effort. Experimental results on data sets collected from online social media websites show that our approach is 4 - 7 orders of magnitude faster for closeness and 2 - 4 orders of magnitude faster for betweenness calculations over baseline methods. We also show how those two metrics share some common calculations so that the running time can be dramatically reduced when calculated together. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve the running time when those two algorithms are calculated at the same time on streaming network data...|$|E
