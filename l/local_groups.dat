5|$|Always {{in touch}} with its Nazi past, HIAG was a subject of {{significant}} controversy, both in West Germany and abroad.

5|$|The rise of Fascism in {{particular}} frequently encouraged greater state involvement. In Italy, {{between the end}} of the war and 1923 <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> and organisations had established their own local memorials in villages and towns. Not all villages agreed that memorials were appropriate, either for political or religious reasons. With the Fascist revolution, this process became more centralised; veteran groups were assimilated by the Fascist government in 1926, and a systematic attempt to construct suitable national and local memorials followed. In Germany, the political and economic chaos of the immediate post-war years discouraged the construction of civic war memorials and comparatively few civic memorials in their larger towns, mainly due to the shortage of funds in the inter-war German economy and political disagreements between <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> as to what to commemorate and how. Those memorials that were constructed were often built instead by local movements, representing particular factional interests. It was only after the rise of the German Nazi party to power in 1933 that substantial funding began to flow into construction programmes, controlled from Berlin.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the new era until 140 AD two <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> existed in northwest Poland. The Gustow group (named after Gustow on Rügen) people lived in the area settled in the past by the Oder group, and south of there, by the middle section of the Oder River was the Lubusz group, in the area previously inhabited by the Gubin group. Those were of an intermediate character, between the Elbe cultural circle to the west, and the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures to the east (the last one replaced the Oksywie culture after 30 AD).|$|E

50|$|Assuming {{that dark}} energy {{continues}} to make the universe expand at an accelerating rate, in about 150 billion years all galaxies outside the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> will pass behind the cosmological horizon. It will then be impossible for events in the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> to affect other galaxies. Similarly {{it will be impossible}} for events after 150 billion years, as seen by observers in distant galaxies, to affect events in the <b>Local</b> <b>Group.</b> However, an observer in the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> will continue to see distant galaxies, but events they observe will become exponentially more time dilated (and red shifted) as the galaxy approaches the horizon until time in the distant galaxy seems to stop. The observer in the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> never actually sees the distant galaxy pass beyond the horizon and never observes events after 150 billion years in their local time. Therefore, after 150 billion years intergalactic transportation and communication beyond the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> becomes causally impossible.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{multicast}} communications model using a RingNet hierarchy, called the RingNet model, {{which is a}} combination of logical trees and logical rings for multicast communications.

Within the hierarchy, the upper two tiers are dynamically organized into logical rings with network entities. In this paper, based on the RingNet model, <b>local</b> <b>group</b> concept is proposed.

40|$|The <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> {{is a small}} {{galaxy cluster}} with the {{membership}} of 62 nearby galaxies including the Milky Way and M 31. Although the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> {{has yet to be}} virialized, it interacts with the surrounding matter as one gravitationally bound system. To understand the formation and evolution of the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> as well as its member galaxies, it is important to reconstruct the gravitational potential field from the surrounding matter distribution in the local cosmic web. By measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> galaxies, which is assumed to be induced by the local gravitational tidal field, we resolve the three dimensional structure of the gravitational potential {{in the vicinity of the}} Milky Way smoothed on the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> mass scale.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Middle Ages, England was a part of Britannia, a former {{province}} of the Roman Empire. The local economy had once been dominated by imperial Roman spending on a large military establishment, which in turn helped to support a complex network of towns, roads, and villas. At the end of the 4th century, however, Roman forces had been largely withdrawn, and this economy collapsed. Germanic immigrants began to arrive in increasing numbers during the 5th century, establishing small farms and settlements, and their language, Old English, swiftly spread as people switched from British Celtic and British Latin to the language of this new elite. New political and social identities emerged, including an Anglian culture in the east of England and a Saxon culture in the south, with <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> establishing regiones, small polities ruled over by powerful families and individuals. By the 7th century, some rulers, including those of Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, and Kent, had begun to term themselves kings, living in villae regales, royal centres, and collecting tribute from the surrounding regiones; these kingdoms are {{often referred to as the}} Heptarchy.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore {{was home}} to a major doo wop scene {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, which began with The Orioles, who are {{considered}} one of the first doo wop groups to record commercially.

Many bands emerged from the city, including The Cardinals and The Plants. Some doo wop groups were connected with street gangs, and some members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of The Marylanders. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American street gang culture, and with the success of some <b>local</b> <b>groups,</b> pressure mounted, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. Pennsylvania Avenue served as a rough boundary between East and West Baltimore, with the East producing The Swallows and The Cardinals, as well as The Sonnets, The Jollyjacks, The Honey Boys, The Magictones and The Blentones, while the West was home to The Orioles and The Plants, as well as The Twilighters and The Four Buddies.|$|E

Taking this direction as the major principal axis of the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> dark matter halo and measuring the degree of the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> member galaxies, we estimate the two axial ratios of the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> dark matter halo with the help of the algorithm recently developed by Lee & Kang.
