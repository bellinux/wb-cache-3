25|$|Because {{they differ}} {{only by the}} {{constant}} walking velocity, <b>the</b> <b>walker</b> and <b>the</b> rotational observer see <b>the</b> same accelerations. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>walker's</b> perspective, <b>the</b> fictitious force is experienced as real, and combating this force is necessary to stay on a straight line radial path holding constant speed.

50|$|Live {{performance}} {{art is a}} major part of <b>the</b> <b>Walker’s</b> programming and it is seen as a leader in exhibiting the medium.

[...] Walkerville became a town on April 7, 1890. In honour of the incorporation and in gratitude to its founder, Walker received a bronze statue made by Tiffany’s. The ceremony took place on Walker’s birthday, July 4, which was declared by town council {{to be a public}} holiday.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} via perturbation a {{class of}} random walks in reversible dynamic environments having a spectral gap.

We then consider as a special case a random walk on the East model that tends to follow dynamical interfaces between empty and occupied regions. We study the asymptotic velocity and density profile for <b>the</b> environment seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walker.</b> In particular, we determine {{the sign of the}} velocity when the density of the underlying East process is not 1 / 2, and we discuss the appearance of a drift in the balanced setting given by density 1 / 2...|$|R
