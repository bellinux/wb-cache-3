In this work, an efficient Particle-in-cell/Monte-Carlo (PIC/MC) simulator is developed to model IEDF at the electrodes of electronegative plasma discharges.

50|$|Loudness wars {{have caused}} a general fall in audio quality, {{initially}} on radio stations and more recently on CDs. As radio stations competed for attention and to raise the listener scores their ad revenue is based on, they used audio compression to give their sound more impact. They used level compressors, and in particular multi-band compressors that compress different frequencies independently. Such compressors usually incorporate fast acting limiters to eliminate brief peaks, since brief peaks, though they may not contribute much to perceived loudness, limit the modulation level {{that can be applied}} to FM transmissions in particular, if serious clipping and distortion are to be avoided. Digital broadcasting has changed all this: stations are no longer found by tuning across the band, so the loudest stations no longer stand out. <b>Low</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> is also guaranteed regardless of signal level, so that it is no longer necessary to fully modulate to ensure acceptable clarity in poor reception areas. Many professionals feel that the more widespread adoption and understanding of alignment level throughout the audio industry could help bring modulation levels down, leaving headroom to cope with brief peaks, and using a different form of level compression that reduces dynamic range on programmes where this is considered desirable, but does not remove the brief peaks which add 'sparkle' and contribute to clearer sound. CDs in particular have suffered a loss of quality since they were introduced through the widespread use of fast limiting, which, given their very <b>low</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> is quite unnecessary.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a critical review}} of different acoustic resonator models exposed in the past, {{in the light of}} recent experimental results. Among the few models attempting to explain the 1 /f behavior of the quartz crystal resonator, the 1 /f quantum noise theory of P. Handel and the thermal boson theory of M. Planat, are recalled.

In the case of Handel's model, the noise depends on the resonator volume under the electrodes and the unloaded quality factor of the resonator. Handel's model is supposed to give an order of magnitude of the <b>lowest</b> possible <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> but now some experimental results are under its prediction.
