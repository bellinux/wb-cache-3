The three Byssochlamys strains were able to produce patulin in both cloudy and clarified apple juices. Overall, the lower the storage temperature, the lower the patulin levels and mycelium dry weight in the apple juices (p< 0. 05). The greatest variations in pH and degrees Brix were observed in the juices from which the greatest mycelium dry weights were recovered. The maximum levels of patulin recovered from the juices were ca. 150 mu g/kg at 21 degrees C and 220 mu g/kg at 30 degrees C. HPLC-UV, HPCL-DAD and mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the ability of B. fulva IOC 4518 to produce patulin.

40|$|Tetra Recart (TRC) is a {{multilayer}} <b>laminate</b> <b>paperboard</b> package used {{to package}} {{foods such as}} tomatoes, beans, vegetables and sauces. Some “aggressive” food products interact with {{the inside of the}} package material and make it difficult to guarantee the quality of the food during the whole shelf life of the product. Products with pH below 4 and Cl− content above 1 % are regarded as “aggressive” and are not packed in the TRC standard material. In this thesis work, a fill product mimicking aggressive food products has been developed. The goal was to obtain the same interaction patterns as given by aggressive food products, but eight times as fast, in order to use the fill product in accelerated storage tests in the development of new TRC materials. The work included the development of a model for corrosion development caused by aggressive products, the design of the fill product, packaging, and opening and evaluation of the packages. As well as evaluating the effects of different concentrations of acids, salts, fat and fatty acid together with an emulsifier, the influence of different storage temperatures on delamination of the inside polymer coating and corrosion of aluminium was evaluated. Delamination of the inside polymer was crucial for an accelerated development of corrosion of the aluminium foil. The presence of free fatty acids and an elevated storage temperature were necessary factors for delamination to occur. A high Cl− content seemed to be more important than a low pH in terms of aggressiveness of a product. The most well suited test product to use in accelerated storage tests of aggressive products in TRC had a pH of 2. 49 and a Cl− content of 7. 71 %. It was stored at 35 °C and contained 40 ppm free fatty acids. This product gave accelerated corrosion, and showed good compliance with the developed model for corrosion development.

40|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>paperboard</b> {{is often}} used as a {{packaging}} material for products such as toys, tea and frozenfoods. To make the paperboard packages appealing for consumers, the fold lines must be both neat and undamaged. The quality of the folds depends on two converting processes: the manufacture of fold lines (creasing) and the subsequent folding. A good crease contains some delamination, initiated during creasing, to reduce the bending stiffness and to prevent the board from breaking during folding. However, for boards of high grammage breaking of he top layer is nevertheless a frequent problem. The mechanisms that operate in the creasing zone during creasing and folding, and that may thus result in breaking of the top layer, are studied in this contribution {{on the basis of}} idealized small-scale creasing and folding experiments. However, since experimental observations are only limited means to study the paperboard's behavior, a mechanical model is proposed to obtain more detailed insight. Although the material and delamination descriptions used in the mechanical model are both relatively straightforward, comparisons between the model and the experimental data show that the model predicts the paperboard's response well. The mechanical model shows - in combination with experimental strain fields - that multiple delaminations are initiated in the shear regions. Moreover, only the mechanical model reveals the mechanism that is responsible for the failure of the top layer if a crease is too shallow. Finally, the model also demonstrates that not only delamination but also plastic behavior must occur during creasing if breaking of the top layer is to be avoided...|$|E

A total of 118 samples of <b>laminated</b> <b>paperboard</b> before filling were collected, being 68 before and 50 after the hydrogen peroxide bath. Seven molds, including heat-resistant strains (Penicillium variotii and Talaromyces flavus) with counts ranging between 0. 71 and 1. 02 CFU/cm(2) were isolated. P. variotii was more resistant to hydrogen peroxide than T. flavus and was inactivated after heating at 85 degrees C/ 15 min. When exposed to 35 % hydrogen peroxide at 25 degrees C, T. flavus (F 5 E 2) and N. fischeri (control) were less resistant than P. variotti (F 1 A 1). P. citrinum (F 7 E 2) was shown to be as resistant as P. variotti. The D values (the time to cause one logarithmic cycle reduction in a microbial population at a determined temperature) for spores of P. variotii (F 1 A 1) and N. fischeri (control) with 4 months of age at 85 and 90 degrees C were 3. 9 and 4. 5 min, respectively. Although the contamination of packages was low, the presence of heat-and chemical-resistant molds may be of concern for package sterility and product stability during shelf-life.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the thesis were to investigate the adhesives influence on the mechanical properties in laminated multi-layer paperboard. The study also strived to find a method to investigate the interface strength of the adhesive layer. This was investigated by constructing handsheets of <b>laminated</b> <b>paperboard</b> by gluing a bulky, CTMP center ply, Chromofoil, of two different grammages, 290 g/m 2 and 360 g/m 2, together with two outer plies of ordinary copy paper, Multi- Copy 80 g/m 2. The sheets were glued with two types of dispersion adhesives, a starch based adhesive and a polyvinyl acetate based adhesive. Twelve types of test specimens were constructed and tested {{in a series of}} mechanical tests, which involved a tensile test, a two-point bending test and a Scott Bond test. The method called “digital image correlation” was used trying to investigate the interface strength of the adhesive layer. The study also involved an evaluation of the possibility to predict the bending stiffness of laminated multi-layer paperboard by using calculations according to classic laminate theory. The results show that it is fully possible to use these calculated values as a prediction, with low risk of overestimating the bending stiffness of the paperboard and without involving the adhesive layer in the calculation. The method provided high absolute values in bending and tensile properties, which increased with increasing amount of glue applied. This came at the cost of grammage, which lead to low index values. The overall conclusion is that the effect from the adhesives is somewhat negative, since the mechanical properties would have been improved if the adhesive had been replaced with more fiber. The major source of errors during the experiments was the roughness of the manufacturing method. This lead to an uncertainty about whether the right amount of adhesive had been applied to the test specimens. Due to this the validity of the results could be questioned. Digital image correlation proved to be a rather sensitive method that requires a high accuracy setup and execution for it to be applicable in this type of study. The failure mode of the glue seam correlated well to the amount of glue applied. A lower amount of adhesive applied increases the likeliness of failure of the glue seam. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>paperboard</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{packaging}} materials in industry. Its relatively low price, sustainability and straightforward manufacturing process make it an attractive packaging material. This material exhibits a highly anisotropic mechanical behavior due to its manufacturing process. Its elastic as well as its inelastic properties, such as initial yield point, strain hardening, and tensile failure, become direction dependent. To obtain an accurate prediction of paperboard packaging, it is essential to perform studies on two aspects, namely the paper sheet anisotropic behavior and the interface delamination between different layers. The aim of this study is to describe the anisotropic behavior of the paper sheet with an orthotropic elastic-plastic model and characterize the interface fracture behavior with a cohesive zone model. Paper is in general composed of a bonded fiber network. It is well known that the macroscopic mechanical properties of composites can be strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of the fiber orientation. In order to evaluate this influence, a microsphere-based homogenization approach was proposed, in which the passage from microstructural contributions to the macroscopic response was obtained by integration over the surface of a unit microsphere. The results illustrated the effects of the degree of fiber misalignment on the predicted overall properties. In order to further investigate the nonlinear anisotropic behavior of paper, a structural tensor-based approach was applied to model the elastic deformation, while a multi-surface based yield criterion was adopted to describe the yield behavior. The model incorporated nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening to capture the anisotropic hardening effect. In the experiment, the compressive yield stress was found to be insensitive to the previous tensile deformation. With the material parameters calibrated from a set of simple uniaxial tests in various directions, the model was shown to predict the stress-strain behavior for other orientations satisfactorily. The model was further validated with a punch test and found to capture the highly anisotropic, elastic-plastic behavior accurately. In order to experimentally and numerically investigate the interface fracture behavior in pure opening mode (mode I) and sliding mode (mode II), four experimental tests have been evaluated and compared to the numerical simulation, namely, the z-directional tensile test (ZDT), double-notch shear test (DNS), double-cantilever beam test (DCB) and end-notched flexure test (ENF). It was shown that, for the paperboard specimens tested, the ZDT test was sufficient to fully characterize the mode I crack growth response. However, the DNS and ENF tests were required to determine the maximum shear stress and the fracture toughness of pure mode II, respectively. The further mixed-mode investigation would enable the analysis of paperboard delamination behavior during the creasing and folding process...|$|E
