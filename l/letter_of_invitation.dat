5|$|The first World Cup was {{the only}} one without qualification. Every country {{affiliated}} with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players, very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances, and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>invitation</b> to The Football Association, even though the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929. Two months {{before the start of the}} tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.|$|E

25|$|The {{city was}} first {{mentioned}} in written sources as Vilna in 1323 {{as the capital}} city of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the letters of Gediminas. Gediminas built his wooden castle on a hill in the city. The city became more widely known after he wrote a circular <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>invitation</b> to Germans and Jews to the principal Hansa towns in 1325, offering free access into his domains to men of every order and profession. Vilnius was granted city rights by Jogaila in 1387, following the Christianization of Lithuania and the construction of the Vilnius Cathedral. The town was initially populated by local Lithuanians, but soon the population began to grow as craftsmen and merchants of other nationalities settled in the city.|$|E

The French continued alone and created the foundations of what is now called the Système International d'Unités and is the measurement system for most of the world.|$|E

Requirements were simplified: Cubans need only a passport and a national ID card to leave; and {{they are allowed to}} take their young children with them for the first time. However, a passport costs on average five months' salary. Observers expect that Cubans with paying relatives abroad {{are most likely to be}} able to take advantage of the new policy.

30|$|As {{the results}} of the study demonstrate, the {{community}} as one important partner in the collaborative governance activity is not well incorporated. This is because there are no community organizations or board that could representatively work on behalf of the community with regard to river problems. The fact that different sectors do not accomplish their responsibility of organizing community consultation platform and community participation councils inhibits the collaboration of the community in a meaningful manner. Apart from facilitative styles emphasized by Sutcliffe (2012) and Sophia and Mark (2006) as important to encourage the participation of sectors and exchange of information, this study found out that the acceptance or recognition <b>of</b> the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>invitations</b> from the organizers also affects the involvement of sectors.
