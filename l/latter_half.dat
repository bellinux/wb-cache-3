50|$|The {{proximal}} radioulnar joint {{is similarly}} derived in higher primates in {{the location and}} shape of the radial notch on the ulna; the primitive form being represented by New World monkeys, such as the howler monkey, and by fossil catarrhines, such as Aegyptopithecus.

With this forearm configuration, the ulna supports the radius and maximum stability is achieved when the forearm is fully pronated.|$|R

60|$|Some of {{the things}} demanded by the Johannesburgers' Manifesto have been conceded {{since the days of}} the Raid, and the others will follow in time, no doubt.

5000|$|The tiny car {{was to be}} a {{replacement}} for the S-3D, and, like its predecessor, featured a simple motorcycle engine.

The Oka quickly became the next [...] "people's car" [...] project, a vehicle that [...] "every factory engineer can afford".|$|R
50|$|Alamanno {{came from}} Genoa's mercantile class, and the {{earliest}} record of him dates from 1193, {{when he joined}} an accomende, a commercial partnership, directed towards Sicily.

The Carroccia and Leopardo were both classed as navi—broad-beamed, lateen-rigged ships. The former had on board 500 armed men, and the <b>latter</b> probably <b>half</b> as many. The inventory taken after Alamanno successfully captured the Leopardo and integrated her into his force lists 280 suits of armour among the booty. Presumably this represents the number of marines she carried.|$|R

5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since the <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of the 20th century, coinciding {{with the rise of}} cognitivism.
