5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} occurred off {{the coast}} of Nicaragua at 6:16p.m. on September 2. Some damage was also reported in Costa Rica. At least 116 people were killed and several more were injured. The quake was <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> active zone of stress and deformation. It created tsunamis disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{practice}} of cursing and sorcery peculiar to Sinhala Buddhists, Kataragama deviyo has his dark side represented by Getabaru and Kadavara. The current Getabaru shrine is <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> isolated place near Morawaka. The shrine for Kadavara is in the town of Kataragama. His power to curse is carried out in secret outside the Main Kataragama deviyo shrine at a place at the Menik Ganga, where he receives animal sacrifices. Katagama devio is also directly invoked in sorcery practices.|$|E

5|$|On September 4, a {{cold front}} exited {{the coast of}} Texas into the Gulf of Mexico. A {{convective}} band from the front continued southeastward and stalled between Veracruz, Mexico and Tampa, Florida. The band began to split into two on September 6; the northeastern portion developed into a frontal wave and tracked northeastward, while the southwestern portion remained nearly stationary and began showing signs of tropical organization. <b>Located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area of generally low pressures, the system developed a spiral band structure, though deep convection was mostly intermittent. Subsequent {{to the formation of}} a surface circulation, the system developed into a tropical depression while located about 450miles (725km) northwest of Mérida, Yucatán.|$|E

The refuge is one of only ten national wildlife refuges in the United States <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> urban area.

5|$|The National Archives of Malta {{maintains}} three facilities across Malta. The first {{facility to}} be opened was the Legal Documentation Section, located in Mdina, which was opened in 1988. This facility is <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> old bank building and houses court and tribunal records dating back to those decisions made under the Knights Hospitaller. The second facility is the Archives' Gozo location, which holds over 9,000 items. The final facility {{to be opened}} was the Head Office, located in Rabat, which was officially opened in 1994. This facility houses most of Malta's official records, and is the Archives' main facility.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the keep was <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> avant-corps on the northern side, with a vaulted passageway between two gates leading from the outer courtyard to the inner rooms of the keep. The keep itself features just two round towers of 5m diameter with square bases, both located {{on the western side}} and within the outer ward. The more southern of the two is almost totally ruined, probably as a result of Ibrahim Pasha's destruction. The more exposed eastern and southern sides featured no towers. According to the historian Kevin Andrews, this is perhaps because they were judged to be adequately protected by the steep terrain.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{areas of}} the {{wilderness}} area are covered by a taiga forest of Scots pine. Less common trees include downy birch, goat willow, aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly occurred in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being old-growth forests. The barren soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the ground vegetation in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian spruce and red cottongrass.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression One in June 1992 {{produced}} 100-year {{floods in}} portions of southwestern Florida. The first tropical depression and second tropical cyclone of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season, the depression developed on June 25 from a tropical wave. <b>Located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environment of strong wind shear, {{much of the}} convection in the system was located well to the southeast of the poorly defined center of circulation. The depression moved northeastward and made landfall near Tampa, Florida on June 26 shortly before dissipating over land.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Josephine {{formed as}} a {{tropical}} wave that emerged off {{the west coast of}} Africa near the end of August 2008. It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed, and on September2 the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south-southeast of the Cape Verde islands. As the depression became more organized, an eye-like feature developed in the upper levels of the system. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Josephine six hours after forming. Josephine was <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Gabrielle was <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area of cooler air to its north, dry air to its south and west, southerly wind shear, and cooler water temperatures along its path. Despite these unfavorable conditions, a curved convective band developed in its northern and western quadrants, and the circulation became better defined. Subsequently, the rainbands in its northeastern quadrant dissipated, leaving the well-defined center {{far removed from}} the convection. By later that day, the circulation began to become more involved with the remaining convection. Based on evidence of a weak warm-core, the system was re-designated as Tropical Storm Gabrielle late on September 8 about 185miles (300km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.|$|E

At about 2:15 AM a rescue team was sent to the spot and found the three missing firefighters unconscious and out of air in their SCBAs.

One of the missiles flew between the two helicopters, while the other struck the engine of the lead helicopter.

The second helicopter had to crash-land to evade the attack.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 27. It tracked westward to the south of a subtropical ridge, becoming convectively active, and a low-level circulation was observed as it passed south of the Cape Verde islands on September 28. The organization of the convection oscillated over the subsequent days, and a few times the system showed signs of developing into a tropical depression. As it approached the Lesser Antilles it organized further, and despite unfavorable upper-level wind shear the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3 while located about 115miles (185km/h) east of Dominica. <b>Located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area of weak steering currents, the depression drifted to the northwest, and about six hours after first developing the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; the National Hurricane Center designated it with the name Klaus.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on January16 to {{the west}} of Diego Garcia, and that day Météo-France (MF) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 08. The system maintained thunderstorms over a developing circulation, <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area of weak to moderate wind shear. It developed outflow and gradually organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on January17. That day, the MF discontinued advisories after the system briefly halted its development trend. The disturbance continued its movement {{to the west}}-southwest, and on January19 began intensifying. That day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S {{to the north of the}} northern coast of Madagascar. After continued development, MF upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Ernest on January20.|$|E
