5|$|Born in Ireland, Daily {{first began}} playing {{baseball}} professionally around the Baltimore area, often receiving more lucrative offers {{to play in}} more prominent leagues, all of which he declined, preferring {{to stay in the}} local area. His reputation, along with actions such as verbally assaulting umpires and fans, forced him to move on to other teams, which <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> New York City playing for the Metropolitans, which was an all-professional club but had yet to join a major league; they later joined the National League in 1883. He became the team's ace pitcher, winning 38games, including notable victories against Cap Anson's Chicago White Stockings, and most of the other top professional teams in the country at the time.|$|E
5|$|Trevor is Canadian, born {{just north}} of the border of the United States. He grew up with a {{physically}} abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother. Trevor had a brother, Ryan, who died prior to the game's events. Trevor's father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which he later burned down in retaliation. His father died when Trevor was 10. This upbringing combined with Trevor's violent temper led Trevor to be severely unhinged, leading to numerous fights at school, including an assault on a teacher. Trevor loved planes, and at some point entered the military as a pilot, but was quickly forced to leave after being reproved in a psychological evaluation. Later on, Trevor committed crimes, the first one being a small robbery that <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> jail for six months (however, due to good behavior, he was out in four). He would continue his criminal ways, including using his piloting skills to become a smuggler. Trevor eventually met Michael Townley and both men realised that they wanted to earn money by performing large heists, and both men became successful in doing so. However, their partnership began to strain after Michael married a stripper named Amanda and started a family with her.|$|E

25|$|John Patrick McEnroe Jr. (born February 16, 1959) is {{a retired}} American tennis player, often {{considered}} among the greatest {{in the history of}} the sport.

25|$|Dr William Dodd (1729–1777), was an Anglican clergyman, man {{of letters}} and forger. He was also {{the son of the}} Rev William Dodd, Vicar of Bourne from 1727 to 1756. The younger Dodd {{graduated}} with distinction from Clare College, Cambridge, and then moved to London, where his extravagant lifestyle soon <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> debt. This worried his friends, who persuaded him to mend his ways. So he decided to take holy orders and was ordained in 1751. He became a popular and fashionable preacher, but was always short of money, and in an attempt to rectify his depleted finances, forged a bond in the sum of £4,200. This was discovered and he was prosecuted, sentenced to death and publicly hanged at Tyburn on 27 June 1777.|$|E

25|$|During the 2008 Christmas holiday Weir {{traveled}} to South Korea {{to perform in}} a charity skating show. While there, he contracted a severe stomach virus that <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the hospital and caused him to lose eight pounds in a single day. He was unable to regain all of the weight or train at full capacity before the 2009 U.S. Championships in January 2009, where he singled the planned triple axel in both his short and long programs and also fell on the triple lutz in the long, resulting in a fifth-place finish. It {{was the first time}} since 2003 that he had been off the podium at Nationals. He was subsequently not named to the U.S. team for the World Championships.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Grothendieck {{attended}} Henri Cartan's Seminar at École Normale Supérieure, but {{he lacked}} the necessary background to follow the high-powered seminar. On the advice of Cartan and André Weil, {{he moved to the}} University of Nancy where he wrote his dissertation under Laurent Schwartz and Jean Dieudonné on functional analysis, from 1950 to 1953. At this time he was a leading expert in the theory of topological vector spaces. By 1957, he set this subject aside in order to work in algebraic geometry and homological algebra. The same year he was invited to visit Harvard by Oscar Zariski, but the offer fell through when he refused to sign a pledge promising not to work to overthrow the United States government, a position that, he was warned, might have <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> prison. The prospect did not worry him, {{as long as he could}} have access to books.|$|E
25|$|Leigh Hunt (1784-1859) was an English man of letters—a poet, {{political}} commentator, drama critic, literary critic, translator, and essayist. The {{center of}} a literary circle including the poets Byron, Shelley, and Keats, and the essayists Charles Lamb and Hazlitt himself, he exerted an influence on and was an avid promoter of all of them. Hunt began to gain notice in 1808, when, {{as editor of the}} radical periodical The Examiner, and a valiant advocate of liberty, free speech, and political reform, he attracted a wide audience; he gained even more attention in 1813 when his outspoken criticism of the Prince Regent <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> prison. In 1816, Hunt published his innovative but controversial narrative poem The Story of Rimini. It drew many enthusiastic admirers, but its theme of forbidden love provided Hunt's political foes with an instrument to chastise him, and from then on Hunt's reputation was sharply split along political lines.|$|E
50|$|Peak is the youngest, and {{the most}} reckless, of the siblings. He enjoys stunt-flying on dragon-back, which <b>lands</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> trouble, and is quite egoistical and mischievous. His name {{indicates}} 'the top', as of a mountain or hill.|$|R
5000|$|Guillen {{is known}} for being {{somewhat}} eccentric and outspoken, which sometimes <b>lands</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the middle of controversy. [...] He declined {{to join in the}} traditional visit to the White House after the 2005 White Sox World Series win.|$|R
5000|$|Ken Leung as Leon Tao, {{a former}} {{financial}} criminal and three-time {{person of interest}} who has assisted in some cases with his forensic accounting skills. He has a penchant for get-rich-schemes which always <b>land</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> difficulties with gangsters.|$|R
500|$|The {{signing of}} Ted Easterly and Grover Land gave the Naps four {{catchers}} entering spring training. Easterly became the starting catcher and Bemis the backup due to Clarke's [...] "lack of ambition", {{which led to}} speculation {{that he could be}} traded during the season. He finished the season with a [...]274 batting average in 55 games. During the offseason, St. Louis Browns player-manager Jack O'Connor attempted to trade for Clarke, but a deal never materialized. Clarke saw little playing time in 1910 due to a bout of typhoid fever, which <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the hospital for most of the season. He played 21 games that season, batting [...]155.|$|E
500|$|After {{four years}} on the sidelines, Austria sought another war with France to avenge its recent defeats. Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war with Britain, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire in 1809. Frederick William of Prussia {{initially}} promised to help the Austrians, but reneged before conflict began. A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would {{run out of money}} by the middle of 1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilized. Although Archduke Charles warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon, a stance that <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the so-called [...] "peace party", {{he did not want to}} see the army demobilized either. On 8 February 1809, the advocates for war finally succeeded when the Imperial Government secretly decided on another confrontation against the French.|$|E
500|$|Morrell {{was born}} at Rye, in Westchester County, New York, on July 5, 1795. He grew up in Stonington, Connecticut, where his father, also named Benjamin, was {{employed}} as a shipbuilder. Morrell, after minimal schooling, ran away to sea {{at the age of}} 17 [...] "without taking leave of any member of my family, or intimating my purpose to a single soul". During the War of 1812, which broke out while he was at sea, he was twice captured by the British; on his first voyage his ship, carrying a cargo of flour, was intercepted off St John's, Newfoundland, and Morrell was detained for eight months. His second voyage <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Dartmoor prison, England, for two years. After his release Morrell continued his seafaring career, sailing before the mast as an ordinary seaman since his lack of education prevented him advancing to officer rank. A sympathetic captain, Josiah Macy, taught him what he needed to know to qualify as an officer, [...] and in 1821 he was appointed chief mate on the sealer Wasp, under Captain Robert Johnson.|$|E
50|$|Tommy finally {{breaks off}} his affair with Angela when {{she tells him}} she's pregnant. Her brother Charlie beats Tommy severely, <b>landing</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the hospital. Angela is fired from her bank job. Cavanaugh has the bank foreclose the Bonali house.|$|R
60|$|I {{hastened to}} inform him that any {{violence}} attempted against the parties WHILE IN POSSESSION, although that possession was illegal, would, by a fatuity of the law, <b>land</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the county jail. I said I would not hear of it.|$|R
2500|$|In Yes, Prime Minister Hacker {{strives to}} perfect all {{the skills needed}} by a statesman, giving more grandiose speeches, dreaming up [...] "courageous" [...] {{political}} programmes, and honing his diplomatic craft, nearly all of these attempts <b>landing</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> trouble at some point.|$|R
500|$|Sir Nicholas Exton (died 1402) was {{a medieval}} English merchant. A leading {{member of the}} Fishmongers' Company and citizen of the City of London, he was twice elected Mayor of that city during the troubled years {{of the reign of}} King Richard II. Little is known of his {{personal}} background and youth, but he became known at some point as a vigorous defender of the rights of his Guild. This eventually <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> some trouble for attacking the then-current Mayor, and he was fined and imprisoned as a result. The situation soon reverted back to his favour with the election as Mayor of Nicholas Brembre, a close ally of his. During this period Brembre was a loyal supporter of the King, who at this time was engaged in a bitter conflict with some of his nobles (known collectively as the Lords Appellant). They managed to manoeuvre the King into surrendering some of his authority, and this in turn weakened Brembre, who was eventually executed by the Appellants for his support of the King.|$|E
500|$|The {{problems}} {{of command and}} cohesion became more acute following the 1793 introduction of mass conscription, the so-called levée en masse. French commanders walked {{a fine line between}} the security of the frontier and the Parisian clamor for victory. Add to this the desperate condition of the Armyin training, supplies, and leadershipand the military leadership faced a disaster. They themselves were constantly under suspicion from the representatives of the new regime and sometimes from their own soldiers. Failure to achieve unrealistic expectations implied disloyalty and the price of disloyalty was the guillotine: [...] the aged Nicolas Luckner, Jean Nicolas Houchard, Adam Philippe Custine, Arthur Dillon, and Antoine Nicolas Collier all fell under its blade. Francisco de Miranda's failure to take Maastricht <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> La Force Prison for several years. [...] Many of the old officer class already had emigrated, forming émigré armies; the cavalry in particular suffered from their departure and two entire regiments, the Hussards du Saxe and the 15éme Cavalerie (Royal Allemande) defected en masse to the Austrians. The artillery arm, considered by the old nobility to be an inferior assignment, was less affected by emigration, and survived intact.|$|E
500|$|Stationed on {{the border}} with France, Bär {{achieved}} his first victory—a Curtiss P-36 Hawk—on 25 September 1939 during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the Armée de l'Air (French air force), earning him the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 27 September 1939. During the Battle of France, he was credited with two more aerial victories before adding a further 10 during the Battle of Britain. During this time, he had several emergency landings in badly damaged aircraft and was shot down over the English Channel on 2 September 1940 by a Spitfire. Bär was summoned to appear before Hermann Göring and report on this battle. When Göring asked him what he was thinking about while in the water, Bär immediately replied, [...] "Your speech, Herr Reichsmarschall, in which you said that England is no longer an island!", alluding to an address that Göring had made before the German fighter pilots. Incidents like this are testimony to his often blatant disregard for higher authority. His outspokenness frequently <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> trouble with Göring. In early 1941, he was credited with an additional four aerial victories against the Royal Air Force (RAF), bringing his total to 17.|$|E
50|$|When mild mannered Joe (Tyrell Davis) {{comes into}} an inheritance, he leaves {{his job as}} a clerk, and embarks on a sea cruise.

The charges against Martinez, which <b>landed</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Manhattan's Metropolitan Correction Center [...] on June 19, 2002, involved an alleged scheme to sell fake Basquiat drawings, accompanied by forged certificates of authenticity.|$|E
