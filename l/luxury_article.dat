The newborn son was baptized in honor of his godfather the crown prince and his father the archduke, Carl Friedrich.  Of Zeiss’ siblings, three sisters and two brothers reached adulthood.|$|E
40|$|Chanoyu, {{commonly}} {{known in the}} Anglophone world as the “tea ceremony,” was characterized by its most famous sixteenth-century practitioner Sen no Rikyû {{as nothing more than}} “boiling water for tea. ” Yet like much writing on tea, such statements hide the true nature of a cultural practice that since the fifteenth century has been a driving force behind the production and consumption of both imported and domestic luxury goods in Japan. This paper examines the culture of tea from the perspective of import substitution and innovation. Import substitution, as Maxine Berg has defined it, refers to the replacement of like with like, a <b>luxury</b> <b>article</b> that becomes too scarce or costly being replaced by a domestic product that simulates its appearance, but not its mode of manufacture. But here I complicate the notion, first, by suggesting how it might involve the replacement of like with unlike, and, second, by considering the processes through which innovative goods are validated, in turn generating new imports and domestic substitutes that may come to assume the same luxury status as the articles they replaced...|$|E
40|$|Chanoyu, {{commonly}} {{known in the}} Anglophone world as the ‘tea ceremony’, was characterised by its most famous 16 th-century practitioner Sen no Rikyū {{as nothing more than}} ‘boiling water for tea’. Yet like much writing on tea, such statements hide the true nature of a practice that, since the 15 th century, has been a driving force behind the production and consumption of both imported and domestic luxury goods in Japan. As part of her exploration of fresh interpretative models for the study of a practice that had far-reaching economic implications in early modern Japan, Guth first presented this material in 2008 at a symposium on global commodities co-organised by Warwick University and the V&A Museum, and was later invited to submit it for publication in Global Design History. This article examines the culture of tea from the perspective of import substitution and innovation, following a methodological perspective discussed in an influential essay by Maxine Berg, who wrote the response to Guth’s contribution to the edited volume. Import substitution, as Berg has defined it, refers to the replacement of like with like, as when a <b>luxury</b> <b>article</b> that becomes too scarce or costly is replaced by a domestic product that simulates its appearance, but not its mode of manufacture. Guth complicates this idea by situating import substitution within tea culture discourses to demonstrate how imported ceramics from China and South-East Asia could be replaced with dissimilar ones through a process of symbolic inversion, and how these in turn could give rise to a range of innovative locally produced teawares that assumed the same luxury status as those they were intended to replace. In so doing, Guth demonstrates the importance of looking into the larger geographies in which both the production and consumption of Japanese tea ceramics were implicated...|$|E

50|$|Already by 1160, {{the first}} loads of Bentheim {{sandstone}} were being shipped into the Netherlands. Up to 1,200 freight cranes, scows and barges lay each year at anchor and brought their goods to Holland. The Steinmaate (street) became a staple market. The like-named street still recalls today that Bentheim sandstone was shipped {{from here to}} many other countries. From it were built stately buildings such as the Royal Palace in Amsterdam, but also many mills, churches, locks, town halls and other public buildings. The returning ships brought spices, textiles, paper and foods as well as <b>luxury</b> <b>articles</b> such as coffee, tea, cacao and tobacco. Trade, crafts and agriculture were the region's economic foundations until the mid 19th century.

During the post-war {{reconstruction}} of Beirut’s central district that began in 1994, excavations through successive layers revealed that the street’s origins dated back to the Phoenico-Persian period. Souk al-Tawileh thrived in Romano-Byzantine times; it lost its standing after the 551 Beirut earthquake, remaining a simple earth path for a long time. In 1874, the Ottoman urbanization plan of Beirut turned Souk al-Tawileh into a modern commercial street. It flourished until 1975 as a prosperous shopping venue. Its shops often bore French names, and sold clothing, perfumes and other <b>luxury</b> <b>articles.</b> A shop owner whose family had a store in Souk al-Tawileh remembers: [...] "This large store was one of the oldest and most attractive stores of the city center.

40|$|The 13 th century saw {{the rise}} of the multi-material art of the cristalleri, who, using {{imported}} rock crystal, created objects from cut or baccellato blocks, or applied thin sheets of crystal to miniatures (creating pseudo-enamels) or to embossed foils, mounted together with inserts of red jasper or with filigree. The precious objects thus created were both secular (including precious chess-sets) and religious (especially crosses and reliquaries). At the end of the 13 th and throughout the 14 th century the technique of translucent enamel was developed. No object with miniatures has survived in Venice, where only the Treasure of St Mark’s includes items connected with this specific Venetian art. It was thus principally designed for export, a product of the artistic (but also commercial) creativity of Venice, bringing together the fruits of the loot from Constantinople (relics) and imported minerals, and creating liturgical furnishings and <b>luxury</b> secular <b>articles</b> for a market that extended even beyond the confines of Europe...|$|R

The suggestion, in the light of secondary evidence and a series of fourteen case studies in the Victorian and New South Wales metal industry, is that three variables are important in helping to explain the direction that labour relations management has taken in recent years. These are the ’labour threat: the reorganization of production methods, and changes to the legal and institutional framework. It was found that management in those plants in which exposure to these three environmental pressures was similar responded with fairly similar labour relations management practices, suggesting that there may indeed be a link between the key variables.

40|$|By {{focusing}} on the recent fashion warfare over the red sole used on <b>luxury</b> shoes, this <b>Article</b> reconsiders the implications of trademark protection of single color marks for regulating {{the development of the}} fashion industry and the cultural evolution of human society. Courts and commentators have focused {{on the role of the}} aesthetic functionality doctrine in deciding whether Christian Louboutin’s red sole mark should be protected by trademark law. This Article takes a different approach. It calls for a social justice-based re-examination of whether the red sole mark is distinctive enough to warrant trademark protection. Based on a close look at the distinctiveness of the red sole mark, the Article puts forward a social justice mandate that should be incorporated into trademark law. It contends that social justice should have the trumping power to deny trademark protection of marks even if they are adequately distinctive. It also shows how the new mandate resonates with the equality-oriented protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Article further addresses practical concerns for implementing the mandate and discusses its merit in solving the problems caused by the aesthetic functionality doctrine. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The Household Budget Survey is used to examine changes in the expenditure patterns of Irish households. Relative to the boom period, there is now an increased share of spending on essential items such as housing and transport and a lower share of spending on discretionary or <b>luxury</b> items. This <b>article</b> also documents trends in infl ation from the Consumer Price Index over the fi ve year period between December 2006 and December 2011. Education, health and transport have witnessed large price increases over this period. We also examine the period of defl ation caused by the fi nancial crisis. The analysis shows that this defl ation was very broad in nature, as a very large percentage of items in the consumer basket recorded price decreases. This argues against the notion of price rigidity, the idea that prices are unlikely to adjust, particularly in the downward direction. Using a simple forecasting model, it is also shown {{that the percentage of}} price changes from an earlier period can help to forecast infl ation...|$|R
40|$|The luxury {{market has}} {{experienced}} considerable growth over recent years, {{being one of}} the sectors that have been the most resistant to the current economic recession. Selective fragrances make up one of the primary categories of the so-called accessible luxury consumed by a middle class that is seeking to approach the upper classes by copying their lifestyle. Despite the importance of this market, there is relatively little literature existing in regard {{to the study of the}} image of luxury brands due to the complexity of the <b>luxury</b> phenomenon. This <b>article</b> presents the results of an initial qualitative study conducted on focus groups of luxury fragrance consumers, making it possible to identify the types of attributes to be considered when studying the brand image of said luxury products. Subsequently, a quantitative study was conducted to determine the perceived image of the main luxury fragrances brands by consumers. Thanks to this study, it has been possible to determine the typical profile of each of the analyzed brands, to define the underlying dimensions of the image of luxury fragrances brands, and to analyze the correlations and dependency relations existing between the luxury brand dimension and the other attributes of image for the studied brands and between all the image attributes themselves...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} service-sector unions in the United States {{have turned to}} urban land-use {{strategies}} in alliance with community organizations to achieve organizing goals and sustain bargaining regimes in a hostile environment. These union strategies typically entail the formation of project-specific “common cause ” coalitions with community organizations in order to leverage local benefits, living wages, and union rights from private developers and growth-oriented local governments. The labor studies literature on community unionism understands these strategies through the analytical frame of social movement theory, and closely associates them with labor movement renewal. In approaching the question {{from the perspective of}} critical human geography, this article highlights a contradiction that emerges in labor’s land-use campaigns in cases where redevelopment entails the transformation of working-class neighborhoods into spaces of production and <b>luxury</b> consumption. The <b>article</b> argues that a strategy of negotiating distributional shares out of prospective increases in land values in such cases encourages union-community coalitions to prioritize workplace over residential demands, in turn reproducing structural divisions between labor and community. The argument is sustained through a discussion of the involvement of the New York City hotel workers union, UNITE-HERE Local 6, in a labor-community coalition formed to contest the terms of the redevelopment of Coney Island. The case study casts some doubt on whether labor-community land use strategies of this type are consistent with labor movement renewal...|$|R
40|$|Collecting porcelain, furniture, lacquer, ivory objects, {{statues and}} folding screens from the Far East became {{very popular in}} Europe {{in the course of}} the eighteenth century. The Dutch nabob Jan Albert Sichterman (1692 - 1764), who as VOC-director made a big career in Bengal, was a {{dedicated}} follower of this fashion. As the owner of both a new built townhouse and a country estate in respectively the town and the province of Groningen, he imitated the lifestyle of the rich merchants of Amsterdam and Middelburg. The balcony above the extravagantly carved door of his imposing new mansion was decorated with beautiful ironwork incorporating the monogram J. A. S. supported by two Moorish herms in sandstone. Sichterman liked to show his oriental porcelain, statues and furniture to his visitors, who came from all over Europe; he had even educated one of his black servants to guide his guests through all the rooms and cabinets, full of objects of art and <b>luxury.</b> In this <b>article</b> the author uses the perspective of the historical anthropologist interested in the social and cultural processes of imitation, the symbolic aspects of social superiority and the development of personal and collective taste. Collectively, eighteenth-century nabobs are usually associated with conspicuous consumption and portrayed as typical nouveaux riches; they lack the specific form of distinction that Pierre Bourdieu has discovered: the seemingly natural, ‘embodied’ superiority in social intercourse. For this reason they tended to compensate for this lack by demonstrating material luxury. But there is still the riddle of Sichterman as an individual collector. Had he developed an aesthetic taste and did he enjoy his treasures as vehicles of pure beauty...|$|R
