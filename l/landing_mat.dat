25|$|A double mini-trampoline {{competition}} {{consists of}} two types of pass. In the one, which {{is known as a}} mounter pass, the athlete performs one skill in the jump from the sloping end to the flat bed and a second skill as they dismount from the flat bed to the <b>landing</b> <b>mat.</b> In the second, which is known as a spotter pass, the athlete does a straight jump from the sloping end to the flat bed to gain height, then after landing on the flat, performs the first skill, then after landing on the flat a second time, performs a second skill as they dismount. These skills are similar to those performed on a regular trampoline except that there is forward movement along the trampoline.|$|E

5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned <b>landing</b> <b>mats.</b> The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of <b>landing</b> <b>mats</b> behind it.|$|R

A 3,700' long north/south apron sat to the southwest of the <b>landing</b> <b>mat,</b> and west of the apron was the building area. In addition, the airfield had a PX gas station, 10 gas tanks, a truck fill station, oil & lube station, motor repair shop with 4 grease racks & 4 underground tanks, fire station, cadet quarters, warehouses, officers quarters, mess hall, utilities shop, chapel, classrooms, water reservoir & water well, taxiways, runway, landing field, and two hangars.|$|E
50|$|Donald Wallace (Wally) Gordon (4 February 1932 - 11 April 2016) was an American gymnast and Inventor who {{is notable}} for inventing the first <b>landing</b> <b>mats,</b> incline mats, octagons {{and all the}} other foam shapes that {{currently}} fill gymnastic schools. Gordon also invented the foam landing pits for pole-vaulters and high jumpers used in all Track and Field competitions including the 1968 Olympics, where they made their first Olympic debut.|$|R
50|$|Located within Gills Field House, Crowell Track is {{the home}} of Army's indoor track & field team. Crowell track {{features}} a six-lane (eight on the straightaway), 200-meter, mondo-surface oval track. This lightning-fast track incorporates the same surface as the tracks used in the Atlanta and Sydney Olympic Games. The facility is also equipped with two jumping pits, mondo pole vault runway with new UCS 1900 landing system and a mondo high jump apron with UCS <b>landing</b> <b>mats.</b> There is an indoor throwing cage and sector, as well as throwing nets to allow for discus and hammer practice.|$|R
50|$|Practitioners usually {{perform the}} {{majority}} of their tricks on grass or plyometric flooring. Foam <b>landing</b> <b>mats,</b> trampolines or jumping jamporees are utilized to become familiar with new movements in a safe environment. In addition to practicing the movements of tricking, many tricksters improve physical fitness to complement their training. A mutually common skill among many tricksters is body conditioning and strength training, as many of the movements within the activity require a high level of strength. Dynamic and static flexibility training is also commonly practiced by tricksters due to the high range of motion many tricks require.|$|R

50|$|Typically, in both {{competition}} and practice, {{the use of}} mats is mandatory. On every event except floor exercise, pommel horse and vault, gymnasts may use an additional <b>landing</b> <b>mat,</b> without deduction, which may be adjusted for distance.|$|E
50|$|A typical later PSP was the M8 <b>landing</b> <b>mat.</b> A {{single piece}} weighed about 66 pounds and was 10 ft long by 15 in wide. The hole pattern for the sheet was three holes wide by 29 holes long {{resulting}} in 87 holes per mat.|$|E
50|$|Throughout her World War II service, Mercury {{operated}} in the Pacific Ocean, beginning with long {{runs from the}} west coast to the South Pacific and ending with underway replenishments for the fast carrier forces. The converted merchantman completed her maiden wartime voyage at San Francisco, California, 27 September 1942 having carried a mixed cargo, which included drummed petroleum products, <b>landing</b> <b>mats,</b> dynamite, engineering equipment, and food, to Noumea and Guadalcanal. Over the next 15 months she continued to carry essential materiel to the South Pacific, supporting Allied forces as they pushed through the Solomons and the Gilberts.|$|R
50|$|Although {{succeeded by}} the more {{efficient}} layout techniques ofthe western roll and (in the 1930s) by the straddle, the easterncut-off continued to be competitive at an international level untilthe 1940s in the men's high jump, and until the 1960s in the women'shigh jump. It was used by John Winter of Australia to win the high jump in the Olympics of 1948, and by Iolanda Balas of Romania to win the women's high jump in the Olympics of 1960 and 1964. Even today, the eastern cut-off is used by high school jumpers in Kenya, where the lack of foam <b>landing</b> <b>mats</b> necessitates a style where jumpers land on their feet.|$|R
25|$|This {{is often}} highly {{emphasized}} by spectators and novice vaulters, {{but it is}} arguably the easiest phase of the vault and {{is a result of}} proper execution of previous phases. This phase mainly consists of the vaulter pushing off the pole and releasing it so it falls away from the bar and mats. As the torso goes over and around the bar, the vaulter is facing the bar. Rotation of the body over the bar occurs naturally, and the vaulter's main concern is making sure that their arms, face and any other appendages do not knock the bar off as they go over. The vaulter should land near the middle of the foam <b>landing</b> <b>mats,</b> or pits, face up.|$|R
50|$|Korean-style teeterboard {{is a form}} of teeterboard {{where two}} {{performers}} jump vertically in place, landing back on the apparatus instead of dismounting onto a <b>landing</b> <b>mat</b> or human pyramid.

50|$|Gymnasts are {{expected}} to land cleanly, with no hops or steps, and within a set landing zone on the <b>landing</b> <b>mat.</b> They must also demonstrate good technique and execution in the actual vault. Falling or stepping on landing incurs deduction, as will lack of height off the table, or distance from the table.|$|E

50|$|Arnold {{correctly}} {{anticipated that}} the U.S. would have to build forward airfields in inhospitable places. Working closely with the Army Corps of Engineers, he created Aviation Engineer Battalions that by 1945 included 118,000 men. Runways, hangars, radar stations, power generators, barracks, gasoline storage tanks and ordnance dumps had to be built hurriedly on tiny coral islands, mud flats, featureless deserts, dense jungles, or exposed locations still under enemy artillery fire. The heavy construction gear had to be imported, along with the engineers, blueprints, steel-mesh <b>landing</b> <b>mats,</b> prefabricated hangars, aviation fuel, bombs and ammunition, and all necessary supplies. As soon as one project was finished the battalion would load up its gear and move {{forward to the next}} challenge, while headquarters inked in a new airfield on the maps.|$|R
5000|$|Bushnell had a 6,000-foot {{hard-surface}} {{runway and}} a 4,000-foot NNE/SSW steel plank <b>landing</b> <b>mat</b> runway {{but had no}} radio facilities, no gasoline, and no hangars. The 6,000-foot runway {{was known as the}} [...] "bomber runway", while the 4,000-foot strip was known as the [...] "fighter runway". An aircraft parking area was apparently located at the southwest end of the bomber runway.|$|E
5000|$|Following the war, many {{bases and}} {{auxiliary}} fields {{were given to}} local governments or returned to service as municipal airports. Often, budget constraints caused the new owners to close or even remove the [...] "extra" [...] runways, retaining only those that faced into the prevailing winds. In at least one case (Orland), large portions of a <b>landing</b> <b>mat</b> were removed, leaving a conventional runway and ramp.|$|E
50|$|The United States Navy {{proposed}} to the U.S. Congress {{the development of}} a lighter-than-air station program for anti-submarine patrolling of the coast and harbors. This program proposed, in addition to the expansion at NAS and Lakehurst, the construction of new stations.

25|$|There {{was a lack}} of airfields in the Western sectors, and {{authorities}} drafted contingency plans to deal with such a blockade. Plans included the laying down of metal <b>landing</b> <b>mats</b> at Schönbrunn. The Soviets did not blockade the city. The Potsdam Agreement included written rights of land access to the western sectors, whereas no such written guarantees had covered the western sectors of Berlin. During the 10 years of the four-power occupation, Vienna became a hot-bed for international espionage between the Western and Eastern blocs. In the wake of the Berlin Blockade, the Cold War in Vienna took on a different dynamic. While accepting that Germany and Berlin would be divided, the Soviets had decided against allowing the same state of affairs to arise in Austria and Vienna. Here, the Soviet forces controlled districts 2, 4, 10, 20, 21 and 22 and all areas incorporated into Vienna in 1938.|$|R

The rate of injury {{was not related to}} any identified design or safety feature of the walls, although upper limb injuries were proportionally more common in walls which provided thinner fixed <b>landing</b> <b>mats</b> rather than thicker, moveable crash mats. The overall rate of injury was very low and climbers seem to modify risk taking behaviour and thus compensate for the level of safety equipment available. It may be possible to reduce the injury rate further by providing seamless ground cover with matting of adequate energy absorbency...|$|R

The Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill for 1941, passed July 3, 1941, changed the authorization {{to the construction}} of 8 facilities to accommodate a total of 48 airships (as requested in 1940), but due to steel rations, a total of 17 large wooden hangars were built among 10 LTA bases.|$|E
50|$|The {{surfacing}} material {{selected for the}} building of advanced landing grounds during the first weeks after the Normandy invasion was known as square-mesh track (SMT). SMT, a British development, was material composed of heavy wire joined in three-inch squares. It was chosen over other {{surfacing material}}s because it was very lightweight, allowing sufficient quantities to be transported across the English channel on over-tasked landing craft.
