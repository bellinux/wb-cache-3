50|$|A {{telephone}} call {{is made to}} an elderly person with a family member who is supposedly {{in some kind of}} trouble, usually claiming to be a grandson or granddaughter. These calls are often placed late at night or early in the morning when most people are not thinking that clearly. Callers assume that their targets have grandchildren and will usually have several other people in on the scam, such as a bail bondsman, the arresting police officer, a lawyer, a doctor at a hospital, or some other person. The first voice on the phone is usually by the scammer pretending to be the grandchild sounding upset and typically stating that {{there are only a few}} moments to talk. The caller may say that they have a cold if the victim does not recognize their voice. Their story generally follows a familiar line: they were traveling in another country with a friend, and after a car accident or <b>legal</b> <b>infraction,</b> they are in jail and need bail money wired to a Western Union account as soon as possible for their quick release. The caller does not want anyone told about the incident, especially not family. Before the victim can ask too much about the situation the phony child will hand the phone over to the accomplice who will then request money to be transferred to release the grandchild from jail. While this is commonly called the grandparent scam, criminals may also claim to be a family friend, a niece or nephew, or another family member.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} estimates of the actual cost of corruption. [...] According to official government statistics from Rosstat, the [...] "shadow economy" [...] occupied only 15% of Russia's GDP in 2011, and this included unreported salaries (to avoid taxes and social payments) {{and other types of}} tax evasion.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} impulsivity {{in football}} {{players in the}} National Football League (NFL) {{to determine the extent}} to which impulsiveness predicts athletic success and negative consequences. Twenty-four professional football players from eight NFL teams participated in this study, twelve of whom had been drafted out of college. Players were interviewed and administered several tests of impulsivity including a neuropsychological instrument and two self-report questionnaires. In addition, a collateral (e. g., teammate or friend) provided corroborative information. Data were collected at the end of the season regarding the number of game penalties, games started, and games played. Feedback sessions were conducted via phone or in person with each player, and written feedback of the test results and relevant impressions was mailed to the player in the form of a one-page written summary. This sample of professional football players showed moderate levels of impulsivity. In a planning task, athletes who spent more time planning solved a greater number of problems correctly. However, when they acted impulsively, their behaviors generally served a functional purpose. Players who sustained a higher number of head injuries were more likely to show higher levels of dysfunctional impulsivity and use a more impulsive problem solving approach. Length of participation in football was not related to levels of impulsivity in this group of NFL football players. Players 2 Ì† 7 scores of functional impulsivity related to their athletic success; players who reported that they like to make split-second decisions and take advantage of unexpected opportunities were also more likely to be rated positively by a professional scout, play and start in games, and survive in the NFL. In addition, a combination of measures including a self-report questionnaire, the investigator 2 Ì† 7 s clinical rating based on players 2 Ì† 7 responses during the interviews, a behavioral measure, and corroborative information significantly predicted athletic success. Players who reported higher levels of functional impulsivity were significantly less likely to experience game penalties and <b>legal</b> <b>infractions.</b> The investigator 2 Ì† 7 s rating of the players was the most accurate predictor of negative outcomes; athletes who reported more frequent incidents of interpersonal dysfunction, aggression to friends and family, and a need for immediate gratification were more likely to commit <b>legal</b> <b>infractions</b> and game penalties. Factors that contributed to developing impulsive tendencies included being socialized within the violent and aggressive culture of football, functioning within an unpredictable environment, and receiving lesser consequences for deviant behaviors. This study provided initial support for the use of the Impulsivity Checklist as a measure of impulsivity in NFL football players and supported the current finding in the literature that a multidimensional approach should be utilized to measure impulsivity. Lastly, the research findings provided initial evidence that utilizing a more impulsive response style in the appropriate context can be a functional quality. ...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Lancaster DuBois, {{a wealthy}} and mild-mannered black man, is an {{assistant}} district attorney and close friend of Robert Freeman. Tom, being non-confrontational and skittish by nature, adheres strictly to the law, particularly due to his irrational fear of being sent to prison and anally raped. This fear originated when Tom was exposed {{at a very young}} age to a television series that depicted a violent prison rape. The fear developed to such a degree that Tom refused to participate in even the slightest of <b>legal</b> <b>infractions</b> (even those that are not punishable by a prison sentence) as a youth and throughout adulthood. His job as a prosecuting attorney is ironic: He essentially sends other people (mostly black men) to the fate he himself most fears, and he seems to feel guilty about it. Tom is ultimately forced to confront his phobia in the third season episode A Date With the Booty Warrior, where he comes face to face with a rapist dubbed [...] "Booty Warrior" [...] after being trapped in a prison washroom during a riot. Tom seemingly conquers his fear after beating the would-be rapist unconscious with a bar of soap (after he slipped and fell on his back), and also mentions to Sarah that he plans on becoming a public defender in order to save young men from being violated in prison.|$|R

40|$|The {{histories}} of the Opium War, {{of which there are}} many, have posited that the roots of the conflict are diverse and interconnected, ranging from cultural differences to conflicting perspectives on trade. Many historians even imply that the Opium War was somehow inevitable. They point to the famous Macartney Mission of 1793, in which the first British diplomat to meet the Chinese emperor refused to kowtow and was subsequently denied formal diplomatic relations with the Chinese. However, in investigating documents of the British East India Company at Canton some years later, the war in no way seemed predestined. On the contrary, there existed a collaborative and mutually beneficial relationship between the Chinese and British merchants at Canton. Through examining the archives of the East India Company Factory at Canton from March 1833 until July 1834 it becomes quite clear that the internal problems of regulating trade at Canton, the relationship with the Hong Merchants, the attitudes toward the Chinese, and the legal and political issues that arose all paint a lucid, new narrative of the root of the Opium War. The documents demonstrate that the Companyâ€™s successful management of the tenuous relationship with the Chinese merchants at Canton actually helped avoid conflict and <b>legal</b> <b>infractions</b> with higher authorities. Although the Company lacked true authority over the British subjects at Cantonâ€”other than providing them with licensesâ€”it carried out the difficult task of representing the entire British community to the Chinese. Thus, when significant problems arose, the companyâ€™s long-standing relationship with the Chinese merchants ultimately led to decades of a stable, lucrative trade for the British. However, when the Company lost its monopoly over the China trade in April of 1834, the management of the relationship drastically changed. The first British superintendent of trade, Lord Napier, would exhibit stubbornness, belligerence and a misunderstanding of the Chinese. Refusing to draw upon the knowledge of colleagues who were experienced in the China trade, his cavalier actions set Sino-British relations on a path to war. It was the loss of the British East India Companyâ€™s monopoly and the subsequent restructuring of the trade relationship on the ground at Canton that would ultimately {{set the stage for the}} precipitation of armed conflict in the Opium War of 1840...|$|R
