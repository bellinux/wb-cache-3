6000|$|... [29] The {{price of}} blood in the Somali country is the highest sanctioned by El Islam. It must be remembered that amongst the pagan Arabs, the Korayah [...] "diyat," [...] was twenty she-camels. Abd el Muttaleb, {{grandfather}} of Mohammed, sacrificed 100 animals to ransom the life of his son, forfeited by a rash vow, and from that time the greater became the <b>legal</b> <b>number.</b> The Somal usually demand 100 she-camels, or 300 sheep and a few cows; here, as in Arabia, the sum is made up by all the near relations of the slayer; 30 of the animals may be aged, and 30 under age, but the rest must be sound and good. Many tribes take less,--from strangers 100 sheep, a cow, and a camel;--but after the equivalent is paid, the murderer or one of his clan, contrary to the spirit of El Islam, is generally killed by the kindred or tribe of the slain. When blood is shed in the same tribe, the full reparation, if accepted by the relatives, is always exacted; this serves the purpose of preventing fratricidal strife, for in such a nation of murderers, only the Diyat prevents the taking of life.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{exceptions}} to the rules have been granted. Usually, this was done for a few reasons. First, players who had a <b>legal</b> <b>number</b> under a prior set of rules were allowed to keep the number (this happened to many players after the 1973 numbering conventions were established). Second, players may have played one position early in their career, but switched to a new position and retained their old number. Third, a team may exhaust the available numbers for one position, and thus {{have no choice but}} to assign a different number to a player. This was more frequent prior to the 21st century when numbering rules were more strict; for example until 2004 both wide receivers and tight ends were required to be between 80-89 and under modern offenses, it is likely that teams would have more than 10 such players. The addition of the 10-19 range for wide receivers and the 40-49 range for tight ends has reduced these problems. There are some positions, such as long snapper and gunner which are not covered at all by the official numbering conventions, players in those positions are given a wide range of numbers, and may even be [...] "officially" [...] listed as a position such as [...] "wide receiver" [...] or [...] "tight end", even if they rarely if ever play those positions in game situations.|$|R
