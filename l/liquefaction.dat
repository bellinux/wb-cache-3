5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to <b>liquefaction</b> in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of <b>liquefaction</b> in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for <b>liquefaction</b> to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{extraction}} process, using low-temperature gas <b>liquefaction,</b> was not developed {{in time to}} be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft. During World War II, the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc welding. The helium mass spectrometer was also vital in the atomic bomb Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, {{as it can be}} much more powerful than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil <b>liquefaction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Liquid or solid xenon {{nanoparticles}} can {{be formed}} {{at room temperature}} by implanting Xe+ ions into a solid matrix. Many solids have lattice constants smaller than solid Xe. This results in compression of the implanted Xe to pressures that may be sufficient for its <b>liquefaction</b> or solidification.|$|E
5|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air using {{the methods of}} <b>liquefaction</b> of gases, to convert elements to a liquid state, and fractional distillation, to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The prices of the noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance, with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive. As an example, the adjacent table lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.|$|E
5|$|Strong ground motions {{caused many}} {{secondary}} effects, including gas leaks and widespread soil <b>liquefaction.</b> Consequently, sand boils emerged from asphalt roads, toppling a few cars and sinking another. Several {{houses in the}} hill suburbs of Sumner and Redcliffs were affected by falling boulders from hillsides. Following its occurrence, much of Christchurch lost water pressure; residents were thus urged to conserve water use. In {{some parts of the}} Heathcote Valley, previously dormant or non-existent natural springs surfaced {{as a consequence of the}} sudden rise in the water table, flooding some properties.|$|E
5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired in mud pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil <b>liquefaction</b> from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages {{can be attributed to}} the tendency of smaller animals to become trapped in the mud (other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also hint at the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E
5|$|AMI Stadium was {{significantly}} damaged during the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, with cracks in some stands and the playing surface badly damaged by <b>liquefaction</b> {{as well as}} damage to infrastructure and streets surrounding the venue. As {{a result of the}} damage all scheduled 2011 World Cup games to be held in Christchurch were moved to other regions. test rugby returned to Christchurch in 2012 at Rugby League Park. Although the stands at that venue were damaged severely enough that they had to be torn down, infrastructure damage was much less severe than at AMI Stadium, and the playing surface survived relatively intact. The stadium was rebuilt with a permanent capacity of 17,000, with temporary seating allowing for 9,000 more spectators.|$|E
5|$|During the 1974 {{legislative}} session, Ford {{proposed a}} six-year study of coal <b>liquefaction</b> and gasification {{in response to}} the 1973 oil crisis. He also increased funding to human resources and continued his reorganization of the executive branch, creating cabinets for transportation, development, education and the arts, human resources, consumer protection and regulation, safety and justice. He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers. Despite the expansion, he was criticized for the replacements he made, particularly that of the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration. Critics also cited the fact that employees found qualified by the merit examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were hired.|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the damage}} from the Gorda Basin {{earthquake}} was considered light, there were some exceptions. In Eureka, effects included broken windows and dishes, fallen chimneys, and merchandise that fell from store shelves. In Fields Landing, King Salmon, Loleta, and Big Lagoon areas, the strongest effects included surface cracks on the ground, soil <b>liquefaction,</b> small landslides and rockfalls, and numerous slumps along the Eel River. Similar effects occurred along the Old Coast Highway near Trinidad and Moonstone, where the roadway was reduced to one lane of travel in some areas. Several homes were knocked off their foundations and a highway overpass collapsed in Fields Landing. Seismic wave amplification, poor design, or inadequate construction style {{may have contributed to}} losses there.|$|E
5|$|Attacks on airfields and {{transportation}} infrastructure in southern Japan continued {{until the end}} of the war. By this time the Fifth Air Force's bombers had flown 138 sorties against airfields in Kyushu and the Seventh Air Force had conducted a further 784. Road and railway bridges were attacked by both fighters and bombers, and the city of Kagoshima was frequently bombed. Seventh Air Force B-24 Liberators also bombed the railway terminals in the port of Nagasaki on 31July and 1August. While these raids were focused on tactical targets, the Okinawa-based aircraft made several strategic attacks against industrial facilities; these included an unsuccessful raid on a coal <b>liquefaction</b> plant at Ōmuta on 7August. Bombers of the Fifth and Seventh Air Forces also made firebombing attacks against Tarumizu on 5August, Kumamoto on 10August and Kurume the next day. The FEAF staged its last attacks against Japan on 12August; aircraft were dispatched on 14August but recalled while en route to their targets. Overall, the two air forces flew 6,435 sorties against targets in Kyushu during July and August for the loss of 43 aircraft to Japanese anti-aircraft guns and fighters.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, Janssen and Lockyer {{independently}} {{observed a}} yellow {{line in the}} solar spectrum that did not match {{that of any other}} element. In 1895, in each case at around the same time, Ramsay, Cleve, and Langlet independently observed helium trapped in cleveite. André-Marie Ampère predicted an element analogous to chlorine obtainable from hydrofluoric acid, and between 1812 and 1886 many researchers tried to obtain it. Fluorine was eventually isolated by Moissan, in 1886. In 1894, Lord Rayleigh and Ramsay discovered argon by comparing the molecular weights of nitrogen prepared by <b>liquefaction</b> from air and nitrogen prepared by chemical means. It was the first noble gas to be isolated. In 1898, within a period of three weeks, Ramsay and Travers successively separated krypton, neon and xenon from liquid argon by their differences in boiling points. In 1898, Dorn discovered a radioactive gas resulting from the radioactive decay of radium; Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray subsequently isolated radon in 1910.|$|E
25|$|As of January 2016, global nominal LNG <b>liquefaction</b> {{capacity}} was 301.5 MTPA (million tonnes per annum), and <b>liquefaction</b> capacity {{under construction}} was 142 MTPA.|$|E
25|$|Deposits most {{susceptible}} to <b>liquefaction</b> are young (Holocene-age, deposited {{within the last}} 10,000 years) sands and silts of similar grain size (well-sorted), in beds at least metres thick, and saturated with water. Such deposits are often found along stream beds, beaches, dunes, and areas where windblown silt (loess) and sand have accumulated. Some examples of soil <b>liquefaction</b> include quicksand, quick clay, turbidity currents, and earthquake induced <b>liquefaction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Soil <b>liquefaction</b> occurs when, {{because of}} the shaking, {{water-saturated}} granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil <b>liquefaction</b> may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil <b>liquefaction</b> caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of these trains use either APCI AP-C3MR or Cascade technology for the <b>liquefaction</b> process. The other processes, used in {{a small minority of}} some <b>liquefaction</b> plants, include Shell's DMR (double-mixed refrigerant) technology and the Linde technology.|$|E
25|$|Methods to {{mitigate}} the effects of soil <b>liquefaction</b> have been devised by earthquake engineers and include various soil compaction techniques such as vibro compaction (compaction of the soil by depth vibrators), dynamic compaction, and vibro stone columns. These methods result in the densification of soil and enable buildings to withstand soil <b>liquefaction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Soil <b>liquefaction.</b> In {{the cases}} where the soil {{consists}} of loose granular deposited materials with the tendency to develop excessive hydrostatic pore water pressure of sufficient magnitude and compact, <b>liquefaction</b> of those loose saturated deposits may result in non-uniform settlements and tilting of structures. This caused major damage to thousands of buildings in Niigata, Japan during the 1964 earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Soil <b>liquefaction</b> {{induced by}} {{earthquake}} shaking {{is also a}} major contributor to urban seismic risk.|$|E
25|$|A {{feature of}} the quake was {{the damage caused by}} soil <b>liquefaction.</b> This was {{particularly}} the case in the riverside areas of Avonside, Dallington, Burwood, Avondale, and Kaiapoi, and in river delta areas near Bexley, Brooklands, Spencerville, Pines Beach, and Kairaki, with other areas being affected to a substantially lesser degree or not at all. Damage from <b>liquefaction</b> may have been worsened by the high water table from a wet winter.|$|E
25|$|Soil <b>liquefaction</b> {{was evident}} in areas of {{reclaimed}} land around Tokyo, particularly in Urayasu, Chiba City, Funabashi, Narashino (all in Chiba Prefecture) and in the Koto, Edogawa, Minato, Chūō, and Ōta Wards of Tokyo. Approximately 30 homes or buildings were destroyed and 1,046 other buildings were damaged to varying degrees. Nearby Haneda Airport, built mostly on reclaimed land, was not damaged. Odaiba also experienced <b>liquefaction,</b> but damage was minimal.|$|E
25|$|Road {{and bridge}} damage {{occurred}} and hampered rescue efforts. Soil <b>liquefaction</b> and surface flooding also occurred. Road surfaces were forced up by <b>liquefaction,</b> {{and water and}} sand were spewing out of cracks. A number of cars were crushed by falling debris. In the central city, two buses were crushed by falling buildings. Because the earthquake hit during the lunch hour, some people on the footpaths were buried by collapsed buildings.|$|E
25|$|Since 2004, {{the large}} number of orders {{increased}} demand for shipyard slots, raising their price and increasing ship costs. The per-ton construction cost of an LNG <b>liquefaction</b> plant fell steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s. The cost reduced by approximately 35 percent. However, recently the cost of building <b>liquefaction</b> and regasification terminals doubled due to increased cost of materials and a shortage of skilled labor, professional engineers, designers, managers and other white-collar professionals.|$|E
25|$|For an {{extended}} period of time, design improvements in <b>liquefaction</b> plants and tankers had the effect of reducing costs.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{buildings}} can be mitigated by injecting grout {{into the}} soil to stabilize the layer of soil that is subject to <b>liquefaction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diesel fuel is {{produced}} from various sources, {{the most common}} being petroleum. Other sources include biomass, animal fat, biogas, natural gas, and coal <b>liquefaction.</b>|$|E
25|$|In China, {{due to an}} {{increasing}} need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, coal <b>liquefaction</b> projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel. This is probably because China prefers not {{to be dependent on}} foreign oil, instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves. As oil prices were increasing {{during the first half of}} 2009, the coal <b>liquefaction</b> projects in China were again boosted, and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{depolymerisation}} {{is similar}} to other processes which use superheated water as a major step to produce fuels, such as direct Hydrothermal <b>Liquefaction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over geolocic time, <b>liquefaction</b> of soil {{material}} due to earthquakes {{could provide a}} dense parent material in which the fragipan may develop through pedogenesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{destabilizing}} {{action of}} an earthquake on constructions may be direct (seismic {{motion of the}} ground) or indirect (earthquake-induced landslides, soil <b>liquefaction</b> and waves of tsunami).|$|E
25|$|During this earthquake, in some areas, {{especially}} the epicentral zone, mainly in Vrancea, Buzău, Brăila and Dâmbovița counties appeared large ground cracks and <b>liquefaction</b> phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Large {{fractions}} of the settled delta are in soil <b>liquefaction</b> zones above known active faults. Most {{of the local}} faults are named after city streets.|$|E
25|$|Papanui's {{location}} in the north western area of the city saved it from {{the worst of the}} <b>liquefaction</b> that was suffered by the eastern and southern areas.|$|E
25|$|The SPT is used {{to provide}} results for {{empirical}} determination of a sand layer's susceptibility to soil <b>liquefaction,</b> based on research performed by Harry Seed, T. Leslie Youd, and others.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow <b>liquefaction</b> occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow <b>liquefaction</b> will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic <b>liquefaction</b> can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen storage {{technologies}} can {{be divided}} into physical storage, where hydrogen molecules are stored (including pure hydrogen storage via compression and <b>liquefaction),</b> and chemical storage, where hydrides are stored.|$|E
