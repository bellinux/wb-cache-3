500|$|The {{push for}} a new on-campus stadium for Golden Gopher {{football}} began {{in the fall of}} 2000. The university cited poor revenue and lack of a college football atmosphere at the off-campus Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome as their main reasons for wanting to move back on campus. [...] A plan for a joint Minnesota Vikings/University of Minnesota football stadium was proposed in 2002, but differences over how the stadium would be designed and managed, as well as state budget constraints, led to the plan's failure. [...] In September 2003 a highly publicized attempt was made by T. Denny Sanford to be the <b>lead</b> <b>donor</b> for the project, but in early 2004 the plan fell through when the two parties were unable to come to an agreement on the financial terms. [...] The university unveiled preliminary stadium drawings and a general plan to seek state money and donations in December 2003. On March 24, 2005, the university and TCF Bank announced a deal that would have the bank contribute $35million towards the project which would give them naming rights. [...] The deal was given an expiration date of December 31, 2005; time enough for the Minnesota Legislature to provide the bulk of funding needed to make the project a reality.|$|E

Nevertheless, Malhotra fears [...] "the issue of potential conflict when the occupant of the chair takes positions that undermine the very tradition that has backed and funded the chair." [...] According to Malhotra, ... the Vedic traditions are under assault from a school of thought whose fundamental assumptions are dismissive of the sacred dimension. If, out of naivety, we hand over the keys to our institutions and allow outsiders to represent our legacy, then any chance of genuine dialogue will be lost. Furthermore, because of the enormous prestige and power of Western universities, a view of the Sanskrit will become accepted by the public.|$|E
