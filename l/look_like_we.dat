[...] as the best quip of the season. Thomas was also laudatory towards Jordan's character's reactions towards Veronica about events he secretly already knew, such as when he hears a voicemail from Hank not recommending him for an internship. He thought that he played the lie realistically but that one could see through his façade upon a repeat viewing. Because the Dean O'Dell storyline was six episodes instead of the initially scheduled seven, some plot strands had to be removed from the final episode and story arc.|$|E
500|$|For {{the closing}} reveal {{involving}} Melisandre, {{the director of}} the episode stated that a similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in [...] "Mother's Mercy" [...] was used, with Carice van Houten wearing prosthetic makeup for the face that was then transposed onto the real body of an old woman. Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person <b>look</b> <b>like?</b> <b>We</b> don't know. So if you try to create that, then you're creating something that looks beyond our known reality. Here you feel like she's very old without putting a number on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison all later {{stated that}} they regretted {{the manner in which}} Best was sacked. Lennon {{admitted}} that [...] "we were cowards when we sacked him. We made Brian do it." [...] McCartney stated: [...] "I do feel sorry for him, because of what he could have been on to." [...] Harrison said: [...] "We weren't very good at telling Pete he had to go," [...] and [...] "Historically it may <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> did something nasty to Pete and it may have been that we could have handled it better." [...] Starr, on the other hand, feels he has no apology to make: [...] "I never felt sorry … I was not involved." [...] In 1968, authorised Beatles biographer Hunter Davies wrote: [...] "But for the sake of Pete's career, whatever happened to the Beatles afterward, the handling and especially the announcing of the sacking might have been done more neatly and cleanly. He could have been fixed up with a job in another group before the news was announced." [...] Over twenty years later Mark Lewisohn concluded that [...] "Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete, who had served the group unstintingly from their hapless, drummerless Silver Beatles days through three lengthy Hamburg seasons and over 200 Cavern Club performances. He had shared in the heartaches and the headaches, had controlled the Beatles' bookings before Epstein took over, and had made his home – the Casbah – their home. The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now – as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured – he was out. It was the most underhand, unfortunate and unforgivable chapter in the Beatles' rise to monumental power." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Yorke refused an {{invitation}} from Friends of the Earth to meet prime minister Tony Blair to discuss climate change.

[...] He told the Guardian that Blair's advisers had [...] "wanted pre-meetings. They wanted to know that I was on-side. Also, I was being manoeuvred into a position where if I said the wrong thing post-the meeting, Friends of the Earth would lose their access. Which normally would be called blackmail." ...|$|E

[...] "We worked with chemicals, paint, fluorescent dyes, smoke, liquids, CO2, flares, spin dishes, fluid dynamics, lighting and high speed photography to see how effective they might be," [...] said Trumbull. [...] "It was a free-wheeling opportunity to explore, something that I have found extraordinarily hard to get in the movie business. Terry didn't have any preconceived ideas of what something should <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> <b>We</b> did things like pour milk through a funnel into a narrow trough and shoot it with a high-speed camera and folded lens, lighting it carefully and using a frame rate that would give the right kind of flow characteristics to look cosmic, galactic, huge and epic." [...] The team also included Double Negative in London. Fluid-based effects were developed by Peter and Chris Parks, who had previously worked on similar effects for The Fountain.|$|E

2500|$|Recall {{that the}} moral law, if it exists, must apply universally and necessarily. Therefore, a moral law could never rest on {{hypothetical}} imperatives, which only apply if one adopts some particular end. Rather, the imperative associated with the moral law must be a categorical imperative. The categorical imperative holds for all rational agents, regardless of whatever varying ends a person may have. If we could find it, the categorical imperative would provide us with the moral law. What would the categorical imperative <b>look</b> <b>like?</b> <b>We</b> know that it could never {{be based on the}} particular ends that people adopt to give themselves rules of action. Kant thinks that this leaves us with one remaining alternative, namely that the categorical imperative must be based on the notion of a law itself. Laws (or commands), by definition, apply universally. [...] From this observation, Kant derives the categorical imperative, which requires that moral agents act only {{in a way that the}} principle of their will could become a universal law. (4:421) The categorical imperative is a test of proposed maxims; it does not generate a list of duties on its own. [...] The categorical imperative is Kant’s general statement of the supreme principle of morality, but Kant goes on to provide three different formulations of this general statement.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1990, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Taylor {{would fight}} over Ridge's affection for years. In 2013, Tylo {{revealed}} {{that she and}} Lang would distance themselves from each other to make their on-screen rivalry convincing: [...] "We cannot look comfortable with each other. [...] We need to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> are {{in a place of}} competition." [...] In 2007, Brooke and Taylor's rivalry intensified when Brooke begins pursuing Nick Marone (Jack Wagner) while he is married to Taylor. Soap Opera Digest noted that the women were [...] "crossing swords once again for the same man". Tylo observed that both Brooke and Taylor were being written with [...] "more intelligence" [...] this time around, and was happy in revisiting the rivalry between them as [...] "long as it wasn't over Ridge" [...] again. Taylor becomes pregnant with Nick's child through In vitro fertilisation (IVF), having struggled to conceive a child, and gives birth to Jack Marone. However, because of a mistake that Bridget had made in the lab, it was Brooke's eggs which were implanted in Taylor and not the donor's; making Brooke Jack's biological mother. She fears that her baby will be drawn to Brooke. Taylor begins drinking and becomes mentally unstable, with her parental rights being taken away. The scenes where Taylor loses custody and suffers a breakdown in court were filmed shortly after Tylo's own son died. Tylo told On-Air On-Soaps: [...] "I got a lot of emails from people worrying. They would go from worrying about me to saying, 'Was I okay with those scenes and after them?'" [...] The actress said that she tapped into her own tragedy when portraying those scenes, and allowed herself to feel the [...] "feeling that will never go away which is, 'It's not fair'". Taylor is soon awarded joint custody of Jack when she passes a mental health evaluation. However, she cannot bond with him and ends up giving Jack to Brooke in the end.|$|E

There's swell pickings for an honest politician here, Hank: a whole city working to provide cigars and fried chicken and dry martinis for us, and rallying to our banner with indignation, oh, fierce indignation, whenever some squealer like this fellow Seneca Doane comes along! Honest, Hank, a smart codger like me ought to be ashamed of himself if he didn't milk cattle like them, when they come around mooing for it! But the Traction gang can't get away with grand larceny like it used to. I wonder when--Hank, I wish we could fix some way to run this fellow Seneca Doane out of town. It's him or us!" ...|$|E
