In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 minutes to complete on a 750MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, Intrusion Detection with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further intrusion attempts. The program provides notifications for intrusion attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall can put the computer in stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the security level, affecting the number of notifications. Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect outbound connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts.|$|E

40|$|A high {{pressure}} and variable temperature cryogenic <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> system was conceived and designed {{in order to}} conduct leakage testing of pipe fittings/valves in liquid hydrogen supply lines of the Space Shuttle.

In terms of cryogenic <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> the system has a special capability for extensive applications.

5000|$|The Helium <b>leak</b> <b>test,</b> The leak {{detection}} method uses helium (the lightest inert gas) as a tracer gas and detects it in concentrations {{as small as}} one part in 10 million. The helium is selected primarily because it penetrates small leaks readily, is inert and will not react with the test piece and also has a natural low quantity in air making detection less complicated. It is possible to detect leaks as small as 5.10-10 pa m3/s in vacuum mode and modern digital machines can detect 5.10-10 pa m3/s in sniffing mode.|$|E

5000|$|A {{torque tester}} [...] is {{required}} during the packaging design process. It {{could be used}} as a destructive tester to identify if there is any material weakness of the packaging during the screwing process. It also allows to define the torque tolerances of the capping machine. The lower torque limit is considered as the minimum pressure of the cap to avoid any leak of the product. This torque test needs to be combined with a <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> with secure seal analyzer. The higher torque limit is the maximum torque the customer can apply to open or close the product's cap.|$|E

40|$|Vacuum box <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> is, {{because of}} {{geometrical}} problems, {{not always possible}} and therefore an alternate test method with dye penetrant is used. DEKRA Industrial has identified a need for quality assurance of the method and development of a written procedure with guidelines that lead to more uniform ways of testing. A literature study was done to get a general overview of nondestructive testing (NDT) and {{to see how the}} method is used in different applications. European and American standards were studied. Analytical and numerical solutions, involving flow simulation, were deemed to be rather difficult and beyond the scoop of this project. Thus the problems had to be solved by using experimental methods. Interviews with personnel involved in <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> were also done. The results of the interviews showed that how the method was applied varied very much and development of a procedure is therefore necessary. Standards that specifically deal with <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> with dye penetrant do not exists but parts of general NDT and PT standards have been deemed as relevant. The results of the experiments showed that the method, although not as good as <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> with vacuum boxes, is reliable within its limitations. The limitations are mainly coupled to geometrical and weather conditions. No adequate penetration times could be determined...|$|R

A periodic <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> that could have revealed the problem was omitted. Furthermore, the emergency floats failed to operate.

50|$|The Shower: The contestants must {{remove a}} sink {{in their rooms}} and install shower stalls using a prefab shower kit.

Dez accidentally melts the plastic tap connectors, but thanks to Geoff's advice, manages to save his plumbing. He and Casey both finish, but whether they leak is another matter. The next day, because Tex, Joe, and Charmaine quit (Tex not even having unboxed his shower kit), they fail the <b>leak</b> <b>test.</b> Casey and Dez have leaky plumbing, so they both fail.|$|E

Volume 1, describes that portion of the liquid low-level waste system at that will be tested; it provides the regulatory background, especially in terms of the requirements stipulated in the Federal Facilities Agreement, upon which the <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> plan is based. Volume 1 also describes the foundation of the plan, portions of which were abstracted from existing federal documents that regulate the petroleum and hazardous chemicals industries. Finally, Volume 1 gives an overview the plan, describing the methods that will be used to test the four classes of components in the liquid low-level waste system. Volume 2 takes the general information on component classes and leak detection methods presented in Volume 1 and shows how it applies particularly to each of the individual components. A complete test plan for each of the components is presented, with emphasis placed on the methods designated for testing tanks. The protocol for testing tank systems is described, and general <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> schedules are presented. Volume 3 describes the results of a performance evaluation completed for the <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> method that will be used to test the small tanks at the facility (those less than 3, 000 gal in capacity). Some of the details described in Volumes 1 and 2 are expected to change as additional information is obtained, as the viability of candidate release detection methods is proven in the Oak Ridge environment, and as the testing program evolves...|$|R
