40|$|This study {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} linking {{the current account}} balance to its major determinants such as exchange rate, interest rate and budget balance in 7 of the EU member countries: Bulgaria, Greece, Ireland, Italy, <b>Latvia,</b> <b>Portugal</b> and Spain. Using the panel version of various cointegration tests, we find a long-run relationship between the current account and its determinants. The long-run coefficient of the interest rate is found statistically significant in all estimation techniques. On the other hand, weak evidence is found {{for the existence of}} the twin deficit hypothesis...|$|R
30|$|Somewhat weaker {{evidence}} of a positive relationship was apparent in Lithuania, Luxembourg, <b>Latvia,</b> <b>Portugal</b> and Sweden. However, {{in some cases the}} span of the data was generally quite limited (15  years or less). As such, we did not read too much into these outcomes. Similarly, for the one country for which there might arguably be a negative relationship between telephone uptake and productivity growth, Malta, there were only ten observations and this hardly provided strong {{evidence of}} the estimated negative relationship. Moreover, only two of the four equations satisfied our criteria for a valid statistical relationship between productivity growth and infrastructure.|$|R

50|$|World {{basketball}} was growing, {{but it was}} on June 18, 1932 that a real {{international organization}} was formed, to coordinate tournaments and teams: that day, Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, <b>Latvia,</b> <b>Portugal,</b> Romania and Switzerland founded the International Basketball Federation (Fédération internationale de basketball amateur, FIBA) in Geneva. Its work was fundamental for the first inclusion of basketball in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936.

It also topped the charts in Argentina, Italy, Hungary, <b>Latvia,</b> <b>Portugal,</b> Mexico, and the Netherlands. The success of the song was so massive that it spent 54 weeks inside the Canadian charts. The video for the song received attention in the United States, due to Hollywood actress Daryl Hannah appearing as his love interest, leading radio stations to play the track.|$|R
