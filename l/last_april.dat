500|$|As {{the season}} wound down, Benfica was battling for a direct {{qualification}} for the Champions League with six matches remaining. On 6 April, the club played Boavista on the road. The hosts were undefeated at home since October, but Benfica {{had an opportunity}} to gain ground over Vitória de Guimarães (who had lost points hours earlier). Neither team could penetrate the other's defence, despite Boavista's 24th-minute penalty kick, and the game ended in a scoreless draw. Chalana was highly critical of the refereeing: [...] "What happened here was a disgrace." [...] The following Friday, Benfica hosted Académica. In the fourth minute Luisão lost the ball to Miguel Pedro, who scored for Académica. At the 30-minute mark, Markus Berger added another, and in the second half, Luis Aguiar scored a third. It was the fourth time in Benfica's history that they lost by three goals at home, matching their worst result in the Primeira Liga. They had lost 3–0 to Boavista in 1998–99 and 4–1 to Sporting CP in 1938–39 and 1947–48. Chalana was resigned: [...] "There are days like this." [...] With the loss, Benfica had lost 18 points in Luz, was 21 points behind Porto and fell from second to fourth place. On 16 April, the club visited the Alvalade for the Portuguese Cup semi-finals. Benfica began the game well, with first-half goals by Rui Costa and Nuno Gomes. Sporting mobilized in the second half, scoring three goals in 12 minutes. Rodríguez tied the game for Benfica before Sporting scored two more goals, eliminating Benfica. Chalana attributed the loss to poor refereeing: [...] "We started strong, scored two goals and could have scored a third if the referee had signalled a penalty over Luisão. It would be the 3–0 and would have killed the game." [...] Four days later, Benfica played Porto at the Estádio do Dragão. Lisandro López scored goals in the seventh and 80th minutes to give Porto a 2–0 win, increasing the difference between them to 24 points. Despite amassing five out of a possible 15 points since becoming manager and trailing second-place Vitória de Guimarães by four points, Chalana remained hopeful: [...] "Nothing is lost, Benfica will use all their weapons to win the remaining nine points." [...] The club's <b>last</b> <b>April</b> match was a 2–0 victory over Belenenses, with Chalana praising his players' performance against [...] "a very good team".|$|E
2500|$|Adult Swim had {{a direct}} and {{important}} role in the revival of an aforementioned popular animated series, Family Guy. Due to the series' popularity in reruns, the block burned off [...] "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein", an episode of the series that had been banned from airing on Fox, in 2003. On September 21, 2003 Seth Macfarlane guessed voice on the Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode [...] "Super Trivia". In 2004 from July 26 through July 29 Adult Swim had a week dedicated to Seth MacFarlane where It had him host a Family Guy marathon showing select episodes. On March 29, 2004, less than one year later, Fox announced it would be renewing Family Guy for a fourth season and reviving it from cancellation. Shortly after the announcement, Jim Samples, then-general manager and executive vice president of Cartoon Network, commented, [...] "Bringing Family Guy to the Adult Swim lineup <b>last</b> <b>April</b> really helped turn the block into a cultural phenomenon with young adults." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 July 2006, a {{man called}} in at 6.23pm to say [...] "Ada bom" [...] (There is a bomb) {{but it turned out}} to a bomb hoax. A section of Kuching International Airport's (KIA) {{domestic}} arrival entrance was cordoned off for several hours after a suspicious looking black plastic bag was found lying near one of the pillars there. MAB quickly cordoned off the area and quietly diverted the public and passengers to other sections of the KIA complex. With the aid of a Robot Scanner, the Bomb Disposal Unit closed in to check the package and twice blasted it with shotgun pellets. A thorough check by one of the police from the Bomb Disposal Unit in special suit confirmed that the black plastic bag actually contained rubbish. Nevertheless, none of the flights were rescheduled or cancelled during the whole episode. This is the first bomb hoax incident reported since the KIA was refurbished and reopened early <b>last</b> <b>April.</b>|$|E

Daniel Norris, who started the second game of the series, pitched the longest MLB game of his career, and appeared to overcome what he had described as a [...] "dead arm" [...] phase.

The Chamber of Deputies of Chile reaffirmed its commitment to peace and urged the Republic of Azerbaijan for the immediate cessation of all acts of war against the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh and the strict observance of the truce signed by both countries in 1994.
