40|$|Purpose: One key {{variable}} for improving efficiency in freight transport systems {{is to increase}} the load factor; the ratio of the actual load carried to the maximum load that could have been carried. A high <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in transport operations is of interest for several reasons; to lower costs and to reduce environmental impact. Shippers have a large influence on transport operations e. g. through choices concerning packaging, loading and planning. Therefore, it is of interest what opportunities there are for shippers to improve <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Meanwhile, there are few studies focusing on <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Since <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is often one of many aspects examined when discussing wider topics, such as transport efficiency, the research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is dispersed. Thus, it is difficult to get an overview of the subject, in particular to identify opportunities from a shipper’s perspective. To address the lack of overview of research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how specific actors, in particular shippers, can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> {{the purpose of this paper}} is to structure how academic literature has described how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> can be influenced, with a specific focus on the role of shippers. Research approach: An extensive literature search in scholarly journals was performed on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> terms using Summon search tool. A total of 473 articles were identified, where 29 articles discussed <b>factors</b> that influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> (determinants). Literature was categorized according to focus on <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> actor perspective, mode of transport covered, how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is measured and determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Findings and Originality: The literature review identifies determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> within warehousing; order and delivery; packaging and loading; transport operations; information sharing and IT; and regulations. Surprisingly few studies discuss determinants, especially from the perspective of a shipper. The literature review shows a lack of detailed descriptions of determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Also, it is difficult to gain reliable data about <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and consequently also compare results between studies. Suggested research areas include how shippers can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in their transports, detailed descriptions of how determinants influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> performance can be measured; e. g. through standardized measuring methods. This research is unique since it is the first, to our knowledge, review on determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Research impact: This literature review contributes with an overview of the dispersed research on <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> structured according to determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Areas of interest for future research are suggested. Practical impact: The overview of determinants is useful for shippers, specifically logistics managers in order to gain understanding of their role when aiming for improved <b>load</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} {{adaptive}} array beamforming {{in the presence}} of errors due to steering vector mismatch and finite sample effect. Diagonal loading (DL) is one of the widely used techniques for dealing with these errors. However, the main drawback of DL techniques is that there is not an easy and reliable manner to determine the required <b>loading</b> <b>factor.</b> Recently, serval DL approaches proposed the so-called automatic scheme on computing the required <b>loading</b> <b>factor.</b> In this paper, we propose a fully data-dependent loading to overcome the difficulties. The novelty is that the proposed method does not require any additional sophisticated scheme to choose the required loading. The <b>loading</b> <b>factor</b> can be completely obtained from the received array data. Analytical formulas for evaluating the performance of the proposed method under random steering vector error are further derived. Simulation results are provided to confirm the validity of the proposed method and make comparison with the existing DL methods. 1...|$|E
40|$|Galactic {{winds are}} a key {{physical}} mechanism for understanding galaxy formation and evolution, yet empirical and theoretical constraints for the character of winds are limited and discrepant. Recent empirical models find that local star-forming galaxies have a deficit of oxygen that scales with galaxy stellar mass. The oxygen deficit provides unique empirical constraints on the magnitude of mass loss, composition of outflowing material and metal reaccretion onto galaxies. We formulate the oxygen deficit constraints so they may be easily implemented into theoretical models of galaxy evolution. We parameterize an effective metal <b>loading</b> <b>factor</b> which combines the uncertainties of metal outflows and metal reaccretion into a single function of galaxy virial velocity. We determine the effective metal <b>loading</b> <b>factor</b> by forward-fitting the oxygen deficit.
