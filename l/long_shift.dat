Clemens {{performs}} an autopsy on Newt at Ripley's request, although he is annoyed at not being told why. To gain Ripley's trust, Clemens admits that he got drunk after a <b>long</b> <b>shift</b> as a resident and accidentally killed eleven men being treated after a boiler explosion by misprescribing a painkiller. Sentenced to Fiorina 161, he served his time but remained behind with the other inmates when they refused to leave.

25|$|Game two {{was another}} 3â€“1 victory for Detroit. Pittsburgh started out the game strong, setting up {{numerous}} chances {{from behind the}} net that were stopped by Chris Osgood. The Penguins then struck first at 16:50 of the opening period. After the Red Wings' Niklas Kronwall {{was sent to the}} penalty box for cross checking, Evgeni Malkin fired from the slot, and a scramble in front of the net ensued after Osgood gave up a rebound. The puck eventually came to Malkin for a second crack, and the shot was inadvertently deflected by Brad Stuart into his own net. Detroit took over in the second period, dominating in shots and benefiting from some luck, such as when Bill Guerin's wrist shot hit the inside of the post but stayed out of the net. Jonathan Ericsson tied the game at 4:21 of the second period, moments after the Penguins were forced to ice the puck after a <b>long</b> <b>shift.</b> Pittsburgh promptly lost the ensuing faceoff in their zone, allowing Ericsson to score from the point. Then at 10:29, the Red Wings went ahead after Valtteri Filppula was able to backhand a shot from a difficult angle into the net. Filppula scored after Fleury had stopped both Tomas Holmstrom and Marian Hossa, but couldn't hold the rebounds.|$|E

She attempts to call the hospital only to find that there is no connection; as she keeps ringing, Luis rises up, now infected with the same disease and immediately goes after Ana. She flees in her car and drives away, seeing chaos all around her neighborhood, but eventually crashes and passes out.|$|E

40|$|Physicians' work {{schedules}} {{are an important}} determinant of their own wellbeing and that of their patients. This study considers whether allowing physicians control over their work hours ameliorates the effects of demanding {{work schedules}}. A questionnaire was completed by hospital physicians regarding their work hours (exposure to <b>long</b> <b>shifts,</b> short inter-shift intervals, weekend duties, night duties, unpaid overtime; and work time control), sleep (quantity and disturbance) and wellbeing (burnout, stress and fatigue). Work time control moderated the negative impact that frequent night working had upon sleep quantity and sleep disturbance. For participants who never worked <b>long</b> <b>shifts,</b> work time control was associated with fewer short sleeps, {{but this was not}} the case for those who did work <b>long</b> <b>shifts.</b> Optimizing the balance between schedule flexibility and patient needs could enhance physicians' sleep when working the night shift, thereby reducing their levels of fatigue and enhancing patient care...|$|R

They got to Penilee and were held at the starter, for a ballast was working in the section to Cardonald.

60|$|And still, {{providing}} for contingencies, I fain confront the fact, {{the need of}} powerful native philosophs and orators and bards, these States, as rallying points to come, in times of danger, and to fend off ruin and defection.

Flaunt it as we choose, athwart and over the roads of our progress loom huge uncertainty, and dreadful, threatening gloom. It is useless to deny it: Democracy grows rankly up the thickest, noxious, deadliest plants and fruits of all--brings worse and worse invaders--needs newer, larger, stronger, keener compensations and compellers.|$|E

50|$|On the 2-2-4 schedule, firefighters work two 10-hour days, two 14-hour nights, {{and then}} have four days off.

50|$|Similarly, {{most modern}} {{motorcycles}} use unsynchronized transmissions: their low gear inertias and higher strengths mean that forcing the gears to alter speed is not damaging, and the pedal operated selector on modern motorcycles, with no neutral position between gears (except, commonly, 1st and 2nd), is {{not conducive to}} having the <b>long</b> <b>shift</b> time of a synchronized gearbox. On bikes with a 1-N-2(-3-4...) transmission, it is necessary either to stop, slow down, or synchronize gear speeds by blipping the throttle when shifting from 2nd into 1st.|$|E

Around the same time, Justin Price (Granville Van Dusen) arrives, a friendly psychiatrist from the bar who claims that he followed her home because she was being followed by the drunk. Believing that he scared away the stalker, Brianne shows her gratitude by taking on volunteer work at his hotline practice, despite her busy schedule.|$|E
50|$|Usually a fly-in fly-out job {{involves}} {{working a}} <b>long</b> <b>shift</b> (e.g. 12 hours each day) {{for a number}} of continuous days with all days off spent at home rather than at the work site. As the employee's work days are almost entirely taken up by working, sleeping and eating, there is little need for any recreation facilities at the work site. However, companies are increasingly offering facilities such as pools, tennis courts and gyms as a way of attracting and retaining skilled staff. Employees like such arrangements since their families are often reluctant to relocate to small towns in remote areas where there might be limited opportunities for spouses' employment, limited educational choices for children, and poor recreational facilities.|$|E

50|$|PATCO were {{demanding}} wage increases, safer working conditions, a 32-hour week, {{and an end}} to <b>long</b> <b>shift</b> patterns. As federal employees they were, however, barred from striking. The FAA replaced the strikers with non-union workers. According to the union, 481 near misses were reported {{in the first year of}} the strike, compared to 10 reported in the 10 years before the walkout. Militants were arrested, jailed and fined. Some PATCO members with federal mortgages lost their homes. The union was fined millions of dollars, and its $3.5 million strike fund was frozen. Eventually, the government succeeded in decertifying PATCO. The president of the US union federation, the AFL-CIO, denounced Reagan's attack on PATCO. But a letter was also sent to AFL-CIO affiliates, discouraging them from taking any type of strike action in solidarity.|$|E

40|$|The term â€˜Object Shiftâ€™ {{means that}} a weak object pronoun has been raised to a {{position}} {{to the left of}} a sentence adverbial. Primarily, there are two positions to which a weak object pronoun can be raised; one of them is called <b>Long</b> Object <b>Shift.</b> In this paper, I primarily deal with finite verb frequencies in sentences with <b>Long</b> Object <b>Shift</b> in Swedish. Also, in order to further define the verbs in these sentences I discuss verb semantic and syntactic valence in relation to the shifted object. Furthermore, I discuss the search methods which have generated sentences with <b>Long</b> Object <b>Shift</b> in written sources in Swedish; an equivalent study has never been done before. Â  The most salient results of my study indicate that: verbs with physical denotation, and specifically vÃ¤nta, mÃ¶ta and slÃ¥, frequently recur in sentences with <b>Long</b> Object <b>Shift</b> in written sources in Swedish; monotransitive verbs appear more often than ditransitive ones; shifted objects are most often assigned the semantic role of experiencer in the studied sentences; the search methods show divergent results, which indicates the significance of sentence adverbial initiating sentences with <b>Long</b> Object <b>Shift.</b> Lastly, the results show that semantic analyses, terminology and search methods need to be extended in order to further define the finite verb in sentences with <b>Long</b> Object <b>Shift</b> in Swedish...|$|R
30|$|The {{quality of}} service may be {{influenced}} by shift length, so study volume should be carefully considered.
