5|$|The major dietary lipids {{for humans}} {{and other animals}} are animal and plant triglycerides, sterols, and {{membrane}} phospholipids.

5|$|The MAM {{may also}} {{be part of the}} {{secretory}} pathway, in addition to its role in intracellular lipid trafficking. In particular, the MAM appears to be an intermediate destination between the rough ER and the Golgi in the pathway that leads to very-low-density lipoprotein, or VLDL, assembly and secretion. The MAM thus serves as a critical metabolic and trafficking hub in <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolism.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{proposed}} to elucidate the effect of Commiphora mukul gum resin elthanolic extract treatment on alterations in carbohydrate and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolisms</b> in rats fed with high-fructose diet. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: two of these groups (group C and C+CM) were fed with standard pellet diet {{and the other two}} groups (group F and F+CM) were fed with high fructose (66 %) diet. C.  mukul suspension in 5 % Tween- 80 in distilled water (200  mg/kg body weight/day) was administered orally to group C+CM and group F+CM. At the end of 60 -day experimental period, biochemical parameters related to carbohydrate and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolisms</b> were assayed. C.  mukul treatment completely prevented the fructose-induced increased body weight, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance observed in group F decreased significantly with C.  mukul treatment in group F+CM. The alterations observed in the activities of enzymes of carbohydrate and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolisms</b> and contents of hepatic tissue lipids in group F rats were significantly restored to near normal values by C.  mukul treatment in group F+CM. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that C.  mukul treatment is effective in preventing fructose-induced insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia while attenuating the fructose induced alterations in carbohydrate and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolisms</b> by the extract which was further supported by histopathological results from liver samples which showed regeneration of the hepatocytes. This study suggests that the plant can be used as an adjuvant for the prevention and/or management of insulin resistance and disorders related to it...|$|R

The antidiabetic and hypolipidemic activities of C. latifolia fruit:root aqueous extract in high fat diet (HFD) and 40 [*]mg streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats through expression of genes involved in glucose and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolisms</b> were investigated. Diabetic rats were treated with C. latifolia fruit:root extract for 4 weeks. Plasma glucose, insulin, adiponectin, lipid profiles, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), urea, and creatinine levels were measured before and after treatments. Regulations of selected genes involved in glucose and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolisms</b> were determined. Results showed the significant (P< 0. 05) increase in body weight, high density lipoprotein (HDL), insulin, and adiponectin levels and decreased glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), urea, creatinine, ALT, and GGT levels in diabetic rats after 4 weeks treatment. Furthermore, C. latifolia fruit:root extract significantly increased the expression of IRS- 1, IGF- 1, GLUT 4, PPARα, PPARγ, AdipoR 1, AdipoR 2, leptin, LPL, and lipase genes in adipose and muscle tissues in diabetic rats. These results suggest that C. latifolia fruit:root extract exerts antidiabetic and hypolipidemic effects through altering regulation genes in glucose and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolisms</b> in diabetic rats...|$|R

5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolism</b> defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|The central {{pathways}} of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the {{citric acid}} cycle, {{are present in}} all three domains of living things and {{were present in the}} last universal common ancestor. This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a methanogen that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolism.</b> The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution {{may be the result of}} these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the acute and sub acute {{toxicity}} of ciprofloxacin on <b>lipids</b> <b>metabolism</b> ofchicks which included determination of cholesterol, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and albuminlevels in serum of chicks. The biochemical changes induced by giving ciprofloxacin as a single dose (200 and 400 mg/kg. body weight intraperitoneally) included significant increases of cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein levels inserum, whereas albumin level significantly decreased, and there was no significant changes in high density lipoprotein levelsas compared with control group. Repeated treatment with ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg. body weight intra peritoneal) for 14 dayscaused significant increase in cholesterol level, albumin level significantly decreased as compared with control group, whereasit did not change significantly high density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels, repeated treatment of ciprofloxacin also showedsignificant decrease of the body weights of the chicks as compared with control group.

Primary metabolites are directly involved in more [...] "natural" [...] processes, such as reproduction and development, so abnormal differences could result in differences of mental development. Results identified changes in thirteen metabolites between dogs who had separation anxiety and those who did not; these changes included differences in hypoxanthine, indoxysulfate and phospholipids, all which control oxidative stress, tryptophan levels, and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolisms.</b> Researchers were able to {{come to the conclusion that}} biomarkers such as primary metabolites play a prominent role in canine anxiety.|$|R
25|$|AMPK {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolism</b> in the liver. It has long been known that hepatic ACC has been regulated in the liver by phosphorylation. AMPK also phosphorylates and inactivates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. HMGR converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, which is made from acetyl-CoA, into mevalonic acid, which then travels down several more metabolic steps to become cholesterol. AMPK, therefore, helps regulate fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol synthesis.|$|E

40|$|Changes in plasma {{concentration}} of small organic metabolites {{could be due}} to their altered production or urinary excretion and changes in their urine concentration {{may be due to the}} changes in their filtered load, tubular reabsorption, and/or altered urine volume. Therefore, these factors should be considered in interpretation of the changes observed in plasma or urine of the target metabolite(s). Fasting plasma and urine samples from 180 CKD patients and 120 age-matched healthy controls were determined by UPLC-HDMS-metabolomics and quantitative real-time RT-PCR techniques. Compared with healthy controls, patients with CKD showed activation of NF-κB and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant mRNA and protein expression as well as down-regulation of Nrf 2 -associated anti-oxidant gene mRNA and protein expression, accompanied by activated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. 124 plasma and 128 urine metabolites were identified and 40 metabolites were significantly altered in both plasma and urine. Plasma concentration and urine excretion of 25 metabolites were distinctly different between CKD and controls. They were related to amino acid, methylamine, purine and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolisms.</b> Logistic regression identified four plasma and five urine metabolites. Parts of them were good correlated with eGFR or serum creatinine. 5 -Methoxytryptophan and homocystine and citrulline were good correlated with both eGFR and creatinine. Clinical factors were incorporated to establish predictive models. The enhanced metabolite model showed 5 -methoxytryptophan, homocystine and citrulline have satisfactory accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for predictive CKD. The dysregulation of CKD was related to amino acid, methylamine, purine and <b>lipid</b> <b>metabolisms.</b> 5 -methoxytryptophan, homocystine and citrulline could be considered as additional GFR-associated biomarker candidates and for indicating advanced renal injury. CKD caused dysregulation of the plasma and urine metabolome, activation of inflammatory/oxidative pathway and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and suppression of antioxidant pathway...|$|R
