For instance, the pulse could be <b>linearly</b> <b>chirped</b> or present higher order group delay dispersion (GDD) so that its duration is longer than a bandwidth-limited pulse having the same intensity spectrum. It is therefore highly desirable to have a method which can not only characterize the pulse, but also correct the pulse to specific shapes for various applications in which repeatable pulse characteristics are requested. MIIPS can not only measure the pulse but also correct the high-order dispersion, thus is highly preferable for applications where repeatable electromagnetic field is important, such as to generate ultrashort pulses which are transform limited or possess specific phase characteristics.|$|E

The desired mathematical operation is performed as signal propagates through a fully reconfigurable on-chip photonic signal processor. Although a few number of photonic temporal signal processors have been introduced recently, they are usually bulky or they suffer from limited reconfigurability which is of great importance to implement large-scale general-purpose photonic signal processors. To address these limitations, this paper demonstrates a fully reconfigurable photonic integrated signal processing system. As the key point, the reconfigurability is achieved by taking advantages of dispersive Fourier transformation, <b>linearly</b> <b>chirp</b> modulation using four wave mixing, and applying the desired arbitrary transfer function through a cascaded Mach-Zehnder modulator and phase modulator.

40|$|In {{the scope}} of this thesis, a {{systematic}} study about coherent control with shaped femtosecond pulses in the one-photon regime was performed. This regime is especially important in nature as photochemical and -physical reactions are driven by sun light, i. e. at very low intensities. Apart from the relevance of these conditions in nature, coherent control experiments at low intensity are well suited to gain understanding of the underlying processes as well as to control them by using shaped laser light ﬁelds. For the experimental shaping in the visible spectral range, a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (LCM) was utilized. Here, it was shown for the ﬁrst time that such an LCM introduces noise on the tailored spectral phase. The detailed characterization of the noise implied that molecular properties like the mobility of the liquid crystals cause the noise. Reliable pulse shapes on a pulse-to-pulse basis were achieved by externally cooling the LCM. Due to appropriate data averaging, coherent control experiments were successfully performed, where even small differences in the shaped pulses are important. These control experiments aimed at the enhancement of electronic population and vibrational coherence in the ground and excited state in dependence on the temporal shape of the excitation pulses for various excitation spectra. The temporal shape of the excitation pulse was tailored to <b>linearly</b> <b>chirp</b> pulses, multipulses, whose interpulse distance matches the period of the dominant molecular mode, and the sum of both as chirped multipulses. While the ideal choice to enhance the population and the vibrational coherence in the ground state is a resonant negatively chirped multipulse, the excited state is enhanced best with a blue-detuned positively chirped multipulse. These transient absorption experiments were performed on a prototype chromophore. However, the results should be applicable to other systems. These kinds of control experiments should be transferred to DNA bases and prototype molecules, which can be easily addressed theoretically. As many organic molecules absorb light in the ultraviolet wavelength regime, an experimental set-up for the shaping of femtosecond pulses in the spectral range between 250 nm and 350 nm was developed and characterized in detail. This setup provides the basis for future experiments with organic samples...|$|R

For atomic H, the population transfer from n) 35 to 30 with nearly 100 % efficiency is achieved by means of the sequential two-photon ¢n) - 1 transitions. The calculation fully utilizes all of the available orbital angular momentum l states for a given n, and the interference pattern and population evolution dynamics of individual l states are analyzed in detail.

Similar analysis is performed for the Na atom, where the alkali atomic structure is described by an accurate model potential. We found that while the global population transfer pattern is qualitatively similar, there are significant differences in the dynamical response of atomic H and Na to the chirped microwave fields. Due to the degeneracy of the l states (for a given n) in unperturbed atomic H, the population transfer involves significant coupling and interference among a number of low-lying l states.
