25|$|C. rufifacies {{is one of}} {{the most}} forensically {{important}} flies because of its extremely predictable developmental time, minimal larval length difference, and low regional variation. It has a pupal developmental time ranging from 134 hours to 162 hours. The adult begins to form during the 237th to the 289th hour. This is useful for the forensic entomologist in determining the time of death <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>corpse.</b> C. rufifacies could have an impact in distorting post mortem intervals by eliminating primary maggots on <b>a</b> <b>corpse,</b> due to its facultatively predatory nature during the second- and third-instar larval stages. The facultatively predatory instars feed on other dipteran larvae as alternative food sources, especially in conditions where limited food supplies exist. Even undernourished larvae can successfully pupate and become healthy adults. Further altering of the post mortem interval can occur due to cannibalism, which occurs when the second-instar larvae consume the first-instar larvae.|$|R

50|$|Lychpit is now {{the name}} of a modern housing {{development}} adjacent to Old Basing near Basingstoke, Hampshire. The modern development started in the early 1980s but the area has an ancient past associated with that of Old Basing. The name derives from a wooded dell that still exists at the western end of Little Basing. Lych or Lich being the Old English name <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>corpse,</b> it is assumed that the pit was therefore some kind of mass burial ground, local tradition associating it with the Danish victory over Alfred's Saxons at the Battle of Basing in 871. Another possibility is that it was used to bury casualties of the Battle of Basing House, where Oliver Cromwell's troops laid siege to and eventually sacked this large private house. Several of the local roads bear the names of Cromwell's officers e.g. Norton Ride and Gage Close.|$|R
