5|$|Dietary {{regimes of}} lemurs include folivory, frugivory, and omnivory, with some being highly {{adaptable}} while others specialize on {{foods such as}} plant exudates (tree gum) and bamboo. In some cases, lemur feeding patterns directly benefit the native plant life. When lemurs exploit nectar, they may act as pollinators {{as long as the}} functional parts of the flower are not damaged. In fact, several unrelated Malagasy flowering plants demonstrate lemur-specific pollination traits, and studies indicate that some diurnal species, such as the red-bellied lemur and the ruffed lemurs, act as major pollinators. Two examples of plant species that rely on lemurs for pollination include traveller's palm (Ravenala madagascariensis) and a species of legume-like <b>liana,</b> Strongylodon cravieniae. Seed dispersal is another service lemurs provide. After passing through the lemur gut, tree and vine seeds exhibit lower mortality and germinate faster. Latrine behavior exhibited by some lemurs may help improve soil quality and facilitate seed dispersal. Because of their importance in maintaining a healthy forest, frugivorous lemurs may qualify as keystone mutualists.|$|E

50|$|As {{noted by}} Charles Darwin, because <b>lianas</b> are {{supported}} by other plants, they may conserve resources that other plants must allocate {{to the development of}} structure and use them instead for growth and reproduction. In general, <b>lianas</b> are detrimental to the trees that support them: growth rates are lower for trees with <b>lianas,</b> they directly damage hosts by mechanical abrasion and strangulation, render hosts more susceptible to ice and wind damage, and increase the probability that the host tree falls. <b>Lianas</b> also make the canopy of trees more accessible to animals which eat leaves. Because of these negative effects, trees which remain free of <b>lianas</b> are at an advantage; some species have evolved characteristics which help them avoid or shed <b>lianas.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Lianas</b> compete {{intensely}} with trees, greatly reducing {{tree growth}} and tree reproduction, greatly increasing tree mortality, preventing tree seedlings from establishing, and altering {{the course of}} regeneration in forests. <b>Lianas</b> also provide access routes in the forest canopy for many arboreal animals, including ants and many other invertebrates, lizards, rodents, sloths, monkeys, and lemurs. For example, in the Eastern tropical forests of Madagascar, many lemurs achieve higher mobility from the web of <b>lianas</b> draped amongst the vertical tree species. Many lemurs prefer trees with <b>lianas</b> for their roost sites. <b>Lianas</b> also provide support for trees when strong winds blow. However, they may be destructive in that when one tree falls, the connections made by the <b>lianas</b> may cause many other trees to fall.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lianas</b> are {{relatively}} rare on mature (>20 cm dbh) individuals of S. amara, {{compared to other}} trees on BCI, with only around 25% having <b>lianas</b> growing on them.

Smaller individuals also have fewer <b>lianas</b> and woody hemi-epiphytes than other species of tree in the same forests.|$|R

40|$|<b>Lianas</b> are {{structural}} parasites that depress growth, {{fertility and}} survival rates of their hosts, but the magnitude {{to which they}} alter these rates differs among host species. We tested the hypothesis that sycamore would have fewer creeping <b>lianas</b> because it possesses exfoliating bark and is therefore able to shed <b>lianas</b> from the trunk. We investigated the distribution of <b>lianas</b> on the trunks of trees 3 ̆e 6 cm DBH in floodplains throughout the Miami River Valley (southwestern Ohio). We recorded the identity and DBH of each tree species and counted the number of creeping <b>lianas</b> present on the trunk at 1. 6 m in height in 10 x 300 m belt transects conducted along 3 river stretches. We generated expected frequencies <b>lianas</b> per tree based on the relative surface area available per tree species, and analyzed data using replicated goodness of fit tests. Our analysis includes 875 <b>lianas</b> (mostly Toxicodendron radicans) and 730 trees...|$|R
40|$|Can the {{strategic}} incorporation of <b>lianas</b> (woody vines) into rainforest restoration plantings enhance biodiversity-conservation outcomes? <b>Lianas</b> {{are an integral}} component of primary tropical rainforests yet are often omitted from rainforest restoration plantings as they may damage trees and compete with them for resources.

40|$|Question: In {{fragmented}} forests, {{edge effects}} lead {{to changes in}} the distribution of plant species. In particular, tropical forest edges are increasingly dominated by <b>lianas.</b> Will this increase in <b>lianas</b> lead {{to changes in the}}ir interactions with other plantmorphological groups? If so, will this alter the local distributions and abundance of other species? Location: Plots located at increasing distances from the nearest forest edge and in remnant fragments of rain forest in the Atherton Tablelands, far northeast Queensland, Australia. Methods: We mapped the distribution of trees, <b>lianas</b> and epiphytic ferns to better understand the role of forest disturbance in shaping their competitive and facilitative interactions. We then used specific spatial point-process analyses {{to examine the effects of}} the spatial distribution of trees on the presence and abundance of <b>lianas</b> and epiphytic ferns. Results: Tree aggregation near forest edges was lower than that in the interior. The higher abundance of <b>lianas</b> near edges was associated with increased spatial segregation between <b>lianas</b> and epiphytic ferns. This segregation suggests there is competition between these two functional groups, and that <b>lianas,</b> being muchmore abundant, probably outcompete epiphytic ferns. Conclusions: The ability of <b>lianas</b> to thrive in disturbed tropical rain forests appears to reduce the abundance of epiphytic ferns, probably via direct competition for space. Epiphytic ferns provide unique microclimates and harbour much biodiversity, and their decline could negatively affect many animals and plants that rely upon them...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lianas</b> are an {{important}} component of the structure and diversity of tropical forests and the Amazon biome is one of few natural protected areas that still support the highest level of biodiversity in the world. Generally in disturbed forests high densities of <b>lianas</b> are found than mature forests. The aim of this study is to investigate the richness among families and <b>lianas</b> abundance with different diameter classes in permanent plots in the Amazon of Mato Grosso. To the survey were placed 8 plots of 40 x 250 in a forest fragment that has been management for 30 years, where we sampled <b>lianas</b> species with diameter breast height (DBH) ≥ 1 cm. There were sampled 3970 stems in the permanent plots, and the two most abundant were 2 and 6 with 594 and 573 individuals respectively. The richest families were Sapindaceae, Dilleniaceae, Menispermaceae and Fabaceae. These results confirm the hypothesis that disturbed areas have more density of <b>lianas</b> with small DBH. </p...|$|R
5000|$|In {{tropical}} forests, infestation of tree canopies by woody climbers or <b>lianas</b> can be {{a serious}} problem. Cladoptosis - by giving a clean bole with no support for climbing plants - may be an adaptation against <b>lianas,</b> {{as in the case}} of Castilla.|$|R
40|$|In {{tropical}} forest, landscape {{fragmentation and}} the consequent degradation of disturbed forests increase the incidence of light and dry hot winds, causing a disturbance on natural regeneration. Under these conditions, <b>lianas</b> (woody vines) development is stimulated instead of other species, which are more suited to mature forest and under less influence of the edge effect. For this, <b>lianas</b> colonization is an important variable for assessing the disturbance level of a forest. In this context, it becomes {{important to understand the}} nature of the competitive relationships between hyper-abundant <b>lianas</b> and ring growth of the host trees. Here, we selected trees with occupation or absence of <b>lianas</b> from two tropical species – Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis (Caribbean pine) and Tectona grandis (teak) – localized in a semideciduous forest fragment in southeastern Brazil, aiming to compare growth, climatic response, anatomy (vessels and intra-annual density fluctuations), wood density and carbon, by tree-ring analysis. The results showed that the <b>lianas</b> caused a change in tree-ring anatomy of host trees in last 10 years, mainly. We observed that trees occupied by <b>lianas</b> had a decrease the radial growth and carbon in the two species, an increase of the vessels size in teak and a decrease of the IADF frequency in Caribbean pine. In teak, the climate-tree relationship indicated that trees with <b>lianas</b> had lower response to rainfall and higher response to temperature in the summer (rainy and hottest period); in Caribbean pine, we observed that trees with <b>lianas</b> had a 2 -month delay in the radial growth response to rainfall in the dry season. In the teak group, we observed that host trees had higher wood density values than liana-free tree in the outer rings, and the opposite was showed for pine. These findings show that tree-ring growth of host trees are a strong bioindicator of forest disturbance caused by aggressive colonization of <b>lianas.</b> We believe that these methods are applicable to future studies relating to the effects of habitat fragmentation and forest degradation on biodiversity and ecosystem services, particularly in the context of global climate change.
