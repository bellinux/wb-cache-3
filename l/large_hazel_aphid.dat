60|$|The child, a {{handsome}} little fellow of some sixteen months, toddled across to his mother, waving {{his hands as}} he went, and laughing, while his <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes glowed with pleasure. His mother caught him, pushed the silken brown hair back from his forehead, and laid his cheek against hers.|$|R
6000|$|Dates {{are seldom}} {{affixed to the}} compositions, and it is {{impossible}} to say whether any are autobiographical. But, taken as a whole, they reveal a clever, romantic, impulsive, imaginative woman, whose pet names describe at once the charm of her character and the fascination of her small, slight figure, [...] "golden hair, <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes," [...] and low musical voice.|$|R
5000|$|Two large fires, one in 1884 {{and one in}} 1891, {{destroyed}} much of {{the original}} business district. The district rallied and rebuilt around 1900. Much of the historic downtown district remains. [...] "Silk Stocking Row" [...] the many well-preserved turn-of-the-century homes on Hazel Street, was so named because during the Depression the only women who could afford silk stockings lived in these <b>large</b> <b>Hazel</b> Street homes.|$|R

60|$|As soon as I clapped {{my eye on}} the captain, I thought myself he {{was just}} the captain to suit me. He was a fine looking man, about forty, splendidly dressed, with very black whiskers, and very white teeth, and what I took to be a free, frank look out of a <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eye. I liked him amazingly. He was promenading {{up and down the}} cabin, humming some brisk air to himself when we entered.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Wild was {{considered}} [...] "one of the world's teen heartthrobs," [...] alongside David Cassidy and Barry Williams. With <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes, a somewhat pug nose and freckles, Jack was loved and adored by many girls across the globe. [...] "I received roughly 2,000 fan letters a week," [...] he stated in 1989. [...] "I never left {{any one of}} them blank. I always answered, even if I was exhausted. I really thought {{it was one of the}} most important things." ...|$|R
60|$|In one corner, upon a large native couch, {{elevated}} upon posts, reclined a nymph; who, half-veiled {{in her own}} long hair, had yet to {{make her}} toilet for the day. She {{was the daughter of}} Po-Po; and a very beautiful little daughter she was; not more than fourteen; with the most delightful shape--like a bud just blown; and <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes. They called her Loo; a name rather pretty and genteel, and therefore quite appropriate; for a more genteel and lady-like little damsel there was not in all Imeeo.|$|R
60|$|The baby turned {{with sudden}} coy shyness, and {{clung to her}} mother's neck. Meg kissed her fondly, then the child laid her cheek against her mother's. The mother's dark eyes, and the baby's <b>large,</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes looked at me serenely. The two were very calm, very {{complete}} and triumphant together. In their completeness was a security which made me feel alone and ineffectual. A woman who has her child in her arms is a tower of strength, a beautiful, unassailable tower of strength that may in its turn stand quietly dealing death.|$|R

She is described as tall, slender, and pretty, with shoulder-length golden-brown hair and <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes. Until moving to Sleepyside, she spent her life in boarding schools and summer camps, barely knowing her own parents. Her friendship with Trixie and the Bob-Whites has given her more confidence and helped her to forge a relationship {{with her parents and}} adopted brother. Generally regarded as the sweetest and most tactful of the Bob-Whites, she is also their star swimmer.

60|$|Fortunately I {{had had the}} {{advantage}} of being taught French by a French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.|$|R
60|$|Averil Ward was {{naturally}} a plump, well-looking girl of eighteen, with clearly-cut features, healthy highly-coloured complexion, and <b>large</b> bright <b>hazel</b> eyes, much {{darker than}} her profuse and glossy hair, which was always {{dressed in the}} newest and most stylish fashion, which, {{as well as the}} whole air of her dress and person, was, though perfectly lady like, always regarded by the Stoneborough world as something on the borders of presumption {{on the part of the}} entire Ward family.|$|R
60|$|Over {{the green}} squares {{of the fields}} and the low curve of a wood there rose in the {{distance}} a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American accent, {{in the corner of}} a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes. If on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it.|$|R
60|$|The sleeper stirred {{and opened}} two <b>large,</b> {{exceedingly}} brilliant <b>hazel</b> eyes. For {{a moment he}} gazed rather blankly at the brown-curled young lady who was embracing him. Then a most delightful smile broke over his face; he sprang up and caught her to his heart.|$|R

6000|$|... “The pretty word graziosa, {{by which}} Napoleon loved to {{describe}} [...] Josephine, seemed made for her. She {{was full of}} a delicate grace of [...] mind and person. Her little elegant figure and her fair mild face, [...] lighted up so brilliantly by her <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes, corresponded [...] exactly with the soft, gentle manners which were so often awakened [...] into a delightful playfulness, or an enthusiasm more charming still, [...] by the impulse of her quick and ardent spirit. To be sure she had a [...] slight touch of distraction about her (distraction French, not [...] distraction English), an interesting absence of mind. She united in [...] her own person all the sins of forgetfulness of all the young ladies; [...] mislaid her handkerchief, her shawl, her gloves, her work, her music, [...] her drawing, her scissors, her keys; would ask for a book when she [...] held it in her hand, and set a whole class hunting for her thimble, [...] whilst the said thimble was quietly perched upon her finger. Oh! [...] with what a pitying scorn our exact and recollective Frenchwoman used [...] to look down on such an incorrigible scatterbrain! But she was a [...] poetess, as Madame said, and what could you expect better!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very proper of Joe. He can't be too particular,—-but such a child!" [...] thought Mrs. Brownlow as the mufflings {{disclosed}} a tiny creature, angular in girlish sort, {{with an odd}} little narrow {{wedge of}} a face, sallow and wan, rather too much of teeth and mouth, <b>large</b> greenish- <b>hazel</b> eyes, and a forehead {{with a look of}} expansion, partly due to the crisp waves of dark hair being as short as a boy's. The nose was well cut, and each delicate nostril was quivering involuntarily with emotion—-or fright, or both.|$|R
500|$|They have a smooth, {{somewhat}} domed skull with a medium-length, square-cut muzzle {{and a black}} (or occasionally liver) gumdrop nose. The jaw {{is strong}} and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw. The eyes are <b>large,</b> <b>hazel</b> or brown, with a mild hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long {{enough for them to}} easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a dewlap; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered abdomen and waist and a long, slightly curved tail (known as the [...] "stern") tipped with white. The white tip, known as the flag has been selectively bred for, as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent. The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the stifles.|$|R
60|$|Beside his couch stood Thomas de Vaux, in face, attitude, {{and manner}} the strongest {{possible}} {{contrast to the}} suffering monarch. His stature approached the gigantic, and his hair in thickness might have resembled that of Samson, though only after the Israelitish champion's locks had passed under the shears of the Philistines, for those of De Vaux were cut short, {{that they might be}} enclosed under his helmet. The light of his broad, <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eye resembled that of the autumn morn; and it was only perturbed for a moment, when from time to time it was attracted by Richard's vehement marks of agitation and restlessness. His features, though massive like his person, might have been handsome before they were defaced with scars; his upper lip, after the fashion of the Normans, was covered with thick moustaches, which grew so long and luxuriantly as to mingle with his hair, and, like his hair, were dark brown, slightly brindled with grey. His frame seemed of that kind which most readily defies both toil and climate, for he was thin-flanked, broad-chested, long-armed, deep-breathed, and strong-limbed. He had not laid aside his buff-coat, which displayed the cross cut on the shoulder, for more than three nights, enjoying but such momentary repose as the warder of a sick monarch's couch might by snatches indulge. This Baron rarely changed his posture, except to administer to Richard the medicine or refreshments which none of his less favoured attendants could persuade the impatient monarch to take; and there was something affecting in the kindly yet awkward manner in which he discharged offices so strangely contrasted with his blunt and soldierly habits and manners.|$|R
50|$|Historically {{a part of}} Cheshire, until 1836 {{the area}} was known as Bullock Smithy; however, this name was unpopular with its {{residents}} and so the settlement was renamed Hazel Grove, possibly due to the <b>large</b> number of <b>hazel</b> trees found in the locale, though more probably from a small hamlet towards High Lane called Hessel Grave. The SK7 postcode, which also includes Bramhall and Woodford, {{is one of the}} most sought after residential postcodes in Greater Manchester.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower and}} middle {{slopes of the}} {{mountain}} are characterised by very tall forests of mountain ash with a cool temperate rainforest mid story on the southern slopes and sheltered areas elsewhere on the mountain. Trees such as myrtle beech, sassafras and soft tree fern as well as <b>large</b> shrubs like <b>hazel</b> pomaderris are fairly common in this zone. On the higher slopes sub-alpine species such as woollybutt and snowgum predominate, although myrtle beech is also common almost to the summit.|$|R
50|$|The Hazel River is a 47.8 mi {{tributary}} of the Rappahannock River in northern Virginia in the United States. Via the Rappahannock, {{it is part of}} the Chesapeake Bay watershed. It rises in Shenandoah National Park and flows generally eastwardly through Rappahannock and Culpeper counties. It joins the Rappahannock River from the west about 3 mi northwest of Remington. The <b>Hazel's</b> <b>largest</b> tributaries are the Hughes River, which joins it at the border of Rappahannock and Culpeper counties, and the Thornton River, which joins it in Culpeper County.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia's {{brown hair}} was smooth as satin; Kate's net {{did not succeed in}} {{confining}} the loose rough waves of dark chestnut, on the road to blackness. Sylvia was the shorter, firmer, and stronger, with round white well-cushioned limbs; Kate was tall, skinny, and brown, though perfectly healthful. The face of the one was round and rosy, of the other thin and dark; and one pair of eyes were of honest grey, while the others were <b>large</b> and <b>hazel,</b> with blue whites. Kate's little hand was so slight, that Sylvia's strong fingers could almost crush it together, but it was far less effective in any sort of handiwork; and her slim neatly-made foot always was a reproach to her for making such boisterous steps, and wearing out her shoes so much faster than the quieter movements of her companion did--her sister, as the children would have said, for nothing but the difference of surname reminded Katharine Umfraville that she was not the sister of Sylvia Wardour.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the rise}} of the curtain Stephen Murray is {{discovered}} sitting [...] in a chair in front of the fireplace, left. Murray is thirty [...] years old--a tall, slender, rather unusual-looking fellow with a [...] pale face, sunken under high cheek bones, lined about the eyes and [...] mouth, jaded and worn for one still so young. His intelligent, [...] <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes have a tired, dispirited expression in repose, but [...] can quicken instantly with a concealed mechanism of mocking, [...] careless humour whenever his inner privacy is threatened. His large [...] mouth aids this process of protection by a quick change from its [...] set apathy to a cheerful grin of cynical good nature. He gives off [...] the impression of being somehow dissatisfied with himself, but not [...] yet embittered enough by it to take it out on others. His manner, [...] as revealed by his speech--nervous, inquisitive, alert--seems more [...] an acquired quality than any part of his real nature. He stoops a [...] trifle, giving him a slightly round-shouldered appearance. He is [...] dressed in a shabby dark suit, baggy at the knees. He is staring [...] into the fire, dreaming, an open book lying unheeded on the arm of [...] his chair. The gramophone is whining out the last strains of [...] Dvorak's Humoresque. In the doorway to the office, Miss Gilpin [...] stands talking to Miss Howard. The former is a slight, [...] middle-aged woman with black hair, and a strong, intelligent face, [...] its expression of resolute efficiency softened and made kindly by [...] her warm, sympathetic grey eyes. Miss Howard is tall, slender and [...] blonde--decidedly pretty and provokingly conscious of it, yet with [...] a certain air of seriousness underlying her apparent frivolity. She [...] is twenty years old. The elder woman is dressed in the all-white of [...] a full-fledged nurse. Miss Howard wears the grey-blue uniform of [...] one still in training. The record finishes. Murray sighs with [...] relief, but makes no move to get up and stop the grinding needle. [...] Miss Howard hurries across to the machine. Miss Gilpin goes back [...] into the office.|$|R
5000|$|Memoirist Izrael Deutsh (Harry Dunai), who was {{admitted}} to the school in 1939 at the age of five, described Kaniszai of that period: [...] "A tall man with a hefty, well-developed body and a few red streaks running through his pure white hair. He lived at school along with the children. He was Jewish as were most counselors and teachers." [...] "He was easy to spot with his tall <b>large</b> frame, <b>hazel</b> eyes, red-streaked white hair and very fair skin. He always wore the same three-piece suit with a white striped shirt and a necktie... he could speak, read and write English and German and held a doctorate degree." [...] According to Deutsh, Kaniszai was a strict, and at times a ruthless disciplinarian who [...] "regularly publicly spanked children when they defied him". Other teachers followed suit, beating and humiliating the children. Eventually, {{at the end of the}} war, Deutsch was so fed up with [...] "Dr. Kanizsai treating me like his slave" [...] and [...] "using me as his workhorse" [...] that he fled from the school. According to Deutsch, [...] "he Kanizsai was a selfish man, always fulfilling his own needs whenever he could." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of aphid feeding on chlorophyll a fluorescence {{in the leaves}} of four cultivated hazel cultivars, with different levels of resistance to filbert aphid (Myzocallis coryli Goetze), was studied. The maximum effect of photosystem reaction measured on dark-adapted hazel leaves (Fv/Fm parameter) and maximum efficiency of photon energy PAR conversion to chemical energy in light conditions (Y parameter) were estimated twice, in the leaves of four hazel cultivars with different levels of resistance to filbert aphid, using a fluorometer PAM- 2000 by Walz GmbH - Germany. The analysis of changes of these parameters showed that aphid feeding caused a reaction in all tested cultivars. The most visible reduction of the Fv/Fm and Y values {{as a result of}} aphid feeding was observed in the cultivars 'Cud z Bollwiller' and 'Olbrzymi z Halle', numerously colonized by aphids. A smaller number of aphids found on the leaves of more resistant cultivars - 'Kataloński' and 'Lamberta Biały', caused a weaker response of plants and a smaller decline in the value of this parameter. 'Cud z Bollwiller' cultivar showed higher tolerance than other tested cultivars to stress caused by the feeding of sucking insects. The Fv/Fm and Y parameters can be regarded as reliable indexes useful in diagnosing susceptibility of <b>hazel</b> cultivars to <b>aphids,</b> helpful in determining, for example, harmfulness thresholds...|$|R
40|$|The Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia) has {{suffered}} from habitat loss due to changes in forestry practices in many regions of Europe. The widespread conversion of structurally heterogeneous to uniform, single-layered stands has caused many of its populations to decline. The trend in multi-functional forestry towards more dynamic processes and natural rejuvenation offers {{a unique opportunity to}} restore many habitats of Hazel Grouse in core areas of its actual distribution. As the Alps represent a stronghold of Hazel Grouse distribution in Central Europe, we aimed to determine the species–habitat relationship in mountain forests. We assessed the distribution and characteristics of Hazel Grouse habitat in a forest reserve of the Swiss Alps. Abiotic, structural and vegetation characteristics were investigated at the small scale, and abiotic and forest inventory data at the large scale. We compared the habitat characteristics of used and unused forest stands with a raster system consisting of bird presence and absence cells by applying a logistic regression. Hazel Grouse preferred stands with high proportions of tall rowans, forest edges, and a dense shrub layer at the small scale. Rowans had the strongest influence on Hazel Grouse occurrence. At the <b>large</b> scale, <b>Hazel</b> Grouse preferred forests with large proportions of alder and a diverse mosaic of canopy closure and stand structure. For 44...|$|R
6000|$|When she {{got home}} {{she looked at her}} face in the glass more {{critically}} than she had done for years. Anne Stockard at her best had never been pretty. When young she had been called [...] "gawky." [...] She was very tall and her figure was lank and angular. She had a long, pale face and dusky hair. Her eyes had been good--a glimmering <b>hazel,</b> <b>large</b> and long-lashed. They were pretty yet, but the crow's feet about them were plainly visible. There were brackets around her mouth too, and her cheeks were hollow. Anne suddenly realized, as she had never realized before, that she had grown old--that her youth was left far behind. She was an old maid, and Harriet Warren was young, and pretty. Anne's long, thin lips suddenly quivered.|$|R
6000|$|A little Englishwoman, {{married to}} a German, had dwelt with him {{eighteen}} years in humble happiness {{and the district of}} Putney, where her husband worked in the finer kinds of leather. He was a harmless, busy little man with the gift for turning his hand to anything which is bred into the peasants of the Black Forest, who on their upland farms make all the necessaries of daily life--their coarse linen from home-grown flax, their leather gear from the hides of their beasts, their clothes from the wool thereof, their furniture from the pine logs of the Forest, their bread from home-grown flour milled in simple fashion and baked in the home-made ovens, their cheese from the milk of their own goats. Why he had come to England he probably did not remember--it was so long ago; but he would still know why he had married Dora, the daughter of the Putney carpenter, she being, as it were, salt of the earth: one of those Cockney women, deeply sensitive beneath a well-nigh impermeable mask of humour and philosophy, who quite unselfconsciously are always doing things for others. In their little grey Putney house they had dwelt those eighteen years, without perhaps ever having had time to move, though they had often had the intention of doing so {{for the sake of the}} children, of whom they had three, a boy and two girls. Mrs. Gerhardt--she shall be called, for her husband had a very German name, and there is more in a name than Shakespeare dreamed of--Mrs. Gerhardt was a little woman with <b>large</b> <b>hazel</b> eyes and dark crinkled hair in which there were already a few threads of grey when the war broke out. Her boy David, the eldest, was fourteen at that date, and her girls, Minnie and Violet, were eight and five, rather pretty children, especially the little one. Gerhardt, perhaps because he was so handy, had never risen. His firm regarded him as indispensable and paid him fair wages, but he had no [...] "push," [...] having the craftsman's temperament, and employing his spare time in little neat jobs for his house and his neighbours, which brought him no return. They made their way, therefore, without that provision for the future which necessitates the employment of one's time for one's own ends. But they were happy, and had no enemies; and each year saw some mild improvements in their studiously clean house and tiny back garden. Mrs. Gerhardt, who was cook, seamstress, washerwoman, besides being wife and mother, was almost notorious in that street of semi-detached houses for being at the disposal of any one in sickness or trouble. She was not strong in body, for things had gone wrong when she bore her first, but her spirit had that peculiar power of seeing things as they were, and yet refusing to be dismayed, which so embarrasses Fate. She saw her husband's defects clearly, and his good qualities no less distinctly--they never quarrelled. She gauged her children's characters too, with an admirable precision, which left, however, loopholes of wonder as to what they would become.|$|R
