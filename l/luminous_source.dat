[504] [...] "At all events," [...] {{says the}} author of the Academical Questions [Sir William Drummond], [...] "I trust, {{whatever}} may be the fate of my own speculations, that philosophy will regain that estimation which it ought to possess. The free and philosophic spirit of our nation has been the theme of admiration to the world. This was the proud distinction of Englishmen, and the <b>luminous</b> <b>source</b> of all their glory. Shall we then forget the manly and dignified sentiments of our ancestors, to prate {{in the language of the}} mother or the nurse about our good old prejudices? This is not the way to defend the cause of truth. It was not thus that our fathers maintained it in the brilliant periods of our history. Prejudice may be trusted to guard the outworks for a short space of time, while reason slumbers in the citadel; but if the latter sink into a lethargy, the former will quickly erect a standard for herself. Philosophy, wisdom, and liberty support each other: he, who will not reason, is a bigot; he, who cannot, is a fool; and he, who dares not, is a slave."--Vol. i. pp. xiv., xv.|$|E

40|$|Observations of high-redshift Lya {{sources are}} a major tool for {{studying}} the high-redshift universe and {{are one of the}} most promising ways to constrain the later stages of reionization. The understanding and interpretation of the data is far from straightforward, however. We discuss the effect of the reionizing intergalactic medium (IGM) on the observability of Lya sources based on large simulations of early structure formation with radiative transfer. This takes into account self-consistently the reionization history, density, velocity and ionization structures and non-linear source clustering. We find that all fields are highly anisotropic and as a consequence there are very large variations in opacity among the different lines of sight. The velocity effects, from both infall and source peculiar velocity are most important for the <b>luminous</b> <b>sources,</b> affecting the line profile and depressing the bright end of the luminosity function. The line profiles are generally asymmetric and the line centres of the <b>luminous</b> <b>sources</b> are always absorbed due to the high density of the local IGM. For both <b>luminous</b> and average <b>sources</b> the damping wing effects are of similar magnitude and remain significant until fairly late, when the IGM is ionized between 30 and 70 per cent by mass...|$|R

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} Chandra High Resolution Camera {{observations of}} the starburst galaxy M 82, concentrating on the most luminous x-ray source. We find a position {{for the source of}} R. A. = 09 ^h 55 ^m 50 ^s. 2, decl. = + 69 ^∘ 40 46. 7 (J 2000) with a 1 σ radial error of 0. 7. The accurate x-ray position shows that the <b>luminous</b> <b>source</b> is not at the dynamical centre of M 82 nor coincident with any suggested radio AGN candidate. The source is highly variable between observations, which suggests that the source is a compact object and not a supernova or remnant. There is no significant short term variability within the observations. Dynamical friction and the off-center position place an upper bound of 10 ^ 5 - 10 ^ 6 M_ on the mass of the object, depending on its age. The x-ray luminosity suggests a compact object mass of at least 500 M_.
