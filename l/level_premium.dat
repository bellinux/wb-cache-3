40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{practical}} way for ex-post indexing of <b>level</b> <b>premiums</b> in lifelong medical insurance contracts, {{in order to}} take into account observed medical inflation. We show that ex-post indexing can be achieved by considering only premiums, without explicit reference to reserves. This appears to be relevant in practice as reserving mechanisms may not be transparent to policyholders and as some insurers do not compute contract-specific reserves, managing the whole portfolio in a collective way. The present study originates from a proposal for indexing lifelong medical insurance <b>level</b> <b>premiums</b> in Belgium. As an application, we study the impact of various indexing mechanisms on a typical medical insurance portfolio on the Belgian market. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Modified {{reserves}} {{are based on}} premiums which are not level by duration. Almost all modified {{reserves are}} intended to accumulate lower reserves in early policy years than they would under the net <b>level</b> <b>premium</b> method. This is to allow the issuer greater margins to pay for expenses which are usually very high in these years. To do this, modified reserves assume a lower premium {{in the first year}} or two than the net <b>level</b> <b>premium,</b> and later premiums are higher. The Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method, used for statutory reserves in the United States, allows for use of modified reserves.|$|E

50|$|Net <b>level</b> <b>premium</b> reserves, {{also called}} benefit reserves, only involve two cash flows {{and are used}} for some US GAAP {{reporting}} purposes. The valuation premium in an NLP reserve is a premium such {{that the value of}} the reserve at time zero is equal to zero. The net <b>level</b> <b>premium</b> reserve is found by taking the expected value of the loss random variable defined above. They can be formulated prospectively or retrospectively. The amount of prospective reserves at a point in time is derived by subtracting the actuarial present value of future valuation premiums from the actuarial present value of the future insurance benefits. Retrospective reserving subtracts accumulated value of benefits from accumulated value of valuation premiums as of a point in time. The two methods yield identical results (assuming bases are the same for both prospective and retrospective calculations).|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} {{classical}} {{analysis of the}} endowment contract on a single life to multiples lives.

In practice actuarial values of the tariff book are calculated under the simplifying assumption of independent future lifetimes. It is therefore important to measure {{the impact of this}} assumption under the observation that independence is not fulfilled in real life. In the two lives case the maximal impact can be measured using the well-known Höffding-Fréchet lower and upper bounds. The independence assumption overestimates the joint-life net single and <b>level</b> <b>premiums</b> and underestimates the last-survivor net single and <b>level</b> <b>premiums.</b> The maximal deviations are obtained by perfect positive dependence.

Using 136 take-over transactions for the period of 1990 - 1999, we found that the take-over premiums were much higher than those in developed countries. The various motives for take-overs had different impact on the <b>level</b> of <b>premiums</b> paid in different industries. The evidence also suggests that the main motive of the bidders was more towards enhancing the earnings base of the bidders rather than playing the disciplinary role for under-performed target. Family-owned firms paid a lower <b>level</b> of <b>premiums</b> compared to non-family firms unless the targets had good performance (relatively higher ROAs). This study concludes that ownership by family aligned the interests of the owners to that of the shareholders rather than resulting in the expropriation of minority shareholders...|$|R

50|$|The main {{benefit is}} that the {{enhanced}} price is paid not to a producers' co-operative, which normally comprises {{only a small percentage}} of the whole village, but to a village level co-operative that must have 90% membership. The products are bought by the village co-operatives from the local farmers at the normal market rates but are then sold onto the exporter at the enhanced WCP rates, which can produce a village <b>level</b> <b>premium</b> of up to 70% over the farm gate price. Coffee from the villages around the Lambusango and Cusuco sites run by Operation Wallacea were initially marketed under the Wicked Jungle Coffee brand. By cutting out middlemen and dealing directly with the farmer co-operatives, the prices paid for the products to the villages can be considerably higher than the Fair Trade rates but the final sale price in the western market can be comparable with Fair Trade. This scheme has great potential to substantially increase incomes in communities that are committed to protecting their adjacent forests and provides a market driven way of conserving forests.|$|E

5000|$|Although life {{insurance}} is often sold {{with a view}} toward the [...] "living benefits" [...] (accumulated cash and dividend values), this feature is a byproduct of the <b>level</b> <b>premium</b> nature of the contract.
