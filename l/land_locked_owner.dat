40|$|As {{persistent}} object store technology {{reaches a}} mature state {{with respect to}} orthogonal persistence support, the lack of efficient and flexible concurrency control that could make them an attractive alternative to database systems is cruelly felt. In the search for more flexibility, an increasing trend towards independent control over the basic transaction properties of atomicity, permanence and serializability has emerged [11, 13]. Following this approach, this paper propose a new mechanism, called locking capability graph, which allows quick prototyping of concurrency control independently of other transaction properties. This mechanism allows (1) generic conflict detection based on a no conflict with relationship between <b>lock</b> <b>owners,</b> (2) arbitrary delegation of locks, and (3), automated tracking of dependencies between <b>lock</b> <b>owners.</b> The mechanism is flexible enough to support a variety of popular transaction models' concurrency control. Our measurements using a first prototype show [...] ...|$|R
