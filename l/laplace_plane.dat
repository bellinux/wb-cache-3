5|$|The bending of the <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane</b> of the Solar System {{toward that}} of Planet Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the ascending nodes and arguments of perihelion {{of the extreme}} TNOs. The <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane</b> defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit precesses with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum of Planet Nine causes the <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane</b> to bend toward that of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit precess about the <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane,</b> they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the ecliptic pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were found to be more stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a libration of the longitudes of ascending nodes with respect to the ecliptic making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of perihelion this can also produce clustering of the arguments of perihelion.|$|E
5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and resonant dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long timescales and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia oscillate. The resonant dynamics acts on shorter timescales and provides phase protection, maintaining the stability of the objects by preventing close approaches. The inclination of Planet Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of the objects circle that of the Solar System's <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane,</b> which is bent toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered toward one side.|$|E

Transient boundary conditions of normal and shear tractions are applied to a crack embedded in the matrix of the unidirectional composite. The two boundary conditions are solved independently and the results superimposed. Mathematically, these conditions reduce the problem to a system of dual integral equations which are solved in the <b>Laplace</b> transform <b>plane</b> for the transformation of the dynamic stress intensity factor.

40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} {{model for the}} one-dimensional, impulsive displacement of a quasi-linear viscoelastic material has been developed. The quasi-linear model of Fung [1] has been used successfully {{for a wide range}} of soft biological tissues. Due to the integral definition of linear viscoelastic materials, solutions are conveniently performed in the <b>Laplace</b> transform <b>plane.</b> Complex kernels like the quasilinear model are challenging to invert back to the real plane. Here, the method of Gaver [2] and Stehfest [3] is used to numerically carry Laplace space solutions to the real plane. Parametric results for a basic impulsive disturbance problem are presented. Results indicate that stress wave propagation is weakly dependent on the fast time, slow time ratio and more strongly dependent on the logarithmic damping parameter. Limitations of the numerical inversion method in the face of discontinuities are discussed as well using asymptotic methods. As an alternative to the numerical/polynomial-based Gaver-Stehfest method, a semianalytical regularization function useful near large gradient regions method is developed. A composite method that utilizes both the fully numerical and semianalytical convolution-based method is also described. The composite model provides improved results in terms of reducing computational undershoot and overshoot (wiggles) which limit both the fully numerical and the semi{{analytical model}}s alone...|$|R

40|$|The Kalman filter is a {{mathematical}} method, whose {{purpose is to}} process noisy measurements {{in order to obtain}} an estimate of some relevant parameters of a system. It represents a valuable tool in the GNSS area, with some of its main applications related to the computation of the user PVT solution and to the integration of GNSS receivers with INS or other sensors. The Kalman filter is based on a state space representation, that describes the analyzed system as a set of differential equations that establishes the connections between the inputs, the outputs and the state variables of the analyzed system. In the continuous time domain there exists a large class of physical processes with a time evolution well described by means of stochastic differential equations. A typical problem is the need for an equivalent system in the discrete time, due to the discrete nature of the data to be processed. In the literature, it is quite common to solve this problem in the continuous time domain and to approximate the solution using a Taylor series approximation, to obtain an approximate discrete time version of the continuous time problem. By the way, other methods exist, based on the possibility to transform a continuous-time system to a discrete-time system by means of transformations from the <b>Laplace</b> complex <b>plane</b> to the z plane. These methods are widely used in the digital signal processing community, for example, to design digital filters from their analog counterparts.

50|$|The {{encounters}} between planets also perturb {{the orbits}} of the moons of the other outer planets. Saturn's moon Iapetus could have been excited to its current inclination, if the ice giant's closest approach {{was out of the}} plane of Saturn's equator. If Saturn acquired its tilt before the encounters, Iapetus's inclination could also be excited due to multiple changes of its semi-major axis, because the inclination of Saturn's <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane</b> would vary with the distance from Saturn. In simulations, Iapetus was excited to its current inclination in five of ten of the jumping-Jupiter models tested, though three left it with excessive eccentricity. The low inclination of Uranus's moon Oberon, 0.1°, was preserved in nine out of ten. The preservation of Oberon's inclination favors the 5-planet models, with only a few encounters between Uranus and an ice giant, over 4-planet models in which Uranus encounters Jupiter and Saturn. The encounters between planets may have also be responsible for the absence of regular satellites of Uranus beyond the orbit of Oberon.|$|E

40|$|We used {{recently}} produced Solar System ephemerides, which incorporate 2 {{years of}} ranging observations to the MESSENGER spacecraft, {{to extract the}} secular orbital elements for Mercury and associated uncertainties. As Mercury is in a stable 3 : 2 spin-orbit resonance, these values constitute an important reference for the planet’s measured rotational parameters, which in turn strongly bear on physical interpretation of Mercury’s interior structure. In particular, we derive a mean orbital period of (87. 96934962 ± 0. 00000037) days and (assuming a perfect resonance) a spin rate of (6. 138506839 ± 0. 000000028) °/day.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{evolution of}} the Earth-Moon system due to tidal friction is treated here. George H. Darwin used Laplace planes (also called proper planes) {{in his study of}} tidal evolution. The <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane</b> approach is adapted here to the formalisms of W. M. Kaula and P. Goldreich. Like Darwin, the approach assumes a three-body problem: Earth, Moon, and Sun, where the Moon and Sun are point-masses. The tidal potential is written in terms of the <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane</b> angles. The resulting secular equations of motion can be easily integrated numerically assuming the Moon is in a circular orbit about the Earth and the Earth is in a circular orbit about the Sun. For Earth-Moon distances greater than 10 Earth radii, the Earth's approximate tidal response can be characterized with a single parameter, which is a ratio: a Love number times the sine of a lag angle divided by another such product. For low parameter values it can be shown that Darwin's low-viscosity molten Earth, M. Ross's and G. Schubert's model of an Earth near melting, and Goldreich's equal tidal lag angles must all give similar histories. For higher parameter values, as perhaps has been the case at times with the ocean tides, the Earth's obliquity may have decreased slightly instead of increased once the Moon's orbit evolved further than 50 Earth radii from the Earth, with possible implications for climate. This is contrast to the other tidal friction models mentioned, which have the obliquity always increasing with time. As for the Moon, its orbit is presently tilted to its <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane</b> by 5. 2 deg. The equations do not allow the Moon to evolve out of its <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane</b> by tidal friction alone, so that if it was originally in its <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane,</b> the tilt arose with the addition of other mechanisms, such as resonance passages...|$|E
40|$|High-inclination circumplanetary orbits {{that are}} gravitationally perturbed {{by the central}} star can undergo Kozai {{oscillations}} [...] -large-amplitude, coupled variations in the orbital eccentricity and inclination. We first study how this effect is modified by incorporating perturbations from the planetary oblateness. Tremaine et al. (2009) found that, for planets with obliquities > 68. 875 degrees, orbits in the equilibrium local <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane</b> are unstable to eccentricity perturbations over a finite radial range, and execute large-amplitude chaotic oscillations in eccentricity and inclination. In the hope of making that treatment more easily understandable, we analyze the problem using orbital elements, confirming this threshold obliquity. Furthermore, we find that orbits inclined to the <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane</b> will be unstable over a broader radial range, and that such orbits can go unstable for obliquities less than 68. 875 degrees. Finally, we analyze the added effects of radiation pressure, which are important for dust grains and provide a natural mechanism for particle semimajor axes to sweep via Poynting-Robertson drag through any unstable range. We find that generally the effect persists; however, the unstable radial range is shifted and small retrograde particles can avoid the instability altogether. We argue that this is occurs because radiation pressure modifies the equilibrium <b>Laplace</b> <b>plane.</b> Comment: 39 pages, 9 figures. Accepted for publication in A...|$|E

A detailed study of solar power satellites’ orbit dynamics is performed, obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the effect of perturbations on orbits of large solar power satellite structures over a time frame commensurate with proposed solar power satellites’ lifetimes (30 – 40 years). Analytical equations derived by the process of averaging of the solar power satellites’ equations of motion are used to determine the long-term orbital behavior.
