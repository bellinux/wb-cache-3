Williams opposed a provision of the plan that required county officials to raise additional tax revenue in order to participate in school construction program; he said that counties which were owed large amounts in delinquent taxes would have to raise tax rates above the state minimum in order to collect the requisite funds. He offered several amendments to the plan, including the repeal of a provision to pilot a career <b>ladder</b> <b>program</b> for educators and a requirement that the state retirement system pay the full health insurance premiums of retired teachers and their spouses. All of Williams' amendments were defeated, except one to maintain the same qualifications for writing aides that were required of kindergarten aides. After the session, Williams and Representative John Harper charged that Collins delayed approval of public works grant projects in their districts in retaliation for their opposition to the reform plan; Collins denied that.|$|E

Snyder Schools of Nursing are {{approved}} by the New Jersey State Board of Nursing and are fully accredited by the National League for Nursing Accreditation Commission. Trinitas offers a generic program as well as a licensed practical nurse (LPN) to a registered nurse (RN) program. The LPN - to - RN Completion Program is designed for Licensed Practical Nurses who wish to return to school, but need to maintain their employment status. Classroom and clinical experiences are designed to meet the specific needs of the LPN. Trinitas had been using leased space in a converted warehouse in the Elizabethport section of the city of Elizabeth but after 1992 moved into a renovated utility building. There were 4000 full and part-time nursing students in Elizabeth in 1992. In one account, there were 2,000 nurses receiving further training at the Trinitas school in 2010. The Muhlenberg and Snyder program offers a day or evening track in nursing. Muhlenberg offers an Accelerated Program designed for individuals who have earned a BA or graduate degree in another discipline and wish to continue their studies in nursing. The nursing or clinical portion of the program can be completed in one year by attending from January to December as a full-time day student. Muhlenberg also offers an LPN - to - RN Career <b>Ladder</b> <b>Program.</b> After successful completion of an LPN transition course, the LPN program may be completed in two semesters.|$|E

Research and literature indicate that development of professional competence and expertise following entry into practice is related to experience as well as motivation for continued learning and participation in continued professional education. This study investigated the relationship of the level of practice of one professional group, registered nurses, to the learner's characteristic of self-directiveness for learning and participation in Houle's modes of continuing professional learning: instruction, inquiry, and performance. The level of nursing practice was measured by self-report of position in a clinical <b>ladder</b> <b>program</b> for registered staff nurses. Self-directiveness for learning was measured by the Oddi Continuing Learning Inventory (OCLI) and participation in the modes of learning was measured by four subscores on {{a modified version of the}} Bevis Job Activity Survey (JAS).

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to examine whether teachers view mentoring as an inherently contrived or collaborative enterprise. Drawing upon a micro-political framework, this study examines the relationships between contrived and collaborative collegial relationships (Hargreaves, 1991), utilizing data from a mentor teacher program in a large Southwestern district. Teacher collegiality has not been viewed within the context of shifting power relationships between teachers and administrators. Some researchers (Conley, Bas-Isaac, & Scull, in press; Hargreaves, 1991) have maintained that while some teacher collegiality mechanisms may be teacher-driven and reflect genuine teacher collaboration, others are contrived and aimed more toward promoting administrative efficiency and gaining greater control over teachers' work. The critical question is whether peer mentoring systems, such as a formalized mentoring component of a Career <b>Ladder</b> <b>program,</b> which are inherently contrived, are capable of generating teacher collaboration.
