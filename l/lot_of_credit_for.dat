500|$|Conversely, various Marxist {{observers}} – including Western historians Hill and John Rees – {{argued against}} {{the view that}} Lenin's government was a dictatorship, viewing it instead as an imperfect way of preserving elements of democracy without some of the processes found in liberal democratic states. Ryan contends that the leftist historian Paul Le Blanc [...] "makes a quite valid point that the personal qualities that led Lenin to brutal policies were not necessarily any stronger than {{in some of the}} major Western leaders of the twentieth century". Ryan also posits that for Lenin, 'revolutionary' violence was merely a means to an end: the establishment of a socialist, ultimately communist world – a world without violence. Historian J. Arch Getty remarked, [...] "Lenin deserves a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the notion that the meek can inherit the earth, that there can be a political movement based on social justice and equality."

Like Yehl, Johnson also praised the fluidity of the art from Zircher, Cannon, Sampere and Cifuentes. Newsarama's Aaron Duran gave the title a 5 out of 10, saying the comic is simply okay and would have worked better as a shorter installment within other books or as bonus digital content.|$|E

While he praised the episode's production and the singing abilities of the cast, Kurt Anthony Krug of Mania.com wrote a negative review: [...] "All in all, what was supposed to be a fun filler episode before the question of where Peter went at the end of the last episode when he found out he was the Peter from an alternate reality – one of the turning points in the show’s mythology – fell flat". Sarah Stegall of SFScope enjoyed it, writing [...] "There was just enough music, and just enough dance, to season this story without overburdening it". She praised the risktaking it took to make the episode [...] "edgy and whimsical, casting aside the concrete conventions of television storytelling...Not only was it entertaining, but it moved the storyline forward on some important emotional fronts, as the characters deal with Peter's disappearance in ways that protect them, but reveal as well".|$|E

5|$|The most wide-reaching {{psychological}} {{weapon was}} {{the radio station}} Voice of Liberation. It began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist propaganda, telling its listeners to resist the Árbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting from deep within the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message which many listeners believed. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in Miami by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a mobile transmitter. The Voice of Liberation made an initial broadcast that was repeated four times, after which it took to transmitting two-hour bulletins twice a day. The transmissions were initially only heard intermittently in Guatemala City; a week later, the CIA significantly increased their transmitting power, allowing clear reception in the Guatemalan capital. The radio broadcasts {{have been given a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> by historians <b>for</b> the success of the coup, due to the unrest they created throughout the country. They were unexpectedly assisted by the outage of the government-run radio station, which stopped transmitting for three weeks while a new antenna was being fitted.

However, {{there is a lack}} of research focused on the lived experience of grandchildren parented by their grandparents in comparison to the volumes to date on the experience and impact on grandparents who are parenting their grandchildren. The purpose of this study was to invite grandchildren, who have been parented by their grandparent(s) to speak about their experience and in this way, to make a contribution to the fledgling body of knowledge beginning to be gathered. What, in particular, do they want others to know about their experience? What suggestions do they want to make to inform and influence our practice as counsellors, teachers, social workers, policy makers and grandparents involved in a parenting role? These questions formed the basis for this research. Seven young people aged between seventeen and twenty-four, five females and two males, were interviewed. As far as it has been possible to establish, this is the first research on this topic based in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Through the individual and group interview process, the young adults showed insight, maturity and demonstrated the ability to articulate their thoughts and feelings with a capacity beyond their years. Contrary to the dominant discourse in the published literature on this topic, which highlights emotional and behavioural difficulties, these young people were clearly thriving, going forward strongly in their lives and giving a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> this to their grandparents' willingness to take them on and see them through.

Most wondered what life might have been like, had they grown up in the idealized nuclear family construct, however, they also highlighted the wisdom their respective grandparents offered and would not want to have missed out on the opportunity to have developed the close connection that being raised by their grandparents provided...|$|R

The 1997 season {{proved to be a}} fairytale effort with the team having its best season yet in NPC rugby. The side finished as top qualifier, won its home semi final and went down to in the final. 1998 saw North Otago lose only two of its nine games. North Otago was now winning more games in a season than it used to win in a decade. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the massive resurgence in North Otago rugby during this period must go to the outstanding coaches, Greg Shipton and Peter Cook. In 2000, Glenn Moore took over the reins with Paddy Stewart. Moore, a former Mid Canterbury representative, had instant success with the side and only narrowly lost the final against East Coast 21-25. 2001 looked like North Otago's season, winning all of its seven games. However, in the final it was a disappointing four-point loss to South Canterbury 16-20. 2002 saw the North Otago Rugby Union celebrate its 75th jubilee and it indeed appropriate that in the 75th year of its existence the side should take the third division title beating Horowhenua 43-19 before an ecstatic crowd. 2003 and the challenges of Division Two was very much a daunting task. However, the team responded magnificently and finished in the top four but lost the semi final to Hawke's Bay in Napier in controversial circumstances. The highlight of the season was a superb win against Counties-Manukau. 2004 saw North Otago once again playing above its weight making the semi finals before going down to Nelson Bays.|$|R

Birch, Alumni Programs Director, (706) 542 - 5190 UGA LAW SCHOOL PRESENTS PORTRAIT OF FORMER DEAN ATHENS, Ga. [...] A {{portrait}} honoring former University of Georgia School of Law Dean Edward D. (Ned) Spurgeon will {{be presented}} in a public ceremony in the law school 2 ̆ 7 s Hatton Lovejoy Courtroom Friday, October 1 at 5 p. m. The portrait, commissioned by the Law School Alumni Association (LSA) and painted by Jiaxian Hao, represents the seventh time a dean has been honored with an artist 2 ̆ 7 s rendering. The portrait presentation program will include remarks from a former student and research fellow, Elizabeth R. Calhoun, {{a member of the}} class of 2 ̆ 798; Associate Dean and Hosch Professor Paul M. Kurtz; and former Georgia Governor Carl E. Sanders, a 1948 graduate of the law school and chairman of the Atlanta law firm of Troutman Sanders. A reception in the law school rotunda will follow the unveiling of the portrait. Spurgeon, now a professor of law {{and a member of the}} faculty of gerontology at UGA, served as dean of the law school for five years, from 1993 - 98. During his tenure, the law school 2 ̆ 7 s national reputation climbed as he worked to strengthen its faculty, educational program, facilities and base of support. Eight new faculty members were hired, six faculty were named to chaired positions - including the first woman - and the legal research and writing staff was expanded. The additions resulted in the creation of a civil clinic, a more diversified curriculum, a lower faculty/student ratio, and more time for professors to engage in scholarship and research. Faculty and staff salaries were also raised to a level on par with peer institutions. Under Spurgeon 2 ̆ 7 s leadership, construction of Dean Rusk Hall was completed. The law library improved its automation, and the law school joined several international exchange programs. National championships were earned by both the law school 2 ̆ 7 s moot court and mock trial teams. Unrestricted giving grew by nearly 75 percent, several major gifts were received, and alumni support, evidenced both in fund raising and attendance at special events, reached an all-time high. 2 ̆ 2 I think Ned Spurgeon did an outstanding job, 2 ̆ 2 said Sanders. 2 ̆ 2 The law school is getting better year after year, and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> that emanates from the leadership of the dean of the law school. We 2 ̆ 7 ve been fortunate to have had Ned Spurgeon serve as dean and are fortunate that he has been succeeded by another outstanding leader, David Shipley. The future of the law school is bright. 2 ̆ 2 Spurgeon practiced law for 16 years, as a partner with Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker in Los Angeles and as a consultant with two Salt Lake City law firms, before beginning his career in higher education. He taught as a member of the faculty of the Utah College of Law from 1980 to 1993, serving also as dean for seven years (1983 - 90) and as William H. Leary Professor of Law and Policy from 1990 - 93. A native of New Jersey, Spurgeon earned his undergraduate degree in English from Princeton University, his law degree from Stanford University Law School, and a master of laws degree from New York University Law School. Spurgeon 2 ̆ 7 s specialty areas include law, public policy and aging; estate and gift tax; and estate planning. The third edition of his co-authored national treatise, Federal Taxation of Trusts, Grantors and Beneficiaries, was published in 1997. He currently serves as executive director of the Borchard Foundation Center on Law and Aging, a director of the National Senior Citizens Law Center, special adviser to the ABA Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly, and as an executive committee member of the Utah Legal Services Volunteer Senior Lawyers Project...|$|R
