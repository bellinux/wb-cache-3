40|$|The drag of a prawn-trawl body is characterised by five {{design and}} three {{operational}} variables. The design variables comprise headline <b>length,</b> steepness <b>of</b> <b>trawl</b> side cut, width-to-depth mesh ratio <b>of</b> the <b>trawl</b> mouth (gape), vertical wing-end mesh count, and netting solidity; {{all of which}} effectively determine the planar twine-area <b>of</b> the <b>trawl.</b> The operational variables include towing velocity, horizontal spread, and vertical opening (headline height) —these determine {{the extent that the}} netting is exposed to relative water movement. The individual drag effects of the above variables (except for headline length, gape, and netting solidity) were systematically examined in a flume tank with prawn-trawl models built with low-stiffness full-scale netting; and the existing literature was consulted on the drag effects of gape, while drag was assumed to be proportional to twine diameter, mesh size 1 and headline length 2. The developed equations in non-dimensional forms provide the basis for a drag-prediction model for a prawn <b>trawl</b> <b>of</b> any size, construction and operating conditions.

The fishing trials showed that both the species and size compositions obtained by the two gears were significantly different. Relatively more haddock were caught by longline than by trawl, and longline fishing was found to catch less undersized cod and more undersized haddock than trawling. It appeared that the size compositions of the longline catches were affected by the fish density and size composition in the area.

40|$|Abstract: Trawling {{remains a}} {{controversial}} method of fishing {{due to the}} poor selectivity <b>of</b> <b>trawl</b> net and the resultant catch of huge amount of non target species. This work aimed to throw light on quantitative data of the catch composition, by- catch levels and discard estimates <b>of</b> bottom <b>trawling</b> along the Mediterranean coasts of Egypt. Experimental fishing operations using the Italian trawl net during 2008 pointed out the following: The non target catch comprised 51. 07 and 37. 04 % of the total catch <b>of</b> <b>trawl</b> net during spring and summer seasons, respectively. A category of the non target catch comprising 21. 52 and 7. 86 % of the total catch were discarded during spring and summer seasons, respectively. The by-catch taken through the period of study embodied 13 commercial fish species, the average <b>length</b> <b>of</b> which was 4. 7 to 10. 9 cm attaining average weight of 1. 1 to 21. 2 g. Furthermore most of the target fish species were retained in the cod end with small sizes before reaching the length at first maturity. In conclusion, to conserve the fish stocks of demmersal species, it is strongly recommended to increase the mesh size <b>of</b> <b>trawl</b> nets used on commercial scale along the Egyptian coast of the Mediterranean.

40|$|The density, size {{composition}} {{and growth of}} Nephrops norvegicus were examined at six sites in part of the Firth of Clyde, SW Scotland, between 1990 and 1992. Sampling was carried out using small mesh trawls and by an underwater television camera. The growth of male Nephrops at each site was investigated by analysis of length–frequency distributions using the computer program ‘‘Multifan’’. Estimates of Nephrops density at each station were obtained from TV counts of burrows and from relative trawl catch rates. Both density measures were correlated and showed a similar pattern between stations, although burrow counts exceeded trawl catches by roughly two orders of magnitude. Marked geographical variations were recorded in both the growth (L � and K) and density parameters, and L � {{was found to be}} inversely correlated with burrow density, suggesting that growth may be density-dependent. The weighted annual mean carapace <b>length</b> <b>of</b> Nephrops in <b>trawl</b> samples was significantly correlated with L �, suggesting that mean size data may provide a useful indicator of growth variability within and between populations. On the other hand, the maximum carapace length (L max) ofNephrops in samples was found to provide an unreliable estimate of L �.

It was also demonstrated that doors would stay upright and maintain the same ground contact under varying conditions, if warp length was adjusted correctly according to depth.

We conducted a large-scale assessment <b>of</b> bottom <b>trawl</b> fishing <b>of</b> benthic fauna in different habitats, using a theoretical, size-based model that included habitat features. Species richness was estimated based on a generalized body mass versus species richness relationship. The model was validated by sampling 33 stations subject to a range <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> intensities in four shallow, soft sediment areas in the North Sea. Both the model and the field data demonstrated that trawling reduced biomass, production, and species richness. The impacts <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> were greatest in areas with low levels of natural disturbance, while the impact <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> was small in areas with high rates of natural disturbance. For the North Sea, the model showed that the bottom trawl fleet reduced benthic biomass and production by 56 % and 21 %, respectively, compared with an unfished situation.
