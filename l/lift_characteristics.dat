50|$|The drag of a wing {{consists}} of two components, the induced drag, which {{is related to the}} production of lift, and the profile drag, largely due to skin friction which is contributed to by the whole wing area.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of existing theoretical models for predicting wing leading edge separated flow characteristics for high-lift supersonic flight was examined {{with regard to}} previous experimental force, pressure and flow visualization data. Correlations of data on uncambered delta wings revealed that the upper surface normal force and minimum pressure coefficients decreased nonlinearly with increasing angles of attack. The attainable vacuum pressure decreased with increasing Mach number, while the lower surface normal force increased nonlinearly with increasing speed. The LISTAR and VORCAM linear theory aerodynamic codes generated predictions for comparison with the data. LISTAR displayed better agreement with measured vortex strength and position and <b>lifting</b> <b>characteristics</b> than did VORCAM. The Euler code SWINT was ill-suited to calculating wing performance in separated flows at high lift and low supersonic speeds...|$|R

The aft fuselage was almost entirely dedicated to the engine, from just behind the wings. The cockpit had a tandem configuration, which was chosen to give a better aerodynamic fuselage (slimmer) than the more usual side-by-side arrangement. There was a long, low bubble canopy.

Predicted results from two modified linear-theory methods (LTSTAR and VORCAM) are compared with experimental data. Comparison of the two methods for uncambered wings revealed that the LTSTAR code is in much better agreement with experimentally measured vortex strength, vortex position, and total <b>lifting</b> <b>characteristics</b> than the VORCAM code.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{an analytical}} approach towards {{the understanding of}} the hydrostatic leakage and <b>lift</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a flat slipper of the type used for piston/slipper units within an axial piston pump or motor.

A new set of equations are developed and in generic form for a slipper with any number of grooves. Experimental comparisons are then undertaken and extended to include the effect of relative motion around the swash plate and slipper tilt. A CFD study of the slipper is also presented. Comparisons between analytical, experimental and CFD results show a very good agreement, validating the equations presented and extending the conclusions when tilt and tangential speed are considered.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} computing section <b>lift</b> <b>characteristics</b> for a 2 -dimensional airfoil with a second 2 -dimensional object at a position at or ahead of {{the leading edge of}} the airfoil. Since both objects are 2 -dimensional, the analysis yields a closed form solution to calculation of the airflow over the airfoil and second object, using conformal mapping of analytically closed form airflow velocity vector past two circular shaped objects in initial complex plane, using a standard air flow model for each object individually. The combined airflow velocity vector is obtained by linear superposition of the velocity vector for the two objects, computed individually. The <b>lift</b> <b>characteristics</b> are obtained from the circulation around the airfoil and second object which is computed from the combined closed form velocity vector and the geometry along the contour integral for circulation.
