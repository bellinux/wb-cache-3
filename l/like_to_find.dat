25|$|The {{purpose of}} radio {{resource}} management is {{to satisfy the}} data rates that are requested by the users of a cellular network. The main resources are time intervals, frequency blocks, and transmit powers. Each user has its own objective function that, for example, can represent some combination of the data rate, latency, and energy efficiency. These objectives are conflicting since the frequency resources are very scarce, thus {{there is a need}} for tight spatial frequency reuse which causes immense inter-user interference if not properly controlled. Multi-user MIMO techniques are nowadays used to reduce the interference by adaptive precoding. The network operator would like to both bring great coverage and high data rates, thus the operator would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a Pareto optimal solution that balance the total network data throughput and the user fairness in an appropriate subjective manner.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are certain}} {{examples}} of social loafing {{in the workplace}} that are discussed by James Larsen in his essay [...] "Loafing on The Job."

2500|$|Given {{a circle}} in the {{boundary}} of a manifold, we would often <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a disk embedded in the manifold whose boundary is the given circle. If the manifold is simply connected then {{we can find a}} map from a disc to the manifold with boundary the given circle, and if the manifold is of dimension at least 5 then by putting this disc in [...] "general position" [...] it becomes an embedding. The number 5 appears for the following reason: submanifolds of dimension m and n in general position do not intersect provided the dimension of the manifold containing them has dimension greater than m+n. In particular, a disc (of dimension 2) in general position will have no self intersections inside a manifold of dimension greater than 2+2.|$|E

He said that the U.S. government should be defending the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). His 2012 campaign web site says that he would [...] "nominate conservative judges who are committed to upholding Constitutional limited government and understand that the role of the judges is to interpret the law, not legislate from the bench". Gingrich believes the Republican Party should accept the reality that several states allow same-sex marriage and accept the distinction between [...] "a marriage in a church" [...] and [...] "a legal document issued by the state".|$|E

2500|$|The 20th century Israeli Modern Orthodox Rabbi Pinchas Peli {{argued that}} even though God {{endorsed}} Phinehas's action and Moses no doubt approved, it frightened Moses, the experienced and trained leader, who could not see how this zealot, who {{in a moment of}} crisis decided to take the law into his own hands, could become the permanent leader of the Israelite people. Thus, Peli suggested, in [...] Moses asked God to name the new leader and specified qualifications that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in the appointee. Citing Rashi and the Midrash, Peli read Moses's prayer to ask God for a leader who would be able to bear with the Israelites' differing spirits. Peli argued that a true leader is not a single-minded fanatic, but a person able to tolerate all views, able to stand up for what is right, but also capable of changing his or her mind.|$|E

[...] Love also co-wrote and co-produced another R midtempo for the album titled [...] "Feeling Me Right Now", where the lyrics describe what it is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> [...] "self-love" [...] in the club. The final Love-penned song which appears on the album is titled [...] "Each Other" [...] and was co-written/co-produced by Souldiggaz. Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins scores two songs on the album, including the Lil Playy-assisted [...] "Work It Man". Beginning with a strong piano riff, the song picks up its tempo resulting in a [...] "speaker-banger." [...] The lyrics see Rowland telling listeners {{what kind of man}} she wants. [...] "Turn It Up", another Darkchild production, features a synth-heavy production with lyrics about having a good time and allowing karma to deal with a cheating partner. Joseph [...] "Lonny" [...] Bereal helped Rowland and two others to co-write [...] "Keep It Between Us", a song that appears as the eighth song on the album. In February 2011, during New York Fashion Week, Rowland confirmed that she also had sessions arranged with RedOne, which led to the conception of the album's tenth song, a Eurodance song called [...] "Down for Whatever", co-produced by The WAV.s and Jimmy Joker.|$|E
