5|$|Several {{teaching}} {{guides and}} books of study notes {{have been published}} to help teachers and students gain the most from the book. The Hobbit introduces literary concepts, notably allegory, to young readers, as the work has been seen to have allegorical aspects reflecting the <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the author. Meanwhile, the author himself rejected an allegorical reading of his work. This tension can help introduce readers to readerly and writerly interpretations, to tenets of New Criticism, and critical tools from Freudian analysis, such as sublimation, in approaching literary works.|$|E
5|$|Barrymore's {{achievements}} and his colorful life have ensured that several biographical studies followed his 1926 autobiography, Confessions of an Actor. Alma Power-Waters produced a 1941 study, {{authorized by the}} subject, John Barrymore: The Legend and the Man; Fowler, wrote Good Night, Sweet Prince: The <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> John Barrymore (1943); Alpert published The Barrymores (1964); and John Kobler wrote Damned in Paradise: The Life of John Barrymore (1977), although Norden noted in 2000 {{that many of these}} earlier works are less than reliable. Those he identified as being more thoroughly researched are Peters' 1990 history, The House of Barrymore, and his own study of the actor's work in John Barrymore: A Bio-Bibliography (1995). Subsequent to Norden's comments on the available literature, Morrison published the positively reviewed John Barrymore, Shakespearean Actor in 1997, which focuses on Barrymore's stage work.|$|E
5|$|Hagiographic {{accounts}} of Harding's life quickly followed his death, such as Joe Mitchell Chapple's <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> <b>Times</b> <b>of</b> Warren G. Harding, Our After-War President (1924). By then, the scandals were breaking, and the Harding administration {{soon became a}} byword for corruption {{in the view of}} the public. Works written in the late 1920s helped shape Harding's historical reputation: Masks in a Pageant by William Allen White mocked and dismissed Harding, as did Samuel Hopkins Adams' fictionalized account of the Harding administration, Revelry. These books depicted Harding's time in office as one of great presidential weakness. The publication of Nan Britton's bestselling book disclosing they had had an affair also lowered the late president in public esteem. President Coolidge, not wishing to be further associated with his predecessor, refused to dedicate the Harding Tomb. Hoover, Coolidge's successor, was similarly reluctant, but with Coolidge in attendance presided over the dedication in 1931. By that time, with the Great Depression in full swing, Hoover was nearly as discredited as Harding.|$|E
