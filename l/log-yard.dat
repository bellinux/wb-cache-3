40|$|We {{successfully}} {{tracked the}} identities of over 550 selected 13 -year-old trees from a Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) progeny trial through tree felling, harvesting of butt-logs, sawmill processing to finished sawn boards using a two-stage approach. To track log identity from the standing tree to the <b>log-yard,</b> we used a numbered under-bark wooden identification plug, glued into a hole drilled in the trunk prior to harvesting. To track tree identity for individual sawn boards, log-end templates with corresponding tree identification numbers were glued to the log-ends before milling. Materials and methods used withstood harvesting and debarking, log transportation, milling, air and kiln-drying, steam-reconditioning and final machining. A second study confirmed {{the success of the}} under-bark plug method to successfully track 548 selected standing trees through harvesting and transportation to the mill...|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainability}} of short-rotation willow coppice (SRWC) as a multifunctional system for phytoremediation—the use of plants {{for treatment of}} contaminated air, soil or water—and for producing energy biomass, was studied. SRWC is grown commercially in Sweden to produce energy biomass, nutrient-rich residues being applied as cost-efficient fertiliser to increase production. The principal residues used are municipal wastewater, landfill leachate, industrial wastewater (e. g. <b>log-yard</b> runoff), sewage sludge and wood-ash. Small- and large-scale experiments with residues aimed to quantify the extent of potential hazards {{and the performance of}} SRWC in reducing them. Lysimeter experiments with willow plants, intensively irrigated with N-rich municipal wastewater, showed that N-leaching is a potential threat when high N loads are applied. Experimental data from SRWC fields irrigated with municipal wastewater in central Sweden suggest that in practice, N-leaching is significantly lower, even when the N load applied is greater than the N requirements of SRWC. Growth of willow plants of five different clones in pot experiments irrigated with landfill leachate was reduced by comparison with that of control plants. The reduction was attributed to saline stress or P deficiency, and indicates that, when hazardous compounds are present in wastewater, irrigation rates should be adjusted to avoid growth reduction. Genetic differences were observed between willow clones in salt tolerance and growth performance. The careful selection of clones to suit specific situations is therefore recommended. Leaf length can be used for rapid diagnosis of stress, to permit adjustment of the irrigation rate, and thus to avoid growth reduction. Phytoremedial efficiency of SRWC is satisfactory when the concentration of hazardous compounds in wastewaters is low, as in <b>log-yard</b> runoff, and depends on irrigation intensity. Application of sludge–ash mixtures to SRWC is not a substantial threat to sustainability, in terms of heavy metals. Total Cd in the soil is expected to decrease after harvest, but other metals and P loads, must also be considered. Any decision concerning residue application must take into account factors such as residue composition, soil type, climate, and species or clone characteristics, if both a high growth rate of SRWC and sustainability are to be attained...|$|E
40|$|Shortrotation willow coppice is {{cultivated}} {{not only}} to produce biomass for energy, but also to treat waste products, taking up pollutants from soil and water. Short-rotation willow coppice is cultivated in Sweden to produce biomass for energy. The crop is commercially grown, mainly on agricul-tural land, and the biomass produced is used in district heating plants for com-bined heat and power production. In recent years, nutrient-rich waste products – mainly urban wastewater, landfill leachate, industrial wastewaters (e. g. <b>log-yard</b> runoff), sewage sludge and wood-ash – have been successfully applied to the willow coppice to reduce, through plant uptake, the content of pol-lutants and/or excess nutrients in water and soils, and to facilitate microbial degradation of organic pollutants. This process is known as phytoremediation. The benefits of such practices are both environmental and economic: this method of treating waste products (which here can be considered more as resources than as wastes) is more cost effective than conventional treatments, and the nutrients contained in the waste products serve as low-cost fertilizers to increase biomass production. This article provides an overview and exam-ples {{of the use of}} short-rotation willow coppice in phytoremediation systems for treating different kinds of waste i...|$|E

We show that log-end splitting in the temperate plantation speciesEucalyptus nitensvaries across sites and within-tree log position and increases with time in storage. ContextLog-end splitting {{is one of the}} single most important defects in veneer logs because it can substantially reduce the recovery of veneer sheets. Eucalyptus nitens can develop log-end splits, but factors affecting log-end splitting in this species are not well understood. AimsThe present study aims to describe the effect of log storage and steaming on the development of log-end splitting in logs from different plantations and log positions within the tree. MethodsThe study was conducted on upper and lower logs from each of 41 trees from three 20 – 22 -year-old Tasmanian E. nitens plantations. Log-end splitting was assessed immediately after felling, after transport and storage in a <b>log-yard,</b> and just before peeling. A pre-peeling steam treatment was applied to half the logs. ResultsSite had a significant effect on splitting, and upper logs split more than lower logs with storage. Splitting increased with tree diameter breast height (DBH), but this relationship varied with site. The most rapidly growing site had more splitting even after accounting for DBH. No significant effect of steaming was detected. ConclusionLog-end splitting varied across sites and within-tree log position and increased with time in storage...|$|E
