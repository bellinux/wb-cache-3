2500|$|Early {{synchronized}} guns of the 1915–1917 period had {{a rate of}} fire in {{the region}} of 400 rounds per minute; at this comparatively leisurely rate of fire a synchronizer can be geared down and rendered fairly reliable. To control a faster gun, with (say) a cyclic rate of 800 or 1,000 rounds a minute, a gear had to work faster, making it more liable to failure. The intricate mechanism of a mechanical <b>linkage</b> <b>system,</b> especially of the [...] "push rod" [...] type, tended to shake itself to pieces when driven at this sort of speed.|$|E

50|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} {{to design the}} <b>linkage</b> <b>system</b> so that the movement {{of all of the}} bodies are constrained to lie on parallel planes, to form what is known as a planar linkage.

50|$|Linkages are {{important}} components of machines and tools. Examples {{range from the}} four-bar linkage used to amplify force in a bolt cutter or to provide independent suspension in an automobile, to complex <b>linkage</b> <b>systems</b> in robotic arms and walking machines. The internal combustion engine uses a slider-crank four-bar linkage formed from its piston, connecting rod, and crankshaft to transform power from expanding burning gases into rotary power. Relatively simple linkages are often used to perform complicated tasks.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} difference between biological and engineering linkages is that revolving bars are rare in biology and that usually {{only a small}} range of the theoretically possible is possible due to additional mechanical constraints (especially the necessity to deliver blood). Biological linkages frequently are compliant. Often one or more bars are formed by ligaments, and often the linkages are three-dimensional. Coupled <b>linkage</b> <b>systems</b> are known, as well as five-, six-, and even seven-bar linkages. Four-bar linkages {{are by far the}} most common though.|$|R
50|$|The {{configuration}} {{of a system}} of rigid links connected by ideal joints is defined by a set of configuration parameters, such as the angles around a revolute joint and the slides along prismatic joints measured between adjacent links.

The number of input parameters is called the mobility, or degree of freedom, of the <b>linkage</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

The objective of this study was to better understand the facilitators and barriers to successful data <b>linkage</b> <b>systems.</b> Data were collected by questionnaire, focus group, and a literature search. Twenty-five States completed the survey and 19 participated in focus groups. Facilitators of these systems included a community context that supports linkage, one lead agency to oversee the system, coalition of data owners, memorandums of understanding to obtain data, high quality data, staff with the right mix of technical and non-technical skills, technical assistance and training, and stable funding. Barriers included lack of funding, staff turnover, lack of documented procedures, lags in obtaining data, statutory requirements for data use, complex linkage techniques, and failure to adequately market information available from linked databases.
