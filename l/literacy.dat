Emily, Tristan and Simon helped me to see <b>literacies</b> as complex in their conception and use and that all sign systems (e. g. art, dance, reading, writing, maths, sports, videogaming, etc.) operate using common semiotic principles. Sign systems as <b>literacies</b> are multimodal, meaning-focused and motivated; they involve specific social and cultural practices which differ depending on site and community. During every literate act the children in this study made extensive use of the semantic, sensory, syntactic and pragmatic cuing systems to make meaning, regardless of the <b>literacies</b> used. Emily, Tristan and Simon taught me that we need to see children as literate, as symbol users, and meaning-makers from birth. In order to support <b>literacies</b> learning we need to begin by recognizing and supporting the <b>literacies</b> learning process that is already in place...|$|R

40|$|Current {{interest}} in digital <b>literacies</b> rarely encompasses preschool children, considers the role which digital technologies {{play in the}} development of early <b>literacies,</b> or addresses the extent to which digital <b>literacies</b> develop in tandem with traditional <b>literacies.</b> Findings from our research project Entering e-Society indicate that three- and four-year-old children growing up in Scotland {{are in the process of}} developing digital literacies: making meaning and engaging in social and civic participation through the use of digital technologies at home, at preschool and in the community. Their technological competences are used to achieve goals and develop their knowledge and understanding of the world around them. Drawing on concepts from new <b>literacies</b> perspectives and socio-cultural theory, we looked for parallels, and dissonances, between the development of early print and early digital <b>literacies.</b> This presentation focuses on tensions between the concept of prolepsis (Cole, 1996) and deixis (Leu et al, 2004). Prolepsis is used to theorise parents' (and, implicitly, teachers') cultural engagement with young children's development: present actions based on recalling their own (idealised) past and projecting this into their children's futures. Deixis refers to the notion that the rapid pace of technological change is in the process of revolutionising the ways in which we think and learn: where once human cognitive potential was limited by technology, it is now limited by human ability to keep up with technological development. In this context we argue for a view of young children's early engagement with both print and digital <b>literacies</b> which sees this as one set of competences spread over a wider range of media than was the case a generation ago. However, we think it is not simply an expansion of the territory in which <b>literacies</b> can happen. We use the term enhanced <b>literacies</b> to describe an emergent, probably different, model of early <b>literacies</b> from earlier, print-dominant models...|$|R

In this discussion, I examine how discipline-based faculty encourage and support digital <b>literacies</b> and suggest how these faculty might update their courses to include digital technologies and new media.

40|$|Emerging {{from the}} United Kingdom {{during the last}} decade, {{academic}} <b>literacies</b> research {{has been instrumental in}} the growth of academic writing support in English-medium tertiary institutions.
