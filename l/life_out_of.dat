5|$|When Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, he held an {{approval}} rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later Bill Clinton, {{as the highest}} ratings for departing presidents in the modern era. He was the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms, after a succession of five prior presidents did not, some under unusual circumstances. Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in 1994 {{that he had been}} diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier that year. He appeared publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon. He died ten years later in 2004 at the age of 93. Reagan had the third-longest <b>life</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all the presidents, after Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. An icon among Republicans, he is viewed favorably in historian rankings of U.S. presidents, and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{conversion}} {{was described in}} different ways, but most ministers agreed that there were 3 essential stages.

The third stage was sanctification, the ability to live a holy <b>life</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> gladness toward God.|$|E
25|$|The {{main source}} for {{information}} about Paul's life is the material found in his epistles and in Acts. However, the epistles contain little information about Paul's past. The book of Acts recounts more information but leaves several parts of Paul's <b>life</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its narrative, such as his probable but undocumented execution in Rome. Some scholars believe Acts also contradicts Paul's epistles on multiple accounts, in particular concerning the frequency of Paul's visits to the church in Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Tancred enlisted in the Natal Light Horse but was discharged as being unfit for active service in 1915. His marriage to Mary Chawick later that year produced two children and following a few post War matches Tancred retired from first-class cricket in 1920. It is believed that Tancred became depressed {{as he struggled to}} live <b>life</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the limelight that surrounded his cricketing career. His disillusionment was such that Tancred strongly advised his son Louis Jnr not to embark on a career in sport. Louis Jnr instead joined the Royal Air Force and, while working as a flight instructor, was killed aged 34 in a plane crash at the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire.|$|E

They finally arrived, against all odds, at Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring could be destroyed. However, Gollum had secretly followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's <b>life</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> pity, and turned his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature and followed Frodo.|$|E

Upon her return, she offers to give Lee a piece of The Shard—a fragment of Christ's crucifix. Lee drugs and tortures Mariah for information, but later helps her recover her death from Wilde. Mariah learns that Doctor Juris was {{responsible for the death of}} Shadow Boxer, Mariah's lover, and allies herself with Lee. Twenty years later, she also enters a relationship with Malachi.|$|E

500|$|Beyond this, Jack Warner {{was shaken}} by the 1936 murder of studio {{salesman}} Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin. Warner later described the incident in the following terms: [...] "Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [...] hit him with fists and clubs and then kicked the <b>life</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him with their boots and left him dying there." [...] Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism {{and the loss of}} European markets, Warner Brothers produced films that were openly critical of Nazi Germany.|$|E
