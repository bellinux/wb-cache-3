Mechanistic-empirical (M-E) pavement design computes stresses induced {{in a concrete}} slab due to applied traffic and environmental loads, and correlates these stresses to distress levels using empirical correlations. Currently, the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) {{is one of the}} most advanced and prevalent methods of M-E pavement design. While the MEPDG predicts transverse <b>cracking,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking</b> is not predicted, even though <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking</b> is commonly observed in jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCPs). In this research, an MEPDG compatible model was developed to predict <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking</b> fatigue damage in JPCPs. This modeled adapts the framework of the MEPDG specifically for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking.</b> In order to develop an M-E <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking</b> fatigue damage model, it is necessary to compute stresses at the critical location for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking</b> due to the various traffic and environmental loads to which a pavement could be exposed. The principles of similarity were used to map the original problem into similar space, which drastically reduces the complexity of the problem without introducing any error. To avoid the computational inefficiency associated with embedding a finite element program within the program, neural networks are used for rapid stress solutions. Stresses determined in similar space are converted back into real space for damage computation. Modifications were made to the MEPDG fatigue damage computation process to eliminate simplifying assumptions and to make the procedure applicable to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking.</b> A study was also conducted to determine characteristics of pavement susceptible to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking</b> based on various parameters. This study made use of the principles of similarity to examine almost all pavements which could be considered in M-E design. By identifying the characteristics of pavements susceptible to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking,</b> engineers can identify pavements for which <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking</b> analysis should be conducted. The model and design procedure developed in this research provides the tools needed to conduct such an analysis...|$|R

The sensitivity analysis of design parameters for asphalt pavement can be used to study the influence of every parameter on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking,</b> which can help optimizing the design of the pavement structure. In this study, 20 test sections of Qinghai–Tibet Highway were selected to conduct the sensitivity analysis of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cracking</b> on material parameter based on Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) and single factorial sensitivity analysis method. Some computer aided engineering (CAE) simulation techniques, such as the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) technique and the multiple regression analysis are used as auxiliary means.

40|$|M. Ing. (Civil Engineering) Abstract: Pipe {{material}} behaviour plays a {{major role}} in the crack opening of pressurised water distribution systems. Several studies have shown that the amount of water that leaks from a crack can be much more sensitive to pressure than theory suggests. The aim of this investigation is to understand the structural behaviour of longitudinal cracks in pipes under pressure. This is achieved by subjecting several plates with different length of cracks to tension and monitoring the opening of the cracks. A theoretical model for a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>crack</b> opening is derived using the orifice equation, as a function of the pressure, pipe material properties, pipe geometry and fluid properties for uni-axial stress state. Subsequently an equation describing the increase of the leakage flow rate as a function of the increase of the crack area in uni-axial stress state is determined. Results show that the material around the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>crack</b> exhibited elastic expansion behaviour due to hoop stresses induced by internal pressure in the pipe. Therefore, the crack opening area increases until the material exceeds its yield strength, causing a bulging of crack faces thus resulting in a significant increase of the leakage flow rate. Conclusions are made in relation to the influence of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>crack</b> expansion to an increase flow rate through <b>longitudinal</b> <b>crack</b> opening in pressurised pipes. Results include the effects of geometrical and material variables on the expansion of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>crack.</b> A better explanation of the increased flow rate through <b>longitudinal</b> <b>crack,</b> demonstrated by experimental data is presented in this study as a theoretical model. The leakage exponents resulting from the derived flow rate equation show a linear relationship with pressure a low stress and an exponential relationship at high stress. Further investigations are recommended to derive a model of flow rate under varying internal pressure for an increase of crack length combined with an increase of crack propagation. A coefficient as a corrector factor should be determined in order to greatly improve the theoretical derived equation of the maximum deflection of rectangular plates with a central crack under uniaxial tensile stresses...|$|E
40|$|Turbo {{generator}} shafts {{are often}} subjected to cyclic torsion resulting in formation of large longitudinal cracks {{as well as}} circumferential cracks. The presence of these cracks could greatly impact the shaft resonance frequencies. In this paper, dynamic response of a shaft with longitudinal and circumferential cracks is investigated through a comprehen-sive analytical study. The longitudinally cracked section of the shaft was modeled as an uncracked shaft with reduced torsional rigidity. Torsional rigidity correction factor (i. e., the ratio of torsional rigidity of the cracked shaft {{to that of the}} uncracked shaft) was obtained from finite element analysis and was shown to be only a function of crack depth to the shaft radius. The resonance frequency and frictional energy loss of a shaft with a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>crack</b> were found little affected by the presence of the crack as long as the crack depth was less than 20 % of the shaft radius even if the entire shaft is cracked longi-tudinally. Moreover, we showed that the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>crack</b> location could be more con-veniently identified by monitoring the slope of the torsional response along the shaft. The circumferential crack was modeled as a torsional spring with a torsional damping. The torsion spring and damping constants were obtained using fracture mechanics. For a shaft with both a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>crack</b> and a circumferential crack, the resonance frequency was governed by the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>crack</b> when the circumferential crack depth was less than 30 % of the shaft radius.
