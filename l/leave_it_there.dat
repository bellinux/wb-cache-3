5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} three floors beneath the statue: {{the halls of}} the Universe, of Benevolent Merit and of Remembrance. One of the most renowned {{features}} inside is a relic of Gautama Buddha, consisting of some of his alleged cremated remains. Only visitors who purchase an offering for the Buddha are allowed to see the relic, entering to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>there.</b> There is a huge carved bell inscribed with images of Buddhas in the show room. It was designed to ring every seven minutes, 108 times a day, symbolising the release of 108 kinds of human vexations.|$|E
500|$|Their {{investigation}} {{was led by}} Detective Chief Inspector Gordon Mutch of the Greater Manchester Police (GMP), [...] "astonishingly... the only person ever charged with a criminal offence {{in connection with the}} Manchester bomb". The van's last registered owner told police that he had sold it to a dealer in Peterborough, who had in turn sold the van on to a man calling himself Tom Fox, two weeks before the bombing. After the purchase price was delivered in cash by a taxi driver, the dealer was instructed to take the van to a nearby lorry park, and <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> with the keys and documents hidden inside.|$|E

60|$|He waited till he {{was safely}} out of sight, and then {{followed}} {{on down the}} street towards his hotel. When he reached it he walked boldly up to the clerk's desk, {{and said that he}} guessed he would take a room for the night, and gave him the check for his bag that he had received in <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
60|$|Josie {{paid the}} money. She caught the drayman who had {{unloaded}} {{the furniture and}} hired {{him to take the}} desk at once to the Hathaway residence. She even rode with the man, on the truck, and saw the battered piece of furniture placed in her own room. <b>Leaving</b> <b>it</b> <b>there,</b> she locked her door {{and went back to the}} Shop.|$|R
500|$|In turn, Evile's guitarists {{went into}} a room where another person sat with a microphone, ready to capture the sound. From the control room, Rasmussen would say [...] "Right, play something". The {{respective}} guitarist would play his instrument, to which Rasmussen would respond [...] "Right, move it left". Moving the guitar left, the respective guitarist would play again, Rasmussen replying with [...] "Move it right. Alright, <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>there.</b> Don't touch it". The respective guitarist would leave his instrument in that position, and the [...] "record" [...] button would be pressed. From there, the musician in question would play his parts. A Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier amplifier was tested alongside a Marshall [...] amplifier, but according to Drake, [...] "the Mesa (sound) was nowhere near as good". Evile chose to record Enter the Graves guitar parts using a Marshall amplifier, and spent roughly ten minutes attempting to achieve a [...] "decent" [...] sound. Slightly more time was spent testing the drums so that a [...] "nice" [...] sound could be achieved, and so that the drums could be tuned.|$|E
500|$|Speaking to {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: [...] "I don't {{think they do}} have feelings for each other in that way. Last year happened and Zoe put it down to history and experience — {{one of those things}} that teenagers get up to occasionally and she was quite happy to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>there.</b> They've got through a lot and their relationship is really quite special. There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah — it's purely a deep friendship." [...] Meanwhile, Batley said: [...] "I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had — a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more — she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the summer}} months, there are free [...] "City Bikes" [...] {{stationed}} at various {{spots in the}} downtown area of Copenhagen, Aarhus and Aalborg. The idea is that anyone can take a bike from one of the spots, ride it to one of the other spots and <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> for the next person. There are lots of National and regional bicycle routes throughout Denmark. They are all marked and include rest areas with benches and other necessities.|$|E
50|$|The sorcerer steals the Kalevides sword. After {{an attempt}} to take it away, he is forced to drop it in a stream. When the Kalevide awakes he goes hunting for his sword. When he finds it, he consults it and finds it is happier in the stream. He <b>leaves</b> <b>it</b> <b>there,</b> but orders <b>it</b> {{to cut off the}} feet of the sorcerer should he ever return.|$|R
2500|$|Gasparoli {{questioned}} in fact what purpose would {{be served by}} <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> <b>there.</b> As a message to Hedgepeth {{it made no sense}} to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> next to her body if she was dead; if it was written by the killer or killers it could have been particularly incriminating evidence and they had to be aware of that possibility. It looked to him, in fact, [...] "lmost {{as if it were a}} red herring ... left for some other reason than to reflect the real feelings of the killer(s). Left ... to confuse." ...|$|R

2500|$|However, Ulfang's Easterlings {{were also}} betrayed by their lord Morgoth, who had promised them vast lands in Beleriand, {{but now he}} {{commanded}} them to settle in the cold land of Hithlum and forbade them to <b>leave</b> <b>it.</b> <b>There</b> they plundered and harassed the remnant of the House of Hador, mostly old, women and children; those able to work they enslaved, others they drove out to starve. And many married women of the Folk of Hador by force, because there were few women in their following and [...] "none to compare with {{the daughters of the}} Edain". The Easterlings called the Folk of Hador Strawheads, and were met with such names as Incomers or Wolf-folk.|$|E
2500|$|For this reason, {{financial}} advisers often encourage {{those who have}} the option to do so to supplement their Social Security contributions with private retirement plans. One [...] "good" [...] supplemental retirement plan option is an employer-sponsored 401(K) (or 403(B)) plan when they are offered by an employer. 58% of American workers have access to such plans. Many of these employers will match a portion of an employee's savings dollar-for-dollar up to a certain percentage of the employee's salary. Even without employer matches, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are portable, self-directed, tax-deferred retirement accounts that offer the potential to substantially increase retirement savings. Their limitations include: the financial literacy to tell a [...] "good" [...] investment account from a less advantageous one; the savings barrier faced by those who are in low-wage employment or burdened by debt; the requirement of self-discipline to allot from an early age the required percentage of salary into [...] "good" [...] investment account(s); and the self–discipline needed to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> to earn compound interest until needed after retirement. Financial advisers often suggest that long-term investment horizons should be used, as historically short-term investment losses [...] "self correct", and most investments continue to deliver good average investment returns. The IRS has tax penalties for withdrawals from IRAs, 401(K)s, etc. before the age of 59½, and requires mandatory withdrawals once the retiree reaches 70; other restrictions may also apply on the amount of tax-deferred income one can put in the account(s). For people who have access to them, self-directed retirement savings plans have the potential to match or even exceed the benefits earned by federal, state and local government retirement plans.|$|E

60|$|While {{he spoke}} Pierre was working industriously, having taken {{his hand from}} my mouth after <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> {{sufficiently}} long to give token that he intended it for a reproof, and from that moment until sounds from the inside told that whoever was held prisoner had been on his part aiding in the work, I held my peace, watching little Frenchie's every movement, determining never again until {{we were out of}} this village, would I raise my voice until he had given permission.|$|R

The battle is {{interrupted}} when Psylocke {{arrives at the}} scene; Hawkeye threatens to shoot her head unless Angel stops fighting. He complies, but is still shot by Hawkeye, and later reports it to Emma Frost. In Wakanda, Black Panther and Storm fight while reflecting about their life as a couple. The fight is interrupted by Wakandan citizens and Storm's fellow X-Men; before leaving with her allies, Storm takes out her wedding ring and <b>leaves</b> <b>it</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the last}} novel, it is {{implied that the}} gunslinger's mostly cold, {{ruthless}} nature is alleviated slightly every time he reaches the Dark Tower and begins his journey again—Whilst his memories are erased, his personality changes in reflection of the experiences of each quest. This is symbolised by his re-acquisition of the Horn of Eld after the version covered in the Dark Tower series, implying that he has learned some of the true values of family and love (and patience); he has clearly taken the horn from Cuthbert Allgood's body as he wished rather than <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> as he did before.|$|R

50|$|Another {{commonly}} cited accurizing {{treatment for}} barrels is cryogenic treatment. This involves slowly cooling the steel down to liquid nitrogen temperatures, <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> for a time, {{and then slowly}} warming back to room temperature. This process converts remaining austenite in the steel to martensite. Many proponents of this process claim increased accuracy of the resulting barrels, but independent testing of the process by major manufacturers has shown no increase in accuracy. However, the conversion of austenite to martensite {{has been shown to}} result in easier machining and greater wear resistance on steels that tend to have significant amounts of retained austenite, such as stainless steels, and the process does appear to significantly affect the accurate life of stainless steel barrels.|$|R
