5|$|Both NEC tracks have {{high-level}} platforms, {{which were}} added in 2001 {{for use by}} Acela Express trains (which cannot use low platforms). The southbound NEC track is served by a <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> behind the station, {{which leads to a}} short high-level platform south of State Street. The northbound NEC track is served by a high-level platform behind the station building; the <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> south of State Street is generally only used for deboarding passengers from busy trains. Because of the sharp curve, the high-level platforms are set slightly back from the tracks to avoid scraping the ends of train cars, and thus bridge plates are needed to span the gap between platform and car.|$|E

5|$|To {{the north}} of Group B are several smaller groups of structures. They consist of {{residential}} complexes laid out around small plazas and their occupation was limited purely to the Late Classic period. Stela 2 is situated on a <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> {{to the west of}} the main pyramid.|$|E
5|$|Structure 13 {{is on the}} {{southwest}} side of Plaza 1, dividing that Plaza from Plaza 2. It was accessed via a double stairway ascending from Plaza 1. This double stairway gave access to the first level of the temple structure only; from there, a wide single stairway continued to the summit shrine. Only the lower sections of the walls and columns of the temple superstructure remain. The earliest phase of construction dates to the Early Classic and consisted of a <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> that supported a perishable superstructure.|$|E
5|$|Group C lies to the {{southwest}} of Group B and east of Group E. Group C is arranged around two large structures (C1 and C2). It possesses two small plazas; the East Plaza is {{the larger of the}} two, enclosing an area to the east of the main temple, Pyramid C1. The East Plaza was accessed via a narrow alley that ran between a large, <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> and a high-status residential structure with a patio (C8). An inset stairway climbed outside of the retaining wall of Group C and accessed the East Plaza between the high-status residence and a platform to its east. The West Plaza is located behind Platform C2 and is enclosed to the north by three platforms (C9, C10 and C17).|$|E

5|$|Patio F is on {{a terrace}} {{at the same}} level as Patios D and E. The patio is a closed {{courtyard}} formed by 5 structures on the west and south sides, while the other two sides are formed by the retaining walls of Patios A and C. The structures were residential buildings built upon low platforms, with the principal structure {{on the south side of}} the patio. A long, <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> on the west side supports two structures, labelled as Structures 1 and 2. Excavations of this platform recovered ceramic remains dating to the Late and Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 {{is another}} pyramid-temple {{base on the}} west side of Plaza C. It has a <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> at its southeastern corner, where 48 severed heads were {{excavated}} immediately to the west. Schele and Mathews have speculated that these may be the heads of the K'iche' kings Tepupul and Itzayul together with other members of the K'iche' court who were captured by the Kaqchikels and decapitated. Most of the skulls were found with associated obsidian blades. Most of the skulls had been individually buried in pits cut into the floor of the plaza, although a few were grouped into small lots.|$|E
5|$|The Pink Structure (Estructura Rosada in Spanish) {{was built}} as a <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> during {{the first part of}} the Middle Preclassic, at a time when the city was {{producing}} Olmec-style sculpture and La Venta was flourishing on the Gulf coast of Mexico (c.800–700 BC). During the latter part of the Middle Preclassic (c.700–400 BC), the Pink Structure was buried under the first version of the enormous Structure 7. It was at this time that the use of Olmec ceremonial structures was discontinued and Olmec sculpture was destroyed, signalling an intermediate period prior to the beginning of the city's Early Maya phase. The transition between the two phases was a gradual one, without abrupt changes.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologist William R. Coe {{divided the}} Mundo Perdido complex into two clearly demarcated areas that he {{referred}} to as the High Plaza and the Low Plaza. The High Plaza is the area around the Lost World Pyramid. It is closed on the south side by Structures 6C-24 and 6C-25. A range of eight adjoining structures divide the High Plaza from the Plaza of the Seven Temples to the east. On the north side, the Plaza is principally delimited by Structures 5D-77, 5C-45, 5C-46, together with some smaller structures. The Low Plaza lies {{to the west of the}} Lost World Pyramid, centred upon Structure 5C-53, a <b>low</b> <b>platform.</b> The Low Plaza is closed on its north side by the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49), which is the second largest structure in the whole complex.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 is {{an unusual}} {{combination}} of temple and palace. It is situated on the southeast side of Plaza 2. The structure consists of a central pyramidal base flanked by two attached range structures. The pyramidal base is topped by a shrine containing three rooms, the final room of the three is circular. The temple has three steep stairways flanked by balustrades. The main stairway ascends directly from the plaza, those on either side are perpendicular to the main stairway. The balustrade of each stairway terminates at the top in a vertical panel. The temple facade is in good condition although {{the roof of the}} temple is missing. The range structures are unequal in size and each contains a single long room atop a <b>low</b> <b>platform.</b> The facade of each of these rooms once possessed a row of columns although only stumps remain in situ. This temple-palace is K'iche' in style and has been identified with the Nija'ib' lineage of the K'iche', being very similar to the Temple of Awilix at Q'umarkaj. A tomb was excavated in Structure 4, it consisted of a complete skeleton with associated offerings that included two tripod earthenware bowls, one with duck effigies, a tripod incense burner, a flint knife, nine obsidian knives, five jade beads and some fragments of gold.|$|E
5|$|Wood Siding {{initially}} had no {{facilities for}} passengers, {{not even a}} platform. In 1894 a <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> and small corrugated iron waiting room were built for passengers. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a buffer stop for the siding, and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. While the original Aveling & Porter locomotive was slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before its arrival, later locomotives were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains. Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the new Chiltern Main Line. Wood Siding {{was removed from the}} timetable by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. While Wood Siding station was demolished shortly after closure, the abutments of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact. The porter's hut survives as a nearby garden shed.|$|E

25|$|The EMUs have {{doors on}} both sides of the train and {{therefore}} can easily be used in either direction. Even though the SKM line has stops with high platforms, the units can be used on <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> stations as well. The most common livery for SKM electric multiple units is yellow and blue. The exception are units with advertising labels, which are coloured according to the advertiser's wishes. The SKM company logo is placed {{on both sides}} of the unit, next to the doors.|$|E
500|$|Structure 5C-53 is a <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> {{situated}} [...] to {{the west}} of the Lost World Pyramid. The platform has access stairways on all four sides and has no sign of ever having supported any superstructure. Details of the sides of the platform suggest that its construction was influenced by Teotihuacan. The platform dates to the beginning of the Late Classic, around AD 600.|$|E

500|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of Temple 2 is a <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> that bore painted murals that had a skull with crossed longbones upon two bands of decoration. This platform may have been an itzompan or [...] "skull place", a Kaqchikel version of the Aztec tzompantli skull racks. Two skulls bearing evidence of decapitation were found in a cache to the southeast of Temple 2 together with some obsidian blades.|$|E
500|$|Terrace 1 Structure 7 is a <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> on {{the east}} side of Patio B. It {{measured}} [...] and stood [...] high.

Excavations of the platform uncovered material that was dated to the Late Preclassic, Late Classic and Terminal Classic. Structure 7 was the last to be built on Patio B, postdating the construction of Structures 6 and 8.|$|E
500|$|Burial PNT-004 was interred under a <b>low</b> <b>platform</b> {{associated}} with the third version of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54). It was deposited near the bedrock [...] under the platform without any funerary offerings. The remains are those of a young adult male between 21 and 35 years old who was laid on his right hand side in a flexed position with an east-west orientation, with the head lying to the west. The remains were {{associated with}} three pieces of worked stone that had traces of stucco and red paint. The burial has been dated to around 300 BC.|$|E
