40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The threespot damselfish, Stegastes planifrons, {{maintains}} individual territories {{that are}} clustered on coral patch reefs. My {{objective was to}} understand the effects of territory clustering on behavior and fitness. Fish with territories {{in the center of a}} cluster had (relative to edge fish) : higher mating success (number of eggs), higher aggressive chase rates with conspecifics, <b>lower</b> <b>chase</b> rates to heterospecifics, lower overall chase rates, lower grazing rates by intruders, and smaller territories. Feeding rate, survivorship, and age at maturity did not vary with territory position. Therefore, central fish appeared to have higher fitness, which was probably related to the lower energetic costs of territory defense there. Center and edge territories differed in habitat complexity, and the density of potential algal competitors, egg predators, and various food and invertebrate species. These microhabitat features could provide different quality shelter, nest or feeding sites and thus might explain the positional differences in fitness. An experiment in which I changed the position of treatment fish from the center to the edge of a cluster, without altering microhabitat, showed that position per Se, and not microhabitat variation, caused the center-edge differences. Vacated space in the center of a cluster was fought over more vigorously and reoccuppied sooner than similar space on the edge. Settlement to one of two depopulated clusters was preferentially to the cluster center. These data indicated that threespots compete for the more desirable central positions. Therefore, these populations can be considered simultaneously recruitment limited (in terms of local population size) and resource limited (in terms of local reproductive output and perhaps global population size). Aggressive chases with conspecifics were lower on the cluster edge than at any distance toward the center, while chases to heterospecifics had the opposite pattern. The results of chases with conspecifics did not fit the predictions of the model by Stamps et al. (1987). This discrepancy may be a result of habituation between territorial neighbors...|$|E
60|$|The {{captain was}} right. In {{tropical}} regions {{there is little}} or no twilight. Night succeeds day almost instantaneously. Before the boats were lowered, and the men embarked, it was becoming quite dark. The schooner observed the movement however, and, as she did not dare to venture through the reef in the dark, her boats were also <b>lowered</b> and the <b>chase</b> was recommenced.|$|R
5000|$|National Hunt {{horses that}} have the size and scope to jump higher than {{the height of a}} hurdle, use these types of races in order to gain {{experience}} of jumping obstacles so they can later be sent to jump bigger obstacles called fences. Hurdle races tend to be run at a faster pace than Chases as the height of the hurdle is much <b>lower</b> than a <b>chasing</b> fence. The best hurdlers have a low and efficient style of jumping, which means they do not lose much momentum when they jump.|$|R
25|$|In 1645 the Roundheads, {{now under}} the command of Major Phillip <b>Lower,</b> were <b>chased</b> off by a large {{contingent}} of Royalist cavalry, under Lord Goring. Goring's force however was not strong enough to hold the town and so withdrew, allowing Lower's troops to return. A few days later Goring returned with a larger force of some 1000 men. Lower now only had 200 men but had made efforts to bolster the town's defences and had pulled down some of the buildings to increase the field of fire from his guns. Despite this the Royalists were able to occupy the town, driving the defenders back into the castle and the church. As Goring lacked the large calibre weapons required to destroy the two structures, the attackers settled down to a siege. A few days later however, news reached Goring that Parliamentarian reinforcements were on their way from Lymington and having already suffered heavy losses, he made the decision to withdraw.|$|R
50|$|The {{river is}} in three sections, an upper part {{beginning}} at Joss Pass, {{at the northern}} end of the Sawtooth Range of the Monashees and emptying into Sugar Lake southeast of the south end of that range. The next section of the river curves south from Sugar Lake to wind up running north again before entering Mabel Lake, which is a fair-sized mountain lake as typical of much of Interior British Columbia (e.g. Shuswap and Adams Lakes elsewhere in the same season, the original Arrow Lakes and Kootenay Lake). Below Mabel Lake is the last stretch of the river west towards the town of Enderby {{at the north end of}} the Okanagan Corridor, after which the Shuswap River drains into Mara Lake. Mara Lake is connected via a channel named Sicamous Narrows to the Salmon Arm of Shuswap Lake at Sicamous which empties via the 3.5 km canal-like Little Shuswap River into Little Shuswap Lake. At that lake's <b>lower</b> end is <b>Chase</b> and the beginning of the South Thompson River.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed that}} {{somewhat}} {{late on the}} afternoon of the day previous, while three of the stranger's boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the blue water, not very far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat-- a reserved one--had been instantly <b>lowered</b> in <b>chase.</b> After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat--the swiftest keeled of all--seemed to have succeeded in fastening--at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats--ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction-- the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail--stunsail on stunsail-- after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.|$|R
5000|$|Operation Husky, the {{invasion}} of Sicily, involved some 1,400 other ships and over 1,800 landing craft putting ashore nearly one-half million men. In the early hours 10 July 1943 nearly eight reinforced divisions were to come ashore abreast on a broad front almost 150 miles wide. It was a daring plan to send so many men ashore in the initial landings; {{it had never been}} tried before and has not been done on this scale since, even at Normandy on D-Day in 1944. For the initial assault on Gela, the Samuel <b>Chase</b> <b>lowered</b> twenty-one boats of troops from the United States Seventh Army were. The first three waves came under fire but the [...] "Lucky Chase" [...] did not lose a man. This was attributed to the Coast Guard's ability to handle small boats {{and the fact that the}} landings were actually performed better than those made during the practices. While German planes buzzed overhead the amphibious craft brought supplies to the beach at a staggering rate. The heavy equipment bogged down on the beach due to the soft sand. Supplies began to pileup as more and more craft brought supplies to the beach. Aggravating this problem was the absence of the Army unloading details that were frequently called into action. Without the unloading details available the Coast Guard and Navy crews unloaded the craft themselves. Despite these hindrances, the men from Chase, for example, made over 250 trips to the beach to land the transport's cargo.|$|R
40|$|The post-stress oxygen {{consumption}} rate (VO 2) {{was investigated in}} southern catfish (47. 433. 92 g) after different acute stress. The stress treatment were chasing for 2. 5 min (CH), air exposure for 2. 5 min (AE), 12. 5 C coldwater bath for 2. 5 min (CB), 2. 5 min chasing plus 2. 5 min air exposure (CA) and chasing at 12. 5 C for 2. 5 min (CC), respectively. All water and air temperature was 25 C except that of coldwater bath group. VO 2 of all groups were increased immediately after stress (coldwater bath was increased a little slower) and slowly return to a pre-stress level. The VO 2 peak of CC group {{was significantly higher than}} those of all other groups (p 2 peak of CH group was significantly higher than that of CE group, while the latter was significantly higher than those of AE and CB groups (p 2 peak /VO 2 rest in both chasing groups (CH and CC) were significantly higher than those of other groups (p 2 response of southern catfish to chase was larger that air exposure and acute low-temperature stress, while air exposure and low-temperature stress might have little effects on VO 2 response; Compared to chase effect, added air exposure treatment after <b>chase</b> <b>lowered</b> the post-stress VO 2 response, while coldwater bath chase might elevated the post-stress VO 2 response and as a sit-and-wait forager with poor aerobic and anaerobic capacity, the stress response of southern catfish was relatively lower...|$|R
60|$|But {{perhaps there}} would be others she had known, whose lives had been {{interwoven}} with hers, she {{would be allowed to}} commune with in that same place. Edgar of a certainty would be there, although Glastonbury had built him a chapel and put him in a silver tomb and had begun to call him Saint Edgar. Would he find her and seek to have speech with her? It was anguish to her even to think of such an encounter. She would say, Do not come to me, for rather would I be alone in this dreadful solitude for a thousand years than have you, Edgar, for company. For I have not now one thought or memory of you in my soul that is not bitter. It is true that I once loved you: even before I saw your face I loved you, and said in my heart that we two were destined to be one. And my love increased when we were united, and you gave me my heart's desire--the power I loved, and glory in the sight of the world. And although in my heart I laughed at your pretended zeal for a pure religion while you were gratifying your <b>lower</b> desires and <b>chasing</b> after fair women all over the land, I admired and gloried in your nobler qualities, your activity and vigilance in keeping the peace within your borders, and in making England master of the seas, so that the pirate kings of the North ventured not to approach our shores. But on your own gross appetites you would put no restraint, but gave yourself up to wine and gluttony and made a companion of Death, even in the flower of your age you were playing with Death, and when you had lived but half your years you rode away with Death and left me alone; you, Edgar, the mighty hunter and slayer of wolves, you rode away and left me to the wolves, alone, in a dark forest. Therefore the guilt of Edward's death is yours more than mine, though my soul is stained red with his blood, seeing that you left me to fight alone, and in my madness, not knowing what I did, I stained myself with this crime.|$|R
40|$|A study {{comparing}} different {{alternatives for}} the Vacuum Vessel Primary Heat Transfer System has been completed. Three alternatives were proposed in a Project Change Request (PCR- 190) by relocating the heat exchangers (HXs) {{from the roof}} of the Tokamak building to inside the Vacuum Vessel Pressure Suppression System (VVPSS) tank. The study evaluated the three alternatives and recommended modifications to one of them to arrive at a preferred configuration that included relocating the HXs inside the Tokamak building but outside the VVPSS tank as well as including a small safety-rated pump and HX in parallel to the main circulation pump and HX. The Vacuum Vessel (VV) Primary Heat Transfer System (PHTS) removes heat generated in the VV during normal operation (10 MW, pulsed power) as well as the decay heat from the VV itself and from the structures/components attached to the VV (first wall, blanket, and divertor {approx} 0. 48 MW peak). Therefore, the VV PHTS has two safety functions: (1) contain contaminated cooling water (similar to the other PHTSs) and (2) provide passive cooling during an accident event. The 2004 design of the VV PHTS consists of two independent loops, each loop cooling half of the 18 VV segments with a nominal flow of 475 kg/s of water at about 1. 1 MPa and 100 C. The total flow for both loops is 950 kg/s. Both loops are required to remove the heat load during normal plasma operation. During accident conditions, only one loop is needed to remove by natural convection (no pump needed) the decay heat of the complete VV and attached components. The heat is transferred to heat exchanger (HXs) located on top of the roof, outside the Tokamak building. These HXs are air-to-water (A/W) HXs. Three alternatives have been proposed for this cooling system. For a detailed discussion of these alternatives, please refer to Project Change Request, PCR- 190 (Ref. 1). A brief introduction is given here. Alternative 1 includes only one main forced circulation loop with a small safety-rated pump in parallel with the main circulation pump. In addition, this alternative has two natural circulation safety loops. Both the safety and main loops supply water {{to the bottom of the}} VV with six branch lines and collect the heated water at the top of the vessel through six branches. The distribution headers are located in the <b>lower</b> pipe <b>chase</b> and the collection headers in the upper pipe chase. Each of these loops (one main and two emergency) has a HX mounted in the Vacuum Vessel Pressure Suppression System (VVPSS) tank. The main HX is cooled using either Component Cooling Water System (CCWS) or Chilled Water System (CHWS) water, and the emergency HXs are cooled by natural circulation of the VVPSS water. See Fig. 1 taken from PCR- 190. Alternative 2 is exactly the same as Alternative 1 except that there is only one emergency loop and one emergency HX. See Fig. 2 taken from PCR- 190. Alternative 3 also has one main forced circulation loop with a small safety-rated pump in parallel with the main circulation pump and one natural circulation safety loop. In this case, both the safety and main loops supply water to the top of the VV with three branch lines and collect the heated water at the top of the vessel through three branches. Here, the distribution header is located in the upper pipe chase as is the collection header. As before, each of these loops has a HX mounted in the VVPSS tank. The main HX is cooled using either CCWS or CHWS water, and the emergency HXs are cooled by natural circulation of the VVPSS water. See Fig. 3 taken from PCR- 190. The preferred configuration is developed by selecting specific attributes of the other configurations analyzed and the logic for selecting this configuration is discussed at the end of the document. It is a modification of Alternative 2 that eliminates the separate safety loop, but incorporates a small safety rated HX and pump in parallel with the main HX and pump. It uses 18 inlet and 18 outlet branches (as did the 2004 design) and locates the HXs outside of the VVPSS tank. Tables 1 and 2 examine alternatives to the 2004 VV heat transfer system design that were proposed in PCR- 190, as well as the preferred option...|$|R
