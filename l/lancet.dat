5|$|The {{particular}} {{character of}} this Early English interior {{is dependent on the}} proportions of the simple <b>lancet</b> arches. It is also dependent on the refinement of the architectural details, in particular the mouldings.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the stained}} glass windows at Kirkpatrick Chapel are {{approximately}} twenty <b>lancet</b> windows along the chapel's side aisles that were donated by graduating classes {{at the turn of}} the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (1890–1912). These windows depict their class year and phrases in Ancient Greek and Latin.|$|E

50|$|The nave {{is divided}} {{on either side}} into five arcades. They show the {{transition}} from Norman architecture to the Early English Style. The piers are Norman in character with foliated capitals from which spring pointed arches. The four clerestory windows {{on either side of}} the nave are examples of Early English <b>lancets,</b> whilst the two long <b>lancets</b> of the west wall are part of the nineteenth-century restoration.|$|R

5|$|Built between 1093 and 1537, Chester Cathedral {{includes}} {{a set of}} medieval choir stalls dating from 1380, with exquisite figurative carving. An unusual feature is the very large south transept. The Early English Lady Chapel is a harmonious composition in <b>Lancet</b> Gothic. It retains substantial monastic buildings including a large refectory.|$|E
5|$|During Cook's second voyage, Forster brought two Tahitian Dogs {{aboard the}} ship to take home to England. They were tested with arrow poison at Malakula by having their legs opened with a <b>lancet</b> and {{inserted}} with the substance; both dogs recovered, though one later died from eating poisonous fish. However, {{the fate of the}} other dog and their remains is unknown.|$|E
5|$|During this period, {{the style}} of the {{building}} was changed from heavy Romanesque into Early English Gothic. Although the base Norman columns were left alone, <b>lancet</b> pointed arches were placed over them in the triforium and some heavy columns were substituted with clustered pillars. The steeple was erected in 1221 and the cathedral was rededicated by Bishop Roger Niger in 1240.|$|E
50|$|The southern, {{entrance}} facade has {{an almost}} triangular facade {{due to the}} overhanging eaves of the steeply pitched roof and squat side walls. This elevation is dominated by a centrally located tripartite window comprising three <b>lancets</b> filled with stained glass and with stuccoed sills and heads and all embraced by a cream brick pointed arch. Flanking the principal window are smaller <b>lancets,</b> with similarly detailed heads and sills.|$|R
50|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that autotomy in P. raphigastra occurs {{as a result}} of the shape and size of their sting barbs. Stings resemble two sharp rods clasped together and tapered off in width closer to the end known as <b>lancets.</b> The external surface of the <b>lancets</b> possess large, well developed barbs through the length of the sting that are arranged in a helicoidal distribution. The inner passage between the two <b>lancets</b> is the canal through which venom travels as it exits the sting. In P. raphigastra, this otherwise smooth median margin contains a tooth-like structure and a semicircular incisure. It is proposed that these artifacts, along with the arrangement of the barbs, serve to impede the extraction of stings from the victim.|$|R

5|$|In 1890, Wallace gave {{evidence}} {{before a}} Royal Commission investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted {{to support his}} testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. The <b>Lancet</b> averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime, attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by The <b>Lancet,</b> which stated that it contained {{many of the same}} errors as his evidence given to the commission.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a study {{published}} in the <b>Lancet</b> reported that state laws only requiring background checks or permits for gun sales at gun shows were associated with higher rates of gun-related deaths. The same study also found that state laws that required background checks for all gun sales were strongly associated with lower rates of gun-related deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{data were}} {{published}} as {{a letter in}} The <b>Lancet</b> in October 1999, co-authored by Ewen. It reported {{significant differences in the}} thickness of the gut epithelium of rats fed genetically modified potatoes (compared to those fed the control diet), but no differences in growth or immune system function were suggested.|$|E
50|$|The chevet's {{principal}} window {{dates to}} 1923 and {{is dedicated to}} Sainte Nonne. The two <b>lancets</b> in {{the left side of}} the window recall the welcome given by the local people to Sainte Nonne and her son Divy shown here being baptised whilst the two <b>lancets</b> on the right side show the saint taking her son to a monastery where she is greeted by an abbot and two monks. See photograph of window above.|$|R
50|$|The {{crossing}} {{is made up}} of roll-moulded arches on clustered columns. The transepts are gabled, {{with two}} layers of three <b>lancets</b> below a rose window. The south transept's windows (the originals) are the most notable - the <b>lancets</b> have Christ in Majesty with ranks of saints, apostles and angels and earth below, whilst its rose window is by Archibald Nicholson and has a dove in the centre surrounded by musician angels and cherubim and seraphim.|$|R

5|$|The eastern face (to Ditchling Road) {{has eight}} bays and a {{carriage}} arch {{at the north}} end. The first four bays have trefoil-headed <b>lancet</b> windows, while the next four have simpler straight-headed windows. The carriage arch is segmental-headed. The first floor has eight dormers. On the west side, the roof is cross-gabled: the gables are parallel to, rather than perpendicular to, the ridge.|$|E
5|$|The large triple <b>lancet</b> to {{the nave}} west end was glazed {{at the expense}} of Dean Creighton at a cost of £140 in 1664. It was {{repaired}} in 1813, and the central light was largely replaced to a design by Archibald Keightley Nicholson between 1925 and 1931. The main north and south transept end windows by James Powell and Sons were erected in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed <b>lancet</b> window. On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are <b>lancet</b> windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a <b>lancet</b> window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E

25|$|During Scott’s 1860 additions, {{what is now}} {{the north}} aisle west window of four <b>lancets,</b> {{contemporary}} with the 13th-century geometrical nave west windows, was re-sited from the original north wall of the nave. The aisle also contains Scott’s run of four windows on its long north side, all of three <b>lancets</b> with cinquefoils—lobes formed by the overlapping of five circles—set in a rosette above within a pointed head, and at the east one window of two <b>lancets</b> with a quatrefoil rosette above. Above the aisle east and west windows are small glazed trefoil openings. Between the north wall windows, and at the aisle corners, are buttresses with steeply angled double steps to the eaves of the slate roof, with their socles, or base plinths, continuing around the faces of the aisle walls.|$|R
5|$|When {{traditional}} cutters are involved, non-sterile {{devices are}} likely to be used, including knives, razors, scissors, glass, sharpened rocks and fingernails. According to a nurse in Uganda, quoted in 2007 in The <b>Lancet,</b> a cutter would use one knife on up to 30 girls at a time.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Aylward, the vicar from 1847 to 1872 and {{overseer}} of {{the parish}} restructuring, is commemorated by a brass plaque on the south-west pillar of the tower, and by a Clayton and Bell window in the north-west chancel. Aylward's daughter Julia had died in 1862 aged 15 and is buried in the churchyard; her grave was planted with snowdrops at her mother's request, which still bloom each spring. Julia Aylward is also commemorated by a piece of Burlison and Grylls glass in the <b>lancet</b> window at {{the west end of}} the north aisle.|$|E
5|$|After rescue, Bågenholm was {{transported by}} {{helicopter}} to the Tromsø University Hospital, where {{a team of}} more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked in shifts for nine hours to save her life. Bågenholm woke up ten days after the accident, paralyzed from the neck down and subsequently spent two months recovering in an intensive care unit. Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury. Bågenholm's case has been discussed in the leading British medical journal The <b>Lancet,</b> and in medical textbooks.|$|E
50|$|St Michael's is {{constructed}} in Pwntan sandstone quarried locally at Tan-y-Groes, and has slate roofs. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave, a north aisle, a south porch, and a chancel. At the west end is a stepped single bellcote with a coped gable, and at the northwest is a small octagonal turret. The windows are all <b>lancets,</b> with a three-light east window and a two narrow <b>lancets</b> at {{the west end of}} the nave. On the gables are cross finials.|$|R
