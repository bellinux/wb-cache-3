40|$|This paper {{presents}} a global hydrodynamic stability analysis of flow fields in a backward facing step combustor, assuming weakly non parallel flow. The baseline experiments in a `long' combustor of length of 5. 0 m shows {{the presence of}} two combustion instability states characterized by coherent low and high amplitude acoustic pressure oscillations. The analysis is performed for Propane-air mixtures at three values of it phi = 0. 63, 0. 72 and 0. 85 which correspond to quiet, low amplitude and high amplitude instability states in the long combustor experiments. Base flow velocity and density fields for the hydrodynamic stability analysis are determined from time averaged PIV measurements made after {{the length of the}} duct downstream of the step has been shortened to eliminate acoustic pressure oscillations. The analysis shows that the shear layer mode is self-excited for the = 0. 72 case with an oscillation frequency close to that of the long combustor's fundamental acoustic mode. We show from an analysis of the weakly forced, variable density Navier-Stokes equations that self-excited hydrodynamic modes can be weakly receptive to forcing - suggesting that the low amplitude instability in the long combustor is due to semi-open <b>loop</b> <b>forcing</b> of heat release oscillations by the shear layer mode. At phi = 0. 85 the flow is hydrodynamically globally stable but locally convectively unstable. Spatial amplification of velocity disturbances by the convectively unstable flow causes high amplitude combustion instability in the long combustor case. These results show that combustion instability can be sustained by acoustic and hydrodynamic modes being either strongly coupled, resulting in fitlly closed <b>loop</b> <b>forcing,</b> or weakly coupled, resulting in semi-open <b>loop</b> <b>forcing</b> of the flame by a self-excited hydrodynamic mode...|$|R

If hydraulic actuator {{is driven by}} flow control servovalve, a force-based position control requires tuning of inner <b>loop</b> <b>force</b> controller and force or pressure sensor. An alternative for flow control servovalves are pressure servovalves which are seldom used in industrial applications. Advantage of this technology should be that tuning of inner force-control loop should be avoided and also more importantly addition of pressure and/or force feedback sensors should not required. Sensors are often the most likely component to fail while working in hazardous environments. Our aim is to compare three kinds of inner <b>loop</b> <b>force</b> controls. First, we use pressure servovalve in position control application without inner loop pressure or force sensors. In remaining two cases we use force control in the inner control loop with flow and pressure control servovalve. Three controller alternatives are compared {{and the results are}} discussed...|$|E

This paper presents a novel approach suggesting the use of a sigma-delta modulator with an order higher than the mechanical sensing element. This is achieved by a modified cascaded (or MASH) Σ∆M loop architecture. A model of the electromechanical MASH is presented and the quantisation noise analysis is derived.

40|$|A force {{reflecting}} hand controller {{based upon}} a six degree of freedom fully parallel mechanism, often termed a Stewart Platform, has been designed, constructed, and tested as an integrated system with a slave robot manipulator test bed. A force reflecting hand controller comprises a kinesthetic device capable of transmitting position and orientation commands to a slave robot manipulator while simultaneously representing the environmental interaction forces of the slave manipulator back to the operator through actuators driving the hand controller mechanism. The Stewart Platform was chosen as a novel approach to improve force reflecting teleoperation because of its inherently high ratio of load generation capability to system mass content and the correspondingly high dynamic bandwidth.

40|$|The {{transmission}} of stress through a marginally stable granular pile in two dimensions is exactly formulated {{in terms of}} a vector field of loop forces, and thence {{in terms of a}} single scalar potential. The <b>loop</b> <b>force</b> formulation leads to a local constitutive equation coupling the stress tensor to fluctuations in the local geometry. For a disordered pile of rough grains (even with simple orientational order) this means the stress tensor components are coupled in a frustrated manner, analogous to a spin glass. If the local geometry of the pile of rough grains has long range staggered order, frustration is avoided and a simple linear theory follows. Known exact lattice solutions for rough grains fall into this class. We show that a pile of smooth grains (lacking friction) can always be mapped into a pile of unfrustrated rough grains. Thus it appears that the problems of rough and smooth grains may be fundamentally distinct. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} force control in the {{fidelity}} of a low-force five degree-of-freedom (dof) haptic mechanism is investigated. Strict conditions that guarantee stability are presented. Our effort focuses on haptic devices, able to reproduce accurate low forces in a soft virtual environment, rather than large forces in stiff virtual environments. Open and closed loop controllers are applied to a haptic mechanism, which {{is a part of}} a training medical simulator for urological operations, and consists of a two-dof, five bar linkage and a three-dof spherical joint. The force control algorithm is described and discussed. Open and closed loop schemes are compared. Simulation and experimental results of the force control law applied to the five-dof mechanism are presented and discussed. It is shown that the use of closed <b>loop</b> <b>force</b> control law increases the haptic device fidelity and the realism of the simulation. It is also shown that in case of haptic devices used in soft virtual environments, issues like signal noise and device stiffness are more critical than maintaining system stability. I...|$|E
40|$|AbstractKnowledge of the {{mechanical}} properties of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is essential to understand the role of dsDNA looping in gene regulation and the mechanochemistry of molecular machines that operate on dsDNA. Here, we use a newly developed tool, force sensors with optical readout, to measure the forces inside short, strained loops composed of both dsDNA and single-stranded DNA. By varying {{the length of the}} loops and their proportion of dsDNA, it was possible to vary their internal forces from 1 pN to > 20 pN. Surprisingly, internal <b>loop</b> <b>forces</b> changed erratically as the amount of dsDNA was increased for a given loop length, with the effect most notable in the smallest loop (57 nucleotides). Monte Carlo simulations based on the helical wormlike chain model accurately predict internal forces when {{more than half of the}} loop is dsDNA but fail otherwise. Mismatches engineered into the double-stranded regions increased flexibility, suggesting that Watson-Crick basepaired dsDNA can withstand high compressive forces without recourse to multibase melts. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy further excluded transient melting (microsecond to millisecond duration) as a mechanism for relief of compressive forces in the tested dsDNAs. DNA <b>loops</b> with integrated <b>force</b> sensors may allow the comprehensive mapping of the elasticity of short dsDNAs as a function of both sequence and salt...|$|R

40|$|Embedding a micro-machined {{sensing element}} {{in a closed}} <b>loop,</b> <b>force</b> {{feedback}} system is a technique commonly used to realise high performance MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) sensors due to the advantages of better linearity, increased dynamic range and reduced parameter sensitivity.

40|$|We present two novel {{rehabilitation}} robots for stroke patients. For {{lower limb}} stroke rehabilitation, {{we present a}} novel self-aligning exoskeleton for the knee joint. The primal novelty of the design originates from its kinematic structure that allows translational movements of the knee joint on the sagittal plane along with the knee rotation. Automatically adjusting its joint axes, the exoskeleton enables a perfect match between human joint axes and the device axes. Thanks to this feature, the knee exoskeleton is not only capable of guaranteeing ergonomy and comfort throughout the therapy, but also extends the usable range of motion for the knee joint. Moreover, this adjustability feature significantly shortens the setup time required to attach the patient to the robot, allowing more effective time be spend on exercises instead of wasting it for adjustments. We have implemented an impedance-type concept of the knee exoskeleton, experimentally characterized its closed-loop performance and demonstrated ergonomy and useability of this device through human subject experiments. To administer table top exercises during upper limb stroke rehabilitation, we present a novel Mecanum-wheeled holonomic mobile rehabilitation robot for home therapy. The device can move/rotate independently on its unlimited planar workspace to provide assistance to patients. We have implemented two different concepts of holonomic mobile platform based on different actuation and sensing principles: an admittance-type mobile robot and a mobile platform with series elastic actuation.

40|$|Background Stroke {{survivors}} {{often have}} difficulties in manipulating objects with their affected hand. Thumb control {{plays an important}} role in object manipulation. Surface functional electrical stimulation (FES) can assist movement. We aim to control the 2 D thumb force by predicting the sum of individual muscle forces, described by a sigmoidal muscle recruitment curve and a single force direction. Methods Five able bodied subjects and five stroke subjects were strapped in a custom built setup. The forces perpendicular to the thumb in response to FES applied to three thumb muscles were measured. We evaluated the feasibility of using recruitment curve based force vector maps in predicting output forces. In addition, we developed a closed <b>loop</b> <b>force</b> controller. Load sharing between the three muscles was used to solve the redundancy problem having three actuators to control forces in two dimensions. The thumb force was controlled towards target forces of 0. 5 N and 1. 0 N in multiple directions within the individual’s thumb work space. Hereby, the possibilities to use these force vector maps and the load sharing approach in feed forward and feedback force control were explored. Results The force vector prediction of the obtained model had small RMS errors with respect to the actual measured force vectors (0. 22 ± 0. 17 N for the healthy subjects; 0. 17 ± 0. 13 N for the stroke subjects). The stroke subjects showed a limited work range due to limited force production of the individual muscles. Performance of feed forward control without feedback, was better in healthy subjects than in stroke subjects. However, when feedback control was added performances were similar between the two groups. Feedback force control lead, especially for the stroke subjects, to a reduction in stationary errors, which improved performance. Conclusions Thumb muscle responses to FES can be described by a single force direction and a sigmoidal recruitment curve. Force in desired direction can be generated through load sharing among redundant muscles. The force vector maps are subject specific and also suitable in feedforward and feedback control taking the individual’s available workspace into account. With feedback, more accurate control of muscle force can be achieved. Biomechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
