500|$|Between May 1972 and April 1973, Kemper {{embarked}} on a murder spree that started with two college students and ended with the murders {{of his mother and}} her best friend. He would pick up female students who were hitchhiking and take them to isolated areas where he would shoot, stab, smother or strangle them. He would then take their lifeless bodies back to his home where he would perform irrumatio on their severed heads, have sex with their corpses, and then dissect and dismember them. During this 11-month spree, he killed five women, including two college students, one high school student, his mother and his mother's best friend. Kemper has stated in interviews that he would often go hunting for victims after his mother's outbursts towards him, and that she would not introduce him to women attending the university she worked at. He recalled: [...] "She would say, 'You're just <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>father.</b> You don't deserve to get to know them'." [...] Psychiatrists, and Kemper himself, have espoused the belief that the young women were surrogates for his ultimate target, his mother, and that the humiliating acts he committed with his mother's corpse support this hypothesis.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, {{how would}} you <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> to know of this? It is her secret, and I shall keep it, unless you are so selfish as to {{continue}} the pursuit, and if so, I must have recourse to his authority.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{mother is}} a dear!" [...] she replied, and her voice was convincing--"and I <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>father.</b> He's very good looking. And the breakfast was--well it was like one of your stories--Do you always have steak and {{doughnuts}} for breakfast?" ...|$|E

"Why, yes, of Beauvais. <b>Like</b> Monsieur Manette, <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> {{the gentleman}} was of Beauvais. <b>Like</b> Monsieur Manette, <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> the gentleman was of repute in Paris.

6000|$|... 'No, no,' {{answered}} the provost--'I am only sorry for folks losing the tenderness of conscience which {{they used to}} have. I have a son breeding to the bar, Mr. Fairford; and, no doubt, considering my services and sufferings, I might have looked for some bit postie to him; but if the muckle tykes come in--I mean a' these Maxwells, and Johnstones, and great lairds, that the oaths used to keep out lang syne--the bits o' messan doggies, like my son, and maybe <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> son, Mr. Alan, will be sair put to the wall.' ...|$|R

50|$|According to {{an account}} written {{at the top}} of one of the manuscripts of the epistle, Duran and his friend David Bonet Bonjourno made up a plan to emigrate to Palestine in order to return to Judaism. The two friends set out on their journey, getting as far as Avignon, where they met up with another converso, Paul of Burgos (who had become a believing Christian priest, and had {{achieved}} the rank of Bishop). Paul disrupted their plan by persuading Bonjourno to become a true Christian, and Duran was forced to return to Catalonia. In response to these events, Duran wrote Be Not <b>Like</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Fathers.</b>|$|R

[...] "The {{promises}} {{which he}} has honestly made to me, are promises which I cannot depend on when my back is turned, and when Madame Pratolungo may be with him in my absence. Something under the surface is going on already! I don't like that mysterious letter, which is only to be shown to you on certain conditions. I don't <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> silence.

6000|$|... "Well, I {{am glad to}} {{tell you}} this at any rate," [...] he said. [...] "I always <b>liked</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> and I saw him off when he left England, and have written to him often since. I believe I was his only {{correspondent}} in this country, except his solicitors. He had a very adventurous and, I am afraid, not a very happy time. He never wrote cheerfully, and he mortgaged the greater part of his income. I don't blame him for anything he did. A man needs some responsibility, or some one dependent upon him to keep straight. To be frank with you, I don't think he did." ...|$|R
