5|$|Alexander Karelin {{was awarded}} for his {{recognition}} {{as the greatest}} wrestler of all time (from antiquity to the present day). He was a Greco-Roman wrestler in the Olympics, and in his career he won 887 bouts and lost only 2 times. His <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> controversial because commentators believe they were caused by trivial rule changes, not a bona fide athletic defeat.|$|E
50|$|Return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{related to}} both {{standing}} wave ratio (SWR) and reflection coefficient (Γ). Increasing return loss corresponds to lower SWR. Return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{a measure of how}} well devices or lines are matched. A match is good if the return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> high. A high return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> desirable and results in a lower insertion loss.|$|R

5|$|Casualties of {{the action}} were heavy on both sides. The British ships {{suffered}} 190 killed or wounded in the battle and a number lost afterwards in the fire aboard Corona. Captains Hoste and Hornby were both badly wounded and the entire British squadron {{was in need of}} urgent repair before resuming the campaign. In the French and Italian squadron the situation was even worse, although precise <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> not known. At least 150 had been killed aboard Favorite either in the action or the wreck, and the 200 survivors of her crew and passengers were all made prisoner. Bellona had suffered at least 70 casualties and Corona's losses were also severe. Among the ships that escaped less is known of their casualties, but all required repair and reinforcement before the campaign could resume. Total French and Italian <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> estimated at no less than 700. Losses among the officers of the combined squadron were especially high, with Commodore Dubourdieu and captains Meillerie and Duodo killed and Péridier seriously wounded.|$|E
5|$|I., II., and III./KG 55 {{were also}} in action. III./KG 55 bombed Heathrow Airport. Results are unknown and <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> unclear. KG 55 {{suffered}} heavy losses the previous day, so its operations seemed limited. On 12 August it lost 13 Heinkel He 111s and their crews. The next day, 14 August, they would lose their Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Alois Stoeckl.|$|E
5|$|Non-CCD winter losses {{as high as}} 50% have {{occurred}} in some years and regions (e.g., 2000–2001 in Pennsylvania).

5|$|The 4th Infantry Division did {{not meet}} all their D-Day {{objectives}} at Utah, partly because they had arrived {{too far to the}} south, but they landed 21,000 troops at the cost of only 197 casualties. Airborne troops arriving by parachute and glider numbered an additional 14,000 men, with 2,500 casualties. Around 700 men were lost in engineering units, 70th Tank Battalion, and LCTs and other vessels sunk by the enemy. German <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> unknown.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airborne Division {{suffered}} {{a total of}} 800 casualties between 5 June and 7 June, out of the 8,500 men deployed. German <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> estimated to be estimated 400 dead and a further 400 captured. In addition, fourteen tanks were lost during counterattacks around the Orne River and Caen canal bridges. Other losses include one gunboat on the Caen canal.|$|E
5|$|Allied <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> {{given at}} Evere as 32 fighters, 22 {{twin-engine}} aircraft and 13 four-engine aircraft destroyed, plus another nine single, six twin and one four-engine aircraft damaged. In total, II./JG 26 losses included 13 Fw 190s destroyed and two damaged. Nine of its pilots were missing; five {{were killed and}} four captured. III./JG 26 lost six Bf 109s and four pilots. Only {{one of them was}} captured, the remainder were killed. The amount of damage the Germans inflicted made up for the losses; the Evere strike was a success.|$|E

5|$|Casualties {{suffered}} in the action were relatively heavy on both sides. The British ships, with their reduced crews, suffered 61 men killed or wounded while the French lost over 50 on Pomone alone. There were no casualties on Persanne, and Paulines <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> unknown, although believed to be heavy given her battered condition. The French also lost the cargo aboard Persanne and Pomone, which amounted to 201 bronze and iron cannon, 220 iron wheels for gun carriages and numerous other military stores.|$|E
5|$|Category4 hurricanes tend {{to produce}} more {{extensive}} curtainwall failures, with some complete structural failure on small residences. Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile and manufactured homes are often flattened. Most trees, except for the heartiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. These storms cause extensive beach erosion, while terrain may be flooded far inland. Total and long-lived electrical and water <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> to be expected, possibly for many weeks.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the recent}} successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has {{remained}} controversial. Proponents {{argue that the}} zoos have not only aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small captive breeding group. Opponents of the captive breeding program argue that the <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats. In October 2015 Harapan, the last rhino in the Western Hemisphere, left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|I. and III./JG 4 were {{to strike}} Le Culot together. Taking off at 08:20 and heading northwest, they {{comprised}} {{a force of}} 35 Bf 109s (nine from III./JG 4). Two Ju 88G-1s of II./NJG 101 lead as pathfinders. Some of I./JG 4 attacked No. 125 Wing RAF Spitfires at Ophoven airfield. Spitfire <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> unclear. Two P-47s and a B-17 were destroyed. I./JG 4 reported two Bf 109s missing, one damaged and one destroyed. Just a hangar, one P-47 and several vehicles were claimed, and the anti-aircraft battery was silenced. The attack on the Spitfires at Ophoven and the mentioned B-17 and two P-47s {{are not included in}} the total. Another source suggests two Spitfires destroyed and 10 damaged at Ophoven.|$|E
5|$|It has a {{low rate}} of fruiting, with less than 1% of flowers {{developing}} into follicles, {{and more than half}} of the inflorescences failing to form any follicles at all. Seed survival rates are similarly low. More than half of a plant's seed crop may be lost to the larvae of moths and weevils, which burrow into the cobs to eat the seeds and pupate in the follicles; and further seed <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> caused by granivorous birds such as cockatoos, which break off the cobs to eat both the seeds and the insect larvae.|$|E
5|$|Of this list's 40 {{pitchers}}, Valerio de los Santos and Robert Dodd {{share the}} best win–loss record by winning percentage; each won one game while losing none. Duggleby's 90 wins and 99 <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> most {{among the members}} of this list, as are his 445 strikeouts. Dave Downs' 2.74 earned run average (ERA) in the only season of his career is the best mark in that category. Red Donahue is one of the ten Phillies pitchers who have thrown a no-hitter, accomplishing the feat on July 8, 1898.|$|E
50|$|Hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{classified}} as mild, moderate, severe or profound. Pure-tone audiometry for air conduction thresholds at 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz is traditionally used to classify {{the degree of}} hearing loss in each ear. Normal hearing thresholds {{are considered to be}} 25 dB sensitivity, though it has been proposed that this threshold is too high, and that 15 dB (about half as loud) is more typical. Mild hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> thresholds of 25-45 dB; moderate hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> thresholds of 45-65 dB; severe hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> thresholds of 65-85 dB; and profound hearing <b>loss</b> thresholds <b>are</b> greater than 85 dB.|$|R
50|$|Since it was expendable, DASH used {{off-the-shelf}} industrial electronics with no back-ups. The {{controls were}} multi-channel analog FM. Over 80% of operational aircraft <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> traced to single-point {{failures of the}} electronics. A total of 10% of the <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> from pilot errors, and only 10% of the <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> from engine or airframe failures.|$|R
5000|$|His only <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> to Otto Olson of Michigan (9-8), Ralph Everett (3-2 t.b.), and Rashad Evans of Michigan State (3-2). The fourth <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> a forfeit.|$|R
5|$|Prussian <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> more controversial: Frederick {{boasted of}} {{negligible}} casualties. In his thorough study of regimental histories, Bodart counted 169–170 Prussian dead (including seven officers), and 430 wounded (including Prince Henry, Seydlitz {{and two other}} generals, and 19 officers), or about 2.4% of the total Prussian force; these casualties amount to less than 10% of the engaged Prussian force. Other recent sources agree that the Prussians lost as few as 300 {{and as many as}} 500 among the wounded. In an assessment of surviving regimental records, modern sources place Prussian losses at even fewer than Bodart did: one colonel was killed, plus two other officers, and 67 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} into Pattle's claims {{has shown that}} at least 27 claimed victories can be directly linked to specific Italian and German losses, while only six claims are discounted as no Axis <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> recorded. Other research dedicated {{to the history of}} German bomber units, some of which took part in the air battles against Pattle's unit, have drawn {{attention to the fact that}} 97–98 percent of all German primary records belonging to the Luftwaffe have been lost either through Allied bombing or through Hermann Göring's order to destroy all records in the first week of May 1945. This makes any {{research into}} German losses difficult.|$|E
5|$|Rotating the map using {{a compass}} is {{essential}} for ensuring an army moves in the desired direction. The order of a moving unit will not be carried out until the unit has reached its destination or {{if they have been}} killed before arriving there. Each order carried out is announced through the game's command box, which is situated {{at the bottom of the}} screen. Actions such as battles and unit <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> also announced. In order to attack the enemy from a distance, the player is able to order a unit to commence shelling, which will neutralise an enemy unit if successful. The game features no sound.|$|E
