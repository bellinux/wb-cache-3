40|$|A {{detailed}} {{approach for}} {{the selection and}} design of seals for helicopter transmissions is presented. There are two major types of seals presently being used and they are <b>lip</b> type <b>seals</b> and mechanical type <b>seals.</b> <b>Lip</b> type <b>seals</b> can be divided in conventional <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> and hydrodynamic <b>lip</b> <b>seals.</b> Conventional <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> {{can be used for}} slow-speed, low-pressure, low-temperature <b>sealing.</b> Hydrodynamic <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> although they are as pressure and temperature limited as conventional <b>lip</b> <b>seals,</b> can operate at a higher speed.

In the project, the failure steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> is considered. This situation had threatened {{the safety of the}} whole steam turbine system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the failure cause of the steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> used in nuclear steam turbines. New high nickel steel alloy <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> was compared with the failed <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> The dimensions of macroscopic ring with clearly plastic deformation were measured using calipers. Surface morphology of ring was observed by optical microscopy through metallographic analysis. There is a lot of precipitation in the grain boundaries of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> along with smaller grain size than the new <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> To explore the composition of precipitation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were used. The results indicated that the concentration of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) was higher in the precipitation of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> At the same time, the hardness and elastic modulus of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> were reduced, measured by nanoindentation test. In-situ SEM tensile testing were used to record and analyze the generation of crack source and crack development under applied load. The reasons of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure can be answered because of these experimental results at both macroscopic and microscopic scales. The main reason of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure is a combination of long-term stress and elevated temperature during turbine operation. Complex work environment caused recrystallization and recovery, resulting in grain refinement and secondary phase precipitation. Further embodiment, recrystallization and recovery caused the elastic modulus and hardness of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> decrease. Moreover, a lot of secondary phase precipitates appeared at grain boundaries during use. The appearance of secondary phase precipitates become the weakest part of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> The applied load lead to <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure from the formation of microvoids to microvoids aggregated becoming microcracks until to the appearance of cracks at macroscopic scale.

40|$|Pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> {{intended}} to withstand flows better than do conventional pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> have been conceived. The concept applies, more specifically, to <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> used on some valve stems, pistons, and the like. A conventional pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> generally has a U-shaped cross section {{and consists of}} an elastomer or other suitable polymer with an embedded metal energizing spring (see Figure 1). The working fluid from the high-pressure side that one seeks to seal is allowed into the U-shaped cavity, so that the pressure pushes {{the sides of the}} <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> tighter against the gland and body sealing surfaces, thereby increasing the degree of sealing. Unfortunately, when the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> is exposed to flow of the working fluid, under some conditions, the flow grabs the lip of the U-shaped cross section and ejects or deforms the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> so that, thereafter, a proper seal is not obtained. Figure 2 depicts one of several alternative <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> according to the present concept. One element of the concept is to modify the U-shaped cross section from that of the corresponding conventional <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> to eliminate the exposed lip and prevent entry of the working fluid into the U-shaped cavity. Unlike in the conventional seal, pressurized fluid would not push the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> directly against the both gland and body sealing surfaces. Instead, the pressure would directly push the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> against a gland sealing surface only. In so doing, the pressure would squash the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> into a smaller volume bounded by the gland and body sealing surfaces, and would thereby indirectly press the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> more tightly against the body sealing surface. To enhance the desired squashing deformation, a spring having an approximately parallelogram cross section would be embedded in the modified U-shaped cavity. As the pressure pushed two corners of the approximate parallelogram closer together along the axis of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> the other two corners of the approximate parallelogram would be pushed farther apart along a radius of the ring, thereby causing the polymeric ring material to push radially harder against the body sealing surface. From the radially innermost corner of the approximate parallelogram, the spring material would extend radially, then axially into recesses in the seal gland. These extensions would help to restrain the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> against ejection. A seat retainer would hold the <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> in the gland and form a mechanical compression seal to prevent or at least reduce leakage of pressurized fluid into the cavity behind the seal. However, because there would likely be a little leakage, the cavity behind the seal should be vented to the low pressure side to prevent buildup of pressure in the cavity over time; otherwise, the built-up pressure could cause ejection of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> when the pressure on the high-pressure side was reduced. Polymeric seal-ring materials {{may not be able to}} withstand working conditions in applications that involve abrasive and/or hot working fluids. For such applications, all-metal <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> may be preferred.

Experimentally, {{it is well known that}} the microasperities on the shaft surface can significantly affect the performance of a <b>lip</b> <b>seal,</b> even though the shaft roughness, after run-in, is much smaller than the lip roughness.

Four models are included in this study: hydrodynamic analysis, elastohydrodynamic analysis for full film lubrication, mixed-EHL model for mixed lubrication with asperity contact, and transient dynamic mixed-EHL model for startup and shutdown processes. Those analyses allow the examination of some important seal characteristics, such as the load support sharing between hydrodynamic and contact pressure, contact and cavitation area ratio, reverse pumping rate, liftoff speed for tracing the liftoff process and average film thickness. The development of fluid, contact and cavitation areas as a result of the changing operation condition is also examined.

Trotz des hohen potenziellen Nutzens fÃ¼r Dichtungsanwender durch die VerfÃ¼gbarkeit von optimierten PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere fÃ¼r beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, gibt es kaum Fortschritte seitens der Dichtungshersteller.

The common {{solution}} for sealing shafts {{in mechanical engineering}} is the usage of radial shaft seals made of elastomers. However elastomers encounter load limits in many applications. Through the application of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) compounds as sealing material, the limitations of elastomers can be largely overcome. Therefore the usage of <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> made of PTFE compounds is becoming more common in sealing technology. In contrast to the elastomeric radial shaft <b>seals</b> PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> require special pumping structures to ensure their dynamic tightness. For applications with a fixed direction of shaft rotation PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with a spiral groove as pumping structure are established as state of the art. The spiral groove as pumping structure is only suitable for one direction of shaft rotation. For alternating directions of shaft rotation other pumping structures are used. Although functioning PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures for both directions of shaft rotation are already in existence, these {{are still in the}} research stage and there is potential for optimization. Despite the high potential benefit for users through the availability of optimized PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation, there is little progress by the seal manufacturers. The main reason for lack in progress is deficient knowledge about the functional mechanisms of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. Without knowing the exact functional mechanisms targeted optimization is hardly possible. Therefore optimization of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures requires high experimental effort and is accomplished by "trial and error". The aim of this thesis is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the dynamic functional mechanisms of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation. The focus of this thesis is the numerical investigation of the following topics. â¢ Analysis of the flow pattern and pressure distribution around pumping structures and in the sealing gap. This serves a better understanding of the processes in the region of the sealing gap. â¢ Investigation of various influences on the deflection and pumping ability of pumping structures. The objective is to identify the relevant parameters for the pumping ability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. â¢ Analysis of the pumping behaviour through the hydrodynamic sealing gap and through local elevations of the sealing gap. â¢ Exploration of the influences of the sealing gap geometry on the pumping ability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. â¢ Investigation of the effects of geometry variations in the transitional area between pumping structures and the continuously closes ring, which is necessary for static tightness. The geometry of this area is crucial for pressure build-up and thus indirectly for the pumping ability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. Through a better understanding of the above topics, the dynamic functional mechanisms of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures are described more accurately than before. This allows to identify especially effective measures to improve the pumping ability and thus the dynamic sealing reliability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures.

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 341 â 348 Objectives:â The {{association}} between exposure to acid mists and periodontal changes and oral mucosal lesions {{was measured using}} data from an Oral Health Promotion Program in a large metal plant. The role of sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, and oral health behavior in relation to these outcomes was also examined. Methods:â This is a cross-sectional study of 665 active male workers who volunteered {{to participate in the}} oral health program. A job exposure matrix was constructed with industrial hygienist scores and job titles to estimate years of exposure to acid mists. Oral health outcomes were identified during standardized dental examinations. Unconditional logistic regression models were utilized in the analysis. Results:â Duration of exposure to acid mists exposure was positively associated with oral mucosal lesions among workers without <b>lip</b> <b>sealing.</b> Only age, low salaries and oral hygiene-related variables were associated with periodontal changes, and estimates varied according to <b>lip</b> <b>sealing.</b> Conclusions:â Results suggest that long-term occupational exposure to acid mists is associated with oral mucosal lesions, and that absence of <b>lip</b> <b>sealing</b> may increase the intensity of exposure...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the exact mechanism(s) by which cytoskeletal structures are modulated during bone resorption. In this study, we have shown the possible role of different actin-binding and signaling proteins in the regulation of <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation. Our analyses have demonstrated a significant increase in cortactin and a corresponding decrease in L-plastin protein levels in osteoclasts subjected to bone resorption for 18 h in the presence of RANKL, M-CSF, and native bone particles. Time-dependent changes in the localization of L-plastin (in actin aggregates) and cortactin (in the <b>sealing</b> <b>ring)</b> suggest that these proteins may be involved in the initial and maturation phases of <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation, respectively. siRNA to cortactin inhibits this maturation process but not the formation of actin aggregates. Osteoclasts treated as above but with TNF-Î± demonstrated very similar effects as observed with RANKL. Osteoclasts treated with a neutralizing antibody to TNF-Î± displayed podosome-like structures in the entire subsurface and at the periphery of osteoclast. It is possible that TNF-Î± and RANKL-mediated signaling may play a role in the early phase of <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> configuration (i. e. either in the disassembly of podosomes or formation of actin aggregates). Furthermore, osteoclasts treated with alendronate or Î±v reduced the formation of the <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> but not actin aggregates. The present study demonstrates a novel mechanistic link between L-plastin and cortactin in <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation. These results suggest that actin aggregates formed by L-plastin independent of integrin signaling function as a core in assembling signaling molecules (integrin Î±vÎ² 3, Src, cortactin, etc.) involved in the maturation process...|$|R
