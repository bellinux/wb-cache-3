50|$|Thermal loads are induced in {{a curtain}} wall system because {{aluminum}} has {{a relatively high}} coefficient of thermal expansion. This means that over the span {{of a couple of}} floors, the curtain wall will expand and contract some distance, relative to its length and the temperature differential. This expansion and contraction is accounted for by cutting horizontal mullions slightly short and allowing a space between the horizontal and vertical mullions. In unitized curtain wall, a gap is left between units, which is sealed from air and water penetration by wiper gaskets. Vertically, anchors carrying wind load only (not dead load) are slotted to account for movement.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} <b>deflection</b> <b>load</b> {{characteristics}} of homogeneous and heterogeneous joints made by laser welding using {{various types of}} orthodontic wires. Materials and Methods: Four kinds of straight orthodontic rectangular wires (0. 017 inch × 0. 025 inch) were used: stainless-steel (SS), cobalt-chromium-nickel (Co-Cr-Ni), beta-titanium alloy (β-Ti), and nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti). Homogeneous and heterogeneous end-to-end joints (12 mm long each) were made by Nd:YAG laser welding. Two types of welding methods were used: two-point welding and four-point welding. Nonwelded wires were also used as a control. <b>Deflection</b> <b>load</b> (N) was measured by conducting the three-point bending test. The data (n  =  5) were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance/Tukey test (P <. 05). Results: The <b>deflection</b> <b>loads</b> for control wires measured were as follows: SS: 21. 7 ± 0. 8 N; Co-Cr-Ni: 20. 0 ± 0. 3 N; β-Ti: 13. 9 ± 1. 3 N; and Ni-Ti: 6. 6 ± 0. 4 N. All of the homogeneously welded specimens showed lower <b>deflection</b> <b>loads</b> compared to corresponding control wires and exhibited higher <b>deflection</b> <b>loads</b> compared to heterogeneously welded combinations. For homogeneous combinations, Co-Cr-Ni/Co-Cr-Ni showed a significantly (P <. 05) higher <b>deflection</b> <b>load</b> {{than those of the}} remaining homogeneously welded groups. In heterogeneous combinations, SS/Co-Cr-Ni and β-Ti/Ni-Ti showed higher <b>deflection</b> <b>loads</b> than those of the remaining heterogeneously welded combinations (significantly higher for SS/Co-Cr-Ni). Significance (P <. 01) was shown for the interaction between the two factors (materials combination and welding method). However, no significant difference in <b>deflection</b> <b>load</b> was found between four-point and two-point welding in each homogeneous or heterogeneous combination. Conclusion: Heterogeneously laser-welded SS/Co-Cr-Ni and β-Ti/Ni-Ti wires provide a <b>deflection</b> <b>load</b> that is comparable to that of homogeneously welded orthodontic wires...|$|R

This study evaluated the effect of electric spot welding on the <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> rate of stainless steel and chromium-cobalt orthodontic wires. Materials and Methods: In this experimental-laboratory study, <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> rate of 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch stainless steel and chromium cobalt wires were evaluated in five groups (n = 18) : group one: Stainless steel wires, group two: chromium-cobalt wires, group three: stainless steel wires welded to stainless steel wires, group four: Stainless steel wires welded to chromium-cobalt wires, group five: chromium-cobalt wire welded to chromium-cobalt wires. Afterward, the forces induced by the samples in 0. 5 mm, 1 mm, 1. 5 mm deflection were measured using a universal testing machine. Then mean force measured for each group was compared with other groups.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of fiber}} reinforced plastic (FRP) bars to reinforce concrete structures necessitates the need for either developing a new design code or adopt the current one {{to account for the}} engineering characteristics of FRP materials. This paper suggests some modifications to the currently used ACI model for computing flexural strength, service <b>load</b> <b>deflection,</b> and the minimum reinforcement needed to avoid rupturing of the tensile reinforcement so as to use them when reinforcement is provided by Glass FRP (GFRP) bars. Two series of tests were carried out to check the validity of the suggested modifications. The first series was used to check the validity of the modifications made into the flexural and service <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> models. The test results of the first series were also analyzed to develop two simple models for computing the service <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> for beams reinforced with GFRP bars. The second series was used to check the accuracy of the modification suggested into minimum reinforcement model. Test results of the first series indicate that the flexural capacity of the beams reinforced by GFRP bars can be accurately predicted using the ultimate design theory. They also show that the current ACI model for computing the service <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> underestimates the actual deflection of these beams. The two suggested models for service <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> accurately estimated the measured deflection under service load, and the simplest of the two pertains better predictions than those of the models available in the literature. Test results of the second series reveal that there is an excellent agreement between the predicted and recorded behavior of the test specimens, which suggests the validity of the proposed model for calculating the required minimum reinforcement for beams reinforced by GFRP bars...|$|E

40|$|Several major {{types of}} civil {{engineering}} structure including off-shore platforms and road and railway bridges are subjected to repeated loading. Earlier {{studies have indicated that}} such loading causes higher deflections in concrete structures than static loading. This thesis is devoted {{to the study of the}} deflection behaviour of reinforced and partially prestressed concrete box beams. In addition to presenting details and results of a comprehensive experimental programme, a simple and reliable procedure is proposed for the analysis of concrete beam deflections under repeated loading. Thirty reinforced and five partially prestressed concrete box beams (of 1 / 4 scale) were fabricated and each tested up to 105 repetitions of load. For each beam, the repeated loading range was kept constant with the lower and upper limits set at 30 percent and 50 percent of the yield load to simulate the dead load and service load respectively. For some beams 70 percent or 90 percent of the yield load was used as the upper limit, simulating overloading conditions. The deflections at both loading limits were measured immediately after 1, 10, 102, 103, 104 and 105 cycles of load. It was found that after the initial loading cycle the bending rigidity of the beams (hence the instantaneous deflection) was not affected by further repeated loading. The dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> on the other hand increased with increasing number of loading cycles although the rate of increase reduced rapidly as the number of cycles became larger. This amplification of dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> by repeated load can be seen as a parallel phenomenon to the time creep of concrete under sustained loads. Because large deflection can accumulate in a short time under repeated loads, the accumulated deflection is referred to herein as the 2 ̆ 7 intensive creep 2 ̆ 7 deflection. For some lightly reinforced beams the intensive creep deflection was as high as eight times the initial dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection.</b> The steel ratio, degree of prestressing and the maximum loading level are found to be the important factors influencing the deflection behaviour of concrete beams under repeated loading. A simple procedure is presented for the analysis of the total deflections of reinforced and prestressed concrete box beams under repeated loading. The total deflection is obtained by summing the instantaneous live <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> and the accumulated dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection.</b> The latter may be computed as the product of the initial dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> and the intensive creep factor. Following a comparative study, the most suitable method is chosen from 9 well-known procedures for the computation of initial dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection.</b> Based on the experimental data of the initial and accumulated dead load deflections an empirical formula for the intensive creep factor is derived using statistical means. Parallel to the logarithmic time-creep equation, the formula is considered to be more realistic than an alternative hyperbolic model. For computing the instantaneous live <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> of any loading cycle, a new equation for the effective moment of inertia is proposed. This equation is shown to be superior to the existing formulas. All equations recommended for use are simple and explicit. In light of the experimental data obtained herein and those by other researchers, comparisons are made with two other recently published methods. It is concluded that the proposed procedure is more versatile in that it accounts for more variables and allows for the predictions of instantaneous deflection and permanent set in addition to the total deflection. In most cases it also gives more accurate results...|$|E
