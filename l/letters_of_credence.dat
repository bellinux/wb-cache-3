5|$|The President of Croatia and the Government {{cooperate}} {{in the formulation}} and implementation of Croatia's foreign policy. This provision of the constitution is an occasional source of conflict {{between the president and}} the government. The president decides on the establishment of diplomatic missions and consular offices of the Republic of Croatia abroad, at the Government's proposal and with the countersignature of the prime minister. The president, following prior countersignature of the prime minister, appoints and recalls diplomatic representatives of the Republic of Croatia, at the proposal of the Government and upon receiving the opinion of an applicable committee of the parliament. The president receives <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> and letters of recall from foreign diplomatic representatives.|$|E
5|$|The presidential sash is a Croatian tricolour band, {{trimmed with}} gold and adorned with the {{coat of arms}} of Croatia, which is placed in a white field, with the tricolour at the front. The arms are bordered by oak {{branches}} {{on the left and}} olive branches on the right. The sash is worn diagonally, over the right shoulder, and is fastened using a square clasp trimmed with golden Croatian interlace. The sash is adorned with the arms used on the presidential standard, although without the ribbon used in the arms. The constitution specifies that the sash is worn on Statehood Day, during awards ceremonies, during the acceptance of <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> and in other ceremonial occasions. The presidential sash was not in use since 2000 inauguration of Stjepan Mesić.|$|E

25|$|Ireland in turn {{challenged}} the proclamation in the United Kingdom of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 as ' of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'. The Irish government refused to attend royal {{functions as a}} result; for example, Patrick Hillery declined on Government advice to attend the wedding of the Prince of Wales to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, {{to which he had}} been invited by Queen Elizabeth, just as Seán T. O'Kelly had declined on government advice to attend the 1953 Coronation Garden Party at the British Embassy in Dublin. Britain in turn insisted on referring to the President as 'President of the Republic of Ireland' or 'President of the Irish Republic'. <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credence</b> from Queen Elizabeth, on the British government's advice, appointing United Kingdom ambassadors to Ireland were not addressed to the 'President of Ireland' but to the President personally (for example: 'President Hillery').|$|E
25|$|Whilst Australia's {{reasons for}} the {{exchange}} of diplomatic missions were known, it was also understood that the Soviet government believed at first that the exchange would serve no great purpose, due to the minimal ties {{between the two countries}}, commercial or otherwise. Both countries acknowledged that if relations, particularly trade relations, were to become a reality that diplomatic relations would be required as a formality. Evatt began negotiations with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov in London in May 1942, and the 10 October 1942 agreement between the two countries to exchange diplomatic representatives was regarded in Australia as a diplomatic coup; given the Soviet Union's position as a great power in the Pacific region. The first diplomatic representatives were Andrey Vlasov for the Soviet Union, and William Slater for Australia. Between August and November/December 1942, Handley Page Hampdens of the 455th Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force were based near Murmansk in the Soviet North, where they were involved in protecting convoys bringing supplies to the Soviet Union against attacks by Nazi Germany. Slater opened the Australian Legation in Kuybyshev, the temporary seat of the Soviet government, on 2 January 1943, and moved to Moscow on 12 August 1943. Vlasov arrived in Canberra on 5 March 1943 to head the Soviet Legation, and presented his <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credence</b> to Governor-General Lord Gowrie on 10 March 1943 at Government House. The Soviet Legation in Canberra was upgraded to Embassy status on 12 July 1945 and the Australian Legation in Moscow was upgraded on 16 February 1948.|$|E

25|$|After Bolts {{returned}} from India in May 1781, {{he developed the}} idea for a voyage to the North West Coast of America to engage in the trade in sea otter furs to China and Japan. He apparently heard from John Reid, his agent at Canton (Guangzhou), of the success the crew of James Cook’s ships had had there in November 1779 in selling the sea otter pelts they had obtained for trinkets on the American coast in the course of Cook’s third expedition to the Pacific. Bolts's ship, the Kaunitz (not {{to be confused with the}} Proli group's vessel of the same name), arrived back at Leghorn (Livorno) from Canton with this news on 8 July 1781. Bolts afterwards wrote that he had the ambition of wishing to be the first to profit from this new branch of trade. At an audience in Vienna in May 1782, Bolts discussed his plan with Emperor Joseph II, for which he had bought a ship in England in November 1781. The ship was called the Cobenzell (or Cobenzl) in honour of the Vice-Chancellor of State, Count Philipp Cobenzl (Kobenzl), a patron of the Imperial Company. Bolts’s plan called for the ship to round Cape Horn, take on furs at Nootka, sell or trade them in China and Japan, and return by the Cape of Good Hope. He engaged four sailors who had served under Cook, including George Dixon, who subsequently commanded the Queen Charlotte on a voyage to the North West coast for the Etches Company of London, and Heinrich Zimmermann, who had written an account in German of Cook's final voyage. He bought a sloop, the Trieste, as a tender, and obtained <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> from the Emperor to various rulers at whose ports the ship would touch.|$|E

50|$|A <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> (lettres de créance) or {{credentials}} is {{the instrument}} {{by which a}} head of state exercises his or her power to appoint ("accredit") ambassadors and ministers to foreign countries.

2500|$|Unlike the Acts of Union 1707 with Scotland, the Acts of Union 1800 with Ireland did {{not provide}} for a {{separate}} Irish version of the royal arms. The crest of the Kingdom of Ireland (on a wreath Or and Azure, a tower triple-towered of the First, from the portal a hart springing Argent attired and unguled Or) has {{had little or no}} official use since the union. When the Irish Free State established its own seals in the 1930s, the [...] "Fob Seal" [...] used on <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> varied the British arms by having the harp in two quarters.|$|E
2500|$|However, in 1936, George VI {{had been}} {{declared}} [...] "King of Ireland" [...] and, under the External Relations Act {{of the same}} year, it was this king who represented the state in its foreign affairs. Treaties, therefore, were signed {{in the name of}} the King of Ireland, who also accredited ambassadors and received the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> of foreign diplomats. This role meant, in any case, that George VI was the Irish head of state in the eyes of foreign nations. The Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force in April 1949, proclaimed a republic and transferred the role of representing the state abroad from the monarch to the president. No change was made to the constitution.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936, {{before the}} {{enactment}} of the existing Constitution, George VI had been declared [...] "By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India" [...] and, under the External Relations Act of the same year, it was this King who formally represented the state in its foreign affairs. Treaties, for example, were signed {{in the name of the}} King, who also accredited ambassadors and received the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> of foreign diplomats. [...] Representing a state abroad is seen by many scholars as the key characteristic of a head of state.

2500|$|Since each realm has {{the same}} person as its monarch, the {{diplomatic}} practice of exchanging ambassadors with <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> and recall from one head of state to another is redundant. Diplomatic relations between the Commonwealth realms are thus at a cabinet level only and high commissioners are exchanged between realms (though all {{other countries in the}} Commonwealth of Nations also follow this same practice, but for traditional reasons). A high commissioner's full title will thus be High Commissioner for Her Majesty's Government in [...] For certain ceremonies, the order of precedence for the realms' high commissioners or national flags is set according to the chronological order of, first, when the country became a Dominion and then the date on which the country gained independence.|$|E
2500|$|Liberal Member of Parliament Eugène Marquis in 1945 tabled {{a motion}} in the House of Commons proposing that a change to the King's title be a subject of {{discussion}} at the next Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference; Marquis suggested that the title include each of the King's dominions, giving him the designation King of Canada. But, the motion did not pass {{and it was only}} in 1948 that form of address changed, when the Canadian parliament passed in 1947 its own Royal Style and Titles Act and an Order in Council was issued on 22 June the following year to remove the term Emperor of India from the sovereign's Canadian title. In 1949, it was suggested by Cabinet that the King's title be altered so that in Canada it would be George the Sixth, by the Grace of God, of Canada and the other nations of the British Commonwealth, King; but, again, nothing came of the proposal. At the time, Robert Gordon Robertson, then a member of the Cabinet Secretariat, opined that Canadians would not like the title King of Canada, as [...] "most Canadians... have not thought of themselves as citizens of either a republic or a monarchy." [...] Still, in 1950, when William Ferdinand Alphonse Turgeon was sent to Ireland as Canada's ambassador to that country, the Cabinet wished to have George VI referred to in the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credence</b> as King of Canada. The King's secretaries objected strongly, claiming the monarch had only one title in law and Turgeon's letters eventually used George's full legal title, which referred to him as sovereign of Great Britain [...] "and Ireland." ...|$|E
