Therap. 158 : 115 - 127, 1967. Physiologic studies were performed in unanesthetized dogs administered a lethal intravenous dose of amphetamine. Various parameters were serially measured includ-ing temperature, respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute volume, oxygen utilization, left yen-tricular pressure, right atrial pressure, aortic pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, periph-eral resistance, arterial pH, PO 2, pCO 2, serum electrolytes, lactic and pyruvic acid, serum transaminase, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen and complete blood count. A number of pathophysiologic mechanisms were observed, including a hypermetabolic state, hyperpy-rexia, <b>lactic</b> acidemia, <b>acidosis,</b> shock, tachycardia, intravascular hemolysis, anoxia and yen-tricular outflow obstruction. Postmortem studies demonstrated a generalized hemorrhagic phenomenon with a striking {{involvement of the}} subendocardium. Also present were neu-ronal ganglion cell degeneration and myocardial necrosis, as well as renal vascular, pulmo-nary and hepatic congestion. The pathologic and physiologic changes that occurred in these animals {{were similar to those}} described in animals dying from experimental hyperthermia. It is proposed that the lethal effect of amphetamine relates to the marked hypermetabolic state which is produced by toxic doses. The amphetamines are among the most widely used of all therapeutic agents. These drugs, which include amphetamine, metham-phetamine and dextroamphetamine, are used primarily as central stimulants and as ano-rectics. They also have been used in a variety of clinical circumstances, including alcohol-ism, epilepsy, paralysis agitans, enuresis, be-havior problems in children, narcolepsy and as barbiturate antagonists (Leake, 1958).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ingestion of Enterolobium contortisiliquum pods causes {{digestive}} disturbances, secondary hepatogenous photosensitization and {{abortions in}} ruminants. Pods {{were administered to}} sheep via a ruminal cannula to characterize acute poisoning. In Experiment 1, a single dose of 12 g/kg of body weight (BW) was administered to three sheep in one experiment. One sheep died, {{and the other two}} recovered after presenting clinical signs. In Experiment 2, 10 g/kg BW were administered daily to 15 sheep until the onset of clinical signs or for three consecutive days. Fourteen sheep showed mild to severe signs after the ingestion of 1 - 3 doses. Two sheep died, and the others recovered. Clinical signs in both experiments were diarrhea, anorexia, rumen atony, apathy, dehydration and tachypnea. The main macroscopic findings were an orange, frothy ruminal content witch contained pods fragments. The intestinal content was liquid. Detachment of the mucosa from the submucosa and ballooning degeneration of mucosal cells were observed histologically in the forestomachs. Evaluation of ruminal contents revealed acute <b>lactic</b> ruminal <b>acidosis</b> (ALRA). Bromatological analysis of E. contortisiliquum pods revealed 537. 8 g/kg DM (dry matter) of non-fibrous carbohydrates, which is sufficient to cause ALRA. Only one sheep in Experiment 2 had liver failure, characterized by jaundice, elevated serum activity of liver enzymes and histological lesions in liver biopsies. It is concluded that the administration of E. contortisiliquum pods in forage-fed sheep at doses of 10 g/kg BW or higher may cause ALRA. The induction of liver failure in one sheep suggests that liver damage may occur in those sheep that do not develop acidosis...|$|R
5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap {{is caused}} by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses there will be less ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, <b>lactic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding.

Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, <b>lactic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E

40|$|Survival {{and blood}} acid-base status were {{measured}} on freshwater turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii Gray) that were submerged at 3 °C in either aerated (high Oj) or N 2 -equilibrated (low O 2) water. Results from catheterized turtles, {{without access to}} air under these conditions, and from non-catheterized turtles which were either apnoeic (in high O 2 and low O 2 water) or in high O 2 water with access to air, are compared. Under the most adverse conditions (catheterized, submerged, low O 2), survival duration was 126 ± 14 (^T±s.

Apnoeic, high O 2 turtles generally survived longer and were in better condition despite a skin fungus condition that selectively affected these animals. Six of ten non-catheterized high Oa turtles were still alive after 189 days without breathing. All apnoeic turtles developed an acidosis which, except for a transient hypercapnia in low O 2 turtles, was a metabolic acidosis attributable to elevated <b>lactic</b> acid. <b>Acidosis</b> was most severe in low O 2 turtles in which peak plasma lactates exceeded 200 IBM.

40|$|International audienceWe used six ruminally {{cannulated}} Texel wethers {{to study}} the relative role of protozoa and lactate-metabolizing bacteria in ruminal fermentative patterns during an induced latent acidosis. The sheep were fed an alfalfa hay diet (H) and latent acidosis was induced, following a short transition period of one week, with a grain-rich acidotic diet (W, 60 % wheat + 40 % alfalfa hay). Ruminal pH, ruminal volatile fatty acids (VFA), lactate and NH 3 concentrations, protozoa and lactate-utilizing bacterial counts, the relative proportions of three main bacteria implicated in lactate metabolism (a lactate-producing species, Streptococcus bovis, and two lactate-utilizing species, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Megasphaera elsdenii) using specific 16 S-rRNA-targeting oligonucleotide probes, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity were determined for both diets. The pH parameters (mean, minimum, maximum, time and area under pH 6. 0 and 5. 5) measured with the W diet were indicative of a latent (i. e., subacute and maintained) acidosis. However, a butyric rather than <b>lactic</b> latent <b>acidosis</b> was observed in this study. Total ruminal lactate concentration remained at low levels with the acidotic diet (< 4 mmol*L- 1), but changes were observed in VFA composition, which was oriented towards butyrate {{at the expense of}} acetate (P < 0. 05), while propionate remained constant. In agreement with the low ruminal lactate concentration, no changes in the proportion of S. bovis 16 S-rRNA were observed. The lactate-metabolizing bacterial population also remained fairly constant in number, proportion and activity. The increase in butyrate concentration was accompanied by a proliferation of entodiniomorphs (P < 0. 01). These results suggest that the protozoa limited lactate accumulation and possibly also the decrease in pH during latent acidosis. Experiments with defaunated and faunated sheep could provide further evidence of the role of protozoa in the development of rumen latent acidosis...|$|R
40|$|Subacute ruminal {{acidosis}} (SARA) is a {{metabolic disease}} in dairy cattle that occurs during early and mid-lactation and {{has traditionally been}} characterized by low rumen pH, but lactic acid does not accumulate as in acute <b>lactic</b> acid <b>acidosis.</b> It is hypothesized that factors such as increased gut permeability, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and inflammatory responses may {{have a role in}} the etiology of SARA. However, {{little is known about the}} nature of the rumen microbiome during SARA. In this study, we analyzed the microbiome of 64 rumen samples taken from eight lactating Holstein dairy cattle using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (TRFLP) of 16 S rRNA genes and real-time PCR. We used rumen samples from two published experiments in which SARA had been induced with either grain or alfalfa pellets. The results of TRFLP analysis indicated that the most predominant shift during SARA was a decline in gram-negative Bacteroidetes organisms. However, the proportion of Bacteroidetes organisms was greater in alfalfa pellet-induced SARA than in mild or severe grain-induced SARA (35. 4 % versus 26. 0 % and 16. 6 %, respectively). This shift was also evident from the real-time PCR data for Prevotella albensis, Prevotella brevis, and Prevotella ruminicola, which are members of the Bacteroidetes. The real-time PCR data also indicated that severe grain-induced SARA was dominated by Streptococcus bovis and Escherichia coli, whereas mild grain-induced SARA was dominated by Megasphaera elsdenii and alfalfa pellet-induced SARA was dominated by P. albensis. Using discriminant analysis, the severity of SARA and degree of inflammation were highly correlated with the abundance of E. coli and not with lipopolysaccharide in the rumen. We thus suspect that E. coli may be a contributing factor in disease onset...|$|R

One {{of the most}} important treatments is the control of agitation due to the extreme possibility of injury to the person themselves or caregivers, benzodiazepines should be administered at first sign of this. Physical restraints are not recommended for agitation or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing isometric muscle contractions that are associated with severe <b>lactic</b> <b>acidosis</b> and hyperthermia. If physical restraints are necessary for severe agitation they must be rapidly replaced with pharmacological sedation. The agitation can cause a large amount of muscle breakdown.

5|$|Lactate uptake by {{the liver}} is diminished with {{metformin}} administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate <b>lactic</b> <b>acidosis</b> is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart.

Headache is the most common symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, <b>lactic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
40|$|Acidosis {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{important}} maladies afflicting cattle fed significant amounts of grain and has enormous economic impact for feedlots, dairies, and producers of seed stock. The highest incidence of acidosis occurs when animals are being transitioned from high-roughage diets to diets containing high levels of concentrates. When grain-based diets are consumed in excess, consumed too quickly, or fed without proper adaptation, digestive end products (organic acids) can accumulate within the rumen, resulting in <b>acidosis.</b> <b>Lactic</b> acid {{is one of the}} key organic compounds that accumulates under these conditions. Coupled with the animal’s limited ability to metabolize lactate, accumulation of lactic acid in the rumen lowers ruminal pH and subsequently depresses feed intake. One means of preventing acidosis is to directly populate the rumen with lactate-utilizing bacteria. Alternatively, exposure to low levels of lactate (i. e., levels insufficient to harm the animal) may stimulate development of a population of lactate-utilizing bacteria. The objective of our study was to determine if supplementing low-moisture blocks made of high fructose corn syrup could increase ruminal lactate concentrations and subsequently stimulate growth of lactate-metabolizing bacteria. If successful, this could prove useful for adapting forage-fed cattle to grain-based diets...|$|R
40|$|The aim is {{to study}} the {{possible}} impact of some derivatives of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), piracetam, picamilon and Krebs cycle intermediates - succinate (as sodium salt) on the pathobiochemical changes in the central nervous system, that occur under experimental playing of acute ischemic tissue damage of the cerebrum. Research methods: The {{study was conducted in}} 96 rats Wistar, who were on a standardized vivarium diet. Cerebral ischemia was caused by bond of the unilateral common carotid artery. All drugs were administered intraperitoneally once daily for 4 days after modeling of an acute cerebral ischemia after which animals were withdrawn from experiment. In the brain tissues concentrations of pyruvic, izocitric, dairy and apple acids were determined. The activity of antioxidant enzymes: catalase and superoxide dysmutaza. In addition, the brain tissues the contents of lipid peroxidation products were evaluated – diene conjugates and malonic dialdehyde. Level of brain energy production was judged by the content of the adenylic nucleotide and also phosphocreatine. The degree of destruction of the brain cells was assessed by activity of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase in the blood and brain fraction of the creatine phosphokinase. Research results: As a result of studies, on the 4 th day of ischemia a significant carbohydrate metabolism is detected, which is reflected in the sharp strengthening of anaerobic glycolysis and reduced activity of the Krebs cycle reactions, as evidenced by a significant increase in quantity of lactate and decrease in quantity of malate, isocitrate and pyruvate. A sharp strengthening of anaerobic glycolysis results in the accumulation of oxidized products and intermediates especially the latter product – <b>lactic</b> acid. Metabolic <b>acidosis</b> develops against the background of energy failure, which leads to activation of lipid peroxidation reactions. Courses appointment of the cyclic derivatives of GABA piracetam, especially Picamilon, resulted in significantly greater improvement in metabolic parameters compared with sodium succinate may to some extent explained by the higher bioavailability of these agents cells. The impact of these drugs on the nodal points of disturbed metabolism was almost equal and different in antioxidant activity. As to normalization of lipid peroxidation reactions Picamilon was most active. Conclusions: Thus, {{as a result of the}} research the following conclusions may be done. 1. Bilateral bond of the common carotid artery, accompanied by severe biochemical changes in the brain tissues, that is largely similar to clinical manifestations of acute ischemic stroke. 2. Course appointment of GABA derivatives in the acute period of ischemic lesions of the tissues in varyious degrees improves metabolic status of the ischemic brain and detect different degrees of manifestation of cerebral protective action. 3. The activity of various GABA derivatives in respect to the different links of pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is not the same, that leads to insufficient sustainable improvement of impaired metabolism when used alone, in the long run may be justification for finding effective combinations of cerebral protective means with different mechanism of action. 4.
