50|$|The {{two main}} {{techniques}} are stationary systems {{with an array}} of cameras capturing the facial expressions from multiple angles and using software such as the stereo mesh solver from OpenCV to create a 3D surface mesh, or to use <b>light</b> <b>arrays</b> as well to calculate the surface normals from the variance in brightness as the light source, camera position or both are changed. These techniques tend to be only limited in feature resolution by the camera resolution, apparent object size and number of cameras. If the users face is 50 percent of the working area of the camera and a camera has megapixel resolution, then sub millimeter facial motions can be detected by comparing frames. Recent work is focusing on increasing the frame rates and doing optical flow to allow the motions to be retargeted to other computer generated faces, rather than just making a 3D Mesh of the actor and their expressions.|$|E

40|$|Stage {{performances}} are recently made using interaction technologies between performers' body movements and images for stage design, and the interactions occur {{mainly on the}} stage. Conventionally, audiences basically see the same scenery from performances on the stage. However, interactions between stage and audiences are important for individualized experiences of audiences. We consequently realized an interactive performing art stage using audiences' eye movements. On performing art stages, audiences make eye movements at various times triggered by body actions of performers and spot lights. If <b>light</b> <b>arrays</b> are flickering fast enough during the eye movements, the audiences can perceive 2 D images due to afterimage on the retina.

The vision-based image database is generated as the given path representation in the teaching procedure. The algorithm of an online image positioning is performed for path following. Advanced sensory capability is employed to provide environment perception. A unique omni directional vision (omni-vision) system is used for localization and navigation. The omni directional vision involves an extremely wide-angle lens, which has the feature that a dynamic omni-vision image is processed in real time to respond the widest view during the movement.

40|$|The {{field of}} nanophotonics is finding myriad {{applications}} in telecommunications and information technology, microscopy, lighting, and sensing. There is general interest in highly confined and nanoscale optical modes {{for a number}} of these applications, with a particular interest in structures that confine electromagnetic fields and energy in volumes smaller than the free space wavelength. Plasmonics, the utilization of coupled photon- plasmon waves in systems with free electrons, in micro- and nanoscale geometric structures has attracted significant recent attention for these purposes. In this dissertation we explore surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) fields, on nanostructured metal-dielectric boundaries, at frequencies in the near-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. To couple to these SPP modes from free-space propagating <b>light,</b> <b>arrays</b> of nanoholes etched in metal films are employed. We then utilize a variety of experimental techniques that investigate the physics of SPPs in space, time, and frequency. Various physical phenomena, including enhanced transmission effects and resonantly excited and propagating surface electromagnetic modes, are observed, studied, and explained. We begin by discussing the basics of SPP excitation and modal propagation properties and present an analytical investigation of gain assisted propagation. We next investigate the spatial and spectral frequency dependent transmission through nanohole arrays. We present novel experimental and analytic results of polarization dependent Fano-type lineshape profiles present in enhanced transmission due to SPP excitation. We further present a method for excitation and direct imaging of SPPs from nanohole arrays and demonstrate coupling to a variety of modes with different in-plane propagating wavevector components. This method is extended to incorporate ultrashort laser pulse excitation and enables space-time imaging of ultrashort SPP fields, both in spatial amplitude and phase, with femtosecond time scale resolution. We ultimately describes the application of this work to the making of a highly parallelized sensor to measure chemical reactions at a surface by generating spatially resolved, reaction dependent, spatial and spectral frequency informatio...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{membrane}} capacitance and conductance are key {{pieces of}} intrinsic information {{correlated with the}} cellular dielectric parameters and morphology of the plasma membrane; these parameters {{have been used as}} electrophysiological biomarkers to characterize cellular phenotype and state, and they have many associated clinical applications. Here, we present our work on the non-invasive determination of cell membrane capacitance and conductance by an optically activated microfluidics chip. The model for determining the cell membrane capacitance and conductance was established by a single layer of the shellcore polarization model. Three-dimensional finite-element analyses of the positive and negative optically induced dielectrophoresis forces generated by the projected <b>light</b> <b>arrays</b> of spots were performed, thus providing a theoretical validation of the feasibility of this approach. Then, the crossover frequency spectra for four typical types of cells (Raji cells, MCF- 7 cells, HEK 293 cells, and K 562 cells) were experimentally investigated by using a micro-vision based motion-tracking technique. The different responses of these cells to the positive and negative ODEP forces were studied under four different liquid conductivities by automatic observation and tracking of the cellular trajectory and texture during the cells&# 39; translation. The cell membrane capacitance and conductance were determined from the curve-fitted spectra, which were 11. 1 +/- 0. 9 mF/m(2) and 782 +/- 32 S/m(2), respectively, for Raji cells, 11. 5 +/- 0. 8 mF/m(2) and 114 +/- 28 S/m(2) for MCF- 7 cells, 9. 0 +/- 0. 9 mF/m(2) and 187 +/- 22 S/m(2) for HEK 293 cells, and 10. 2 +/- 0. 7 mF/m(2) and 879 +/- 24 S/m(2) for K 562 cells. Furthermore, as an application of this technique, the membrane capacitances of MCF- 7 cells treated with four different concentrations of drugs were acquired. This technique introduces a determination of cell membrane capacitance and conductance that yields statistically significant data while allowing information from individual cells to be obtained in a non-invasive manner...|$|E
40|$|How {{does the}} brain {{transform}} the 2 -D <b>light</b> <b>arrays</b> in our eyes into a meaningful 3 -D description of surfaces around us? What assumptions does the visual system make {{about the world}} when information is incomplete? And how are these assumptions computationally expressed in this perceptual reconstruction process? These questions, {{and other aspects of}} binocular depth perception are analysed from a theoretical and computational perspective, as well as through empirical investigations. In paper one, the fundamentals of stereopsis are briefly reviewed, and the difficulties related with resolving the (stereo) correspondence problem are particularly discussed. A computational model of stereopsis is further proposed that seek (binocularly) matching left-right image regions, by finding the highest area-correlation, taken on a derivative of the original images, at three different scales. A number of simulations are presented and discussed. In the second paper, the computational difficulties that are related with the identification of object boundaries are addressed. A computational model is proposed that given contextual information selects image primitives that are (statistically) common along occluding edges, and connects such primitives into smooth contours. The selection is guided by a set of simple heuristics, which are based on findings that the response of cortical cells, which are tuned to a certain image primitive, can be modulated by information from outside their ?classical? receptive field. In paper three, the justification for using the uniqueness constraint, as an absolute constraint in stereo models, is questioned. A stereo algorithm is proposed that uses a relaxed form of this constraint, and allows multiple matches when a one-to-one correspondence does not exist between the left and right image primitives. The central mechanism in the model produce binocular matches that preserve the relative ordering of image primitives. Paper four describes an empirical study where sparse random-dot stereograms were used to investigate how depth is perceived in ambiguous image regions that lack explicit disparity information. The results of the study suggest that the binocular disparity content, as well as interocularly unpaired image elements, both affect interpolation of depth in stereoscopic displays...|$|E
