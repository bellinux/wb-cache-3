Les Chouans, a novel about royalist forces in Brittany, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles. He achieved a major success later the same year when he published La Physiologie du mariage, a treatise on the institution of marriage. Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and <b>La</b> <b>Mode.</b> He thus made connections in the publishing industry that later helped him to obtain reviews of his novels.|$|E

5|$|Ikumi's initial {{vision for}} Tokyo Mew Mew {{was a story}} called Tokyo Black Cat Girl that {{featured}} a cat-girl battling alien invaders. After the story was transitioned to a more upbeat story of five female superhumans, the character designs were redone to have a lighter, more colorful feel. The main series characters were praised for being a perfect fit for the overall story, {{as well as for}} their cute appearances. The characters introduced in a <b>la</b> <b>Mode</b> were also praised for their visual appearances, but criticized as being repeats of the original series.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Mews {{are led by}} {{the main}} character, Ichigo Momomiya, whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews: Minto Aizawa, Retasu Midorikawa, Bu-Ling Huang, and Zakuro Fujiwara. As the series progresses, Ichigo goes from having a crush on Masaya Aoyama to {{becoming}} his girlfriend while trying to hide her secret double life from him. The series antagonists include three aliens, Quiche, Pie, and Tart, and their leader, Deep Blue. Originally from Earth, the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental changes. They have returned to kill the humans, who they feel are destroying their planet, and reclaim the planet. In a <b>la</b> <b>Mode,</b> middle school student Berry Shirayuki is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and, {{in the absence of}} Ichigo, the temporary leader of the Mew Mews. A <b>la</b> <b>Mode</b> also introduces new set of antagonists, the Saint Rose Crusaders, a group of human teenagers with various psychic abilities with a desire to create their own utopia. Led by Duke, they make several attempts to kill Berry, eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews.|$|E
5|$|The Tokyo Mew Mew manga {{series was}} well {{received}} by English-speaking audiences. In March and April 2003, {{the first volume}} sold an estimated 1,597 and 1,746 copies respectively. This put the volume {{at the low end}} of the top 50 sales for each month. By 2004, with most of the series released, it became a mild success for licensor Tokyopop. It was ranked number 16 on the list of Manga Top 50 for the first quarter of 2004 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga, based on sales from both mainstream bookstores and comic book shops. Sales of the sixth and seventh volumes dropped slightly; however, both were among the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in March and May 2004. The first volume of Tokyo Mew Mew à <b>la</b> <b>Mode</b> debuted 63rd on the list of top 100 best-selling graphic novels of May 2005, with nearly double the sales figures of the last volume of the main series. On the Nielsen Bookscan charts, the volume debuted at rank 39 before quickly climbing to the 14th spot. The second volume of à <b>la</b> <b>Mode</b> saw similar success, debuting in the 69th slot before advancing to the 12th position, a result of the Mew Mew Power show appearing on 4Kids TV.|$|E

40|$|Time {{correlation}} {{functions of}} current fluctuations were calculated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations {{in order to}} investigate sound waves of high wavevectors in the glass-forming liquid Ca(NO 3) (2) center dot 4 H(2) O. Dispersion curves, omega(k), were obtained for longitudinal (LA) and transverse acoustic (TA) modes, and also for longitudinal optic (LO) <b>modes.</b> Spectra of <b>LA</b> <b>modes</b> calculated by MD simulations were modeled by a viscoelastic model within the memory function framework. The viscoelastic model is used to rationalize the change of slope taking place at k similar to 0. 3 angstrom(- 1) in the omega(k) curve of acoustic modes. For still larger wavevectors, mixing of acoustic and optic modes is observed. Partial time correlation functions of longitudinal mass currents were calculated separately for the ions and the water molecules. The wavevector dependence of excitation energies of the corresponding partial <b>LA</b> <b>modes</b> indicates the coexistence of a relatively stiff subsystem made of cations and anions, and a softer subsystem made of water molecules.

The anime adaptation received high ratings while airing in Japan, resulting in numerous marketing tie-ins.

It was licensed for regional release in several other countries instead of the original Japanese series.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the series, Ichigo has a crush on Masaya Aoyama. Although she {{believes}} that he is oblivious to her feelings, he later returns them and they begin dating. Midway through the series, Ichigo gains a mysterious protector, the Blue Knight. Throughout the series, Ichigo repeatedly rejects repeated advances by Quiche and although she can not accept his final declaration of love, she cries over his death and holds him as he dies. Ichigo dies after transferring her own life force into Masaya after Masaya kills himself and Deep Blue. She is subsequently revived by the last of the mew aqua which was housed within Masaya. Before Masaya goes off to study abroad in England {{at the end of the}} series, Ichigo participates in a mock wedding with Masaya. Tokyo Mew Mew a <b>La</b> <b>Mode</b> reveals that Ichigo lost all of her Mew Mew powers because of the Mew Aqua's influence and joined Masaya in England, but returned to Japan when her powers began to manifest again to aid in the battle against the Saint Rose Crusaders.|$|E

For their final attack, two Crusaders hypnotize the citizens of Tokyo and set them against the Mew Mews.

40|$|The {{recently}} discovered incommensurate phase of quartz {{close to the}} α-β transition has been investigated using Brillouin scattering. The frequency and the damping of the longitudinal (LA) and transverse (TA) acoustic modes propagating along the X, Y and Z directions have been measured {{as a function of}} the temperature in the range 845 K- 860 K with a temperature resolution better than 0. 02 K. The frequency of the TA modes is practically temperature independent but the damping of the TA mode propagating along the Y direction and polarized along the X direction shows an increase near the incommensurate transition point Ti. This anomalous damping which is not observed for TA modes propagating along the X axis, is interpreted as a consequence of the anisotropic coupling of the soft mode with TA modes which was invoked by Aslanyan and Levanyuk to explain the occurrence of the incommensurate phase. The temperature dependence of the <b>LA</b> <b>modes</b> is very strong and exhibits a change of slope at Ti. This temperature dependence can be attributed to third order anharmonic interactions between the <b>LA</b> <b>modes</b> and the soft mode...|$|R
