5|$|Aside from locally formed militia units, the {{military}} {{did not have}} a significant presence in the Moncton area until the beginning of the Second World War. In 1940, a large military supply base (later known as CFB Moncton) was constructed on a railway spur line north of downtown next to the CNR shops. This base served as the main supply depot for the large wartime military establishment in the Maritimes. In addition, two Commonwealth Air Training Plan bases were also built in the Moncton area during the war: No. 8 Service Flying Training School, RCAF, and No. 31 Personnel Depot, RAF. The RCAF also operated No. 5 Supply Depot in Moncton. A naval <b>listening</b> <b>station</b> was also constructed in Coverdale (Riverview) in 1941 to help in coordinating radar activities in the North Atlantic. Military flight training in the Moncton area terminated at the end of World War II and the naval <b>listening</b> <b>station</b> closed in 1971. CFB Moncton remained open to supply the maritime military establishment until just {{after the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E

25|$|Starting in November 1967, the ROC {{secretly}} {{operated a}} cargo transport detachment {{to assist the}} US and the ROV. It was based on existing formation of the 34th squadron of ROC Air force. The unit's strength included two cargo aircraft, seven flight officers and two mechanics, even though a higher number of military personnel was involved through rotation. It was tasked with air transportation, airdrop and electronic reconnaissance. Some 25 members of the unit were killed, among them 17 pilots and co-pilots, and three aircraft were lost. Other ROC involvement in Vietnam included a secret <b>listening</b> <b>station,</b> special reconnaissance and raiding squads, military advisers and civilian airline operations (which cost a further two aircraft due to Vietnamese individually operated AA missiles).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to general postwar growth, the Cold War resulted in further growth in both Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads. With the Pentagon already established in Arlington, {{the newly formed}} Central Intelligence Agency located its headquarters further afield at Langley (unrelated to the Air Force Base). In the early 1960s, the new Dulles International Airport was built, straddling the Fairfax County-Loudoun County border. Other sites in Northern Virginia included the <b>listening</b> <b>station</b> at Vint Hill. Due {{to the presence of}} the U.S. Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, in 1952 the Allied Command Atlantic of NATO was headquartered there, where it remained {{for the duration of the}} Cold War. Later in the 1950s and across the river, Newport News Shipbuilding would begin construction of the USS Enterprise—the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier—and the subsequent atomic carrier fleet.|$|E

Other locally enlisted men from Singapore were sent to the island for basic military training before being sent to other units of the British Army in Singapore. Ten years later, the 1st SRRA was disbanded and its guns dismantled. The coast artillery was replaced with Gurkha infantry units, first the 2/7th Duke of Edinburgh's own Gurkha Rifles and later the 2/10th Princess Mary's own Gurkha Rifles. Fort Siloso and Mount Imbiah became a religious retreat and a Protestant church house respectively. Fort Connaught was left in ruins.

2500|$|Bornholm, {{as a part}} of Denmark, was {{captured}} by Germany on 10 April 1940, and served as a lookout post and <b>listening</b> <b>station</b> during the war, as it w{{as a part of}} the Eastern Front. The island's perfect central position in the Baltic Sea meant that it was an important [...] "natural fortress" [...] between Germany and Sweden, effectively keeping submarines and destroyers away from Nazi-occupied waters. Several concrete coastal installations were built during the war, and several coastal batteries had tremendous range. However, none of them were ever used, and only a single test shot was fired during the occupation. These remnants of Nazi rule have since fallen into disrepair and are mostly regarded today as historical curiosities. Many tourists visit the ruins each year, however, providing supplemental income to the tourist industry.|$|E
2500|$|Although Craven {{received}} much credit for locating {{the wreckage of}} Scorpion, Gordon Hamilton, an acoustics expert who pioneered the use of hydroacoustics to pinpoint Polaris missile splashdown locations, was instrumental in defining a compact [...] "search box" [...] wherein the wreck was ultimately found. Hamilton had established a <b>listening</b> <b>station</b> in the Canary Islands that obtained a clear signal of what some scientists believe was {{the noise of the}} vessel's pressure hull imploding as she passed crush depth. A Naval Research Laboratory scientist named Chester [...] "Buck" [...] Buchanan, using a towed camera sled of his own design aboard Mizar, finally located Scorpion. The towed camera sled, which was fabricated by J. L. [...] "Jac" [...] Hamm of Naval Research Laboratory's Engineering Services Division, is housed in the National Museum of the United States Navy.

2500|$|The {{west side}} of the village was {{attacked}} by the 20th Brigade, which had to fight forward for most of the day. The infantry pushed on to ground facing Mametz Wood and the Willow Stream, outflanking Fricourt to the north though the objectives further beyond Mametz were not reached. Much of the front of the 7th Division was opposite Reserve Infantry Regiment 109, of the 28th Reserve Division, which should have been relieved on the night of 30 June and which received a warning of the attack from a <b>listening</b> <b>station</b> at La Boisselle. Most of the regiment was caught in their deep shelters, under the front trench and cut off from telephone communication. Most of the supporting machine-guns and artillery were put out of action early on. Reinforcements were sent to the second position but not ordered to counter-attack due to uncertainty about the situation at Montauban and the need to secure Mametz Wood. The 7th Division suffered [...] during the day.|$|E

2500|$|In 1963 Innes was one for two RAF {{officers}} {{appointed to}} supervise {{the creation of the}} RAF Security Directorate to review internal security. This followed a high-profile inquiry headed by Lord Denning into the Portland Spy Ring, which resulted in the conviction of [...] five people who had been spying within the Royal Navy for the Soviets. On 1 January 1966 Innes was promoted squadron leader. [...] In February 1968 MI5 received a tip that an RAF serviceman was offering information to the Soviet GRU intelligence service and after initial case work was completed, in July the RAF became involved. As head of RAF counterintelligence, Innes led the hunt and identified Chief Technician Douglas Britten (born 31 October 1931, died Feb 1990), an RAF signals intelligence specialist serving at No. 399 Signals Unit at RAF Digby and also at a <b>listening</b> <b>station</b> in Cyprus which cooperated with Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Innes’s team arrested Britten on 13 September 1968. Searches of Britten’s home and other locations yielded spying equipment including some supplied by the Soviet Intelligence Service.

[...] The article claims that an American NSA employee, former naval pilot Commander Charles Southall, working at the NSA <b>listening</b> <b>station</b> in Cyprus in 1961 shortly after midnight {{on the night of}} the crash, heard an intercept of a pilot's commentary in the air over Ndola – 3,000 miles away.

[...] Based on aircraft registration and availability with the Katangese Air Force, registration KAT-93, a Fouga CM.170 Magister would be the most likely aircraft used and the website http://www.belgian-wings.be/ claims that van Risseghem piloted the Magisters for the KAF in 1961.|$|E
2500|$|The pincer {{movement}} by the 22nd Brigade to envelop Fricourt had failed {{but the main}} attack on Mametz succeeded, despite a warning of the attack received by a <b>listening</b> <b>station,</b> which had eaves-dropped a British message at La Boisselle.

In 2005, Prior and Wilson wrote that the attack by the 7th Division was a success, having been greatly assisted in the crossing of no man's land by a creeping barrage and that the attacking battalions were [...] from the German front line at zero hour. The creeping barrage lost effect as it moved faster than the infantry after which German counter-fire caused an increasing number of casualties but not enough to stop the attack. A failure to engage in counter-battery fire by XV Corps, was redeemed by the emphasis on it by the XIII Corps artillery to the south and the French guns of XX Corps, which [...] "wiped out" [...] the German artillery near Fricourt. The density of the destructive bombardment was much greater than elsewhere and a lack of deep dugouts, led to most of the defenders congregating in dugouts under the front trench, which reduced the capacity of the surviving German infantry to withstand the attack.|$|E
