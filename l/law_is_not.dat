5|$|Under Article 15(4) of the Constitution, a person's {{freedom of}} {{religion}} can be restricted by a general law relating to public order, public health or morality. The term general <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> defined in the Constitution, but may refer to a law that applies to all persons or places belonging to a particular class.|$|E
5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E

5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Representative {{democracy}} {{began in}} the 1940s {{when the number of}} elected seats in the legislature gradually increased, until a fully elected Legislative Assembly of Singapore was established in 1958. At present, Singapore legislation establishes various mechanisms that fulfil the doctrine of representative democracy. Parliamentary elections in Singapore are required to be held regularly to elect the Parliament through universal suffrage. Although the right to vote in Singapore <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> expressly mentioned in the Constitution, the Government has affirmed that the right may be implied into the constitutional text.|$|E
5|$|Romania {{has a large}} {{population}} of wolves, numbering 2,500 animals. The wolf has been a protected animal in Romania since 1996, although the <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enforced. The number of wolves in Albania and Macedonia is largely unknown, despite the importance the two countries have in linking wolf populations from Greece to those of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Although protected, sometimes wolves are still illegally killed in Greece, and their future is uncertain. Wolf numbers have declined in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1986, while the species is fully protected in neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia.|$|E

5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E

25|$|In nations where Islamic <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{the basis}} of law (as {{is the case in}} various Asian and African countries), {{different}} mujtahids can issue contradictory fatāwā. In such cases, Muslims would typically honour the fatwā deriving from the leadership of their religious tradition. For example, Sunni Muslims would favor a Sunni fatwā whereas Shiites would follow a Shi'a one.|$|E

25|$|Some {{amendments}} to the bill, not present in the original version, would potentially require manufacturers to share their proprietary digital music formats with other software developers (by way {{of the need to}} provide the documentation necessary for interoperability). Because of this, a controversy arose with Apple Computer and associated US industry groups, who loudly protested in the US press; therefore, the DADVSI bill was sometimes referred to as the iTunes law or iPod law in the English-language press (see Interoperability and Apple controversy), although the <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> referred to in this way in France.|$|E

Lydia arrived penniless in Seattle to testify on Maynard's behalf; he and Catherine let her stay in their mansion on friendly terms. As Bill Speidel has written, Maynard was seen strolling around town, the only man in Seattle with a wife on either arm.|$|E
25|$|Certain civil {{matters of}} {{jurisdiction}} for Muslims such as marriage, inheritance and waqf properties {{are governed by}} the Muslim Personal Law, which was developed during British rule and subsequently became part of independent India with some amendments. Lack of knowledge especially by some western writers tend to conflate Indian Muslim Personal Law with Sharia Law. Indian Muslims have rejected for any calls of sharia law in India. Indian Muslim personal <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> developed as a Sharia Law but as an interpretation of existing Muslim laws as part of Common Law. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that Sharia or Muslim law holds precedence for Muslims over Indian civil law in such matters.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} custom {{to become a}} source of law, it must be {{approved}} by the competent legislator. Custom in canon <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> simply created by the people through their constant performance of a certain act, but it is the constant performance of a certain act, with the intention of making a custom, which is approved by the competent legislator, thereby acquiring the force of law. This is because of the Catholic ecclesiological teaching on the constitution of the Catholic Church, which states that Christ constituted the Church by divine delegation of power to the hierarchical authorities; the Church was not created by the consent of the governed, but by the direct will of Christ.|$|E
