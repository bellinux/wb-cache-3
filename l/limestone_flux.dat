50|$|Plants for the {{production}} of lead are generally referred to as lead smelters. Primary lead production begins with sintering. Concentrated lead ore is fed into a sintering machine with iron, silica, <b>limestone</b> <b>fluxes,</b> coke, soda ash, pyrite, zinc, caustics or pollution control particulates. Smelting uses suitable reducing substances that will combine with those oxidizing elements to free the metal. Reduction is the final, high-temperature step in smelting. It is here that the oxide becomes the elemental metal. A reducing environment (often provided by carbon monoxide in an air-starved furnace) pulls the final oxygen atoms from the raw metal.|$|R

Despite their importance in controlling the quality of iron ore sinter, the stability range and mechanisms of 'SFCA' formation from precursor phases are not well understood. CSIRO has attempted to improve understanding of phase relations within iron ore sinter by; a) conducting experimental phase equilibria studies within the Fe 2 O 3 -CaO-SiO 2 (FCS) and Fe 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO-SiO 2 (FACS) model sinter systems to establish the key thermal and compositional parameters that influence the bonding phase chemistry and stability, and, b) conducting in situ X-ray diffraction experiments to determine the formation mechanisms of SFCA and SFCA-I under simulated sintering conditions.

Though it is normal to think of steel works in connection with extensive, flat sites and the proximity of coal, here iron-working began before the use of coal for the purpose was practical. The forest was needed to provide charcoal. The river in its steep bed provided power. There was plenty of <b>limestone</b> for smelting <b>flux</b> and some ferruginous limestone, though how useful that will have been as ore is not clear. (Compare Red Mountain, Birmingham, Alabama).

40|$|In modern ironmaking, {{granulation}} is {{the first}} step of the sintering process. It is typically carried out in continuous drum granulators using water as a binder, and involves multiple components besides iron ores, such as return fines and other recycled materials (dusts, mill scale, sludges), solid fuel (coke breeze or anthracite) and <b>fluxes</b> (<b>limestone,</b> lime, olivine, dunite or dolomite) (Ball, 1973). As it is necessary to maintain a consistent quality of the granules (size distribution, porosity, strength, etc.) despite of the varying iron ore origins, the question arises as to how the properties of the iron ore particles (size and shape) influence the granulation process. The granulation process is partly influenced by the characteristic of the feed and partly by the action of cohesive force inside the drum granulator (Newitt et al. 1958). The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the effect of raw material properties on the kinetics of iron ore granulation considering in particular the mechanisms ruling wet granulation for two iron ores and to know the factors which determine the texture, shape, porosity and mechanical strength of the granules...|$|R
5000|$|To process taconite, the ore {{is ground}} into a fine powder, the {{magnetite}} {{is separated from}} the gangue by strong magnets, and the powdered iron concentrate is combined with a binder such as bentonite clay and <b>limestone</b> as a <b>flux.</b> As a last step, it is rolled into pellets about one centimeter in diameter that contain approximately 65% iron. The pellets are fired {{at a very high}} temperatures to harden them and make them durable. This is to ensure that the blast furnace charge remains porous enough to allow heated gas to pass through and react with the pelletized ore. Firing the pellet oxidizes the magnetite (Fe3O4) to hematite (Fe2O3), an exothermic reaction that reduces the cost of pelletizing the concentrate. E. W. Davis of the University of Minnesota Mines Experiment Station is credited with developing the pelletizing process. Since the commercial development of this process in the Lake Superior region in the 1950s, the term [...] "taconite" [...] has been used globally to refer to iron ores amenable to upgrading by similar processes.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines is {{investigating}} ways of enhancing the high-temperature softening-melting (HTSM) properties of domestic taconite pellets. These properties, which {{are important for}} determining the performance of pellets in blast furnaces, include pellet bed contraction, pressure drop, S-value (area under the pressure-temperature curve), and softening and metal-slag drainout temperatures. Experiments showed that HTSM properties {{were related to the}} physiochemical properties (fired strengths and reducibilities) of pellets containing different levels of <b>limestone</b> and dolomite <b>flux.</b> Flux additions resulted in slightly lower green and fired pellet strengths, but improved metallurgical properties, such as reducibility. The influence of reduction conditions on HTSM properties was evaluated by varying the pellet metallization starting temperature and the carbon monoxide content of the CO-N 2 gas mixture. HTSM property change was more sensitive to flux addition levels when metallization was initiated at 1, 10020 C with 20 pct CO in the gas stream. The S-value and the metal-slag drainout temperature were found to be the best criteria for characterizing HTSM properties. The optimum flux addition level was about 8 pct (4 pct dolomite, 4 pct limestone) or a basicity of about 1. At higher flux levels, a higher metal-slag drainout temperature was obtained...|$|R
40|$|Spark Milling (Electrical Discharge Assisted Mechanical Milling) utilises a novel {{chemical}} reactor {{which combines}} {{the features of}} mechanical milling and transferred-arc plasma processing. This combination of techniques has shown great promise in inducement of chemical reactions whilst simultaneously controlling powder morphology. During synthesis reactions, orders of magnitude increases in reaction rates are experienced compared to mechanical milling {{in the absence of}} a plasma arc. Recent work has extended the application of Spark Milling to the inducement of reduction reactions in a commercial grade mineral concentrate. This has identified the need to undertake further experimentation. Firstly, to assess the possibility of inducing other minerals processing reactions that might have commercial value and secondly to characterise the effect that variation of physical and electrical set points on the Spark Mill has on the processing conditions within the reactor. The two groups of materials selected for this study are basic Steelmaking fluxes (carbonate minerals) and metallurgical coke. This research demonstrates the ability of Spark Milling to induce calcination of the raw Steelmaking <b>fluxes</b> <b>limestone</b> and dolomite as well as the ability of Spark Milling to induce graphitisation of metallurgical coke. Phase changes which occur during these reactions are identified using XRD (X-ray Diffraction) and selected microstructures are also characterised by using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). In addition, the average crystal plane height of coke processed by this method is calculated for coke samples Spark Milled over a range of set points and subsequently used to quantify the impact of these set points and to show that the temperatures experienced during Spark Milling can be greater than 1873 K (1600 ÂºC). This thesis report provides an overview of previous Spark Milling work as well as modern methods of calcination of raw Steelmaking fluxes. An explanation of the mechanism of coke graphitisation is also provided. Following this, the experimental method and results from laboratory work are presented. These results are analysed and discussed with a view to understanding their mechanisms, relevance and limitations with regard to the use of Spark Milling in industry as a bulk minerals processing reactor...|$|R
