2500|$|The Flat-Coated Retriever is an active, multitalented {{bird dog}} with {{a strong desire to}} please people. Exuberant, confident, and outgoing, they make a <b>loving</b> <b>family</b> pet and can be companions to small children, {{provided}} adults are nearby to direct this dog's boisterous enthusiasm. These retrievers require plenty of exercise and engagement to help channel their natural sporting energy. While they will protect their owners and property with an assertive bark, they are unlikely to back up such noise with actual aggression. Because of their excellent sense of smell, combined with their boundless energy and eagerness to please their masters, they are sometimes used as drug-sniffer dogs. They are used in the breeding program for The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the UK, both as a breed and as cross-breeds with the Labrador Retriever ...|$|E
2500|$|In award-winning novels such as Sing to the Dawn, Rice without Rain, and The Clay Marble, Minfong Ho {{presents}} realistic {{depictions of}} her native Southeast Asia. Characteristically focusing on strong female protagonists who {{interact with their}} families and friends against the backdrop of real events, Ho is often recognized for the sensitivity and understanding with which she treats the feelings of her characters as well as for her depiction of Asian life and locale. Her books include stories for young adult readers and middle graders as well as picture books for younger children. In all of these works, Ho does not avoid the harsher elements such as poverty and violent death, but she also weaves the theme of the stabilizing influence of family throughout her work. A contributor in St. James Guide to Young Adult Writers explained that Ho [...] "creates a world of great beauty and gentleness, with <b>loving</b> <b>family</b> relationships and ancient customs. But she also creates a world of poverty, drought, dreadful injustice, starvation, and death. Her protagonists are set between these two visions, but in that situation they discover their pride, integrity, and determination to love the land and overcome injustice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ung's {{father was}} born in the small village of Tro Nuon in Kampong Cham {{province}} in 1931. [...] Her mother was from China and moved with her family to Cambodia {{when she was a little}} girl. They married against her family's wishes, and eventually came to live with their children in a third-floor apartment in the center of the bustling capital city of Phnom Penh. [...] Due to his record of service in the previous government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Ung's father was conscripted into the government of Lon Nol, and became a high-ranking military police officer. Ung's mother supported her family as a homemaker. The family was relatively well-off and owned two cars and a truck, and their house used running water, a flushable toilet, and an iron bathtub. [...] They also had telephones as well as the daily services of a maid, and often enjoyed films at the nearby theater and swimming in the pool at a local club. By her own account, Loung lived a happy and carefree life in a close-knit <b>loving</b> <b>family,</b> until April 17, 1975, when the Khmer Rouge gained control of Cambodia and evacuated Phnom Penh.|$|E
2500|$|Haye grew {{up among}} the town {{houses of the}} Peabody Estate, near the famous Tate Modern Gallery and {{around the corner from}} the South Bank tourist attraction, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.

Haye started his ambition and passion for boxing at old-school boxing gym Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club in Lambeth, South London, where he quickly impressed and confidently won his first amateur bouts. Mick Carney, who ran the gym where David began training from 10 years old, said of Haye: [...] "He could whack as a kid. I think he chinned about three kids. But that made it really hard to get him matches. When you've got three first-round knockouts on your card everybody runs for the hills." [...] Of his upbringing, he described Haye as [...] "a lovely kid. He comes from a beautiful, <b>loving</b> <b>family.</b> He wasn't on the streets. He went to school, came to the gym, went home.

Stonewall Head of Policy and Research Ruth Hunt said the new law makes life easier for lesbian families and stated [...] "Now lesbian couples in the UK who make a considered decision to start a <b>loving</b> <b>family</b> will finally be afforded equal access to services they help fund as taxpayers". Home Office minister, Lord Brett was full of praise in his comments: This positive change means that, for the first time, female couples who have a child using fertility treatment {{have the same rights}} as their heterosexual counterparts to be shown as parents in the birth registration. It is vital that we afford equality wherever we can in society, especially as family circumstances continue to change. This is an important step forward in that process. Iain Duncan Smith, who led efforts to oppose the change, said that [...] "The absence of fathers generally has a detrimental effect on the child." ...|$|E
