60|$|In {{the arctic}} regions {{there are a}} number of animals which are wholly white all the year round, or which only turn white in winter. Among the former are the polar bear and the American polar hare, the snowy owl and the Greenland falcon; among the latter the arctic fox, the arctic hare, the ermine, and the ptarmigan. Those which are {{permanently}} white remain among the snow nearly all the year round, while those which change their colour inhabit regions which are free from snow in summer. The obvious explanation of this style of coloration is, that it is protective, serving to conceal the herbivorous species from their enemies, and enabling carnivorous animals to approach their prey unperceived. Two other explanations have, however, been suggested. One is, that the prevalent white of the arctic regions has a direct effect in producing the white colour in animals, either by some photographic or chemical action on the skin or by a reflex action through vision. The other is, that the white colour is chiefly beneficial as a means of checking radiation and so preserving animal heat during the severity of an arctic winter. The first is part of the general theory that colour is the effect of coloured light on the objects--a pure hypothesis which has, I believe, no facts whatever to support it. The second suggestion is also an hypothesis merely, since it has not been proved by experiment that a white colour, per se, independently of the fur or feathers which is so coloured, has any effect whatever in checking the radiation of <b>low-grade</b> <b>heat</b> like that of the animal body. But both alike are sufficiently disproved by the interesting exceptions to the rule of white coloration in the arctic regions, which exceptions are, nevertheless, quite in harmony with the theory of protection.|$|E

Factors {{such as the}} northerly climate and dispersed population cannot be avoided but inefficiencies with heating system design can. The mismatch between the grade of heat required to heat a home and that produced by conventional heat sources results in large amounts of wasted energy and exergy. <b>Low–grade</b> <b>heating</b> sources, such as ground source heat pumps, when combined with low-temperature distribution systems offer a more suitable and efficient means of heating homes.

50|$|The energy {{obtained}} is in {{the form}} of <b>low-grade</b> <b>heat</b> of 70 to 80 °C compared to an assumed 20 °C ambient temperature. According to the second law of thermodynamics (see Carnot-cycle), the maximum theoretical efficiency of a cycle that uses heat from a high temperature reservoir at 80 °C and has a lower temperature of 20 °C is 1−(273+20)/(273+80)=17%. By comparison, a power plant's heat engine delivering high-grade heat at 800 °C would have a maximum theoretical limit of 73% for converting heat into useful work (and thus would be forced to divest as little as 27% in waste heat to the cold temperature reservoir at 20 °C).

Seawater desalination can contribute towards meeting the increasing demand for fresh water using alternative energy sources like <b>low-grade</b> <b>heat.</b> Industrial waste heat, geothermal, solar thermal, could help to ease the energy crisis. Unfortunately, {{the efficiency of the}} conventional power cycle becomes uneconomically low with <b>low-grade</b> <b>heat</b> sources, while, at the same time, seawater desalination requires more energy than a conventional water treatment process.
