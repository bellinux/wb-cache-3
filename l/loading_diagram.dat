The daily load profile can often give great insight into the types of customers connected to the substation and can assist with developing a long-term forecast.

The type of technique used can often lead to representative <b>load</b> <b>diagrams</b> of unique shapes with differing numbers of customers belonging to each group.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} for accelerated life benchmark tests of tractor friction clutches, imitating real mode loading. A <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> of a tractor unit, constructed by this technique, {{is common for}} all friction clutches of a given class and purpose. However, specific clutch loading is determined not only by a <b>loading</b> <b>diagram,</b> but by the design parameters of a friction unit as well (geometric dimensions, a value of the reserve coefficient  and a moment of inertia Je of the engine shaft, terms of heat sink, the number of friction pairs, an irregularity of their loading, etc.). Therefore, when assessing a durability of friction pairs of clutch, a <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> of tractor is reconstructed into the <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> of a particular friction clutch. At life benchmark tests a loading mode {{is close to the}} operating mode, and a convenience of the experiment is provided by logging load levels and by using the minimum number of bench changeovers. Thus, each specific clutch, in a common diagram of operating loads of the tractor, will meet an individual <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> that determines its durability. The paper presents the model loading diagrams for three types of tractors and clutches, used in their transmissions. Conclusions: The proposed technique for accelerated life benchmark tests of clutches is based on the principle of simulating a mode of loading to be equivalent to that of the operating mode. Thus, benchmark test acceleration is achieved by increasing the cyclic of clutching in comparison with an operating mode. Using the proposed technique allows 6 [...] . 10 times benchmark test acceleration as compared to the operating one, depending on the design, code of friction material and loading conditions under operation. Good convergence (error of 11 % at most) of the results at bench and field tests allows us to recommend the proposed technique to evaluate a resource of tractor clutches. </p...|$|E

40|$|Standard {{methods for}} {{determining}} the elastic modulus of polymer materials are based on tension, compression and bending tests of specially prepared specimens. Contrary to steel, the linear elastic area of deformation of polymer materials in standard experiments is rather small. This {{is the reason for}} a noticeable measurement error in the results obtained by such methods. The method of determination of the elastic modulus described in this study is based on the solution of the problem of compression of a thin-walled circular cylindrical shell by two parallel planes with regard to the geometrical and physical nonlinearity. The account of nonlinear effects in determination of elastic modulus makes it possible to use a considerably greater range of the loading curve in the elastic region of deformation compared with that in standard methods of testing specimens for tension, compression, and bending. The contact problem is solved by the finite-element method (ANSYS). To solve the nonlinear problem by the finite-element method, a macros-program was elaborated, which specifies the geometry, physical law, and properties of the material, boundary conditions, loading, division into finite elements, and the step scheme of the solution. The deformation of a thin polymer shell is characterized by great displacements and relatively low elastic deformations in a large range of movement of parallel planes. The solution obtained by finite element method allows making the universal <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> in dimensionless coordinates in the given range of thicknesses and elastic module. Equation of the universal <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> allows us to solve the inverse problem of determination of the elastic modulus according to experimental points on the <b>loading</b> <b>diagram...</b>|$|E

In this work, the determination of the position of the contact points in large radius air bending has been studied by means of both an experimental campaign and finite element analysis. Experiments were performed on a press-brake with a capacity of 50 metric tons. High-strength steel Weldox 1300 and aluminum alloy AlMg 3, and punches of radii 30, 35 and 40 mm have been used.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} is to elaborate a method for determining the flexural modulus of a polymer material based on the solution of compression and tension problems by using the finite-element method in the finite element program ANSYS.

The deformation of a thin polymer shell is characterized by great displacements and relatively low elastic deformations in a large range of movement of parallel planes.

Equation of the universal <b>loading</b> <b>diagram</b> allows us to solve the inverse problem of determination of the elastic modulus according to experimental points on the <b>loading</b> <b>diagram.</b> The method of determination of the flexural modulus of thin polymer shells discussed above was successfully approved on a series of various kinds of thin PVC specimens by tension test.

The flexural modules received by compressing a circular cylindrical were verified by comparing the experimentally measured eigenfrequencies with numerical results from ANSYS program. The method enables the use of a “single specimen principle”. For example, changes in the modulus caused by different processes affecting the structure and properties of polymer material, for example, different kinds of aging of polymer materials, absorption of liquids (water) and vapors by a certain material, and so on, can be studied on a solitary [on one and the same] specimen...|$|E

According to formulation, the MOE and MOR for curved sample under tension or compression loads have more estimated quantity than value amount of the control samples, whereas the MOE and MOR of curved sample are decreased for applied load through the formatting processes. The front to back loads of one-piece and two-piece type chairs as shown in Fig.  12 are improved. The increasing strength of chairs with curved frames is due to their design and less number of joints when compared with custom chairs. Note that this chair has a better performance than custom chair where the loading is applied under front to back. The one-piece type chairs (B) are less strong than other chairs when the loading is applied under top to down. The legs of chairs have a key role against top to down load. The bending properties of curved samples are decreased for the combined effect such as pressure and high temperature. But the strength and stability of structures like a chair with curved frames are more than the custom chairs.

Utilization of draft sensor as a source for draft force sensing in lower arms is intended and examined.
