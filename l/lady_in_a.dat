25|$|These illusions {{are also}} {{implicit}} in the tales of fairy ointment. Many tales from Northern Europe tell of a mortal woman summoned to attend a fairy birth — sometimes attending a mortal, kidnapped woman's childbed. Invariably, the woman is given something for the child's eyes, usually an ointment; through mischance, or sometimes curiosity, she uses it on {{one or both of}} her own eyes. At that point, she sees where she is; one midwife realizes that she was not attending a great <b>lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fine house but her own runaway maid-servant in a wretched cave. She escapes without making her ability known but sooner or later betrays that she can see the fairies. She is invariably blinded in that eye or in both if she used the ointment on both.|$|E

500|$|In 1964, de Havilland {{appeared}} {{in her last}} two leading roles in feature filmsboth psychological thrillers. In Walter Grauman's <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Cage, she played a wealthy poet who gets trapped in her mansion's elevator and faces the threat of three terrorizing hooligans in her own home. Critics responded negatively to the graphic violence and cruelty shown on screen. A.H. Weiler of The New York Times called it a [...] "sordid, if suspenseful, exercise in aimless brutality". That same year, deHavilland {{appeared in}} Robert Aldrich's Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte with her close friend Bette Davis. After Joan Crawford left the picture due to illness, Davis had Aldrich fly to Switzerland to persuade a reluctant deHavilland to accept the role of Miriam Deering, a cruel, conniving character hidden behind the charming façade of a polite and cultured lady. Her quiet, restrained performance provided a counterbalance to Davis. Film historian Tony Thomas described her performance as [...] "a subtle piece of acting" [...] that was [...] "a vital contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film". The film was well received and earned seven Academy Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|Casting for {{the film}} took place over March 2005 through the internet, a Los Angeles-based {{organization}} for Latino actors, and word of mouth. Glatzer and Westmoreland chose to cast non-union actors; none of the cast except Chalo González belonged to the Screen Actors Guild. Most of the actors were nonprofessional and had never acted in a film before. Emily Rios's only experience before playing the lead role of Magdalena was in a school play, while Jesse Garcia had only acted in commercials. The film's own casting director, Jason L. Wood, ended up playing the character of James, and Glatzer and Westmoreland cast their cleaning <b>lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small role. They borrowed props from their cleaner's niece, who had recently had a quinceañera, and mimicked her video of the ceremony to create part of the film. Although the script called for the actors to speak [...] "Spanglish"—a mixture of English and Spanish—neither Glatzer nor Westmoreland were fluent in Spanish, {{so many of the}} actors translated their own lines from English. The teenage cast members also improvised dialogue for some scenes and provided their own clothes to wear in character.|$|E
500|$|At {{the bowling}} alley, Mort Goldman bowls a perfect game and becomes an {{overnight}} celebrity. Lois arrives to pick Peter {{up from the}} bowling alley, but discovers Quagmire spying on her from {{the ceiling of the}} ladies' toilet. Quagmire is beaten up then arrested, but released shortly after by Joe. On his return, Lois, Bonnie and Loretta reveal that they're petitioning the city of Quahog to have Quagmire removed from their neighborhood. As Peter and the other guys are defending Quagmire, Ernie the Giant Chicken attacks Peter and starts a fight that causes huge casualties inside and outside of Quahog. After the fight, Peter returns to the neighborhood to return to the conversation and tells the women that, [...] "Quagmire's a good guy, he's just a little mixed up, that's all!" [...] Eventually, the women agree to let Quagmire stay in the neighborhood so long as he manages to control his perverse behavior. Quagmire's taught self-control through operant conditioning by Peter and his friends, and is eventually allowed out in public. Soon, however, he is distracted by women playing in a fountain in the shopping mall and panics, running into a CCTV camera operation room monitoring women's changing rooms. Discovering that a <b>lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fitting room is having a heart attack, he appears to rush to her aid, performing CPR and saving her life. Quagmire is congratulated for his heroism, but his intention had been to molest the woman while she was unconscious (which he reveals by asking [...] "What the hell is CPR?").|$|E

2500|$|The two next {{encounter}} {{a group of}} friars accompanying a <b>lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> carriage. Don Quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who hold the lady captive, knocks a friar from his horse, and is immediately challenged by an armed Basque traveling with the company. As he has no shield, the Basque uses a pillow to protect himself, which saves him when Don Quixote strikes him. Cervantes chooses this point, {{in the middle of}} the battle, to say that his source ends here. Soon, however, he resumes Don Quixote's adventures after a story about finding Arabic notebooks containing the rest of the story by Cid Hamet Ben Engeli. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and commanding those traveling with her to [...] "surrender" [...] to Don Quixote.|$|E

2500|$|Hell Screen is {{narrated by}} an uninvolved servant who {{witnesses}} or hears of the events. The plot of Hell Screen {{centers on the}} artist Yoshihide. Yoshihide is considered “the greatest painter in the land”, and is often commissioned to create works for the Lord of Horikawa, who also employs Yoshihide’s daughter in his mansion. When Yoshihide is instructed to create a folding screen depicting the Buddhist hell, he proceeds to inflict tortures upon his apprentices, so he can see what {{he is trying to}} paint. Supernatural forces seem to be present; one time, Yoshihide speaks in a devilish voice. [...] The story climaxes when Yoshihide asks the lord to burn a beautiful <b>lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> carriage so he can finish the screen. The lord concedes, but, in a macabre twist, Yoshihide must watch as his daughter Yuzuki and her monkey are the ones who burn. The story ends with the magnificently horrible screen completed, and Yoshihide’s suicide by hanging.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of [...] "the Regulator" [...] Hitchen expresses his grievance for [...] "such abominable practices" [...] carried out by [...] "such as have assumed the title of thief-takers" [...] that [...] "if these should hold their peace, the stones in the city would cry out" [...] and thereupon adds that he hopes [...] "effectual care will be taken {{to have the same}} strictly examined into." [...] Hitchen gives one example out of many similar cases, where Wild saves his accomplices and prosecutes an innocent one, at least in that particular crime. Three [...] "notorious rogues", William Mathews, Christopher Matthews and Obadiah Lemmon robbed a <b>lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coach near St. Paul's Churchyard. Wild for fear of losing these profitable criminals, met the three and arranged for one of them to be an evidence in the court, which meant him giving the names of [...] "a numerous train of offenders" [...] and convicting them. {{but at the same time}} he should not have mentioned the stealing of a dozen of handkerchiefs and other robberies involving Wild directly as a receiver, otherwise they would lose their [...] "factor" [...] by [...] "bringing his own neck into the noose and put it into power of every little prig". As a result, the three offenders escaped the justice and the thief-taker received a reward of £40 for arresting and hanging [...] "shim-sham thieves", Hugh Oakley and Henry Chickley.|$|E
