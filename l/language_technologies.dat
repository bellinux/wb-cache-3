It is with great pleasure that we present her with this Festschrift to honor her lasting contributions to the field and to commemorate her retirement from the chair in computational linguistics at Uppsala University. The contributions to the Festschrift come from Anna’s friends and colleagues around the world and deal with many of the topics that are dear to her heart.
