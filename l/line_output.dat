50|$|Some AC/DC {{equipment}} {{was designed to}} be switchable to be able to operate off either 110 V AC (possibly with a voltage doubler) or 220-240V AC or DC. Television receivers were produced which could run off 240 V AC or DC. The voltage was not high enough to power some circuits, so energy was recovered during the flyback period from the primary of the <b>line</b> <b>output</b> transformer to provide a boosted HT (high tension) supply. In a typical vacuum tube colour TV set, the <b>line</b> <b>output</b> stage had to boost its own HT supply to between 900 to 1200 volts (depending on screen size and design). Transistor <b>line</b> <b>output</b> stages, although not requiring supply voltages above the rectified mains voltage, nevertheless still developed extra voltage over the normal supply rail to avoid complicating the power supply circuitry. A typical transistor stage would produce between 20 and 50 'extra' volts. Some details {{of the way in which}} the nominally 190 volts HT supply was boosted to nearly 500 volts in the 1951 Bush TV22 are described in a technical publication. AC/DC televisions were produced well into the color and semiconductor era (some sets were tube/semiconductor hybrids).|$|E

Instead, line level circuits use the impedance bridging principle, in which a low impedance output drives a high impedance input. A typical line out connection has an output impedance from 100 to 600 Ω, with lower values being more common in newer equipment. Line inputs present a much higher impedance, typically 10 kΩ or more.|$|E
