This is the decision of Constantinople patriarchate of 1325 on regulation of the privity of two land possessors. So the effect of this decision could be interpolated in the village.

Autor nudi tumačenje koje se zasniva na usporedbi vinodolskog područja s drugim pograničnim područjima ugarsko-hrvatske države, u kojima je postojao izgrađen sustav utvrda s gradokmetovima. Premda je vojni ustroj u Vinodolu nesumnjivo postojao i u doba hrvatske države, autor uočava neke značajke vinodolskih općina koje su tipične za općine gradokmetova. The law-code of Vinodol, {{the oldest}} <b>legal</b> <b>monument</b> in the Croatian vernacular, {{was made in}} 1288, when the representatives of nine {{fortified}} towns belonging to Vinodol convened and {{in the presence of}} their territorial lord, the count from the extended family of the counts of Krk/Vegla, put into written form {{for the first time the}} legal rules they called “the law of their fathers. ” In the text of the law-code, the inhabitants of these fortified towns are referred to by the term kmeti, a term which had several meanings in medieval Croatia (ranging from the tenant-peasant or serf to persons in high positions in society). In modern scholarship the position and origin of the kmeti of the law-code of Vinodol have been understood in various ways. The author offers an explanation based on the comparison of the area of Vinodol with other frontier areas of the Kingdom of Hungary-Croatia, in which at that time there existed a system of castles and fortified towns inhabited and administered by the so-called “castle-warriors” (iobagiones castri). The author points out several characteristics of the Vinodol communities typical also for the communities of castle-warriors in Hungary, although he acknowledges that military organisation undoubtedly already existed in Vinodol in the period of an independent Croatian kingdom, prior to the union with Hungary...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{stems from}} a simple question: how do western societies, shaped by continual industrialization, form a heritage concept when confronted with their contemporary industrial building stock? The purpose of comparing Quebec’s attitude towards its contemporary industrial heritage to that of Germany was done to understand what effects were at play that led to different outcomes even though {{a number of significant}} parameters seemed very similar in both locations. The first two chapters of this thesis will show that both Quebec and Germany look back to a century old tradition in commemorating historic industrial sites, but the motivation to do so was coming from very different directions. This indicated that the two countries started their involvement in industrial heritage protection from differing positions. In Germany, not only was legal preservation of industrial sites gaining continued strength after it was re-established in the 1970 s, but in most of the German Länder preservation curators included industrial machinery (technical or mechanical equipment) both inside and outside of the buildings, when adding an industrial site to their heritage list. The case studies show that the country’s curators have integrated already contemporary industrial sites in their protection demands. They treat these sites as historic records that store valuable information in the material itself and should therefore be treated with care, specifically when economic considerations requested to convert these sites. Quebec’s officials hesitated for a much longer time to include industrial sites in their <b>legal</b> <b>monument</b> protection program, and when they did, it was implemented in a more arbitrary fashion. Quebec listed more than anything else small rural workshops to represent the province’s contemporary industrial heritage. The more representative large industrial complexes of the post-World War Two era remained without recognition. These sites are increasingly coming to the end of their intended life. Even if they have outstanding historical, artistic or technical qualities, they face demolition long before any possible heritage value could be addressed. This will lead to a gap in Quebec’s historic narrative in the future. Germany seems, in regard to contemporary industrial heritage recognition, some steps ahead of Quebec. Can Germany therefore be an inspiration for Quebec? This dissertation shows that there is no easy answer to that question but that an analysis by the reader of this thesis helps to guide, in a fruitful direction, the much needed discussion in Quebec. ...|$|E

40|$|Opusu akademika Marka Kostrenčića (1884. – 1976.), prvoga nastavnika samostalne katedre hrvatske pravne povijesti na Pravnom fakultetu u Zagrebu, može se pristupiti na više načina. Na osnovi uvida u skripta, udžbenike, članke i druge tekstove u ovom radu prikazuje se njegov teorijsko-metodološki razvoj, dijelom i u odmaku od prethodnika, posebno s obzirom na raznolika poimanja prava, povijesti i uopće (društveno-humanističkih) znanosti, ali i na konkretnu obradu pojedinih, pretežno medievističkih pravnopovijesnih tema. U tom sklopu glavnina pozornosti pridana je koncepcijama izloženima u njegovim utemeljiteljskim publikacijama 1912. – 1930. te onima iz razdoblja 1947. – 1976., koje zbog izmijenjenoga socio-političkoga okruženja, ali i naznaka unutarnjega kontinuiteta predstavljaju svojevrstan interpretativni izazov. Educated in Zagreb, Prague, Warsaw, Cracow, Lemberg and Wien, Zagreb Faculty of Law {{professor}} and later academician Marko Kostrenčić (1882 – 1976), {{the head of}} the newly founded department (in 1911) and the first teacher of Croatian legal history as a separate course, did not have an easy task. Apart from the general issues concerning the status of social sciences and even epistemology as such at the beginning of 20 th century, his was to face the significant lack of previous systematic research within national confines. Although his mentor Milivoj Maurović (1859 – 1926), who taught Croatian legal history as a part of general and Slavic legal history courses did make some advances from previous romanticist and Hegelian framework found in the earlier approach of Josip Pliverić (1847 – 1907) or Jaromir Hanӗl (1847 – 1910), including an informative overview of medieval sources, Kostrenčić’s lectures and writings of 1910 s and 1920 s had a founding significance. Presenting a “genetic” approach to legal history, aimed at explaining not only how but also why law evolve as it does – most notably in his 1919 and 1923 textbooks – he stressed importance not only of traditional legal dogmatic interpretative methods as well as general ways of studying past, but also of sociology (represented by É. Durkheim), basing his broader epistemological framework on the various influences of Neokantianism and Pragmatism, with H. Vaihinger’s 1911 book Die Philosophie des Als Ob being directly acclaimed as a much needed supplement to the legal-theoretical views held by R. Jhering and H. Kantorowitz. Therefore, in Kostrenčić’s view, the task of legal historian was to gradually advance from the publication of sources and partial research to broader synthesis, sometimes even using vaguely, that is to say pragmatically defined operating legal concepts, including not only written, state, statutory etc. law, but also popular, customary one; in that light, apart from introductory, methodological chapters, his earlier work encompassed rather a small number of <b>legal</b> institutes and <b>monuments</b> of Croatian Middle Ages. As far as then actual debate on the character of various sciences is concerned, Kostrenčić did not negate a possibility of establishing some universal laws in the field of legal history, but his insistence on the importance of singularities suggests that he probably understood them closer to trends or tendencies. However, general trend of history for him, arguably, was not that of unlimited progress, not only because he stated that legal institutes tend to lose their functionality as a result of human actions, but also because of his remarks on the “neverending battle between good and evil”. After an early retirement in late 1930 s, which followed a period of activity within administrative structures of Yugoslav monarchy, Kostrenčić’s teaching career was reactivated shortly after the Second World War, in a society dominated by Communist Party and its official ideology. As a result, majority of his texts published in 1947 – 1976 contain significant references on “Dialectic materialism” as a supposedly unique tool for a “scientific” approach to law, society and history. Although schematic in principle, especially during initial years of the strictly controlled, so called Agitprop culture, this paradigm shift towards a sort of Marxism, present in the majority of Croatian (and Yugoslav) historiographic texts of that time, was by Kostrenčić himself mostly cautiously applied to concrete data, while even his “theoretical” chapters included e. g. stating a two way relationship between legal “superstructure” and economic “basis”, importance of popular customary law (which, as he noted, eschewed dogmatic definition of law as the will of ruling class), positive remarks on methodology of “bourgeois” historiography or philosophers like Schopenhauer, Nietzsche etc. After completing his final 1956 textbook on Croatian State and Legal History during Middle Ages, which came much closer to a synthetical overview centered on the processual changes in social structure, several shorter Kostrenčić’s texts now reflected on a kind of gradually refining philosophy of history, predicting a unification of mankind in a “socialist” community, described in Marxist but non-dogmatic terms. All in all, existing sources do not allow firmer conclusions on Kostrenčić’s motives for described change in his publicly held methodological views. It was probably conformist to a degree, and as such could be explained within scope of lesser evil doctrine, enabling intelectualls under repressive regimes to “save” the core of their research practices. On the other hand, as Kostrenčić continued to vary his positive views on a sort of Marxism much longer then overall situation demanded, if taken together with his claims on the deficits of other theories of law, history and historiography – moreover, {{all the way through the}} postwar period he overtly described himself as a kind of methodological convert – and his earlier stressing of the social component of law (conflicting interests etc.), elements of continuous, intrinsically motivated development can also be traced...|$|R
