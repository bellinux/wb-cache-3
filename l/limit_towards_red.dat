40|$|We propose an {{alternative}} scenario to cosmic inflation for producing the initial seeds of cosmic structures. The cosmological fluctuations are generated by thermal fluctuation {{of the energy}} density of the ideal string gas in three compact spatial dimensions. Statistical mechanics of the strings reveals that scalar power spectrum of the cosmological fluctuations on cosmic scales is scale-invariant for closed strings and inclines <b>towards</b> <b>red</b> for open strings in three compact spatial dimensions. This generation of thermal fluctuations happens during the Hagedorn era of string gas cosmology and without invoking an inflationary epoch the perturbations enter the radiation-dominated era. The amplitude of the fluctuations {{is proportional to the}} ratio of the two length scales in the theory, i. e., the Planck length over the string length.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the causes behind {{the formation of}} colour in mill systems, the effect of different process waters on the optical properties of hydrogen-peroxide bleached Norway spruce mechanical pulp during storage was studied. The influence of process water type, temperature, time, pulp consistency and pH was evaluated over the visible range of wavelengths. The darkening was more pronounced when pulp was stored in process waters compared to in distilled water. Increased temperature and prolonged storage times increased the darkening as expected, whereas a higher storage consistency gave less darkening than a lower storage consistency (15 % compared to 5 %). The pH value that gave the lowest brightness reduction and a minimum in Delta k(460) {{was found to be}} 5. 5 - 6. 0. Storage of pulp in white water from the paper machine resulted in a broad shoulder in the k spectra indicating colour formation related to the particles in this water. Part of this shoulder in absorption spectra was related to added dyes, but the increase in absorption with time is likely to be caused by some other colour formation.

40|$|Male-male {{competition}} for mating territories can exert negative frequency- dependent selection on a male secondary sexual trait, such as nuptial coloration. This can occur when males bias aggression towards owncoloured competitors, {{resulting in a}} fitness advantage for rare phenotypes, thereby promoting the evolution and maintenance of stable colour polymorphisms. It could operate in the extensive radiations of haplochromine cichlid fish in East African lakes. In a previous investigation we studied wild- caught blue and red Pundamilia males from Lake Victoria; males from a location where most resemble blue (referred to as bluish males) biased aggression towards blue stimulus males. In contrast, blue males from a location where blue and red occur sympatrically biased aggression <b>towards</b> <b>red</b> stimulus males. Using lab- bred bluish and blue males, we tested the hypothesis that exclusive experience with blue males (blue treatment) leads to an aggression bias towards blue and that experience with blue and red males (mixed treatment) leads to an aggression bias <b>towards</b> <b>red.</b> Contrary to predictions, blue- treated males did not distinguish between blue and red males, whereas mixed- treated males preferentially attacked blue stimulus males. The data suggest that prior experience can affect aggression biases and that experience {{with more than one}} phenotype may be required for the development of biases. Yet, our results cannot explain the direction of differences in specific biases observed in wild- caught males from different populations. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|Abstract. For {{successive}} annealing stages the photoluminescence (PL) {{peaks of}} InXGa 1 -XN/GaN quantum wells (QWs) shift initially <b>towards</b> <b>red</b> which {{is followed by}} a blue. This phenomenon contradicts the usual monotonic blueshift. We have found that the phenomena can be explained properly only if we consider recombinations from the higher sub-bands to be present in the PL of the InXGa 1 -XN/GaN QWs, which is not usual. When a strong piezoelectric field exists across a QW, as encountered in InXGa 1 -XN/GaN QWs, the probability of optical transitions from higher sub-bands of the QW become more probable. In this paper this theory has been established from experimental results...|$|R
