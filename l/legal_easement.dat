50|$|The {{benefit of}} a <b>legal</b> <b>easement</b> will pass to the next owner of that {{tenement}} without express words. This was {{the position of the}} common law and is now reflected in both sections 62 and 187 of the Law of Property Act 1925. If the dominant tenement is leased, even if only at equity, the benefit of the <b>legal</b> <b>easement</b> will still pass to the lesee and it will remain an easement at law albeit one enforceable by the lessee in equity only.|$|E
50|$|Section 1(2) of the Law of Property Act 1925 {{states that}} {{easements}} are an interest {{capable of being}} legal, with S52 of the 1925 Act stating that all conveyances will be void unless created by deed. Therefore, for an express <b>legal</b> <b>easement</b> to be formed rather than simply equitable {{it must have been}} created by deed. A <b>legal</b> <b>easement</b> must be registered against both the dominant and servient tenements, if their titles are registered, in order to take effect. The benefit of legal easements pass automatically on the transfer of the dominant tenement or part of the dominant tenement.|$|E

50|$|The {{benefit of}} an {{equitable}} easement passes with {{the transfer of}} the dominant tenement. Whether section 62 of the Law of Property Act 1925 can operate to turn an equitable easement into a <b>legal</b> <b>easement</b> upon conveyance of the dominant tenement is unclear. On the one hand, it would seem odd that a mere licence could become a <b>legal</b> <b>easement</b> through the section, when the much closer equitable easement could not; on the other hand, construing the section in this way is unnecessary {{from the perspective of the}} purchaser, since a right enforceable in equity will be almost as useful as one enforceable at common law.|$|E
50|$|A fourth category, {{equitable}} easements arising {{by virtue}} of proprietary estoppel, is contested. Cases such as ER Ives Investments Ltd v High and Crabb v Arun District Council have been offered in support of their existence; however, some commentators prefer to analyse these cases as giving rise to a right distinct from an easement or a <b>legal</b> <b>easement</b> respectively. This makes an important difference {{when it comes to}} binding third-party purchasers.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{circumstances}} where the grant of an easement may be implied, usually occurring on the conveyance of land. Where land is transferred, subject to contrary intention, existing easements are automatically conveyed under Section 62 of the Law of Property Act 1925. Additionally - and controversially {{in some cases}} - 'precarious' rights, such as licenses or personal rights may be transformed into <b>legal</b> <b>easements,</b> as demonstrated in International Tea Stores Co v Hobbs. In this case a right of way granted as a license by a land owner was transformed into an easement, following the conveyance of land into a legal estate. A limitation of Section 62 {{is that it does}} not act to imply reservation easements; for example, a land owner in common ownership of two plots of land could not claim that, after selling one plot, his remaining plot should have an easement for right of light implied. Other circumstances where easements may be implied are where they are necessary for the enjoyment of land.|$|R

50|$|Where land is registered, as is now common, {{there are}} further {{circumstances}} where an equitable easement will arise. Where both the dominant and servient tenements are registered, easements must be registered against both titles {{under the terms}} of the Land Registration Act 1925. Failure to do so will render them easements in equity only, although they will still bind purchasers under rule 258 of the Land Registration Rules 1925. Where the servient land is unregistered, it is likely that the easement will not have to be registered against the dominant title, even if that is itself registered land. This has been disputed, however, and is significant because if legal would bind successors after first registration whereas an equitable easement would require registration as a land charge. Rule 250(1) allows for easements to arise in equity through prescription where the title is registered, but a right arising through prescription would be created as a <b>legal</b> <b>easement</b> and there seems to be no part of this process where the owner of the dominant tenement has a right in equity only.|$|E
40|$|I {{spoke with}} {{you last night}} along with my client Bill Patterson {{regarding}} his property at 1120 W. Redlands Blvd. in Redlands. As you know Caliber Collision Center has occupied Bill's property for the past 15 years, however, they will be moving {{as a result of}} the proposed future RR line coming to Redlands in the years to come. Per our conversation as it sits right now Bill's property will become land locked once construction starts. You mentioned that SANBAG has ordered a Preliminary Title Report and is going to do a title search to try and find if a <b>legal</b> <b>easement</b> for ingress and egress existed at one time for the property. Can you find out what Title Company you have ordered this from and what progress they are making and pass along their findings? FYI- I have ordered a Prelim from First American Title Insurance Company in Ontario, but haven't received it yet. Bill has asked me to market the property to get a new tenant or sell the property, but without future legal access into the property it makes it virtually impossible. Attached is an aerial photo showing the subject property. Please advise. Thank you...|$|E
40|$|In my {{doctoral}} thesis I {{have focused on}} <b>legal</b> regulation of <b>easements</b> and rights of neighbours as interrelated legal institutes. The introductory passages illustrate both fundamental concepts of this work, namely easements and rights of neighbours {{with regard to the}} current legal regulations, as well as their mutual relation. A short presentation of the historic legislation of both institutes in our territory since the early 19 th century until today might help better understanding of the actual legal regulation of these institutes in Civil Code. By determination of easements and rights of neighbours and by analysis of their establishment in current Czech law I attempted to incorporate in my work the actual cases of the most frequently established easements, as well as very common violations of neighbourhood rights. Another part of my thesis is devoted to legal instruments serving to protect the rights corresponding the <b>legal</b> regulation of <b>easements</b> and rights of neighbours in Civil Code. Last section of the thesis contains a brief treatise on the law of easements and rights of neighbours in the Federal Republic of Germany, particularly as codified in the German Civil Code. Within the scope of treatise of the various types of interference to the rights of neig hbours according to German law I tried to [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>legal</b> {{institute}} of <b>easements.</b> These are rights in rem to another person's property which restrict the owner of immovable property {{in favor of a}}nother person so that he is obliged to tolerate something, to refrain from something or to perform something. Easements serve more beneficial usage of immovable property or in favor of a particular person. The thesis consists of ten chapters. The first chapter describes the historical development of easements in five sub-chapters. The second chapter {{deals with the}} definition and function of easements. The third chapter examines their sorting. The fourth chapter deals with the content of easements. The most common easements - the right of way and the right to use a flat or a room - are described in two sub-chapters. The fifth chapter deals with an issue of recording easements in the land register. The sixth chapter, the largest, successively pays attention to individual ways of their creation in six sub-chapters. In three sub-chapters of the seventh chapter modification of easements (in their subjects, content and object) is analysed. The eighth chapter examines individual ways of termination of easements in six sub-chapters. Separately, in the ninth chapter, limitation of time of easements is dealt with. The final chapter describes [...] ...|$|R
