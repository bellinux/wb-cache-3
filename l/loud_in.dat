5|$|Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was {{the music}} of Debussy. Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy {{slightly}} since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued {{for more than ten}} years. In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were <b>loud</b> <b>in</b> their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.|$|E
5|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} Achtung Baby {{was marked by}} several {{releases}} in 2011. At the band's request, a documentary film about the album entitled From the Sky Down was produced. It was directed by Davis Guggenheim, who previously collaborated with the Edge for the documentary It Might Get <b>Loud</b> <b>in</b> 2008. From the Sky Down documents the album's difficult recording period, the band members' relationships, and U2's creative process. Archival footage and stills from the recording sessions appear in the film, along with unreleased scenes from Rattle and Hum. For the documentary, the band were filmed during a return visit to Hansa Studios and during rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, and in October, it was broadcast on multiple television networks worldwide.|$|E

25|$|The group's second album, Gold Against the Soul, {{displayed}} a more commercial, grungy sound which served to alienate both {{fans and the}} band itself. It was released to mixed reviews but still performed well, reaching number eight in the UK album chart. The album presents a different sound from their debut album, {{not only in terms}} of lyrics but in sound, the band privileged long guitar riffs, and the drums themselves feel more present and <b>loud</b> <b>in</b> the final mix of the album. This sound would be abandoned in their next album and as for the nature of the lyrics they also changed, with Edwards and Wire eschewing their political fire for introspective melancholy.|$|E

25|$|With {{a growing}} {{majority}} of the Cabinet, including Lloyd George and Churchill, in favour of women's suffrage, Asquith was pressed to allow consideration of a private member's bill to give women the vote. The majority of Liberal MPs were also in favour. Jenkins deemed {{him one of the}} two main prewar obstacles to women gaining the vote, the other being the suffragists's own militancy. In 1912, Asquith reluctantly agreed to permit a free vote on an amendment to a pending reform bill, allowing women the vote on the same terms as men. This would have satisfied Liberal suffrage supporters, and many suffragists, but the Speaker in January 1913 ruled that the amendment changed the nature of the bill, which would have to be withdrawn. Asquith was <b>loud</b> <b>in</b> his complaints against the Speaker, but was privately relieved.|$|E
25|$|He faced uprisings in Algeria by the pied-noirs and the French armed forces. On {{assuming}} {{the prime minister}} role in June 1958 he immediately went to Algeria, and neutralised the army there, with its 600,000 soldiers. The Algiers Committee of Public Safety was <b>loud</b> <b>in</b> its demands {{on behalf of the}} settlers, but de Gaulle made more visits and sidestepped them. For the long term he devised a plan to modernize Algeria's traditional economy, deescalated the war, and offered Algeria self-determination in 1959. A pied-noir revolt in 1960 failed, while another attempted coup failed in April 1961. French voters approved his course in a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination. De Gaulle arranged a cease-fire in Algeria with the March 1962 Evian Accords, legitimated by another referendum a month later. It gave victory by the FLN, which came to power and declared independence. The long crisis was over.|$|E

25|$|The third (or {{technically}} {{fourth or}} fifth) primary melody {{in a march}} is called the trio. The trio is described as the main melody of the march. It is often played legato style in a softer dynamic, and features woodwinds more than brass. Sousa often used clarinets and euphoniums in lower tenor register in his trios. The trio is the most contrasting section, often containing variations of motifs heard in the previous two strains. The trio melody is often repeated once at a softer dynamic, or not repeated at all and goes right to the next section. Generally, it is played quietly for the first (or second) playthrough, then the next has a piccolo playing over the trio melody, and in the final playthrough, it is <b>loud.</b> <b>In</b> almost all cases, the trio modulates to the subdominant key of the march, meaning one flat {{is added to the}} key signature. Again, this is for the purpose of contrast and makes the trio more memorable to the listener. The fact that the key is now flatter also offers a more relaxing feel for those trios with softer instrumentation. For marches starting in minor keys, the trio usually modulates to the relative major. This key is maintained {{to the end of the}} piece.|$|E
500|$|Doc Kuhn is {{possibly}} the greatest ball {{player on the}} squad, due to his miraculous fielding around short this season. Starting with the opening college games he went for six straight games without an error, finally putting Tot McCullough off the bag with a wide heave that broke the run. The Michigan and Ohio coaches were <b>loud</b> <b>in</b> their praises for Kuhn {{as one of the}} greatest fielding shortstops they had seen in some time. His hitting this season has been hard and timely, including a homer, four triples, and three doubles. He hits in streaks, however, and this alone will keep the phenomenal Vandy star out of a major berth in the near future. Kuhn, Embry and McCullough stand out head and shoulders above anybody in their respective lines that has visited here in recent years.|$|E
500|$|McNeile had a quiet {{life after}} the war; his biographer Jonathon Green notes that [...] "as in the novels of fellow best-selling writers such as P. G. Wodehouse or Agatha Christie, it is the hero who lives the {{exciting}} life". Although he was an [...] "unremittingly hearty man", he suffered from delicate health following the war. He had a loud voice and a louder laugh, and [...] "liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the sight and sound of military good fellowship"; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as [...] "not everybody's cup of tea", and commented that [...] "he was <b>loud</b> <b>in</b> every possible way—in his voice, in his laugh, in his clothes, in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself, in his whole approach to life". McNeile {{and his wife had}} two sons.|$|E

[...] {{and that the}} decision had [...] "set off ... shock waves among rights activists". It commented that [...] "he fact that DNA exonerations often upend criminal confessions that {{turn out to have}} been coerced after lengthy interrogations demonstrates the risks of such police procedures. That's a key reason Miranda rights were established in the first place". The ruling made automatic videotaping of major-crime interviews [...] "critical". It concluded that [...] "t may seem to some that the high court ruling will enable police to nab more bad guys and make the charges stick. But by setting up a 'gotcha' set of rules about a key constitutional protection, the high court has eroded individual liberty for all Americans." ...|$|E
500|$|In the song's final bridge section, at 2:58, {{the spoken}} phrase [...] "Fucking hell!" [...] appears. Scott admits that {{although}} he was told about it, he could not hear the words originally. Lennon attributed the expletive to McCartney, according to Emerick, who reports Lennon's comment in his autobiography: [...] "'Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word,' Lennon gleefully crowed, 'but I insisted we leave it in , buried just low enough {{so that it can}} barely be heard. Most people won't ever spot it ... but we'll know it's there.'" [...] Womack considers that the expletive was actually uttered by Lennon. Malcolm Toft, the mix engineer on the Trident recording, also attributes it to Lennon. In Toft's recollection, Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when, in reaction to the volume being too <b>loud</b> <b>in</b> his headphones, he first called out [...] "Whoa!" [...] then, two seconds later, swore as he pulled the headphones off.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I {{thought that was a}} very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew." [...] "One of the things is that if you played <b>loud</b> <b>in</b> the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud." ...|$|E

500|$|Eva Bella and Spencer Lacey Ganus {{were cast}} to portray Elsa {{as a young}} child and as a teenager, respectively. Actress and singer Megan Mullally was {{originally}} cast to voice an adult Elsa. but was replaced by Idina Menzel, a Broadway actress and singer best known for performing as Elphaba in Wicked. Menzel already knew Kristen Bell, who voiced Anna, and had previously auditioned for a lead role in the 2010 Disney film Tangled. She was not cast for the part, but the casting director recorded her singing and later showed the recording to Frozens film executives. Menzel was surprised when she was subsequently asked to audition, and she received the role after reading the script out <b>loud.</b> <b>In</b> interviews, she acknowledged similarities between Elsa, her then-current role, and Elphaba, her previous role. Namely, she said, they were both very powerful and very misunderstood individuals. She further said that she related to the characters, having hidden her singing talent from her peers at school. [...] "I didn't want to alienate anyone," [...] she explained. [...] "If everyone was singing along in the car to a Madonna song, I didn't join in because when we're younger we're afraid of sticking out or showing off, when in fact we should own those things that make us really unique." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{videos were}} filmed between June and November 2013 in various {{countries}} as the singer traveled on her world tour. Todd Tourso, {{who directed the}} videos for [...] "Jealous" [...] and [...] "Heaven", served as the creative director for the entire project. Much of his role concerned liaising between Beyoncé, who for most videos already had concepts, and the respective directors who also had propositions. As most videos were shot outside of the US, the crew surrounding the videos was small, consisting only of Tourso, the director of photography and producer, as well as Beyoncé and her stylist, make-up artist and security. When filming in public, Beyoncé would wear in-ear headphones instead of having the music played out <b>loud,</b> <b>in</b> {{order to maintain the}} secrecy of the project and prevent any songs leaking. By the time of post-production, the songwriting process began to converge with the content of the visuals and Beyoncé would watch unedited footage to fit the music to them. [...] "Flawless", [...] "Rocket" [...] and [...] "Mine" [...] were noted as having been changed by their visual counterparts, Tourso commenting that [...] "she would rewrite some lines, or she would add certain audio, or she would add bridges" [...] and believed that [...] "it would complete the picture of where the audio needed to go".|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] is a eurodance and dance-pop {{song that}} {{incorporates}} dubstep elements with {{a length of}} three minutes and 51 seconds. According to Carrie Battan of Pitchfork Media, [...] "even though the track opens builds like a arena anthem, but instead of exploding into oblivion after the breakdown it splits into a fizzy and wonky slap of a beat." [...] PopCrush's Trent Fitzgerald compared [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] to Usher's 2010 single [...] "OMG". Ryan Hadfield of Time wrote that, [...] "'Can’t Stop Won’t Stop' and 'Scream' are aggressively seductive club songs" [...] and drew comparisons to Usher's single [...] "Yeah!" [...] (Confessions, 2004) [...] and his collaboration with French disk jockey David Guetta entitled [...] "Without You" [...] (Nothing but the Beat, 2011). Billboards Erika Ramirez concluded that [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] is built around [...] "synth-heavy hook" [...] and was critical towards its [...] "mediocre lyricism". The song starts with the opening lines: [...] "Hey what’s up / This is a jam, turn it up / Play it <b>loud</b> <b>in</b> the club / This is fire, burning it up", while the chorus consists of the lyrics [...] "I can’t can’t stop it / Can’t stop won’t stop". Unterberger noted that the lines [...] "I don’t want {{to do all the}} normal things / That all these other normal dudes do" [...] could be the inspiration for the title of the album and its [...] "thesis statement".|$|E
