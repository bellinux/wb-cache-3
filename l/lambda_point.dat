5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the <b>lambda</b> <b>point</b> is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, Pyotr Kapitsa, John Allen and Don Misener {{discovered}} that helium-4 became {{a new kind}} of fluid, now known as a superfluid, at temperatures less than 2.17 K (the <b>lambda</b> <b>point).</b> Superfluid helium has many unusual properties, including zero viscosity (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of quantized vortices. It was quickly believed that the superfluidity was due to partial Bose–Einstein condensation of the liquid. In fact, many properties of superfluid helium also appear in gaseous condensates created by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle (see below). Superfluid helium-4 is a liquid rather than a gas, which means that the interactions between the atoms are relatively strong; the original theory of Bose–Einstein condensation must be heavily modified in order to describe it. Bose–Einstein condensation remains, however, fundamental to the superfluid properties of helium-4. Note that helium-3, a fermion, also enters a superfluid phase (at a much lower temperature) which {{can be explained by the}} formation of bosonic Cooper pairs of two atoms (see also fermionic condensate).|$|E

Doubly reduced plots of eta rho sub n versus T showed a slight but definite tendency for such curves to rotate clockwise about the (1, 1) point with increasing x sub 3 up to about 0. 05. Values of eta were derived from the measurements by computing rho sub n as a function of T*. For each mixture, both eta and d eta/dT were continuous across T sub lambda (x sub 3). No tendency was manifest for such curves to develop discontinuities as x sub 3 decreased. It was therefore inferred that both eta and d eta/dT of pure He 4 are continuous across T sub lambda (0) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind plasma results in a natural plasma confinement system which stores energy. Dissipation of this energy through Joule heating in the ionosphere can be studied via the Auroral Electrojet (AE) index. The apparent broken power law form of the frequency spectrum of this index has motivated investigation of whether it {{can be described as}} fractal coloured noise. One frequently-applied test for self-affinity is to demonstrate linear scaling of the logarithm of the structure function of a time series with the logarithm of the dilation factor <b>lambda.</b> We <b>point</b> out that, while this is conclusive when applied to signals that are self-affine over many decades in lambda, such as Brownian motion, the slope deviates from exact linearity and the conclusions become ambiguous when the test is used over shorter ranges of lambda. We demonstrate that non self-affine time series made up of random pulses can show near-linear scaling over a finite dynamic range such that they could be misinterpreted as being self-affine. In particular, we show that pulses with functional forms such as those identified by Weimer within the AL index, from which AE is partly derived, will exhibit nearly linear scaling over ranges similar to those previously shown for AE and AL. The value of the slope, related to the Hurst exponent for a self-affine fractal, seems to be a more robust discriminator for fractality, if other information is available...|$|R

For lambda= 3, for all lambda -lambda*(D), establishes a phase transition for negative activities. In fact, {{we now have the}} following picture for the problem of approximating the partition function with activity lambda on graphs G of max degree D. 1. For -lambda*(D) <lambda<lambda_c(D), the problem admits an FPTAS. 2. For lambda lambda_c(D), the problem is NP-hard.

50|$|A <b>lambda</b> <b>point</b> {{refrigerator}} is {{a device}} used to cool liquid helium, typically around a superconducting magnet or for low temperature measurements, from approximately 4.2 K to temperatures near the <b>lambda</b> <b>point</b> of helium (approximately 2.17 K), the temperature at which normal fluid helium (helium I) transitions to the superfluid helium II. Cooling {{is achieved by}} pumping the liquid helium in the bath through a cooling coil via a needle valve and vacuum pump. The reduced pressure in the coil causes some of the helium to evaporate, creating a two-phase system within the cooling coil. The heat removed via evaporation lowers {{the temperature of the}} cooling coil closer to the <b>lambda</b> <b>point.</b> Since the cooling coil is immersed in the liquid helium bath, liquid surrounding the coil is also cooled. The colder, higher density liquid sinks away from the coil toward the bottom of the bath while the warmer, lower density liquid helium rises to the top. Liquid helium typically has poor thermal conductivity, so convective currents associated with a temperature gradient in the bath provide a constant flow of this colder liquid helium toward the bottom of the bath, allowing temperatures below 4.2 K to be realized in the helium bath, typically close to 2.2 K.|$|E

The software was capable of registering sample skulls with less than 100 micron error, and was able to target an injection in a mouse with error of roughly 500 microns.
