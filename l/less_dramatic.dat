5|$|Polish October, {{also known}} as October 1956, Polish thaw, or Gomułka's thaw, marked {{a change in the}} {{politics}} of Poland {{in the second half of}} 1956. Some social scientists term it the Polish October Revolution, which, while <b>less</b> <b>dramatic</b> than the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, may have had an even deeper impact on the Eastern Bloc and on the Soviet Union's relationship to its satellite states in Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Radford {{proposed}} protecting several military {{programs from}} funding cuts by reducing numbers of conventional forces, but {{the proposal was}} leaked to the press, causing an uproar in Congress and among U.S. military allies, and the plan was dropped. In 1957, after the other Joint Chiefs of Staff again disagreed on how to downsize force levels amid more budget restrictions, Radford submitted ideas for <b>less</b> <b>dramatic</b> force downsizing directly to Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, who agreed to pass them along to Eisenhower.|$|E
5|$|New York's success {{continued}} in the 1960s. They finished 9–3 in 1959 and faced the Colts in a championship game rematch. They lost again, this time in a far <b>less</b> <b>dramatic</b> game, 31–16. Led by quarterback Y. A. Tittle and head coach Allie Sherman, the Giants won three consecutive Eastern Division titles from 1961–1963. In 1961, they were beaten 37–0 by the Packers. In 1962, {{they went into the}} championship game with a league-best 12–2 record and a nine–game winning streak, but they lost to the Packers again, 16–7.|$|E
25|$|In Düsseldorf Gude met Carl Friedrich Lessing who, while {{initially}} aloof, became Gude's {{friend and}} colleague. Their relationship {{was such a}} close one that Gude's eldest daughter eventually married one of Lessing's sons. The two artists differed in style though, with <b>Lessing</b> painting <b>dramatic,</b> historical works while Gude never once introduced historical events into his own paintings.|$|R
50|$|To act with, {{she was a}} joy. To direct, she {{was often}} challenging, forever questioning, not content to accept things purely on face value and, like any good actor, never {{settling}} for anything <b>less</b> than <b>dramatic</b> truth. If that makes her sound a tough proposition, then once her questions were answered, doubts reassured, she was fiercely loyal to you and the production.|$|R

5|$|Nonetheless, {{some social}} scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one <b>less</b> <b>dramatic</b> than its Hungarian {{counterpart}} but one {{which may have}} had an even more profound impact on the Eastern Bloc. Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iván T. Berend claims that while {{the effects of the}} Polish October on the Eastern Bloc may be disputed, it set the course for the eventual fall of communism in the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Baorangia bicolor, {{also known}} as the two-colored bolete or red and yellow bolete after its {{two-tone}} coloring scheme of red and yellow, is an edible fungus in the genus Baorangia. It inhabits most of eastern North America, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains and in season during the summer and fall months but can be found across the globe in China and Nepal. Its fruit body, the mushroom, is classed as medium or large in size, which helps distinguish it from the many similar appearing species that have a smaller stature. A deep blue/indigo bruising of the pore surface and a <b>less</b> <b>dramatic</b> bruising coloration change in the stem {{over a period of several}} minutes are identifying characteristics that distinguish it from the similar poisonous species Boletus sensibilis. There are two variations of this species, variety borealis and variety subreticulatus, and several other similar species of fungi are not poisonous.|$|E
5|$|In November, Chaplin {{began working}} with Cherrill again {{in some of the}} Flower Girl's <b>less</b> <b>dramatic</b> scenes. While waiting for her scenes for several months, Cherrill had become bored and openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she could leave early so that she could go to a hair appointment. Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and {{replaced}} her with Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in The Gold Rush. However, Hale's screen tests proved that she was unsuitable for the role. Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress Violet Krauth, but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators. Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish City Lights. She demanded and got a raise to $75 per week. Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary Unknown Chaplin along with an unused opening sequence.|$|E
5000|$|According to an April 1993 {{review of}} the book by Fred Magdoff, rural ghettos are often [...] "omitted from most people's {{conception}} of poverty." [...] Generally, [...] "rural poverty is <b>less</b> visually <b>dramatic</b> than urban poverty--poorly insulated mobile homes and weather-beaten single family houses look almost quaint compared to urban tenements." [...] Magdoff goes on {{to point out the}} reality of poverty in rural areas does not fit a common conception of idyllic farms.|$|R

5|$|In newts and salamanders, {{metamorphosis}} is <b>less</b> <b>dramatic</b> than in frogs. This {{is because}} the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land. Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{enjoyed a}} run of success {{over the next several}} years. Led by league MVP quarterback Charlie Conerly, who passed for 1,706yards, 14 touchdowns, and four interceptions, they {{finished}} 9–3 in 1959 and faced the Colts in a championship game rematch. They lost again, this time in a far <b>less</b> <b>dramatic</b> game, 31–16. Conerly struggled with age and injuries in 1960, and was replaced by George Shaw. Gifford was concussed in a vicious hit by Chuck Bednarik during a November game versus the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed the rest of the season, and the following season, as a result. The hit was so devastating, that after being taken to the locker room, Gifford was given his last rites. The team still finished with a winning record at 6–4–2, but were led to acquire former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Y. A. Tittle in the offseason. Led by Tittle and new head coach Allie Sherman, New York won three consecutive Eastern Division titles from 1961 to 1963. In 1961, they were beaten by the Packers, 37–0 in the championship game. In 1962, they went into the championship game with a 12–2 record, and a nine-game winning streak; but lost to the Packers again, 16–7. Nonetheless, the Giants had captivated New York by this time, even though the sold out game was played in single-digit weather with 35mph winds, only 299 of the 65,000+ fans who bought tickets stayed home. Before the 1962 season, Gifford came out of his injury-forced retirement, saying he missed the game too much. He changed positions from halfback to flanker. During the season, Tittle and wide receiver Del Shofner set still-standing team records when Tittle threw for seven touchdowns and Shofner amassed 269 receiving yards in the same game on October 28. After the season, the team traded two-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Roosevelt Grier to the Los Angeles Rams at his request; Grier wanted to move to LA to start his singing career.|$|E

50|$|Other {{important}} aspect of London’s peculiar image is a recent collaboration between the Duchess of Cambridge and Alexander McQueen fashion brand. Clothes produced for the Duchess can be called revolutionary in a certain sense, as they are woman-friendly, <b>less</b> pretentious and <b>dramatic.</b> This speaks about a certain democratization of the brand, that becomes more affordable for common consumers and perceived as a street style item rather than high fashion royal attribute.|$|R

40|$|The {{meta-analysis}} {{has been}} an invaluable tool {{in the evaluation of}} adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and has supported the use of tamoxifen, anthracyclines, and taxanes via the compilation of results from small trials that individually yielded <b>less</b> than <b>dramatic</b> results. Indeed, recent results of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis demonstrated the enduring benefit in 15 -year recurrence-free and overall survival for 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen for women of any age with early-stage steroid receptor–positive breast cancer (1). It also confirmed an age-related increase in the risks of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer without an excess in non-breast cancer–related deaths. In recent years, the use of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women has been eclipsed by enthusiasm about aromatase inhibitors. Multiple studies have documented a greater reduction in breas...|$|R
50|$|The {{distribution}} of Haplogroup D-M174 is found among {{nearly all the}} populations of Central Asia and Northeast Asia south of the Russian border, although generally at a low frequency of 2% or <b>less.</b> A <b>dramatic</b> spike {{in the frequency of}} D-M174 occurs as one approaches the Tibetan Plateau. D-M174 is also found at high frequencies among Japanese people, but it fades into low frequencies in Korea and China proper between Japan and Tibet. The claim that the Navajo people and Tibetans are related, while discussed among linguists since Edward Sapir, has not found support in genetic studies. Some light has been shed on their origins, however, by one genetic study in which it was indicated that Tibetan Y-chromosomes had multiple origins, one from Central Asia while the other from East Asia.|$|R
5000|$|The album has {{consistently}} been praised by critics. Reviewing the album in Rolling Stone, Kurt Loder wrote [...] "Avalon {{takes a long}} time to kick in, but it finally does, and its a good one. Bryan Ferry stars as a remarkably expressive keyboard player and singer whose familiar mannerisms are subsumed in a rich, benevolent self-assurance. And reed man Andy Mackay shines in a series of cameos (his oboe meditation on Ferrys [...] "Tara" [...] is particularly lovely). Ten years after its debut, Roxy Music has mellowed: the occasional stark piano chords in [...] "While My Heart Is Still Beating," [...] for example, recall the stately mood of [...] "A Song for Europe," [...] but the sound is softer, dreamier and <b>less</b> determinedly <b>dramatic</b> now. Ferrys songwriting, however, has seldom seemed stronger." ...|$|R

50|$|While these social, economic, and {{political}} complexities formed Picasso’s sympathies, perceptions, and expressions, many {{scholars argue that}} his apparent interest is <b>less</b> ideological than <b>dramatic.</b> One can quickly draw {{the link between the}} representation of the underclass depicted in his canvases with Social Realism—a movement that criticized social structures maintaining the miserable conditions of the working class and the poor.

50|$|In 1827 Schirmer and Carl Friedrich Lessing {{founded a}} Society for Landscape Composition that would meet {{a few times}} each year at Schirmer's home where Schirmer would offer advice on the {{composition}} of landscape paintings. Fifteen years later Gude began attending the meetings of the society with other students from his class, but as he progressed to greater levels of realism Gude began {{to make it clear}} that he did not agree with the ideas of composition Schirmer put forward during the meetings, saying specifically: I painted a large mountain view for which my studies of the Rondane Mountainsprovided the subject, and I had severe problems because Schirmer did not approve of the realistic rendering, and his suggestion that I should group the mountains more in accordance with the Classical ideal was impossible for me to accept.

500|$|Numerous {{other writers}} and works have been {{mentioned}} as possible sources from which the elements of Winesburg, Ohio were drawn, most of them either denied or unacknowledged by Anderson himself. The influence of Theodore Dreiser and the Russians (Chekhov, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy) were discounted by the author, the former for stylistic reasons, the latter because he had apparently not read them prior to writing his book. While Anderson expressed an admiration for Ivan Turgenev's A Sportsman's Sketches, the affinities between Turgenev's novel and Winesburg, Ohio ("...both are episodic novels containing loosely bound but closely related sketches, both depend for impact <b>less</b> on <b>dramatic</b> action than on climactic lyrical insight, and in both the individual sketches frequently end with bland understatements that form an ironic coda {{to the body of}} the writing" [...] ) may not be a sign of influence since it is not known whether Anderson read the book before writing Winesburg, Ohio. Finally, the regional focus on the Midwest has been linked to the writing of Mark Twain, particularly The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and while Anderson read and revered Twain, the connection between Twain and Winesburg, Ohio has largely been made by scholars seeking to place the book within the canon of American literature, not necessarily by the author.|$|R
