30|$|Para {{rubber tree}} (Hevea brasiliensis) {{is a major}} {{economically}} important bio-resource because its sap-like extract (known as latex) can be collected and is {{the primary source of}} natural rubber. The white or yellow latex occurs in <b>latex</b> <b>vessels</b> in the bark, mostly outside the phloem. According to world food and agriculture organization (FAO) statistics, in 2010, Thailand produced the highest quantity (3, 051, 780 metric tons) of natural rubber in the world followed by Indonesia (2, 788, 300 metric tons) and Malaysia (858, 900 metric tons) [1]. International Rubber Study Group (IRSG) estimated the production of Para rubber of the world in 2011 to be 10.7 million tons which is more than that of the year 2010 (10.2 million tons) [2]. Main Para rubber products include field latex, concentrated latex, rubber sheet, crepe, and block rubber. Incisions are made orthogonally to the <b>latex</b> <b>vessels,</b> just deep enough to tap the vessels without harming the tree’s growth, and the sap is collected in small buckets. It is known that harvesting can be started once the trees are 5 – 6  years old. The field latex is the primary raw material for other processes. Total solid content (TSC) and dry rubber content (DRC) of field latex are the most important parameters in trading. However, the conventional wet-lab measurement procedures in terms of these parameters are time consuming and require technical experts. Therefore, it is preferable to introduce convenient evaluation technique at in-line process for rubber products or on-site work of Para rubber tree plantation.|$|R

Any difference noted later between the plants could only be attributed to the treatment and in several cases chromosome doubling has been achieved. In this way the pair was constituted by a diploid (2 n = 36) and a tetraploid plant (2 n = 72). The results show that in the polyploid as compared to the normal plants the stomata are larger and in smaller number per area unit. Some morphological differences were also noticed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thailand is {{the world}} leader in the {{production}} of latex extracted from the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). However, the most cultivated clone RRIM 600, is highly susceptible to dis-eases, and there is economic incentive to develop new rubber tree clones. Four rubber tree clones (T 2, SK 1, NK 1 and SK 3) that have high latex yield potential from plantations in Southern Thailand were selected for this study. Yield performance, latex biochemical parameters and anatomical characteristics of bark were monitored for two years, using RRIM 600 clones in the same fields as paired controls. The average yields of the clones SK 1, NK 1 and SK 3 were 129. 3, 74. 2 and 53. 9 g per tree per tapping, respectively, surpassing the paired RRIM 600 controls (94. 3, 49. 9 and 43. 9 g per tree per tapping in matching order). There was a difference in girth increment of SK 1, SK 3 and T 2 clones when compared with RRIM 600, whereas the clones SK 1 and T 2 had higher renewed bark thickness than the paired RRIM 600. The anatomical measurements showed that the diameter of the <b>latex</b> <b>vessels</b> and density of <b>latex</b> <b>vessels</b> mm− 2 were the highest in clone NK 1, which also had the best latex biochemical parameters.

For this purpose, 37 rubber tree families were obtained and assessed in a randomized complete block design, with three unbalanced replications. The field trial was carried out at the Experimental Station of UNESP, located in Selvíria, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The quantitative traits evaluated were: girth (G), bark thickness (BT), number of <b>latex</b> <b>vessel</b> rings (NR), and plant height (PH). Given the unbalanced condition of the progeny test, the REML/BLUP procedure was used for estimation. The narrow-sense individual heritability estimates were 0. 43 for G, 0. 18 for BT, 0. 01 for NR, and 0. 51 for PH. Two selection strategies were adopted: one short-term (ST - selection intensity of 8. 85 %) and the other long-term (LT - selection intensity of 26. 56 %). For G, the estimated genetic gains {{in relation to the}} population average were 26. 80 % and 17. 94 %, respectively, according to the ST and LT strategies.

The half-cystine residues in hevein and cucumber chitinase are located at identical positions. Hevamine is a basic protein from the lutoids (vacuoles) of rubber latex and may have a role in plugging the <b>latex</b> <b>vessels</b> and cessation of latex flow. The differences in cellular location, charge properties and sequence between hevamine and cucumber chitinase are similar to those between class I and class II chitinases from tobacco and other plant species...|$|R
50|$|The cells (laticifers) {{in which}} latex is found {{make up the}} laticiferous system, which can form in two very {{different}} ways. In many plants, the laticiferous system is formed from rows of cells laid down in the meristem of the stem or root. The cell walls between these cells are dissolved so that continuous tubes, called <b>latex</b> <b>vessels,</b> are formed. Since these vessels are made of many cells, they are known as articulated laticifers. This method of formation {{is found in the}} poppy family and in the rubber trees (Para rubber tree, members of the family Euphorbiaceae, members of the mulberry and fig family, such as the Panama rubber tree Castilla elastica), and members of the family Asteraceae. For instance, Parthenium argentatum the guayule plant, is in the tribe Heliantheae; other latex-bearing Asteraceae with articulated laticifers include members of the Cichorieae, a clade whose members produce latex, some of them in commercially interesting amounts. This includes Taraxacum kok-saghyz, a species cultivated for latex production.|$|R
40|$|The Hevea {{breeding}} {{program of}} Instituto Agronômico de Campinas (IAC) has completed clonal evaluation {{on the following}} series: IAC 100, IAC 200 and IAC 300. The performance of 22 clones of Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell. -Arg., evolved at IAC, {{over a period of}} eleven years was evaluated in the Western Central part of the São Paulo State, Brazil. Among these 22 new clones, six were intraspecific hybrid clones (IAC 400, IAC 404, IAC 405, IAC 406, IAC 410, IAC 412) and the remaining are primary those resulted from selected ortets within half-sib progenies. An old popular clone RRIM 600, of Malaysian origin, was used as the control. The trial was laid out in a randomized block design with three replications. Yield performance over a period of four years, mean girth at the 11 th year, girth increment before tapping and on tapping, thermal property of natural rubber produced, bark thickness, number of <b>latex</b> <b>vessel</b> rows in seven year virgin bark, percentage incidence of tapping panel dryness, wind damage and diseases like leaf and panel anthracnose have been observed. Sixty one percent of the clones were superior in relation to the control for yield. The clone IAC 400 recorded the highest yield (97. 40 g tree- 1 tap- 1) over four years of tapping, followed by IAC 411 (78. 87 tree- 1 tap- 1), whereas the control clone RRIM 600 recorded 50. 86 g tree- 1 tap- 1. All selected clones were vigorous in growth. Girth increment of these clones was average to above average. Except for IAC 423, other clones had thick virgin bark at opening ranging from 4. 84 mm for IAC 401 to 6. 38 mm for IAC 416. The natural rubbers from IAC clones have shown good thermal stability up to 300 ºC and no differences in the thermal behavior among rubber from clones of the IAC series and the clone RRIM 600 were found in inert atmosphere...|$|E

Müell. Arg.). Vinte e duas progênies de meios-irmãos foram plantadas na Estação Experimental de Votuporanga, SP, no delineamento de blocos ao acaso, com cinco repetições e dez plantas por parcela. Aos três anos de idade foram avaliados os caracteres: número de anéis de vasos laticíferos (NA), produção de borracha seca (PB), espessura de casca (EC) e circunferência do caule (CC). Os resultados demonstraram haver variabilidade significativa entre progênies quanto aos caracteres PB, EC e CC. As estimativas de coeficientes de herdabilidade e de predição genética foram mais elevadas nas progênies, com valores mais expressivos quanto aos coeficientes de predição genética. Ganhos genéticos adicionais foram obtidos pela seleção combinada. Embora os referidos ganhos tenham sido de pequena magnitude, recomenda-se o uso do método, por propiciar maior acurácia e ganho genético. Os valores mais expressivos de acurácia e ganho genético foram estimados pelo método multivariado. The {{objective of}} this paper was to estimate the heritability coefficients by the univariate method and genetic prediction by the multivariate method, as well as to compare the genetic gain obtained by individual and combined selection between and within progenies, in rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Müell. Arg.). Twenty two half-sib progenies were established at the Experimental Station, in Votuporanga, São Paulo State, Brazil, following the randomized block design, with five replications and ten plants per plot. Three years after planting, number of <b>latex</b> <b>vessel</b> rings (NR), yield of dry rubber (YB), bark thickness (BT) and stalk circunference (SC) were evaluated. The results showed significant variability among progenies for YB, BT and SC characters. The heritability coefficients and genetic prediction to progenies level were high, with expressive values for the genetic prediction coefficients. Additional genetic gains were obtained by combined selection. Although the genetic gains had been small, this method is recommended, because it gives a better improvement and genetic gain. The most expressive values of improvement and genetic gain were estimated by multivariate method...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho foi realizado com o objetivo de determinar a existência e as {{magnitudes}} de correlações e regressões lineares simples em plântulas jovens de seringueira (Hevea spp.), para melhor condução de seleção nos futuros trabalhos de melhoramento. Foram utilizadas médias de produção de borracha seca por plântulas por corte, através do teste Hamaker-Morris-Mann (P); circunferência do caule (CC); espessura de casca (EC); número de anéis (NA); diâmetro dos vasos (DV); densidade dos vasos laticíleros (D) e distância média entre anéis de vasos consecutivos (DMEAVC) em um viveiro de cruzamento com três anos e meio de idade. Os resultados mostraram, entre outros fatores, que as correlações lineares simples de P com CC, EC, NA, D, DV e DMEAVC foram, respectivamente, r =t 0, 61, 0, 34, 0, 28, 0, 29, 0, 43 e - 0, 13. As correlações de CC com EC, NA, D, DV e DMEAVC foram: 0, 65, 0, 22, 0, 37, 0, 33 e 0, 096 respectivamente. Estudos de regressão linear simples de P com CC, EC, NA, DV, D e DMEAVC sugerem que CC foi o caráter independente mais significativo, contribuindo com 36 % da variação em P. Em relação ao vigor, a regressão de CC com os respectivos caracteres sugere que EC foi o único caráter que contribuiu significativamente para a variação de CC com 42 %. As altas correlações observadas da produção com circunferência do caule e com espessura de casca evidenciam a possibilidade de obter genótipos jovens de boa capacidade produtiva e grande vigor, através de seleção precoce dessas variáveis. This {{study was}} undertaken aiming {{to determine the}} existence of linear correlations, based on simple regression studies for a better improvement of young rubber tree (Hevea spp.) breeding and selection. The characters studied were: yield of dry rubber per tapping by Hamaker-Morris-Mann test tapping (P), mean gurth (CC), bark thickness (EC), number of <b>latex</b> <b>vessel</b> rings (NA), diameter of latex vesseis (DV), density of latex vesseis per 5 mm within rings (D) and distance between latex vesseis rings (DMEAVC) in a three and haif years old nursery. The results showed that among other characters, the correlation values between P and CC, EC, NA, DV, D, DMEAVC were r = 0. 61, 0. 34, 0. 28, 0. 29, 0. 43 and - 0. 13 respectively. The correlation coefficients values between CC and EC, NA, DV, D, DMEAVC were: r = 0. 65, 0. 22, 0. 37, 0. 33 and 0. 096 respectively. Linear simple regression of P with CC, EC, NA, DV, D and DMEAVC suggested that CC was the only important and significant character accounting for 36 % of the variation on P. Concerning with vigor, the regression of CC on the same characters suggest that EC was the only important and significant character accounting for 42 % of the variation on CC. The high correlation of mean girth with yield and bark thickness showed {{that it is possible}} to obtain high yielding young ortets through early selection of these characters...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} performance of panel clones under crowns resistant to South American leaf blight (Microcyclus ulei). The experiment was carried out with 18 panel clones crown-budded with Hevea pauciflora x H. guianensis, in a Xanthic Ferralsol (Oxisol) in Manaus, AM, Brazil. The following parameters were evaluated: dry rubber yield, plant nutritional status, and anatomical and physiological characteristics of the <b>latex</b> <b>vessels.</b> In {{the first three years of}} evaluation, the panel clones IAN 2878, IAN 2903, CNS AM 7905, CNS AM 7905 P 1, and PB 28 / 59 showed the highest dry rubber yield potential, while the clones IAN 6158, IAN 6590, and IAN 6515 should not be recommended for crown budding. Higher potassium and copper foliar content in panel clones were associated to an increase in dry rubber yield. The simultaneous evaluation of anatomical and physiological characteristics of latex is fundamental for the selection of panel clones in the Amazon region. Crown budding is an efficient technology for South American leaf blight management in endemic regions. 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the rubber culture and the {{historical}} development of tapping systems in South America and Asia were discussed. The tapping systems were then analysed for many factors: the influence of number, length, direction, inclination, depth, height from the ground and consecutive position of tapping faces on the latex production. Also the influence of cutting hour, cutting frequency and rest periods was studied. The influence of the amount of bark cut on yield and the influence of the age of the bark on the regeneration process were considered. The influence of external factors on diameter and number of <b>latex</b> <b>vessels</b> in the bark was also studied. The choice of a tapping system was considered from an economic aspect. An analysis was made of cost price and tapping labour. Suggestions were advanced to change the tapping system on the ground of this labour analysis. At that time the trend of development of the tapping systems was still towards less damage to bark. Economic considerations had little influence on the choice of tapping system. But sometimes less frequent cutting was more profitable, even more so on occasion by larger cuts...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Activity of {{polyphenol}} oxidase, {{concentration of}} 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenylethylamine (dopamine), and concentration of ascorbic acid in the pulp of bananas as they ripened were measured and relationships between these factors {{and both the}} extent of browning and the susceptibility to discoloration of the fruit during a 30 -minute holding period were studied. Moisture and protein content were determined also. Bananas from three lots were analyzed as purchased and after either two or four days of additional ripening. Initial browning of the filtrates of bananas {{and the increase in}} browning upon standing were greater as the fruit ripened. Protein content also increased with ripening. Moisture content of bananas increased significantly in those bananas held for four additional days. The specific activity of polyphenol oxidase (units of activity/mg protein) in bananas decreased with ripening, but when the activity was calculated on a basis of dry weight of banana no significant change was observed. Both the dopamine and ascorbic acid contents decreased in individual bananas with ripening. Decrease in the concentration of dopamine was the variable with the highest correlation to the increase in browning in ripening bananas. Both the increase in browning and the decrease in dopamine in ripening bananas were associated with a decrease in ascorbic acid content. Thus, the concentration of dopamine as influenced in part by concentration of ascorbic acid appears to be the limiting factor in the browning of bananas. The specific activity of polyphenol oxidase {{did not appear to be}} a limiting factor in the browning of bananas. Dopamine was located histochemically in the vacuoles of the <b>latex</b> <b>vessels</b> and in a few isolated parenchyma cells of banana. Polyphenol oxidase appeared to occur throughout the pulp...|$|R
