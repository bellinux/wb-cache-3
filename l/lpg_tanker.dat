50|$|An LPG carrier or <b>LPG</b> <b>tanker</b> is a gas carrier/gas {{tanker ship}} {{designed}} for transporting {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (LPG) in bulk.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Fearnley & Eger, a {{shipping}} company likewise based in Norway, decided {{to expand its}} gas tanker fleet and commissioned seven gas carriers. One order was passed to Bergesen and another to Gotaas-Larsen A/S. However, Fearnley & Eger faced financial difficulty in seeing the remaining deals through and another four of their contracts were transferred to Bergesen. Bergesen would also acquire the other vessel from Gotaas-Larsen A/S. These six <b>LPG</b> <b>tankers</b> were the first of Bergesen's gas tanker fleet.By the late 1980s, Bergesen was a prominent owner and operator of large <b>LPG</b> <b>tankers.</b> In 1999, {{it was decided that}} Bergesen would specialise in large and very large gas carriers while A.P. Møller managed small gas carriers and Exmar focused on medium gas carriers.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Robert Kabelac - {{director}} of the BV from 1935 to 1960 - managed to avoid {{the dismantling of the}} BV after war as this happened to most other German shipyards. The company was allowed to resume shipbuilding already in 1949. Production could soon be continued, starting with repair of ships and locomotives and the construction of fishing vessels. Soon later the shipbuilding programme was enlarged and various types of ships were offered to the market as container/multi purpose cargo ships, passenger liners, passenger-cargo vessels, roll-on/roll-off ships, LNG and <b>LPG</b> <b>tankers,</b> supply ships, special-purpose ships, reefer vessels and others. End of the 1970th the BV became world leader in container delivered capacity and in innovative container ship design.|$|R
50|$|Up to the present, {{the yard}} has {{delivered}} more than 200 vessels including barges, tugboats, ferry boats, fishing vessels, general cargo and bulk carriers, container ships, oil and chemical <b>tankers,</b> <b>LPG's,</b> cement carriers and war vessels.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{reduction of}} risk in LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) road transport due {{to the adoption of}} passive fire protections was investigated. Experimental data available for small scale vessels fully engulfed by a fire were extended to real scale road and rail tankers through a finite elements model. The results of mathematical simulations of real scale fire engulfment scenarios that may follow accidents involving <b>LPG</b> <b>tankers</b> proved the effectiveness of the thermal protections in preventing the "fired" BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion) scenario. The presence of a thermal coating greatly increases the "time to failure", providing a time lapse that in the European experience may be considered sufficient to allow the start of effective mitigation actions by fire brigades. The results obtained were used to calculate the expected reduction of individual and societal risk due to LPG transportation in real case scenarios. The analysis confirmed that the introduction of passive fire protections turns out in a significant {{reduction of risk}}, up to an order of magnitude in the case of individual risk and of about 50 % if the expectation value is considered. Thus, the adoption of passive fire protections, not compulsory in European regulations, may be an effective technical measure for risk reduction, and may contribute to achieve the control of "major accidents hazards" cited by the European legislation. © 2009 Elsevier B.

5000|$|The {{gathering}} became {{violent and}} started damaging {{private and public}} property. It also tried to set fire to a <b>LPG</b> gas <b>tanker.</b> (Please Take a note this was later found foul by a Special Investigating Committee, and still Manohar Kadam was freed and activists were imprisoned). In order to discourage the mob from doing so (which otherwise {{would have resulted in}} extensive damage to human life and property) and for self-defence, the Police resorted to a [...] "Cane-Charge" [...] and subsequently, having failed to control the mob, opened a fire. Unfortunately, 10 persons died and 24 persons were injured in the firing 8 police personnel were also injured.|$|R
5000|$|A ship's {{engineering}} department {{consists of the}} members of a ship's crew that operate and maintain the propulsion and other systems on board the vessel. Marine Engineering staff also deal with the [...] "Hotel" [...] facilities on board, notably the sewage, lighting, air conditioning and water systems. They deal with bulk fuel transfers, and require training in firefighting and first aid, as well as in dealing with the ship's boats and other nautical tasks- especially with cargo loading/discharging gear and safety systems, though the specific cargo discharge function remains the responsibility of deck officers and deck workers. On <b>LPG</b> and LNG <b>tankers</b> however, a cargo engineer works with the deck department during cargo operations, as well as being a watchkeeping engineer.|$|R
50|$|The {{collision}} {{between the}} <b>LPG</b> <b>tanker</b> and the POL (Petroleum, Oil, Lubricants) oil tanker occurred 2 nautical miles off Kamarajar Port in Ennore - a natural harbour about 20 km {{north of the}} state capital of Chennai on the Coromandel Coast. The Ennore creek (swampy backwater traversing over 13 km between Pulicat Lake {{in the north and}} Kosasthalaiyar river in the south and emptying into the Bay of Bengal) separates the town of Ennore from the Government held public company Kamarajar Port.|$|E
50|$|On November 9, 1974, the Yuyo Maru No.10 (第十雄洋丸), a Japanese <b>LPG</b> <b>tanker,</b> {{collided}} with the Pacific Alice, a Liberian freighter, in Tokyo Bay. 3 hours after the collision, a major explosion and fire occurred on the tanker, which was a unique design carrying both naphtha and LPG. The naphtha fire lasted for {{a week before the}} Japan Self-Defense Forces sank the stricken vessel. The accident resulted in 33 deaths (28 on board Pacific Alice, 5 on board Yuyo Maru No.10) and 8 injuries.|$|E
5000|$|By 8:30 pm, {{passengers}} {{began to}} abandon ship, {{with the aid}} of the crew and local rescue vessels. The passengers were transferred to several ships in the area, including the <b>LPG</b> <b>tanker</b> [...] (Capt. Reedman) and the SeaRail road-rail ferry [...] (Capt John Brew).As darkness set in MS Mikhail Lermontov listed further to starboard. Within 20 minutes of the last passenger being rescued, the ship had disappeared completely, sinking at approximately 10:27 PM, 4 hours and 50 minutes after running aground. The sinking resulted in only one casualty, 33-year-old crew engineer Pavel Zagladimov, who went down with the ship. The coroner's report lists his official cause of death as 'unknown', as his remains were never found. Eleven of those rescued had minor injuries.|$|E
40|$|The BLEVE {{is a kind}} of {{technological}} accident with a major impact on society due to the possibility of causing death and disability on people as well as property damage. This kind of accident {{is the result of the}} production of a pressure wave generated by the release of stored energy, of the heat flux generated by a fireball and the projection of fragments generated by the rupture of the shell and materials from other sources. The probability of a BLEVE happening is greater when the equipment is portable, especially if the transport is made by road. In this work is shown a brief survey of the state of the art in relation to the type of accident BLEVE (phenomenon, construction of tanks and consequences), simulation models of explosions and of the combination of the assessment of the consequences with a road <b>tanker</b> <b>LPG.</b> Finally some conclusions are drawn about the state of the art in this area...|$|R
50|$|These fenders are {{extensively}} {{used for}} {{ship to ship}} transfers at mid seas, double banking operations, and as vessel-to-berth at dock/jetties. The special property of a pneumatic fender is its low reaction force at low deflection. This property of pneumatic fenders makes them the most suitable fender for liquid cargo vessels and defense vessels with very sensitive equipment. These fenders have excellent energy absorption characteristics and linear load deflection characteristics. Pneumatic fenders should comply to the ISO 17357 standard.The pneumatic fender {{is also known as}} the Yokohama fender or floating fender. There are four basic types of pneumatic fenders that comply with the international standard: Type I (Chain&Tyre Net Type), Type II (Sling Type), Type III (Rib Type) and Type IV (Rope Net Type). It has become an ideal ship protection medium used extensively by large <b>tankers,</b> <b>LPG</b> vessels, ocean platforms etc. The most appropriate type will depend on its application and the requirements of the equipment.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLPG Loading /unloading site is {{considered}} as a dangerous environment of significant risk, especially during LPG transfer operations. These risks may cause catastrophic dangers such as BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion), UVCE (Unconfined Vapour Cloud Explosion), etc. The site consists of a tank (RST) containing LPG and threetransfer posts. Two posts allow loading of small carrier tankers 6 tons. The other one transfer post transfer <b>LPG</b> contained injumbo <b>tankers</b> 20 tons inside the tank. The industrial site at risks chooses to demonstrate {{the need for a}} modelling-simulation approach. The aim is to check first compliance and authorization of the truck when it enters the site for loading /unloading, to verify the authorization to make the transfer, and then, to identify the driver and his training to ensure that the transfer operations are going to take place without incident. Sometimes, it may happen that Consignment Operator (CO) is busy orabsent and thus the driver operates alone without being authorized, in this case the site risks a loss of control {{due to a lack of}} resources. The modelling-simulation will be done using multi-agent systems that will present the drivers, trucks, PO and loading unloading posts as agents in order to have a model facilitating this checking...|$|R
5000|$|The 2017 Ennore {{oil spill}} was an oil spill that {{occurred}} outside the Kamarajar Port in Ernavoor, Tamil Nadu, India, on 28 January 2017.23 The spill {{occurred when the}} outbound empty <b>LPG</b> <b>tanker</b> M.T. BW Maple collided with the inbound fully loaded oil tanker M.T. Dawn Kanchipuram around 04:00 local time. In total around 196 tonnes of bunker fuel oil spilled into the sea. The coastline from Ennore southwards until Pondicherry (a stretch of 180km) was in different severity affected by the spill, with the shore of Ennore most severly hit. There were reports of dead fish and dead olive ridley turtle along the coast on different beaches in Chennai and around. The impact of the spill has directly affected the local fishing community as there was a sharp fall in fish sale due to the existing notion amongst public that fishes are contaminated with oil and not fit to consume. Workers had to clean the oil on the shore without adequate protection which lead to skin irritation, throat irritation and breathing problems.|$|E
5000|$|Izumi {{has become}} the first vessel of a fleet of {{captured}} merchant vessels that have been called [...] "Large Pirate Support Vessels" [...] (LPSVs) and been considered [...] "game-changing"; previously pirates had used only dhows and fishing boats as motherships. This new strategy of using merchant vessels presents an escalation {{in the war against}} pirates. The use of merchant vessels enlarges the range of operations, increases transit speed, allows more pirates and skiffs to be taken along, provides better accommodations, gives access to radar and navigational technology, and reduces dependency on sea and weather conditions. [...] Using a larger ship, the pirates can attack ships of equal size and apply heavier weapons from a more stable firing platform; skiffs would still be used to board the victim vessel. The presence of hostages on such ships poses a problem for naval forces, as their superior firepower cannot be effectively applied. The size of the captured merchant ships, however, makes it easier to detect them and avoid them. By the end of 2010 four other merchant vessels had been enrolled as pirate motherships, namely the <b>LPG</b> <b>tanker</b> , the chemical tanker , the tanker , and the chemical tanker [...]|$|E
50|$|Same day, fire man Lakshmanan Pillai (P. Sreekumar) has his send {{off from}} service. Later Achari is seen driving {{away in his}} car and causing an {{accident}} making an <b>LPG</b> <b>tanker</b> topple on the road. There are casualties and the police and the fire force arrive and try to contain the situation. However, the tanker springs a leak and a police officer inadvertly causes an explosion despite Pillai's best efforts to thwart this. Pillai is wounded in the ensuing explosion destroying his lower body. Fire man Vijay (Mammooty) appears heroically to the scene and takes over the reins of the disaster avertment. Vijay and the police force clashes as to what action plan to take. Later Vijay is given full reins of the project. Some time later Achari appears and threatens to light up the area if his daughter is not found within two hours. Vijay tries to calm him, blaming the police for humiliating him. Later, residents at jail comes to know of the gas leak and shouts to get out. The police with the help of Iqbal calms them down.A refinery technician who checks the tanker finds that the screws were not properly connected to the truck. Simultaneously the police gets information that the tanker drivers have gone missing. Vijay predicts that the tanker accident was pre planned by a man identified as Achari, to break his criminal friend out of the central jail.However the force is left with no option but to vacate the jail. After a series of events, Vijay locks himself in jail in order to find out who the wannabe free prisoner is, and finds the culprit successfully. He also instructs his unit to refill the LPG in the tanker to a new tanker, thus thwarting a major disaster.Next day, Vijay and his team, who are supposed to attend the funeral of their dear colleagues, get an emergency call and decide to thwart the accident. As the hero says, a commoner dialling 101 believes that a fireman would come in any problem to save him.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An LPG (liquefied {{petroleum}} gas) storage {{accident was}} reconstructed through several simulation models, with {{the aims of}} the reported and filmed effects and damage. The accident happened in Paese, near Treviso (Italy) in March 1996 and was characterized by complex phenomena due to a choked release of <b>LPG</b> from a <b>tanker.</b> There was a dispersion of light winds and, after about 40 minutes, a flash-fire throughout followed by a transient jet release and BLEVE (boiling-liquid-expanding-vapour explosion). The evolution of these phenomena was studied by application of some available models. The primary purpose of these applications was to check the possible use and the efficiency of the simulation models using comparisons and evidence on the dynamics of the accident. Another purpose was to get more detailed information on the dynamics of the accident. The work was done in collaboration with the Fire Brigade of Rovigo, the University of Padova and ARTES (consulting on risk analysis – Mirano – Venezia). Complex situations, such as the dispersion of heavy gas in a semi-confined area, with light winds and variable atmospheric stabilities, prolonged time of release with different types of flow, various types of fire (flash fire, transient jet fire, BLEVE and fireball) were simulated with adaptations of models or input to obtain realistic results...|$|R
