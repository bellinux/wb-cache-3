Whether {{or not it was}} sent by Doom himself remains to be seen, as does his role in the overall conflict. Doom was not invited to the wedding of Storm and the Black Panther. However, he did send a present: an {{invitation}} to form an alliance with Latveria, using the Civil War currently going on among the hero community as a reason to quite possibly forge an alliance between their two countries. When Black Panther, on a diplomatic mission to other countries with Storm, did show up in Latveria, he presented them with a real present and extended another invitation to form an alliance with Black Panther. He demonstrated behavior very uncharacteristic of him, however, {{which may or may not}} become a plot point later. Panther spurned the invitation, detonating an EMP that blacked out a <b>local</b> <b>portion</b> of Latveria before Doctor Doom 's robots could destroy his ship. Later on, Doom is then shown collaborating with the Red Skull on a weapon which will only [...] "be the beginning" [...] of Captain America's suffering. Von Doom gave the Red Skull the weapon because the Red Skull gave Victor pieces of technology from an old German castle. The castle was owned by a [...] "Baron of Iron" [...] centuries prior, who had used his technological genius to protect himself and his people. The map the Red Skull used to find the castle bore a picture of Von Doom. Doom states that the technology the Red Skull gave him is more advanced than what he currently has and that he will become the Baron of Iron in his future; although he does not agree with the Red Skull's principles, the time paradox the situation causes forces him to comply. The Red Skull is currently in the process of reverse-engineering Doom's weapon for multiple uses, rather than the single use Doctor Doom agreed to.|$|E

50|$|Comment: A rare {{situation}} of a voting deadlock (by missing blocked votes) can happen, with no voting for any transaction on the related cycle {{by any of}} the database systems involved with these transactions. This can occur when local sub-transactions are multi-threaded. The highest probability instance of such rare event involves two transactions on two simultaneous opposite cycles. Such global cycles (deadlocks) overlap with local cycles which are resolved locally, and thus typically resolved by local mechanisms without involving atomic commitment. Formally it is also a global cycle, but practically it is <b>local</b> (<b>portions</b> of <b>local</b> cycles generate a global one; to see this, split each global transaction (node) to <b>local</b> sub-transactions (its <b>portions</b> confined each to a single database); a directed edge exists between transactions if an edge exists between any respective local sub-transactions; a cycle is local if all its edges originate from a cycle among sub-transactions of the same database, and global if not; global and local can overlap: a same cycle among transactions can result from several different cycles among sub-transactions, and be both local and global).|$|R

Complex polygonal plant models and whole plant populations are represented by relatively small sets of point and line primitives.

The scene is hierarchically divided into <b>local</b> <b>portions</b> of geometry to achieve large reduction factors for distant regions. Additionally, the data reduction is adapted to the visual importance of geometric objects.

40|$|Abstract — Many {{perception}} {{problems in}} robotics such as object recognition, scene understanding, and mapping are tackled using scale-invariant interest points extracted from intensity images. Since interest points describe only <b>local</b> <b>portions</b> {{of objects and}} scenes, they offer robustness to clutter, occlusions, and intra-class variation. In this paper, we present an efficient approximate algorithm to extract surface normal interest points (SNIPs) in corners and blob-like surface regions from depth images. The interest points are detected on characteristic scales that indicate their spatial extent. Our method is {{able to cope with}} irregularly sampled, noisy measurements which are typical to depth imaging devices. It also offers a trade-off between computational speed and accuracy which allows our approach to be applicable {{in a wide range of}} problem sets. We evaluate our approach on depth images of basic geometric shapes, more complex objects, and indoor scenes. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a new {{scheme based on}} quadratic C 1 -splines on type- 2 triangulations approximating gridded data.

In this way, each polynomial piece of the approxi-mating spline is immediately available from <b>local</b> <b>portions</b> of the data, without using prescribed derivatives at any point of the domain. Since the Bernstein-Bézier coefficients of the splines are computed directly, an intermediate step making use of certain locally supported splines spanning the space is not needed. We prove that the splines yield optimal approximation order for smooth functions, where we provide explicit constants in the corresponding error bounds. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe local methods which use qua-dratic C 1 -splines on the type- 2 triangulation to approximate data on...|$|R

The bacterial operation in the Pseudo-Bacterial Genetic Algorithm (PBGA) is efficient in improving <b>local</b> <b>portions</b> of chromosomes. In the experiments presented in this paper a gene transfer operation is introduced in the place of the crossover operation in the PBGA. The gene transfer operation allows the chromosomes to directly transfer information to the other counterparts in the population. The gene transfer is inspired by the phenomenon of transfer of strands of genes between bacteria that occurs in nature. By means of this mechanism, one bacterium can rapidly spread its genetic information to other cells. Numerical experiments were performed to show the effectiveness of the PBGA with the gene transfer operation. The obtained results show the benefits that can be obtained with the newly introduced operation. 1. Introduction Genetic Algorithms (GA) represent a class of optimization te [...] ...|$|R
