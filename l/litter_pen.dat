40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} were conducted comparing {{the performance of}} broilers reared in a cage system to broilers in a <b>litter</b> <b>pen</b> system. The caged broilers were compared on mree differ-ent types of floor mats: plastic, soft rubber, and hard rubber. Broilers reared in litter pens were sig-nificantly heavier (P<. 05) than the caged broilers in Experiments 1 and 2. Broilers reared on plastic mats had significantly more (P<. 05) swollen feather follicles than did broilers reared in litter pens or on rubber mats. The occurrence of abnormal legs was approximately equal among the live broil-ers reared in cages or in litter pens. There were significantly more (P<. 05) processed broilers with missing skin on the breast for broilers reared in litter pens than in cages in Experiment 2 but not in Experiment 1. No difference was found for missing skin on the breast between the broilers reared on plastic and rubber mats in cages in Experiment 3. There were significantly fewer (P<. 05) proc-essed broilers with missing wings for broilers reared in littpr ppns compared to those reared in cages. At {{the end of the}} three experiments the plastic mats were still in good condition,-while the rubber mats showed considerable deterioration...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out on Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to {{determine}} the effect of sex, colour and weight group on various organ weights. The birds were housed in deep <b>litter</b> <b>pen</b> at the poultry unit of University of Maiduguri Teaching and Research Farm. Birds were fed with broiler starter marsh from 5 - 8 weeks then, layer mash from 8 - 52 weeks. The birds were divided into various groups (sex, colour and weight groups). The experiment lasted for 52 weeks. Birds were slaughtered and eviscerated. The organs were weighed using sensitive scale and the results obtained were subjected to statistical analysis using Analysis of Variance (SPSS 16. 0 statistical package) and the means were separated using Duncan Multiple Range Test. Effect of color on organ weight were statistically not significant (p> 0. 05) except for fat weight, while the effect of sex on organ weight indicated that male and female differed significantly (p< 0. 05) for all organ weights except liver weight. Similarly, weight group had significant effect (p< 0. 05) on all the carcass traits except liver and testicular weight. The information obtaained in this study could serve as an immense advantage to farmers in the selection of desirable traits in Japanese quail. This will also enhance the farmers to maximise their profits. © 2012 Sjournals. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Rearing {{birds on}} wire {{flooring}} {{has proven to}} be an effective method for consistently triggering significant levels of lameness in broilers, and while the wire flooring model has been proven effective, more mobile wire floor models have been developed to compliment the facility management conditions within commercial genetic selection programs. The mobile wire floor models have been titled 2 ̆ 2 speed bumps 2 ̆ 2, and through previous evaluation have resulted in significantly higher levels of lameness in broilers compared to litter floor shavings. The current experiment contains two studies (studies 1 and 2). Both studies involved comparing leg weakness between broiler strains; while in study 1 the main objective was to detect the optimal time to introduce speed bumps (SB) into <b>litter</b> flooring <b>pens</b> and study 2 involved developing additional SB models and determining which models were the most efficient at inducing significant levels of lameness. Broiler lines B and D (study 1) and A and B (study 2) were hatched at a commercial hatchery and brought to the University of Arkansas Research Farm where they were reared straight run for 56 days with water and feed ad libitium at a final stocking density of 0. 47 square meters per bird.

40|$|Pig {{production}} {{is an important}} contributor to polluting gases emissions like ammonia (NH 3) and greenhouse gases (GHG). Apart from environmental aspects, animal welfare is also an issue of growing importance. The fattening of pigs on deep litter bedded system is consider as more animal friendly than the fattening on slatted floor, {{but it is also}} more expensive and requests more labour. The use of straw flow rather than straw deep litter could be a good compromise because of a reduced need for surface area, straw, labour and manure storage, combined with satisfying animal welfare. In order to evaluate the environmental impact of this rearing technique, a study was designed to quantify pollutant gas emissions of this system compared to the deep litter system for fattening pigs. Three successive batches of 32 Landrace fattening pigs were used. They were divided into 2 homogeneous groups of 16 animals randomly allocated to two treatments: straw deep litter or straw flow. The groups were kept simultaneously for a period of 4 months and separately in two identical rooms in volume (103 m 3) and surface (30. 2 m 2) and fitted either with a deep <b>litter</b> <b>pen</b> (1. 2 m 2 /pig) or with a straw flow system (0. 75 m 2 /pig). Throughout the fattening period, 46. 9 and 34. 4 kg straw were used respectively per pig. In deep <b>litter</b> <b>pen,</b> the litter was removed after each batch. In the straw flow pen, the straw, mixed with dung, travelled down the slope by pig motion and went out of the pen to a scraped passage. The solid fraction was scraped every day, stored in a heap in the room and removed every month, 1 week before each period of gaseous emission measurement. The liquid fraction was automatically pumped from the scraped passage into a hermetic tank, which was emptied {{at the end of each}} fattening period. In both rooms, ventilation was automatically adapted to maintain a constant ambient temperature. Once a month, the emissions of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and water vapour (H 2 O) were measured continuously for 6 consecutive days by infra-red photoacoustic detection. Animal performance (final body weight, body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio), some carcass quality parameters and manure characteristics were not significantly affected by floor type. With fattening pigs kept in a straw flow pen, gaseous emissions were significantly greater (P < 0. 05) for NH 3 (+ 10 %) and significantly lower (P < 0. 001) for N 2 O (− 55 %), CH 4 (− 46 %), CO 2 equivalents (− 47 %), CO 2 (− 10 %) and H 2 O (− 23 %) compared to pigs housed on straw-based deep litter. Thus, the use of straw flow system for pig fattening allows reducing the GHG emissions but presents the disadvantage of increasing the NH 3 emissions. Peer reviewe...|$|E

An experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of including feeding graded levels of palm kernel oil residue in rations on some the performance traits and egg characteristics in layers. Ninety-six (96) Lohmann Brown layers at 32 weeks old were fed experimental layer diets, in which PKOR was used to replace wheat bran at levels of 0 % (control), 5 %, 10 % and 15 % to give four dietary treatments, in a completely randomized design feeding trial that lasted for 19 weeks.

Results obtained showed significant differences (P 0. 05) in internal egg quality characteristics like albumen height and Haugh units. Egg weight and egg shell thickness were also significantly (P< 0. 05) affected by the dietary treatments.

40|$|Because of {{increasing}} resistance of Eimeria spp. against anticoccidials, objections of consumers and legislative restrictions against medicated feed in de EU {{it is necessary}} to develop new strategies against coccidiosis. The severity of the disease is often (partially) dependent on the initial contamination dose, which has a great influence on infection dynamics within a flock. Obtaining insight into (influencing) the dynamics of Eimeria in a population is essential for optimizing and evaluating control strategies. 	For this purpose two transmission experiments where carried out, in a group of 20 broilers. One SPF broiler was orally inoculated on day 2 with 5 sporulated oocysts of E. acervulina, placed in a gelatinous capsule. On day 3, the inoculated animal was placed in a 1000 cm 2 <b>litter</b> <b>pen</b> with 19 non-inoculated contact birds. From day 6 to day 30 (Experiment 1) or day 31 (Experiment 2), each bird was placed in a cat transport cage during one hour per day, to produce a single dropping. Number of oocysts per gram of faeces (OPG) of the single droppings was determined, using the McMaster technique. Sedimentation flotation technique was carried out when samples where negative or when a negative result was expected. 	The inoculated bird tested positive in both techniques on day 7, in both experiments. In Experiment 1 the inoculated bird tested positive during 2 days, in Experiment 2 during 1 day. Oocyst excretion in contact birds in Experiment 1 started on day 12 (n= 1), day 13 (n= 14), day 14 (n= 3) or on day 16 (n= 1). In Experiment 2, oocyst excretion in contact birds started at day 12 (n= 4), day 13 (n= 6), day 14 (n= 4), day 15 (n= 2), day 17 (n= 2) or on day 18 (n= 1). 	Contact birds that shedded oocysts before day 16 (C 1 -animals) where infected by uptake of oocysts shedded by the inoculated bird. Animals who shedded oocysts from day 16 (C 2 -animals) where most likely infected by uptake of oocysts shedded by formerly infected contact birds. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of oocyst output of these C 2 -animals is higher than the AUC of the C 1 -animals. The peaks in oocysts output of C 2 -animals is also higher than the peaks of C 1 -animals. 	These results show that not all the animals of a flock get infected at the same time, but some animals get infected by the contact birds of the first generation. Also, C 2 -birds shedded more oocysts than the C 1 -birds. This build up of infectious oocysts can result in high infectious doses for the following generations of susceptible contact birds and might cause severe clinical signs. These results have increased the understanding of the infection dynamics of an Eimeria infection in a flock. This can make a contribution towards the development of better control strategies...|$|E

Feed restriction of broiler pullets in Experiment 1 was imposed from 4 to 9 days of age. Furthermore, the starter and grower diets in Experiment 2 contained either 1 or 4 % added fat and the starter diets in Experiments 3, 4, and 5 contained either 21 or 26 % protein. No significant differences were observed for abdominal fat pad and gizzard weights, liver and carcass fat, or carcass protein between early restricted birds and ad libitum controls at 49 days of age in Experiments 1 and 2. Furthermore, {{with the exception of}} Experiment 4, no differences in abdominal fat pad weights were observed among the different feeding regimens. Significant increases in abdominal fat pad weights, percentage liver, and percentage carcass fat were noted for females at 49 days of age when compared with male broilers. Carcass fat was significantly higher and carcass protein was significantly lower in broilers fed commercial versus reduced fat diets. Broilers fed a 21 % protein diet had significantly heavier abdominal fat pad weights at 28 days of age than birds fed a 26 % protein diet. No significant interactions were observed between the various treatments for the different variables measured. Results from the present studies indicate that early feed restriction minimally affects organ weights, fat deposition, and carcass composition of broiler chickens later in life.

40|$|Title of the paper: Investigation on {{occupational}} behaviour {{of female}} and castrated male fattening pigs In four rounds 144 fattening pigs {{of both sexes}} were brought in four pens (two of them were littered, two without any litter). Their occupational behaviour was recorded {{at the time of}} bringing the pigs into the pen, at the beginning, at the middle {{and at the end of}} the fattening period using an infrared-video-technology and a time lapse video recorder. In every pen three occupational tools (pendular beam, cross of chains and lifting beam) were offered to the pigs. At the 1 st recording the behaviour of all pigs was analysed, at the other fattening periods the behaviour of six focal pigs of both sexes per pen was analysed always over 24 h. At the time the pigs were brought into the pens no significant differences between the two sexes could be observed concerning the latency until the pigs had the first contact to the different occupational tools, whereas both sexes needed longest for their first contact to the cross of chains. During the other fattening periods the duration of occupation with the cross of chains (♂= 0. 06 %; ♀= 0. 08 %, p< 0. 086) and the pendular beam (♂= 0. 15 %; ♀= 0. 2 %, p< 0. 087) by the female pigs tended to be longer than the one shown by the castrated male pigs. Thereby both sexes used the cross of chains longer for occupation than the pendular beam and the lifting beam. The female pigs occupied themselves significantly longer with the straw in the <b>littered</b> <b>pens,</b> the floor in the pens without straw, the pen’s equipment and the pen mates than the castrated male pigs did. In contrast the castrated males used the trough significantly longer for occupation. In this study female pigs were more active, whereas the castrated male pigs spent a significantly longer time feeding and tended to spend more time lying and had better daily gains...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Laying hens were reared from 1 d {{of age in}} four {{replicates}} each of {{four different}} group sizes: 15, 30, 60, and 120 birds. To maintain stocking density at a constant 5 birds/m 2, they were housed in <b>litter</b> floor <b>pens</b> of 3, 6, 12, and 24 m 2, respectively. The allocation of feeder space, drinker nipples, and perch space was also constant per bird, irrespective of group size, as was the arrange-ment of resources in the pens. Birds were individually weighed at 3, 7, 12, 15, and 18 wk of age, and comb length and height were measured with calipers. At 24 and 39 wk, a sample of 30 eggs from each pen was weighed to determine mean egg weight.

40|$|ABSTRACT Body weight, livability, {{and feed}} conver-sion of a randombred control turkey line (RBC 2) started in 1966 at The Ohio State University was {{compared}} with that of modern commercial turkeys hatched in 2003 when fed representative 1966 - and 2003 -type diets from hatch (March 5, 2003) through 196 d of age. Each pen of modern turkeys consisted of 5 birds each of the Nicholas, British United Turkeys of America, and Hybrid strains. Eight groups (i. e., 2 strains (RBC 2 vs. modern), 2 sexes, and 2 dietary regimens) were randomly assigned into each of 4 blocks of 8 <b>litter</b> floor <b>pens</b> (32 total) for growout. Using the BW performance of the 2 strains on the modern feed as the basis, the study showed that the 2003 turkeys were approximately twice as heavy as the 1966 RBC 2 at the 4 slaughter ages and that tom weights have increased b...|$|R

40|$|Cultural {{monitoring}} {{was used}} to determine the incidence and sources of salmonellae in a 4160 -bird broiler flock raised on <b>litter</b> in 32 <b>pens.</b> Twenty-five of the pens remained apparently free of salmonellae during the 49 -day growing period. Salmonella johannesburg, first detected in the meat meal component of the starter ration, was recovered from the <b>litter</b> of seven <b>pens</b> and from the intestines of dead or culled chicks from two pens. Salmonella alachua was also recovered from two of these pens. Culture of swabs collected from the plastic crates used to transport this flock for processing showed that 97 / 112 (86. 6 %) were contaminated with salmonellae (15 serovars) before the birds were loaded. The crate washer at the plant did not remove salmonellae from these crates: 97 / 132 (73. 5 %) crates sampled after washing yielded salmonellae. Eleven serovar were recovered, including S. johannesburg and S. alachua introduced by the infected flock. Twelve of 31 chickens (38. 7 %) collected when the birds were unloaded at the processing plant were intestinal carriers of S. johannesburg and/or S. alachua and 29 (93. 5 %) were external carriers. Salmonella johannesburg, S. alachua and four other serovars were isolated from the feathers of these birds. Eleven of 25 (44 %) carcasses tested from this flock yielded salmonellae. Salmonella johannesburg or S. alachua, first isolated from the infected flock, were recovered from five carcasses and S. haardt and S.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} with caged egg-type hens and one experiment with broiler breeder hens on litter floors {{were conducted to}} determine interactions between dietary calcium and phos-phorus as related to hatchability and other production characteristics. Reductions in hatchability of eggs from caged layers caused by suboptimal levels of inorganic phosphorus were partially offset by elevation of the dietary calcium. When phosphorus in the diet of caged layers was supplied entirely from plant sources, elevation of dietary calcium resulted in decreased hatchability and egg production. Hatchability of fertile eggs from broiler breeder hens on litter floors was not significantly affected by dietary calcium levels of 2. 25 to 3. 50 %, or by total phosphorus levels of. 31 to 1. 42 %. Egg production was improved by supplementation of the diet with inorganic phosphorus up to. 41 % total phosphorus, but it was depressed by further supplementation. Egg specific gravity decreased with increased phosphorus levels and was significantly depressed by high dietary phos-phorus (1. 42 %). Recycling of phosphorus by coprophagy may be a factor affecting dietary phos-phorus requirements of hens in <b>litter</b> floor <b>pens...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{important}} for broiler producers to know litter production rates and litter nutrient content when developing nutrientmanagement plans. Estimation of broiler litter production varies widely in the literature due to factors such as geographical region, type of hous-ing, size of broiler produced, and number of flocks reared on the same litter. Published data for N, P, and K content are also highly variable. In addition, fewdata are available regarding the rate of production, characteristics, and nu-trient content of caked litter (cake). In this study, 18 con-secutive flocks of broilers were reared on the same <b>litter</b> in experimental <b>pens</b> under simulated commercial condi-tions.

40|$|Popielno White rabbits are {{a native}} breed created from the no longer {{existing}} Polish Albino breed. Research {{on the creation}} of the breed began in 1950. In 1989, Popielno White rabbits were included in the farm animal genetic resources conservation programme, financed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the possibility of using the native breed of rabbits for the production of carcasses of high culinary value. Twenty female and 4 male Popielno White and New Zealand White rabbits were studied. Females of the foundation stock were kept on <b>litter</b> in <b>pens</b> in a closed facility. Reproductive and growth performances and carcass parameters of Popielno White and New Zealand White rabbits were evaluated. The slaughter was carried out when rabbits were 90 days of age old. The study showed the high prolificacy of Popielno White rabbits. Growth parameters were lower in Popielno White than in New Zealand White rabbits, but they were compensated by better reproductive performance. The most valuable cuts (loin, hind part) of Popielno White rabbits were comparable in size with those of New Zealand White, which is a typically meat breed. Overall sensory quality also confirmed the culinary value of meat from Popielno White rabbits...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} if behaviour, ear positions and cortisol in lamb which were given access to play followed the different phases of the reward cycle of anticipation, consumption and relaxation. The study was done on 8 Dorset and 12 Dorset x Fine Wool uncastrated male lambs with an average age of 10 weeks. The lambs were housed pairwise in <b>litter</b> <b>pens</b> (2 x 3 m). Pairs of lambs were taken to a play arena (5. 9 x 5. 5 m) three times a week during five weeks (first week for learning). They were then first kept in a holding pen where they could look into the play arena for 5 minutes and thereafter released for 20 minutes in the play arena which had a ball, two chains and a tunnel. They walked back to their home pen and were observed for 6 minutes thereafter. Observations of behaviours were made as frequency per minute in all three places. Four different ear postures were recorded in the three places to study emotional valence in lambs. During the last week saliva sampling was done for cortisol analyses during the last week; one sample in the home pen before play and another in the home pen after play. Lambs showed significantly more anticipatory behaviour than non-anticipatory behaviour in the holding pen (p< 0. 01). Anticipatory behaviour did not change over the five minutes, and was higher during week 2 - 3 than week 1 and 4. In the play arena, play behaviour was significantly higher than other behaviours (p< 0. 01). Social play was higher than locomotor play and object play. Play behaviour was higher during the first ten minutes than the last ten minutes in the play arena (p< 0. 0001) and was highest during the second week of study (p< 0. 0001). The level of behaviours indicating relaxation was not higher than behaviours indicating no relaxation in the home pen after having been in the play arena (N. S.). Raised ear postures were most frequently recorded in the holding pen, whereas backward ear postures were more frequently recorded in the play arena and plane ear postures were most frequently recorded in the home pen both after play and on days without play. Saliva cortisol level increased after play in lambs during the first day, but not during the second and third day of sampling during the fourth week of play. It is concluded that lambs seem to show behaviours indicating anticipation to play and they do play in a known play arena, but relaxation after having played is less obvious during the first minutes. When given access to play the lambs seemed to pass through all three phases of the reward cycle expressing different anticipation, consumption and relaxation behaviours...|$|R
