5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It could result in a decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains will probably be shortened.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in half of the patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial {{of at least three}} months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. There is some evidence that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.|$|E
5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) that are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E
5|$|Wilder's colleague, {{paediatrician}} Mynie Peterman, later formulated {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10â€“15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from the diet, {{and the use of}} the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E

30|$|Given {{that adult}} workers are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be {{employed}} {{and so are}} more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> receive <b>benefits</b> from unemployment insurance, the above empirical {{results are consistent with}} the assertion that a higher replacement rate makes unemployment acceptable for adult workers, while empirical results on this effect are mixed (Atkinson and Micklewright 1991).|$|R
25|$|The twin {{goals of}} {{research}} are {{to determine whether}} the treatment actually works (called efficacy) and whether it is sufficiently safe. Regulatory processes attempt to balance the potential benefits with the potential harms, so that people given the treatment are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from it than to be harmed by it.|$|E
25|$|Co-operation in {{evolution}} {{is the process}} where groups of organisms work or act together for common or mutual benefits. It is commonly defined as any adaptation that has evolved, at least in part, to increase the reproductive success of the actor's social partners. For example, territorial choruses by male lions discourage intruders and are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> all contributors.|$|E
25|$|Their {{position}} was strengthened in 1988 when the Department of Transport {{announced that the}} Aston Clinton bypass would include a navigable culvert where the new road would cross the arm.

50|$|In {{northern}} Europe, {{climate change}} is initially projected to bring mixed effects, including some benefits such as reduced demand for heating, increased crop yields, and increased forest growth. However, as climate change continues, negative impacts are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> outweigh <b>benefits.</b> These include more frequent winter floods, endangered ecosystems, and increasing ground instability.|$|R
25|$|Only 41% {{of women}} with {{cervical}} cancer {{in the developing world}} get medical treatment. Therefore, prevention of HPV by vaccination may be a more effective way of lowering the disease burden in developing countries than cervical screening. The European Society of Gynecological Oncology sees the developing world as most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from HPV vaccination. However, individuals in many resource-limited nations, Kenya for example, are unable to afford the vaccine.|$|E
25|$|The December 27 {{assassination}} of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto drew responses {{from all of}} the major candidates. McCain, a longtime member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called attention to his foreign policy experience, as well as his personal interaction with Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf. He also drew a contrast with his main Republican rivals, who did not have experience in foreign policy matters. Many observers saw McCain as the candidate most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from a heightened focus on international events.|$|E
25|$|Collisions {{tend to be}} more {{frequent}} in locations where a sudden change in road character violates the driver's expectations. A common example is a sharp curve {{at the end of a}} long tangent section of road. The concept of design consistency addresses this by comparing adjacent road segments and identifying sites with changes the driver might find sudden or unexpected. Locations with large changes in the predicted operating speed are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from additional design effort. A horizontal curve with a significantly smaller radius than those before it may need enhanced curve signs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{technology}} spillovers of {{foreign direct investment}} in China's manufacturing sector in 2003. Using a simultaneous equation model estimated over a comprehensive firm level data set, {{we find that the}} foreign direct investment in China generates significant and positive technology spillovers to domestic firms, with a 1 per cent increase in the foreign presence promoting domestic firms' labour productivity by more than 5 per cent. The substantial positive spillovers not only to some extent justify China's FDI policy setting, but also indicate that China is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from attracting more FDI inflow in the future...|$|R
25|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that 7â€“10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full medical benefit from taking tamoxifen due to their unique genetic make-up. DNA Drug Safety Testing can examine DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications. Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from tamoxifen.|$|E
25|$|In more {{developed}} countries, populations {{that do not}} receive adequate medical care, such as poor or minorities in the United States or parts of Europe also have less access to cervical screening and appropriate treatment, and are similarly more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit.</b> Comments made by Dr. Diane Harper, a researcher for the HPV vaccines, were interpreted as indicating that in countries where Pap smear screening is common, it will take vaccination of {{a large proportion of}} women in order to further reduce cervical cancer rates. She has also encouraged women to continue pap screening after they are vaccinated and to be aware of potential adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|The work on {{interpretation}} {{and analysis of}} genome data {{is still in its}} initial stages. It is anticipated that detailed knowledge of the human genome will provide new avenues for advances in medicine and biotechnology. Clear practical results of the project emerged even before the work was finished. For example, a number of companies, such as Myriad Genetics, started offering easy ways to administer genetic tests that can show predisposition to a variety of illnesses, including breast cancer, hemostasis disorders, cystic fibrosis, liver diseases and many others. Also, the etiologies for cancers, Alzheimer's disease and other areas of clinical interest are considered <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from genome information and possibly may lead in the long term to significant advances in their management.|$|E

40|$|Are {{immigrants}} {{on welfare}} {{because they are}} more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be eligible or {{because they are more}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> claim <b>benefits</b> for which they are eligible? The answer is politically important, but because most current research on immigration and welfare is based on data from the U. S., the answer is difficult due to the complexities of the transfer system which make eligibility determinations difficult. In Germany, by contrast, eligibility for the main cash transfer program, Sozialhilfe (Social Assistance), is determined by a comparatively simple nation-wide formula. We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel to test whether immigrants to Germany are more <b>likely</b> than natives <b>to</b> claim welfare <b>benefits</b> for which they are eligible. We find that immigrants are more likely than native Germans to receive welfare, both because immigrants are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be eligible, and because they are more <b>likely,</b> when eligible, <b>to</b> claim their <b>benefits.</b> However, we also find that this greater propensity <b>to</b> take-up <b>benefits</b> is not related to immigrant status per se: when other socio-demographic factors are accounted for in an appropriate manner, immigrant households are no more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take up <b>benefits</b> than native households...|$|R
30|$|Private sector {{employees}} are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> receive <b>benefits</b> than casual workers, with 25 % reporting written contracts, and another 48 % reporting verbal contracts. Sick leave, casual leave, and maternity leave are also fairly common. A termination notice is less common, only being reported by 45 % of workers, and only around 13 % report {{having access to}} a Provident Fund.|$|R
25|$|Gay activist Jonathan Rauch {{has argued}} that {{marriage}} is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity. The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated {{to their ability to}} provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} a {{bottleneck}} by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as The New Inn at Etchinghill which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'. Tunnel-induced regional development is small compared to general economic growth. The South East of England is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> developmentally and socially from faster and cheaper transport to continental Europe, but the benefits are unlikely to be equally distributed throughout the region. The overall environmental impact is almost certainly negative.|$|E
25|$|Both men {{and women}} have the option of {{investing}} resources either to provision children or to have additional offspring based on life history theory. Males and females monitor costs and benefits of each alternative to maximize reproductive fitness; however, trade-off differences do exist between sexes. Females are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> most from parental effort because they are certain which offspring are theirs and have relatively few reproductive opportunities, each of which is relatively costly and risky. In contrast, males do not have an absolute certainty of paternity, but may have many more mating opportunities bearing relatively low costs and risks. Though not every hunter-gatherer population pinpoints females to gathering and males to hunting (most notably the Aeta and Ju'/hoansi), the norm of most current populations divide the roles of labor in this manner. Natural selection is more likely to favor male reproductive strategies that stress mating effort and female strategies that emphasize parental investment. As a result, women do the low-risk task of gathering vegetation and underground storage organs that are rich in energy to provide for themselves and offspring. Since women provide a reliable source of caloric intake, men are able to afford a higher risk of failure by hunting animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{findings}} from the SPGS-4 and PIVOT should inform practice for the older man with low risk disease, especially those with associated comorbidities unlikely <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from curative intervention.
