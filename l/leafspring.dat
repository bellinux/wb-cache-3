25|$|In {{an effort}} to improve top speed along the legendary Mulsanne Straight at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, a number of enclosed, coupe {{variations}} were constructed using the <b>leafspring</b> chassis and running gear of the AC/Shelby Cobra Mark II. The most famous and numerous of these were the official works Shelby Daytona Cobra Coupes. Six were constructed, each being subtly different from the rest.|$|E
40|$|The {{quasi-static}} {{and dynamic}} force transfer characteristics of an asymmetric tapered <b>leafspring</b> of a South African truck were experimentally determined {{by measuring the}} direction dependent stiffnesses and lowest natural frequency. The test results were also used to verify and modify a Rayleigh-Ritz dynamic model of the spring...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we design, fabricate, and {{validate}} a large-stroke 3 -degree-of-freedom (DOF) positioning {{stage with}} integrated displacement sensors for feedback control in a single-mask microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication process. Three equal shuttles exactly define {{the position of}} the stage in x, y, and Rz. The kinematic relation between the shuttle positions and the stage position is given by the geometric transfer function. By increasing the order of this geometric transfer function, the stage error can be reduced. Each shuttle consists of a flexure mechanism, a position sensor, and electrostatic comb drive actuators for actuation along a straight line. The range of motion of the stage is limited by electrostatic pull-in of these comb drives. Three parameters of the stage, the <b>leafspring</b> length, the eccentricity, and the tangential arm, have been varied to find their influence on the stage range of motion. These simulation results can be used to design stages with different specifications. Position control of the individual shuttles is applied to control {{the position of the}} stage. The stroke of the 3 DOF stage is verified up to 161 μm in x, 175 μm in y, and 325 mrad in Rz. This exceeds the range of motion of existing stages...|$|E
50|$|Axles {{were made}} of drop-forged H girder sections, so forging their upswept ends was a simple addition. To avoid {{creating}} stress risers, the drop was formed as smooth curves, not as sharp corners. Bugatti famously used a round bar for their axles, with the spring passing through holes within it and avoiding the U bolts that il patron found so ungainly. For further lowering, {{at the cost of}} reduced suspension travel, some axles were also prepared for racing by being mounted above the <b>leafsprings,</b> rather than below, although this was more common for straight rear axles than dropped front axles.|$|R
2500|$|The Suzulight Van-based TLA Fronte was {{introduced}} in March 1962 as a passenger car version of the popular light van. The Suzulight Fronte {{was based on the}} earlier Suzulight SS series, itself a fairly straightforward copy of the even older Lloyd LP400, and as such had a transversely mounted two-cylinder, two-stroke engine driving the front wheels. Suspension was independent on all four wheels, with transverse double <b>leafsprings</b> on both axes. 2,565 were built in the first year. Power was [...] at 6000rpm, from a unique engine (also called [...] "TLA") with its cylinders cast separately rather than in a single block. Of 360cc (64.0 × 56.0mm) this method allowed for a lower production cost and better cooling, allowing Suzuki to price the TLA below the more spartan TL Van. As with the light commercials on which it was based, the transmission was a three-speed manual with an unsynchronized first gear and a column-mounted shifter.|$|R
5000|$|Production of the 4-door, 5-seat A8-16 series {{began in}} 1981. The design {{concept of the}} A8-16 was largely {{inspired}} by the SAAB and Volvo models including the ground breaking 1970s Volvo VESC safety concept car, with futuristic details such as the large headlamps, inclined nose and the high-positioned rear trunk - traits that were particularly associated with SAAB models. However, it also had details that appeared [...] "retro" [...] in 1981, such as the rear lights which originally belonged to Böcek, but didn't look good on the A8-16. The interior design and the materials used also did not please the traditional Anadol customers. Many of the design characteristics, especially the door windows and frames, were borrowed from older Anadol models such as the SV-1600 which was designed in 1973, and most potential customers saw this car as a hodge-podge of old Anadol spare parts, mixed with some new ideas. The new body still sat on a box-type perimeter frame with crossmembers, with independent coil sprung front suspension and a live, <b>leafsprung</b> rear axle. Steering is rack and pinion, transmission by {{the way of a}} four-speed manual.|$|R
40|$|Walking is {{the most}} common form of {{mobility}} in humans. For lower limb mobility impairments, a common treatment is to prescribe an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) or brace, which is a passive device designed to resist undesired ankle-foot motion. Recent advances in actuator technology have led to the development of active AFOs (AAFOs). However, these devices are generally too bulky for everyday use and are limited to applications such as gait training for rehabilitation. The aim of this research was to investigate the feasibility of developing a novel Active Ankle-Foot Stabilizer (AAFS). The design criteria were mainly based on the strengths and limitations of existing AFOs. The sagittal plane functional requirements were determined using simulated gait data for elderly individuals and drop foot patients; however, it is intended that the device would be suitable for a wider range of disabilities including ankle sprains. A model of the foot was introduced to modify the moment of a deficient ankle where young healthy adult kinematics and kinetics were assumed. A moment deficit analysis was performed for different gait periods resulting in an AAFS model with two components: a linear rotational spring to modify the ankle joint rotational stiffness, and a torque source. The frontal plane functional requirements for the AAFS were modeled as a linear rotational spring which responded to particular gait events. A novel Variable Rotational Stiffness Actuator (VSRA) AFO was also investigated. It consisted of an actuated spring medial and lateral to the ankle to control sagittal plane ankle stiffness and a passive <b>leafspring</b> posterior to the ankle to control frontal plane ankle stiffness. Due to high forces and profile limitations, a spring and rotation actuator that satisfied the design criteria could not be developed, resulting in an infeasible design. Considering the high forces and moments required by the AAFS, a pneumatic approach was adopted. A novel Airbeam AFO, which consisted of a shank cuff and a foot plate to which airbeams were attached proximally and distally to the ankle, was examined. The joint rotational stiffness of the ankle would be controlled by the inflation of these individual cylindrical airbeams. To satisfy the functional requirements, the airbeam diameters and pressures were too large to meet the design criteria and were unrealistic for a portable device. Finally, a Pneumatic Sock AFO, which proved to best satisfy the functional requirements within the design criteria, was examined. The design consisted of an inner sock worn on the ankle, surrounded by anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral bladders which inflate against outer fabric shells. Although promising, the Pneumatic Sock AFO requires further investigation in regards to manufacturing and behaviour characterization before a functional prototype can be developed. Mechanical test methods to characterize the behaviour of the Pneumatic Sock AFO in the sagittal and frontal planes were developed including the control components required, the configuration of a test rig, and test procedures. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|Several {{positive}} {{influences of}} orthoses on gait {{in children with}} cerebral palsy have been documented, {{as well as some}} detrimental effects. Most importantly, push-off is decreased in orthoses compromising a physiological third ankle rocker. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of three types of orthoses on gait in a homogeneous group of children. All orthoses aimed at improving push-off and normalizing the pathological plantarflexion – knee extension couple. 22 girls and 15 boys with hemiplegia, aged 4 - 10 years (30 GMFCS 1, 6 GMFCS 2), walked barefoot and with orthoses being either Orteams® (orthoses with dorsal part containing 11 sleeves), Posterior <b>Leafsprings</b> (PLS) or Dual Carbon Fibre Spring AFOs® (CFO; carbon fibre at the dorsal part of the orthosis). All orthoses were expected to prevent plantarflexion and allow dorsiflexion thus improving first, second and third rocker. The latter was expected to improve as energy is absorbed in second rocker, due to the flexibility of the orthosis, and returned in third rocker. The orthoses were compared through objective gait analysis, including 3 D kinematics and kinetics. All orthoses successfully improved the gait pattern and only small differences were noted between the different orthoses configurations. The CFO® however, allowed a more physiological third ankle rocker when compared to the Orteam®/PLS. While the PLS ensured the highest correction at the ankle around initial contact, the CFO® created a significantly higher maximal hip flexion moment in stance. In general, the results of this study indicated a substantial functional flexibility of the CFO®. status: publishe...|$|R
