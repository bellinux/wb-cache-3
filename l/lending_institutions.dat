25|$|Redlining {{has helped}} {{preserve}} segregated living patterns {{for blacks and}} whites in the United States because discrimination motivated by prejudice is often contingent on the racial composition of neighborhoods where the loan is sought and {{the race of the}} applicant. <b>Lending</b> <b>institutions</b> have been shown to treat black mortgage applicants differently when buying homes in white neighborhoods than when buying homes in black neighborhoods in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland {{had long}} {{suffered}} from racially discriminatory practices by <b>lending</b> <b>institutions,</b> and in 1979 residents of Union-Miles Park began picketing lenders, including the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). By this time, the Union-Miles Park neighborhood was crime-ridden and decaying. The neighborhood was still solidly blue-collar, and the 1973â€“75 recession hit the area especially hard. Many {{of the most}} affordable homes were owned or leased by public housing agencies, yet these homes {{were some of the}} most decrepit in the area.

25|$|In the 20th century, many {{suburban}} areas, {{especially those}} {{not within the}} political boundaries of the city containing the central business area, began to see independence from the central city as an asset. In some cases, suburbanites saw self-government {{as a means to}} keep out people who could not afford the added suburban property maintenance costs not needed in city living. Federal subsidies for suburban development accelerated this process as did the practice of redlining by banks and other <b>lending</b> <b>institutions.</b> In some cities such as Miami and San Francisco, the main city is much smaller than the surrounding suburban areas, leaving the city proper with {{a small portion of the}} metro area's population and land area.|$|E
25|$|The {{case has}} been {{called one of the}} most {{important}} of the late 20th century, since it freed nationally chartered banks to offer credit cards to anyone in the U.S. they deemed qualified, and more specifically because it allowed them to export credit card interest rates to states with stricter regulations, opening up a race between states in an effort to attract <b>lending</b> <b>institutions</b> to set up shop in their states and offer a wider variety of consumer credit products. Over the next decade, the states accelerated a process that had already begun of repealing or loosening their anti-usury laws, allowing state-chartered banks to compete more equally with national ones. As a result, the use of credit cards has vastly increased, and since the mortgage industry soon followed suit, the issuance of subprime mortgages also increased drastically, facilitating the housing bubble that led to the 2008 housing crisis.|$|E
500|$|At Brownlee's instigation, the Greenfield {{government}} had implemented a Debt Adjustment Act, which allowed farmers in Alberta's drought-stricken southeast to access credit counselling services {{and provided a}} way to settle creditors' claims without ruining farmers or resorting to litigation.

[...] <b>Lending</b> <b>institutions</b> again objected, and threatened {{to withdraw from the}} province if the act was extended. [...] Brownlee felt that these threats were disingenuous, noting that similar measures already existed to protect merchants. [...] However, it was a prosperous time for farmers, and so mobilized support for the legislation was in shorter supply than it might have been during a time of economic hardship; Brownlee, newly disillusioned with bankers, withdrew the bill.|$|E

Despite the rent reduction, a July 17, 1988 Houston Chronicle article stated that rates for poorly maintained apartments in Gulfton and other Houston areas were comparable to well-maintained apartments {{in other parts of}} the city. According to Gaines, complexes in Gulfton began to cater to illegal immigrants and landlords allowed renters to [...] "double-up" [...] housing (several individuals and/or families living in a unit). John Goodner, a Houston city council member who represented a district that included Gulfton at that time, said that more demographic changes occurred within his district in the years leading up to 1988 than in any other part of the city. He was referring to the shift in the demographics of various apartment complexes. Goodner said that the complex owners were unconcerned about this development as long as the rent payments were made. Landlords had difficulty filling apartment complexes even if they did not require background checks. Many banks and <b>lending</b> <b>institutions</b> owned foreclosed apartments and failed to properly maintain them, considering it [...] "pouring money down a perceived rat hole." [...] Gaines added that many complexes deferred maintenance.|$|E

2500|$|Solicitors {{were more}} scared by the {{proposal}} that banks {{would be allowed}} to offer conveyancing services, but this suggestion eventually came to nothing. The government introduced a consultation paper on the subject in April 1984, but in December 1985 announced that it [...] "was not satisfied that <b>lending</b> <b>institutions</b> could safely be permitted to offer both conveyancing and a loan in the same transaction. It is therefore proposed to prohibit the institutions from providing conveyancing, either directly or through a subsidiary company in which they hold a majority stake, to those who are also borrowing from them". This essentially killed the proposal (a framework which would allow banks to undertake conveyancing work was included in the Building Societies Act 1986 but never implemented) because the banks had no interest in lending only to people who were not also engaged in a loan agreement with them. It was well known at the time that many members of the cabinet were happy with the initial proposal, but that Lord Hailsham was determined not to let it pass and forced the government to go against its earlier suggestion.|$|E
