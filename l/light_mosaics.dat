40|$|There {{are many}} {{problems}} during cultivation of ornamental plants arising from diseases and pests. Viral borne pathogens, among these diseases, have a distinctive importance {{compared to other}} plant diseases due to their easy mechanical transmission from plant to plant, their rapid spreading ability by means of seeds, vegetative material and vector insects {{and the absence of}} a chemical control method. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is one of these virus diseases. CMV is the second virus after tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) over {{the world in terms of}} the number of hosts. In this study, presence of CMV was investigated in ornamental bulbous plants (daffodils, hyacinths, lilies) in Çanakkale province and its districts. For this purpose, 128 bulbous ornamental plant samples showing virus and virus like disease symptoms were collected in field studies performed between the years 2012 - 2015. The collected samples were tested for the presence of CMV using serological and molecular methods with DAS-ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. Twenty-nine out of 128 samples (% 22. 65) were found to be infected with CMV. Chlorosis was observed throughout veins and <b>light</b> <b>mosaics</b> were observed to be the most common symptoms in CMV infected plants...|$|E
40|$|The Virgo {{direction}} {{has been}} observed at many wavelengths in recent years, in particular in the ultraviolet with GALEX. The far ultraviolet (FUV) diffuse light detected by GALEX offers interesting information on the large scale distribution of Galactic dust, owing to the GALEX FUV band sensitivity and resolution. Aims. We aim to characterise the ultraviolet large scale distribution of diffuse emission in the Virgo direction. A map of this emission may become useful for various studies by identifying regions where dust affects observations by either scattering light or absorbing radiation. Methods. We constructed mosaics of the FUV and near ultraviolet (NUV) diffuse emission over a large sky region (RA 12 to 13 h, Dec 0 to 20 deg) surrounding the Virgo cluster, using all the GALEX available data in the area. We tested {{for the first time}} the utilisation of the FUV diffuse light as a Galactic extinction E(B-V) tracer. Results. The FUV diffuse light scattered on cirrus reveals details about their geometry. Despite large dispersion, the FUV diffuse light correlates roughly with other Galactic dust tracers (coming from IRAS, Herschel, Planck), offering an opportunity to use the FUV emission to locate them in future studies with a better resolution (about 5 arcsec native resolution, 20 arcsec pixels maps presented in this paper) than for several usual tracers. Estimating the Galactic dust extinction on the basis of this emission allows us to find a smaller dispersion in the NUV-i colour of background galaxies at a given E(B-V) than with other tracers.

40|$|Background: Planum Boreum, {{the north}} polar plateau of Mars, {{displays}} four extensive low-albedo regions covered with widespread se dimentary deposits that are {{thick enough to}} partly or completely suppress the signature of the residual water ice that forms the uppermost zone of the polar layered deposits. These sedi mentary deposits {{appear to have a}} source primarily in a buried sedimentary layer preferentially exposed along the wall s and floors of some polar troughs. The deposits extend and drape over circum-polar dunes. Method: The data analyses in this research were conducted with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping tools. The followin g data sets have been used: (1) Mars Odyssey (MO) Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) summer north polar visibl e <b>light</b> <b>mosaics</b> at 18 m/pixel and 32 m /pixel, as well as 18 m/pixel visible multiband images (THEMI S mosaic provided by P. H. Christensen and the THEMIS Team, Arizona State U.), (2) Mars Express (MEX) High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) images at 10 m/pixel, (3) Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) narrow-angle (NA; > 1. 4 m/pixel) and a wide-angle image mosaic, 64 pixels/degree, (4) Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera images at resolutions that range from 31. 8 cm/pixel (with 1 x 1 binning) to 63. 5 cm/pixel (with 2 x 2 binning), (5) MGS Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) 512 pixels/degree digital elevation models, and (6) MEX OMEGA Vis/IR imaging spectrometer. False color maps have been derived fro m OMEGA data in which all three color planes are proportional to albedo (0. 1 : level 0, 0. 45 : level 255). The red plane scales inversely with the fraction of the area covered by ice, derived from the band stre ngth at 1. 5 ?m (factor of 0 for 30 % fractional ice coverage within the pixel, factor of 1 for ice-free pixels). The H 2 O ice spectral signatures have been observed by OMEGA in November 2004, during early northern summer (Ls 109 ? to 114 ?). The incidence at the time of observations was nearly optimal for such latitude regions (57. 6 ?). Sampling on the ground was 1. 7 to 2 km. Conclusion: The most recent history of the north pola r plateau of Mars includes highly dynamic sedimentary processes involving large-scale wind-d riven mass transfer from Planum Boreum towards its periphery. The proposed polar processes involved: (I) retreat along undulations within upper layered deposits (ULD), thereby exposing underlying dark sedimentary deposi ts, (II) mobilization of these deposits to form extensive dark mantles, which are water-ice free and that terminate in circum-polar terrains, and (III) complete removal of these depo sits leading to the exhu mation of pre-existing trough...|$|E

The most interesting chapter of Guevara's work is about fresco and stucco decoration, which steps through the implementation process and the materials used at the time.

DMSP/OLS single orbits were used to generate a DMSP stable <b>light</b> <b>mosaic</b> for 2002, in {{which most of the}} urban settlements with a population higher than 5000 inhabitants were precisely identified. DMSP/OLS night-time mosaic images from 1995, 1999 and 2002 were integrated with the IBGE census data and the correlation between DMSP/OLS night-time light area and the urban population was compared. Coefficients of determination higher than 0. 8 were obtained from the linear regression between DMSP/OLS night-time lights and urban population census data. Although the fieldwork showed that DMSP image data could only record urbanized settlements with more than 2. 5 km 2 of well-lit surface areas, the initial and final extension of the night-time light foci were actually precisely registered. Therefore, this paper identifies the potential of DMSP night-time light images for estimating urban population as well as the technical limitations of using such images as a means to monitor urban population dynamics annually in a region where data are scarce and the demographic dynamics are unique, as in the Brazilian Amazon. 1...|$|R

Endo-(1 - 4) -β-xylanase purified from culture filtrates of Trichoderma viride was a strong elicitor of pathogenesis-related protein synthesis in tobacco leaves. The synthesis of these proteins was localized to tissue at the area of enzyme application. The inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene action, 1 -aminoethoxyvinylglycine and silver thiosulfate, inhibited accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins induced by tobacco mosaic virus and α-aminobutyric acid, but did not inhibit elicitation by xylanase. Likewise, the induction of these proteins by the tobacco pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci was not affected by the inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and action. The leaf response to tobacco mosaic virus and α-aminobutyric acid was dependent on light in normal and photosynthetically incompetent leaves.

These image-based scene representations provide photorealistic interactive user navigation in a 3 D scene. As the trade-off between acquisition complexity, freedom of movement and rendering quality differs for the diverse techniques, the most efficient scene representation and rendering technique should be selected with respect to scene content and complexity. Splitting a scene into partial representations which are adapted to local requirements is proposed in this paper. Besides meaningful restrictions to user movement, the transition between different image-based scene representations is addressed to provide an efficient image based walkthrough for large and complex scenes. We identify rendering parameters to achieve a seamless transition between different representations and present results for stitching together concentric mosaics, omnidirectional video and light fields.

METHODS: This randomized split-face {{study was conducted in}} 27 men to compare the effect of once daily applications of 5 % calcipotriol cream or a moisturizing cream on the heterogeneity of facial MSM. Computerized image analysis of video images was used at 1 -month intervals before and during a 2 -month treatment, as well as during a 3 -month follow-up. RESULTS: At both sites, the average melanin content of the epidermis showed no significant change over time. However, the mottled appearance was smoothened at the calcipotriol site, whereas it was increased at the site receiving the moisturizer. CONCLUSION: The decreased heterogeneity in MSM after calcipotriol applications suggests a control of the epidermal melanocyte unit by the vitamin D(3) derivative. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The first full peal on the bells was 5,040 changes of Grandsire Triples on 17 December 1895 and was conducted by Stephen Hogarth. There is a remarkable set of the ringers rules dating from 1826, which is displayed in a large frame in the ringing chamber; they were penned by the English master from St Bees School. Outside in the graveyard several of the bell ringers are buried together in their own area. The church has Tudor consecration crosses, both inside and out. It is unique in having a complete surviving set of twelve exterior crosses.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} how spatial organization influences color-pair preference asymmetries: differential {{preference for}} one color pair over another when the pairs contain the same colors in opposite spatial configurations. Schloss and Palmer (2011, Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics 73 551 ^ 571) found weak figure ^ ground preference asymmetries for small squares centered on large squares in aesthetic ratings. Here, we found robust preference asymmetries using a more sensitive forced-choice task: participants strongly prefer pairs with yellower, lighter figures on bluer, darker grounds (experiment 1). We also investigated which spatial factors influence these preference asymmetries. Relative {{area of the}} two component regions is clearly important, and perceived 3 -D area of the 2 -D displays (ie after the ground is amodally completed behind the figure) is more influential than 2 -D area (experiment 2). Surroundedness is not required, because yellowness ^ blueness effects were comparable for pairs in which the figure was surrounded by the ground, and for mosaic arrangements in which the regions were adjacent and separated by a gap (experiment 3). Lightness ^ darkness effects, however, were opposite for figure ^ ground versus mosaic organizations: people prefer figure ^ ground organizations in which smaller regions are <b>lighter,</b> but prefer <b>mosaic</b> organizations in which smaller regions are darker. Physiological, phenomenological, and ecological explanations of the reported results are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is prevalent globally, {{experienced by}} a significant minority {{of women in the}} early childbearing years and is harmful to the mental and physical health of women and children. There are very few studies with rigorous designs which have tested the effectiveness of IPV interventions to improve the health and wellbeing of abused women. Evidence for the separate benefit to victims of social support, advocacy and non-professional mentoring suggested that a combined model may reduce the levels of violence, the associated mental health damage and may increase a woman's health, safety and connection with her children. This paper describes the development, design and implementation of a trial of mentor mother support set in primary care, including baseline characteristics of participating women. Methods/Design MOSAIC (MOtherS' Advocates In the Community) was a cluster randomised trial embedded in general practice and maternal and child health (MCH) nursing services in disadvantaged suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. Women who were pregnant or with infants, identified as abused or symptomatic of abuse, were referred by IPV-trained GPs and MCH nurses from 24 general practices and eight nurse teams from January 2006 to December 2007. Women in the intervention arm received up to 12 months support from trained and supported non-professional mentor mothers. Vietnamese health professionals also referred Vietnamese women to bilingual mentors in a sub-study. Baseline and follow-up surveys at 12 months measured IPV (CAS), depression (EPDS), general health (SF- 36), social support (MOS-SF) and attachment to children (PSI-SF). Significant development and piloting occurred prior to trial commencement. Implementation interviews with MCH nurses, GPs and mentors assisted further refinement of the intervention. In-depth interviews with participants and mentors, and follow-up surveys of MCH nurses and GPs at trial conclusion will shed further <b>light</b> on <b>MOSAIC's</b> impact. Discussion Despite significant challenges, MOSAIC will make an important contribution to the need for evidence of effective partner violence interventions, the role of non-professional mentors in partner violence support services and the need for more evaluation of effective health professional training and support in caring for abused women and children among their populations.

40|$|Background : Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is prevalent globally, {{experienced by}} a significant minority {{of women in the}} early childbearing years and is harmful to the mental and physical health of women and children. There are very few studies with rigorous designs which have tested the effectiveness of IPV interventions to improve the health and wellbeing of abused women. Evidence for the separate benefit to victims of social support, advocacy and non-professional mentoring suggested that a combined model may reduce the levels of violence, the associated mental health damage and may increase a woman 2 ̆ 7 s health, safety and connection with her children. This paper describes the development, design and implementation of a trial of mentor mother support set in primary care, including baseline characteristics of participating women. Methods/Design : MOSAIC (MOtherS 2 ̆ 7 Advocates In the Community) was a cluster randomised trial embedded in general practice and maternal and child health (MCH) nursing services in disadvantaged suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. Women who were pregnant or with infants, identified as abused or symptomatic of abuse, were referred by IPV-trained GPs and MCH nurses from 24 general practices and eight nurse teams from January 2006 to December 2007. Women in the intervention arm received up to 12 months support from trained and supported non-professional mentor mothers. Vietnamese health professionals also referred Vietnamese women to bilingual mentors in a sub-study. Baseline and follow-up surveys at 12 months measured IPV (CAS), depression (EPDS), general health (SF- 36), social support (MOS-SF) and attachment to children (PSI-SF). Significant development and piloting occurred prior to trial commencement. Implementation interviews with MCH nurses, GPs and mentors assisted further refinement of the intervention. In-depth interviews with participants and mentors, and follow-up surveys of MCH nurses and GPs at trial conclusion will shed further <b>light</b> on <b>MOSAIC</b> 2 ̆ 7 s impact. Discussion : Despite significant challenges, MOSAIC will make an important contribution to the need for evidence of effective partner violence interventions, the role of non-professional mentors in partner violence support services and the need for more evaluation of effective health professional training and support in caring for abused women and children among their populations. <br /...|$|R
