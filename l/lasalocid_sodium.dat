40|$|Forty-eight {{crossbred}} heifers (378. 1 ± 18 kg) {{were used}} in a 56 -d feeding trial (four pens per treatment in a randomised complete block design) to evaluate the influence of ionophore supplementation on growth performance, dietary energetics and carcass characteristics in finishing cattle {{during a period of}} heat stress. Heifers were fed a diet based on steam-flaked corn (2. 22 Mcal NEm/kg) with and without an ionophore. Treatments were: i) control, no ionophore; ii) 30 mg/kg monensin sodium (RUM 30); iii) 20 mg/kg <b>lasalocid</b> <b>sodium</b> (BOV 20), and iv) 30 mg/kg <b>lasalocid</b> <b>sodium</b> (BOV 30). Both dry matter intake (DMI) and climatic variables were measured daily and the temperature humidity index (THI) was estimated. The maximum THI during the study averaged 93, while the minimum was 70 (THI average = 79. 2 ± 2. 3). Compared to controls, monensin supplementation did not influence average daily gain, the estimated NE value of the diet, or observed-to-expected DMI, but tended (p = 0. 07) to increase (4. 8 %) gain to feed. Compared to controls, the group fed BOV 30 increased (p≤ 0. 03) daily gain (11. 8 %), gain to feed (8. 3 %), net energy of the diet (5 %), and observed-to-expected DMI (5. 2 %). Daily weight gain was greater (7. 6 %, p = 0. 05) for heifers fed BOV 30 than for heifers fed MON 30. Otherwise, differences between the two treatments in DMI, gain to feed, and dietary NE were not statistically significant (p> 0. 11). Plotting weekly intakes versus THI, observed intake of controls was greater (p 0. 05) in the ionophores group (CV = 1. 7 %) than in the control group (CV = 4. 5 %). Inclusion of ionophores in the diet resulted in relatively minor changes in carcass characteristics. It is concluded that ionophore supplementation did not exacerbate the decline of DM intake in heat-stressed cattle fed a high-energy finishing diet; on the contrary, it stabilised feed intake and favoured feed efficiency. Ionophore supplementation reduced estimated maintenance coefficients around 10 % in finishing cattle during a period of heat stress. This effect was greatest for heifers supplemented with 30 mg lasalocid/kg of diet...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA multi-residue HPLC-ESI-MS/MS {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the simultaneous extraction, detection, and confirmation of the 11 coccidiostats concerned by Regulation 2009 / 8 /EC (<b>lasalocid</b> <b>sodium,</b> narasin, salinomycin sodium, monensin sodium, semduramicin sodium, maduramicin ammonium alpha, robenidine hydrochloride, decoquinate, halofuginone hydrobromide, nicarbazin, and diclazuril) in feedingstuffs at carry-over level. The sensitivity of the method allows quantification and confirmation for all coccidiostats below target concentration. The method was in-house validated and meets all criteria of European legislation (2002 / 657 /EC). The precision of the method was determined under repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility conditions; RSDr and RSDR were below the maximum permitted values for every tested concentration. The specificity was checked by analysing representative blank samples and blank samples fortified with potentially interfering substances (benzimidazoles, corticosteroides, triphenylmethane dyes, quinolones, nitrofurans, nitroimidazoles, phenicols) and no interference were found. Concerning quantification, a quadratic regression model was fitted to every calibration curve with a regression coefficient R 2 above 0. 99 on each data set. Finally, the expanded uncertainty U was calculated with data obtained within the laboratory while applying the method during validation and in routine tests...|$|E
40|$|Five hundred seven bull calves were {{assembled}} at {{a commercial}} feedlot in North-central Utah and sorted by frame size into 8 pens. Bullocks were fed a high energy diet ad libitum. Approximately {{one-half of the}} bullocks received 27. 5 mg/kg of <b>sodium</b> <b>lasalocid</b> daily while the others were fed 27. 5 mg/kg of <b>sodium</b> <b>lasalocid</b> or <b>sodium</b> monensin on alternating days. The experiment was conducted with a randomized block design where ionophore treatment was the main effect and pens were blocks. The objectives {{of the study were}} to determine whether alternating two popularly used ionophores in feedlot diets affects average daily gain, efficiency of growth, total volatile fatty acid production, acetate to propionate ratio and/or carcass traits of young bulls. Bullocks were harvested by pen when the average fat thickness for a pen was estimated to be 0. 6 cm. Days on feed averaged 126 days for all bullocks and were the same for each treatment group. No differences were detected (P< 0. 05) in average daily gain, dry matter feed to gain ratio, cost of gain, total volatile fatty acid production or acetate to propionate ratio. No treatment effects were found for carcass maturity scores, ribeye area, percentage of kidney, pelvic and heart fat or carcass weight. Fat thickness, marbling score and quality grade were slightly higher and USDA sex class was lower (P< 0. 05) for bullocks continuously fed lasalocid than for those fed lasalocid and monensin on alternating days. While small differences were observed for certain carcass traits, it was concluded that alternating ionophores in feedlot diets fed to young bullocks makes little difference in beef production traits of economic importance and is probably not cost effective...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{experiments to}} determine whether preference for barley was affected when lambs ate various amounts of barley and whether lambs ate more barley when it contained <b>lasalocid</b> and <b>sodium</b> bicarbonate (NaHCO 3), both of which attenuate acidosis. In Exp. 1, lambs were assigned to two treatments (six lambs/treatment). For 2 d, lambs in two treatments were offered either 400 or 1, 200 g of rolled barley from 0600 to 0700 as a preload meal. A preference ratio [PR = barley ingested/(total amount of alfalfa + barley ingested) ] was calculated based on lambs 2 ̆ 7 intake when offered a choice of 200 g each of rolled barley and alfalfa pellets hourly from 0700 to 1100. After the preload meal, lambs in Treatment 1 (400 g preload) showed equal preference for barley (. 52) and alfalfa (. 48) for 4 h on d 1 (P 3 ̆e. 05); their preference for barley was less after the meal of barley on d 1 (. 52) than on d 2 (. 72), but their preference for barley declined between h 3 (. 81) and 4 (. 55) of d 2 (P =. 11). Lambs in Treatment 2 (1, 200 g preload) showed a low preference for barley on d 1 (. 29) and 2 (. 19) (P 3 ̆c. 001).

40|$|The {{cell wall}} is one major {{determinant}} of plant cell morphology, {{and is an}} attractive bioresource. Here, we report a novel strategy to modify plant cell wall property by small molecules. <b>Lasalocid</b> <b>sodium</b> (LS) was isolated by chemical screening to identify molecules that affect the cell morphology of tobacco BY- 2 cells. LS treatment led {{to an increase in}} cell wall thickness, whilst the quantity and sugar composition of the cell wall remained unchanged in BY- 2 cells. The chemical also disordered the cellular arrangement of hypocotyls of Arabidopsis plants, resulting in a decrease in hypocotyl length. LS treatment enhanced enzymatic saccharification efficiency in both BY- 2 cells and Arabidopsis plants. Microarray analysis on Arabidopsis showed that exposure to LS upregulated type III peroxidase genes, of which some are involved in lignin biogenesis, and jasmonic acid response genes, and phloroglucinol staining supported the activation of lignification by the LS treatment. As jasmonic acid-mediated lignification is a typical reaction to cell wall damage, it is possible that LS induces cell wall loosening, which can trigger cell wall damage response. Thus, LS is a unique chemical for modification of cell wall and morphology through changes in cell wall architecture...|$|E
40|$|A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric {{method was}} {{developed}} and validated to determine six polyether ionophores (<b>lasalocid</b> <b>sodium,</b> monensin sodium, salinomycin sodium, narasin, maduramicin ammonium alpha, and semduramicin sodium) in feed samples. The method developed was very straightforward, involving extraction with 84 % acetonitrile of the coccidiostats from the feed samples and filtration of the raw extract prior to chromatographic analysis. Method validation included the determination of selectivity, linearity, specificity, repeatability, the limit of detection, limit of quantification, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), and recovery. Feed samples from the Finnish national feed control programme and suspected carry-over samples from a feed manufacturer were analysed in parallel with an existing liquid chromatography method coupled with ultraviolet detection. All feed control samples were negative in LC-UV, but with the developed MS method, monensin, salinomycin, and narasin were detected at concentrations of < 0. 025 – 0. 73 [*]mg/kg, < 0. 025 – 0. 027 [*]mg/kg, and < 0. 025 – 1. 6 [*]mg/kg, respectively. In suspected carry-over samples after an output of 2. 0 tonnes of unmedicated feed in the pelletizer line, the concentrations of monensin, salinomycin, and narasin varied from undetected to 16 mg/kg. In the mixer line, after 3. 2 tonnes of unmedicated feed output, the concentrations of monensin, salinomycin, and narasin varied from undetected to 2. 4 [*]mg/kg...|$|E
40|$|A fit {{to purpose}} multi-analyte method for the {{official}} control of six coccidiostats (monensin sodium, salinomycin sodium, narasin, <b>lasalocid</b> <b>sodium,</b> semduramicin sodium and maduramicin ammonium alpha) at cross-contamination concentration levels in poultry, cattle, pig and calf compound feed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) {{has been developed}} and in-house validated. The corresponding maximum levels have been recently introduced by European legislation. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by centrifugation and filtration of the supernatants for all matrices. For calf feed an additional de-fattening step of the filtrated supernatants with n-hexane was necessary. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified by a modified approach of the standard additions technique applied to the extracts, hence allowing a workload comparable to matrix-matched standard calibration curves. A further simplification of this technique was reached by applying the same addition levels of the target analytes for different concentration ranging from 0. 5 × maximum level up to 2. 5 × maximum level (universal approach). The concentration independent intermediate precision {{expressed in terms of}} relative standard deviation varied between 3 and 12 % (except for maduramicin ammonium alpha and semduramicin sodium up to 21 %) and the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 111 %, depending on the target analyte and matrix. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were different for the various analyte/matrix/instrument combinations but all LOQs were in the 0. 01 ¿ 0. 65 mgkg- 1 range, hence well below the target concentrations of each analyte. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics the method is considered fit for the intended purpose. JRC. DG. D. 6 -Food Safety and Qualit...|$|E
40|$|Coccidiosis, an {{intestinal}} plasmodium infection, {{is a major}} {{infectious disease}} in poultry and rabbits. Eleven different coccidiostats are licensed in the EU {{for the prevention of}} coccidiosis in these animal species. According to their chemical nature and main biological activity, these compounds can be grouped as ionophoric (monensin, <b>lasalocid</b> <b>sodium,</b> salinomycin, narasin, maduramicin and semduramicin) or non-ionophoric (robenidine, decoquinate, nicarbazin, diclazuril, and halofuginone) substances. Coccidiostats are used as feed additives, mixed upon request into the compounded feed. During the technical process of commercial feed production, cross-contamination of feed batches can result in the exposure of non-target animals and induce adverse health effects in these animals due to a specific sensitivity of mammalian species as compared to poultry. Residue formation in edible tissues of non-target species may result in unexpected human exposure through the consumption of animal products. This review presents recent risk assessments performed by the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The health risk to non-target species that would result from the consumption of cross-contaminated feed with coccidostats at levels of 2, 5 or 10 % was found to be negligible for most animal species with the exception of salinomycin and monensin in horses because of the particular sensitivity for which toxicity may occur when cross-contamination exceeds 2 % and 5 % respectively. Kinetic data and tissue analyses showed that residues of coccidiostats may occur in the liver and eggs in some cases. However, the level of residues of each coccidiostat in edible animal tissues remained sufficiently low that the aggregate exposure of consumers would not exceed the established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each coccidiostat. It could be concluded that technical cross-contamination of animal feeds would not be expected to adversely affect the health of consumers...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that the demand for {{products}} of bovine origin increases {{every day in the}} world, and Brazil, which has the largest commercial herd of cattle on the planet, does not stay behind when it comes to raising beef cattle and milk. Despite our efforts to offer the best product, we are faced with difficult challenges in the country when it comes to climate and soil. The tropical climate, with rainy and dry seasons, ends up greatly damaging the pastures, thus offering less quality nutrients to our herds. As a domino effect, with less nutrients, there is more stress on the animal, which implies a poor reproductive efficiency, which is a crucial factor for effective production. However, there are viable outputs to improve the statistics, {{and one of them is}} reducing the interval between calving in cows relating to nutritional aspects, the important theme that the work will address. The nutritional strategy used in the experiment was the supplementation before, during and after the synchronization protocols for IATF. It consisted in the supply of 5 g / kg PV / animal / day, a multiple mixture containing 82 % ground corn, 8 % soybean meal, 4 % protected fat (Megalac®), 3 % protected urea, 2 % calcium carbonate, 0. 06 % mineral core, 0. 04 % Sodium Chloride and 0. 01 % <b>lasalocid</b> <b>sodium</b> 15 % (Taurotec®). Supplement delivery started 7 days prior to protocol (D 0) and lasted up to 20 after TAI, totaling 38 days. It was observed that the results showed an increase in the pregnancy rate of the primiparas that were supplemented, especially those with ECC below 3 (on the scale of 1 to 5), the percentage variation in the increment was of 2. 6 (ECC ≥ 3) to 7. 1 (ECC = 2. 75), presenting lower values in multiparous women. It is evident that, with due planning, observing the moments of nutritional deficit, it is possible to improve the interval between deliveries, thus improving production...|$|E
