Their attempts were not successful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. Mandated by the National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, and, in the case of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. The jobless Saint-Just, despite not meeting the <b>legal</b> <b>age</b> and tax qualifications, was allowed to join the Guard.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Augustus, Germanicus enjoyed an {{accelerated}} political career as the heir of the emperor's heir, entering the office of quaestor five years before the <b>legal</b> <b>age</b> in AD 7. He held that office until AD 11, and was elected consul {{for the first time}} in AD 12. The year after, he was made proconsul of Germania Inferior, Germania Superior, and all of Gaul. From there he commanded eight legions, about one-third of the entire Roman army, which he led against the Germanic tribes in his campaigns from AD 14 to 16. He avenged the Roman Empire's defeat in the Teutoberg Forest and retrieved two of the three legionary eagles that had been lost during the battle. In AD 17 he returned to Rome where he received a triumph before leaving to reorganize the provinces of Asia Minor, whereby he incorporated the provinces of Cappadocia and Commagene in AD 18.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus {{was given}} the title of {{quaestor}} in AD 7, five years before the <b>legal</b> <b>age</b> of 25, and in that year was sent to assist Tiberius {{in the war against}} the Pannonians and Dalmatians. According to Cassius Dio, Augustus sent Germanicus to Illyricum because Tiberius' lack of activity made Augustus suspect that he was delaying to remain under arms as long as possible under the pretense of war. Germanicus brought an army of levied citizens and manumitted slaves that were bought from their masters to reinforce Tiberius in Siscia, his base of operations in Illyricum. In late autumn/early winter additional reinforcements arrived at Siscia from Moesia and the East: three legions from Moesia led by Aulus Caecina Severus and two from Anatolia led by Silvanus with Thracian cavalry and auxiliary troops. While this did show that Augustus took the threat seriously, Tiberius had some soldiers sent back, because he had more than he needed.|$|E
30|$|A more redistributive {{pension system}} will delay the {{preferred}} <b>legal</b> retirement <b>ages</b> {{of the majority}} of workers, those with wages lower than the mean wage, by improving their pension benefits.

40|$|The Amethyst Initiative, {{signed by}} more than 100 college presidents and other higher {{education}} officials calls for a reexamination of the minimum <b>legal</b> drinking <b>age</b> in the United States. A central argument of the initiative is that the U. S. minimum <b>legal</b> drinking <b>age</b> policy results in more dangerous drinking than would occur if the <b>legal</b> drinking <b>age</b> were lower. A companion organization called Choose Responsibility explicitly proposes "a series of changes that will allow 18 - 20 year-olds to purchase, possess and consume alcoholic beverages. " Does the age- 21 drinking limit in the United States reduce alcohol consumption by young adults and its harms, or as the signatories of the Amethyst Initiative contend, is it "not working"? In this paper, we summarize a large and compelling body of empirical evidence which shows {{that one of the}} central claims of the signatories of the Amethyst Initiative is incorrect: setting the minimum <b>legal</b> drinking <b>age</b> at 21 clearly reduces alcohol consumption and its major harms. We use a panel fixed effects approach and a regression discontinuity approach to estimate the effects of the minimum <b>legal</b> drinking <b>age</b> on mortality, and we also discuss what is known about the relationship between the minimum <b>legal</b> drinking <b>age</b> and other adverse outcomes such as nonfatal injury and crime. We document the effect of the minimum <b>legal</b> drinking <b>age</b> on alcohol consumption and estimate the costs of adverse alcohol-related events on a per-drink basis. Finally we consider implications for the correct choice of a minimum <b>legal</b> drinking <b>age.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the main}} reforms {{undertaken}} to solve the viability of public pension systems is to delay the <b>legal</b> retirement <b>age.</b> In this sense, this paper suggests that governments attempting to achieve this objective should {{take into account the}} effects of modifying the redistributive nature of the pension system on workers’ preferred <b>legal</b> retirement <b>ages.</b> Using a two-staged political economy model where, in the first stage, the government decides the redistribution level of the Social Security programme and, in the second one, individuals face a majority voting process on the <b>legal</b> retirement <b>age,</b> we find that increases in the intra-generational redistribution level of the pension system are related to higher elected <b>legal</b> retirement <b>ages.</b>|$|R
5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a condom, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set it alight. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the <b>legal</b> <b>age</b> limit, on 30 November 1960.|$|E
5|$|Rudolf Caracciola {{was born}} in Remagen, Germany, on 30 January 1901. He was the fourth child of Maximilian and Mathilde, who ran the Hotel Fürstenberg.

5|$|The new work, {{like its}} predecessor, {{attracted}} minimal readership. On 21 June 1791, {{just days after}} it was published, all attention became focused on King Louis XVI's ill-fated flight to Varennes, and Saint-Just's theories about constitutional monarchy were made suddenly irrelevant. Yet the episode had another effect – it fostered a public anger toward the king which simmered all year until finally a Parisian mob attacked the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792. In response, the Assembly declared itself ready to step down ahead of schedule {{and called for a}} new election, this one under universal male suffrage. The timing was excellent for Saint-Just, who turned the <b>legal</b> <b>age</b> of twenty-five {{before the end of the}} month. The fear inspired by the invasion of the Tuileries made most of his opponents retire from the scene, and Saint-Just was elected as one of the deputies for the département of Aisne.

40|$|We compare a Social Security {{system where}} people can retire {{at the age of}} their own choice with one {{in which there is a}} <b>legal</b> {{retirement}} <b>age</b> elected through a majority voting process. We analyze how incentives on retirement decisions change depending on the retirement rules. We show that individuals prefer a <b>legal</b> retirement <b>age</b> higher than that they would choose in the flexible scheme since in this scheme they ignore the impact of their decisions on the Social Security budget constraint. In spite of that, we show that when the <b>legal</b> retirement <b>age</b> significantly limits the retirement age of high-wage workers, a flexible scheme would improve the financing of the pension system. Finally, we show that even when pension benefits are higher with a <b>legal</b> retirement <b>age,</b> a flexible system might be implemented since it would be preferred by a majority of the population composed by low- and high-wage workers.
