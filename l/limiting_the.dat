5|$|After the crown, {{the most}} {{important}} government institution in the late Middle Ages was the king's council, composed of the king's closest advisers.

5|$|Archaea show {{high levels}} of {{horizontal}} gene transfer between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, <b>limiting</b> <b>the</b> criterion's applicability. A second concern is to what extent such species designations have practical meaning.|$|E
