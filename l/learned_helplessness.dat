50|$|Although Hart's {{research}} {{acknowledges the}} structural injustices that exist, it also plays into an oppression analysis perspective of psychology. His research, in some ways, mirrors {{the work of}} Martin Seligman. Seligman did research on dogs, which was later used as a human model, and found that dogs placed {{in a situation where}} they cannot escape pain <b>learn</b> <b>helplessness</b> and lose the ability to escape when the option is re-opened to them. Hart's research has similar tones, in that he indicates a lack of positive outlets and activities as a reason for drug use in communities. However, his work is different in that it acknowledges the extreme structural injustices that were created to further oppress and imprison black minorities. He uses his research to argue for laws intended to make a society safer based on empirical evidence, rather than an oppressive legal system which forwards white supremacy, will move us closer to justice.|$|R

Negative experiences at school {{may lead to}} the development of <b>learning</b> <b>helplessness</b> syndrome. This article presents results of the study on educational helplessness in children {{and adolescents}} with intellectual disability who attended elementary, middle, and vocational schools. 181 pupils of special education centers with mild intellectual disability and 854 pupils of public schools were tested. The Intellectual Helplessness Scale for mathematics and the Polish language, and the Locus of Control over School Grades Scale were used. The obtained results indicate clear differences in educational helplessness in pupils from general population at different educational settings, but not in students with intellectual disability. The helplessness level for mathematics and the Polish language was significantly higher in public school pupils in comparison to pupils with intellectual disability in middle, and vocational schools. The results were interpreted regarding the specifics of the pupils’ educational environments...|$|R

40|$|AIM OF THE STUDY: This phenomenological {{study is}} aimed at {{illuminating}} nurses' lived experience {{of the process of}} preceptoring and the meaning of preceptorship in a Swedish context. METHODS: Seventeen nurses from the North of Sweden with varied previous experience of preceptorship volunteered to participate. Their narratives, describing their experience of being a personal preceptor for a student nurse during practical training on a hospital ward in the third year of a 3 -year diploma programme within a university college of nursing in Sweden, were transcribed verbatim. A phenomenological-hermeneutic interpretation disclosed the themes 'sheltering the students when learning' and 'facilitating the students' learning', together with eight sub-themes, which created an understanding of the meaning of preceptorship. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: The meaning of preceptorship was understood as reducing the risk of the students <b>learning</b> <b>helplessness</b> and empowering the students when learning in practice. The meaning of preceptorship highlighted the need for further preceptor support and development {{of the role of the}} preceptor. On the basis of the findings, suggestions were made to increase the preceptors' awareness of values in nursing practice and use of pedagogical strategies in the process of preceptoring. Through such strategies a reciprocal development of the preceptors' and the faculty's knowledge may take place, to the best advantage of the students' learning and the development of the profession...|$|R
40|$|Helplessness deficits are {{characterized}} by an organism’s failure to escape escapable situations after exposure to aversive stimuli. It has recently been <b>learned</b> that <b>helplessness</b> is the mammalian default protective response, {{and that it is}} subdued as mammals learn to control their environment. Human helplessness responses are mediated by our ability to think; explanations for adverse stimuli that tend toward the individual’s inability to control a stimulus can cause a person to exhibit helplessness deficits. This paper proposes a theory of cultural helplessness, positing that information and beliefs spread through cultural transmission can provide individuals with automatic explanations, which can potentially lead to helplessness deficits across a population when group members are subjected to similar aversive stimuli. This theory is applied to a group of African-American law students who have the ability to score well on the LSAT and pass the Bar Exam on the first try, but do not. Positive psychology, applied as part of an interdisciplinary strategy, is proposed as a way to help these students to perceive themselves as being in control of their fate, thus allowing them to achieve according to their ability...|$|R
25|$|The {{goal of a}} trafficker is to turn a {{human being}} into a slave. To do this, {{perpetrators}} employ tactics {{that can lead to}} the psychological consequence of <b>learned</b> <b>helplessness</b> for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives. Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of <b>learned</b> <b>helplessness.</b>|$|E

25|$|Some {{supporters}} of PMS {{as a social}} construct believe PMDD and PMS to be unrelated issues: according to them, PMDD {{is a product of}} brain chemistry, and PMS is a product of a hypochondriatic culture. Most studies on PMS and PMDD rely solely on self-reporting. According to sociologist Carol Tavris, Western women are socially conditioned to expect PMS or to at least know of its existence, and they therefore report their symptoms accordingly. The anthropologist Emily Martin argues that PMS is a cultural phenomenon that continues to grow in a positive feedback loop, and thus is a social construction that contributes to <b>learned</b> <b>helplessness</b> or convenient excuse. Tavris says that PMS is blamed as an explanation for rage or sadness. The decision to call PMDD an illness has been criticized as inappropriate medicalization. In both cases, they are referring to the emotional aspects, not the normal physical symptoms that are subjectively present.|$|E
25|$|<b>Learned</b> <b>{{helplessness}}</b> theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people {{develop a sense of}} body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E
2500|$|Using dogs, Martin Seligman and {{his colleagues}} pioneered the study of {{depression}} in the animal model of <b>learned</b> <b>helplessness</b> at the University of Pennsylvania. Dogs were separated into three groups, the control group, group A had control over when they were being shocked and group B {{had no control over}} when they were being shocked. After the shocking condition the dogs were tested in a shuttle box where they could escape shock by jumping over a partition. To eliminate an interference effect – that the dogs did not learn responses while being shocked that would interfere with their normal escape behavior – the dogs were immobilized using curare, a paralyzing drug while they were being shocked. Both the control group and group A tended to jump over the partition to escape shock while group B dogs did not jump and would passively take the shock. The dogs in group B perceived that the outcome was not related to their efforts. [...] Consequently, a theory emerged that attributed the behavior of the animals to the effects of the shock as a stressor so extreme that it depleted a neurochemical needed by the animals for movement. [...] After the dogs study the effects of helplessness have been tested in species from fish to cats. [...] Most recently <b>learned</b> <b>helplessness</b> has been studied in rhesus macaques using inescapable shock, evoked through stress situations like forced swimming, behavioral despair tasks, tails suspension and pinch induced catalepsy; situations that render the monkey incapable of controlling the environment.|$|E

2500|$|The New Thought {{movement}} has received criticism akin to that levied against the holistic health movement {{due to this}} assertion: in claiming that sickness {{is caused by a}} person’s attitudes, mental states, and faith in New Thought, it is easy to place blame on patients for not adopting the proper attitude, thought processes, and/or lifestyle, thus causing their disease or disorder [...] By blaming ill individuals for causing their own disease, the New Thought movement is encouraging further victimization of patients well beyond the boundaries of their disease symptoms. Blame can have powerful psychological effects – with stress and isolation seen in victim blaming being the largest issues that arise and the most concerning in terms of effect on patients’ health [...] Further, holding beliefs that health and disease is controlled by faith in a higher power can create an external locus of control (i.e., believers may feel as though they themselves cannot prevent disease, and that any illness or disorder that they encounter is an act of the higher power’s will). This external locus of control can create <b>learned</b> <b>helplessness</b> in believers which has been shown to exacerbate mental and physical health conditions via several mechanisms – including reduced incidence of help-seeking behaviour [...] Overall, the New Thought movement is not empirically supported and its position on the etiology and treatment of disease is far more harmful than helpful to followers of New Thought.|$|E
