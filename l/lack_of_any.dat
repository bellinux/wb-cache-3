5|$|The British Army {{tried to}} learn {{the lessons of the}} First World War, and adopt them into its pre-war doctrine. In the 1920s, and much of the 1930s, the General Staff tried to {{establish}} a small, mechanised, professional army and formed the Experimental Mechanized Force but, with the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> identified threat, its main function reverted to garrison duties around the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|The Churches of Christ {{generally}} {{combine the}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> historical {{evidence that the}} early church used musical instruments in worship {{and the belief that}} there is no scriptural support for using instruments in the church's worship service to decide that instruments should not be used today in worship. Churches of Christ have historically practiced a cappella music in worship services.|$|E
5|$|According to Luttwak, {{the forward}} defence system was always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous borders {{to deal with}} such threats. In addition, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> reserves {{to the rear of the}} border entailed that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage deep into the empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E

Two major types of non-response exist: unit nonresponse (referring to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> completion <b>of</b> <b>any</b> part <b>of</b> the survey) and item non-response (submission or participation in survey but failing to complete one or more components/questions of the survey).|$|R
5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack of name {{recognition}} hindered his chances for nomination. When included in Republican presidential preference polls, he regularly received {{less than one}} percent support. Following a last place finish in the Ames Straw Poll and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> invitation to presidential debates, he dropped his candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed Mitt Romney. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the Late Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the same}} genera were present across these formations, though they varied at the species level. For example, the Djadochta was {{inhabited}} by Velociraptor mongoliensis, Protoceratops andrewsi, and Pinacosaurus grangeri, while the Bayan Mandahu was home to Velociraptor osmolskae, Protoceratops hellenikorhinus, and Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively {{close to each other}} geographically. However, given the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, {{it is more likely that}} those differences indicate a slight time difference.|$|E

5|$|Other {{peculiar}} calendars include ancient Greek calendars. These were nominally lunar, {{starting with}} the New Moon. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ton theoi, by the moon. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as games or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism {{may have been used}} as a politically neutral form of timekeeping. Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.|$|E
5|$|Our World {{producers}} selected each episode's subject {{time period}} {{with the help}} of consultants from the Smithsonian Institution and Columbia University. The show was limited in its choices by the available footage for the given time period. Ellerbee recalled a viewer-submitted proposal for an episode on the American Civil War, which could not be made because of the non-existence of archive footage from the 1860s and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> living eyewitnesses.|$|E
5|$|The Air Ministry was unsympathetic to Coastal Command and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> {{suitable}} {{place for}} aerodromes made improvements difficult to implement. OTU airfields required {{a number of}} features not available in all locations. The main requirement was a quiet area so that OTU flights would not interfere with stations that were already operational. To prevent losses to enemy air attacks, it was also necessary to keep OTUs {{as far away from}} enemy airspace as possible, while the sensitive airspace over convoy routes and near Scapa Flow were also inappropriate places to launch OTUs.|$|E
30|$|To conclude, {{one should}} briefly mention on an {{existence}} of α′-TCP polymorph, which {{was discovered in}} 1959 (Nurse et al. 1959). However, this TCP polymorph <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> practical interest because it only exists at temperatures between ~ 1450  °C and its melting point (~ 1756  °C). It reverts to α-TCP polymorph by cooling below the transition temperature. Additional details on α-TCP {{are available in the}} topical review (Carrodeguas and de Aza 2011).|$|R

5|$|The Argentine territories, {{held back}} by their closed economies, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> {{activity}} closely linked to foreign trade, and the scant amounts of labour and capital they consequently received, fell far behind those of {{other areas of the}} colonial world that participated in foreign trade. Only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity, as occurred in Tucuman, where cloth was manufactured, and in Córdoba and the Litoral, where livestock was raised to supply the mines of Upper Peru.|$|E
5|$|The Sedan bridgeheads {{were still}} not safe. French forces were massing to the south. Guderian {{decided it was}} better to mount an {{aggressive}} defence given the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> suitable anti-tank weapons for a defensive battle. The better option would be to attack rather than defend. The advance of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions had assisted his progress. They ran into and defeated elements of X Corps near Chemery. The French Corps was heading towards Sedan, but withdrew southward after the engagement. Any potential threat on the German western flank had been removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{speculates that}} Gregory had {{originally intended to}} send the British slave boys as missionaries, until in 596 he received news that Liudhard had died, thus opening the way for more serious missionary activity. Higham argues {{that it was the}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> bishop in Britain which allowed Gregory to send Augustine, with orders to be consecrated as a bishop if needed. Another consideration was that cooperation would be more easily obtained from the Frankish royal courts if they no longer had their own bishop and agent in place.|$|E
50|$|Alatrism or alatry (Greek: {{from the}} privative ἀ- + λατρεία (latreia) = worship) is the {{recognition}} of the existence of one or more gods, but with a deliberate <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> worship <b>of</b> <b>any</b> deity.

5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected {{and that was the}} primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding {{the fact that there was}} a total <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used in the}} field to distinguish Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca from lookalike species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and forked gills that are saffron to orange coloured; and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> distinctive taste or odour. The false chanterelle can be distinguished from the true chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, velvety cap surface, forked gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and lack of the characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula, found in Britain, has fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. H.rufa has velvety brown fur covering its cap, while H.macrospora has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than H.aurantiaca. H.tapinia, found in a range extending from southern Florida to Central America, is set apart from H.aurantiaca by its growth on or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3µm.|$|E
