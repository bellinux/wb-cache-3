50|$|Before 1837, the East India Company's dominions in India had no {{universal}} public <b>postal</b> <b>service,</b> {{one that}} was shared by all regions. Although courier services did exist, connecting the more important towns with their respective seats of provincial government (i.e. the Presidency towns of Fort William (Calcutta), Fort St. George (Madras), and Bombay), private individuals were, upon payment, only sparingly allowed their use. That situation changed in 1837, when, by Act XVII of that year, a public post, run by the Company's Government, {{was established in the}} Company's territory in India. Post offices were established in the principal towns and postmasters appointed. The postmasters of the Presidency towns oversaw a few provincial post offices in addition to being responsible for the main <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> between the provinces. By contrast, the District collectors (originally, collectors of land-tax) directed the District post offices, including their <b>local</b> <b>postal</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Postal</b> <b>services</b> required payment in cash, to be made in advance, with the amount charged usually varying with weight and distance.

40|$|Inadequate {{infrastructure}} {{is a major}} development challenges in developing countries. This paper applies factor analysis to determine the pattern of access to rural service infrastructure on 158 farming households in the Limpopo Province. The nine components of access to service infrastructure (distance to Polokwane, nearest town, local government, hospital, magistrate office, post office, traditional authority, district agricultural offices and extension service) were subjected to factor analysis. The results support the concept of centre-periphery pattern of service infrastructure development. Polokwane is a major centre in the Province, and provide a composite of services. Its peripheries are regions, which have towns as centres. Health, <b>local</b> government and <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> are mainly found in such regional centres. The district centres provide mainly agricultural and justice services. Finally, local centres provide services of traditional authorities, agriculture and <b>postal</b> <b>services.</b> These patterns have major implication for infrastructure development policy and programs. They {{also need to be}} considered in current crafting of institutions for rural economic development. Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|R
