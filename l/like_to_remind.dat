25|$|Russia has {{recently}} been accused in the West (i.e. Europe and the United States) of using its natural resources as a policy tool to be wielded against offending states like Georgia, Ukraine, and other states it perceives as hindrances to its power. According to one estimate, since 1991 {{there were more than}} 55 energy incidents, of which more than 30 had political underpinnings. Only 11 incidents had no political connections. On the other hand, Russian officials <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> their Western partners that even {{at the height of the}} Cold War the Soviet Union never disrupted energy supplies to the West.|$|E

In an interview, Clarke had previously indicated she had become reluctant to do nude scenes unless it served the plot. After the episode aired, Clarke made a point to indicate {{that it was not}} a body double in {{the final scene}} of the episode, stating, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> people the last time I took my clothes off was season 3. That was awhile ago. It's now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I'm just feeling genuinely happy I said 'Yes.' That ain't no body double!" [...] She continued, [...] "Taking off my clothes is not the easiest thing, but with the magic of the effects, I don't have to do a season 1 and go on a cliff and do it, I'm in control of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|As vice {{chairman}} of the Revolutionary Command Council, al-Douri was involved in the wars against Iran and Kuwait. During the 1988–1989 Al-Anfal Campaign, al-Douri was said to have ordered Ali Hassan al-Majid (aka 'Chemical Ali') to use Mustard and Sarin nerve gas on Kurdish fighters in Halabja.

50|$|Spenser {{was born}} in Laramie, Wyoming and is a Boston private eye in the mold of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, a smart-mouthed tough guy with a heart of gold. Unlike Marlowe, Spenser {{maintains}} a committed relationship with one woman (Susan Silverman). Although he is an ex-boxer (who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> readers that he once fought the former heavyweight champ Jersey Joe Walcott) and lifts weights to stay in shape, he also is quite well educated, cooks, and lives by a code of honor he and Susan discuss occasionally—though as infrequently as he can manage.|$|R
5000|$|Grumpy Bear (voiced by Doug Erholtz) - His sardonic {{and often}} sarcastic {{attitude}} usually {{gives way to}} his caring nature and heart, not unlike the rain cloud and heart shaped raindrops that make up his belly badge.

60|$|Nor did Christabel <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> her of it, {{fearing that}} the {{occasion}} for giving it might never come; but she did feel {{that it was a}} mournful thing to see the child, who was in danger of so fearful a sorrow, wasting her grief in pining after foolish fancies, and turning {{what should have been a}} refreshing holiday into an occasion of longing after what she thus made into pomps and vanities of this wicked world. Christabel had heard that people who murmur among blessings often have those blessings snatched away, and this made her tremble for poor little discontented Elizabeth.|$|E

He <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> of his plebeian origin and used these stories to better evoke it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have always}} said [...] "No" [...] hitherto,' replied the woman, 'considering I could say no more if put upon my oath, as I {{expected}} to be. But speaking in a common everyday way now the occurrence is past, I believe a few things of some kind (though I doubt if they were papers) were left in a workbox she had, because she talked about it to Mr. Brown, and was rather angry at what occurred--you see, she had a temper by all account, and so I didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> the lady of this workbox when she came the other day with her husband.' ...|$|E

Jesus Christ, the great Physician, will teach you how to use it, if you will seek advice from himself. I feel assured that you will not take this parting word ill. Good night, gentlemen.

6000|$|Back in the Maritime Capital, and oh, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly! They have sighted the Little Sally {{from the}} terrace! How happy I am! There will be letters from you, and I shall hear {{all that has}} {{happened}} in America, and I shall never again doubt that Altruria is real! I don't know how I shall get these letters of mine back to you, but somehow it can be managed. Perhaps the Saraband's crew will like to take the Little Sally home again; perhaps when Mr. Thrall knows the ship is here he will want to buy it and go back to his money in America and the misery of it! Do you believe he will? Should I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> my husband of his promise to take me home on a visit? Oh, my heart misgives me! I wonder if the captain of the Little Sally has brought his wife and children with him, and is going to settle among us, or whether he has just let his men have the vessel, and they have come to Altruria without him?

60|$|I {{have no more}} {{desire to}} define ugliness than I have daring to define beauty; but still I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> those who mock at beauty as being an unpractical thing of this fact, that an ugly thing is merely a thing that is badly made, or a thing that does not serve it purpose; that ugliness is want of fitness; that ugliness is failure; that ugliness is uselessness, such as {{ornament}} in the wrong place, while beauty, as some one finely said, is the purgation of all superfluities. There is a divine economy about beauty; it gives us just what is needful and no more, whereas ugliness is always extravagant; ugliness is a spendthrift and wastes its material; in fine, ugliness--and I would commend this remark to Mr. Wentworth Huyshe--ugliness, as much in costume as in anything else, is always the sign that somebody has been unpractical. So the costume of the future in England, if it is founded on the true laws of freedom, comfort, and adaptability to circumstances, cannot fail to be most beautiful also, because beauty is the sign always of the rightness of principles, the mystical seal that is set upon what is perfect, and upon what is perfect only.|$|E
6000|$|... “My poor, dear boy!” {{observed}} Glenalmond. “My poor dear and, if {{you will}} allow me to say so, very foolish boy! You are only discovering where you are; to one of your temperament, or of mine, a painful discovery. The world was not made for us; it was made for ten hundred millions of men, all {{different from each other}} and from us; there’s no royal road there, we just have to sclamber and tumble. Don’t think that I am at all disposed to be surprised; don’t suppose that I ever think of blaming you; indeed I rather admire! But there fall to be offered one or two observations on the case which occur to me and which ({{if you will}} listen to them dispassionately) may be the means of inducing you to view the matter more calmly. First of all, I cannot acquit you of a good deal of what is called intolerance. You seem to have been very much offended because your father talks a little sculduddery after dinner, which it is perfectly licit for him to do, and which (although I am not very fond of it myself) appears to be entirely an affair of taste. Your father, I scarcely <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> you, since it is so trite a commonplace, is older than yourself. At least, he is major and sui juris, and may please himself in the matter of his conversation. And, do you know, I wonder if he might not have as good an answer against you and me? We say we sometimes find him coarse, but I suspect he might retort that he finds us always dull. Perhaps a relevant exception.” ...|$|E
