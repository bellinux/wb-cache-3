Using list decoding techniques, we propose an efficient algorithm that enables an adaptive tradeoff between the number of <b>locked</b> <b>positions</b> and the number of changes.|$|R

Hypermobility syndrome can lead to chronic pain or even disability in severe cases.

5000|$|During Summer, 1942 Gilbert (as {{were many}} {{manufacturing}} companies) was compelled by Federal wartime restrictions to cease manufacturing (and even servicing!) its electric train and other metal consumer products. It did not again publish American Flyer catalogs until 1946. The manufacturing hiatus offered the company {{the opportunity to}} further differentiate the products {{from those of the}} market leaders (by sales volume) Marx and Lionel. By Summer, 1945 it was able to resume limited manufacturing of the 3/16s scale O gauge trains. While it did so, the same sized products were re-engineered to run on much more realistic two rail (with a [...] "T" [...] profile rail) track. The fine detail of the diecast engines, tenders and cars that had debuted in the '39 catalog reappeared. The engines and tenders continued to be made of diecast metal, but the cars' bodies were made out of plastic. Two pages of the spectacular 1946 catalog emphasize the running advantages of the lighter cars. Ironically, they soon realized that they had to add weight. Metal car bottoms & chassis were necessary to prevent the too-light cars from tipping over. The 'link & pin' automatic couplers that had been introduced on the 3/16s O products were reduced in size, with plastic replacing the sintered metal of the originals. They too, later had metal weights added because they would fail to descend to the <b>locking</b> <b>position</b> needed for cars to couple. The chugging mechanisms of the premium O gauge tenders were redesigned to also generate smoke, which was conveyed to the engines' smokestacks via a black rubber tube that protruded out of the rear of the cab so that it could connect {{to the front of the}} tender.|$|E

30|$|Figure  13 shows a {{cross-sectional}} {{view of a}} leg and station when the leg is locked. As it is shown, there is {{a gap between the}} pin and <b>locking</b> <b>position</b> of station, and there is two incline planes in the pin. These allow MoMo 3 to combine with the field smoothly. However, the gap causes a misalignment between the pins and the entering holes at the other leg, and this will be increased by the existence of an abrasion. This indicates that the durability of MoMo 3 and the field is important. Therefore, the essential components of MoMo 3 and the field are manufactured using the metal materials to increase their durability. However, this does not completely guarantee against the abrasion of these parts. Therefore, MoMo 3 requires an additional process to overcome the error caused by abrasion.|$|E

The fracture surface was found to be extensively damaged and as a result, fractographic features on majority of the fracture surface were obliterated. However, in isolated places, the fracture surface was relatively preserved and examination of these regions showed presence of ductile dimple rupture, typical of overload failure. Because of post fracture damage, fractographic study alone was not adequate for establishing the failure mode. However, the fractographic study along with evidences available on the side track (port) suggests that the fracturing of the eyering shaft occurred most probably due to excessive load.

40|$|The use of convergent-beamSPECT can {{increase}} detection sen-sitivity; however, the projection data {{are likely to}} be truncated if the patient is not properly positioned. This article describes a patient-positioningmethod that has been adopted in our hospital for cardiac SPECT scanswhen convergent-beamcollimators are used. Methods: The system that we use has 3 detector heads and a patient table (i. e., bed) with 3 locking positions: left, center, and right. When convergent-beam collimators are used in a car-diac SPECT scan, the patient table is locked in the left position, and a noncircular contour orbit is set up. Results:We were able to acquire truncation-free cardiac projections for all of our pa-tients. Conclusion: Patient positioning in convergent-beam SPECT is important. If the patient is not positioned properly, then the heart may be truncated in some projection views. The use of the left <b>locking</b> <b>position</b> of the patient table positions the heart at the center of rotation, and the heart is not truncated in the projection data.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} seismic {{response}} and optimum {{design of a}} base isolation system for earthquake protection of structures. The system incorporates spherical supports for the base, a specially designed spring-cam system to keep the base rigidly supported under normal conditions and {{to allow it to}} move {{for the duration of the}} earthquake under the constraint of a spring with optimized stiffness characteristics. A single degree of freedom structure was considered to investigate the feasibility of the concept. The simulation of the system response shows a 20 times reduction of the transmitted force as a result of using the proposed design in the considered case. This paper extends the previous study to the case a 3 story concrete structure subjected to the Taft as well as El Centro earthquakes. A 11. 5 and 17 times reduction of the maximum transmitted force was achieved for the considered disturbances respectively without any adverse effects due to the tilting moment which is inherent in this type of base isolation. Since the system performance is highly dependent on the rapid unlocking of the cams in the event of a seismic disturbance, careful consideration should be given to the design of a reliable cam release control. This can be achieved by spring loading each cam such that it would be normally unlocked. A hydraulic actuator would be used to force it rotate to the <b>locking</b> <b>position</b> under fluid pressure which would be constantly maintained at the design level during normal conditions. The actuator would be equipped with a quick response release valve for rapidly releasing the pressure and consequently unlocking the cam as soon as an earthquake is detected...|$|E

We then propose a new algorithm based on Guruswami-Sudan list decoding, which is slower but provides an adaptive tradeoff between the number of <b>locked</b> <b>positions</b> and the average number of changes.|$|R
40|$|The {{aspects of}} having a non-perfect {{conducting}} shell surrounding a reversedfield pinch (RFP) plasma are addressed in this thesis and experimental results from two RFP experiments with different shells are presented. In par- ticular this thesis addresses the effects a resistive shell has on the self- generation of toroidal flux in the plasma, the dynamo, and points out the necessiW of reducing these influences {{in order to avoid}} detrimental sideeffects such as wall locking. Experimental results show that the resistiveshell boundary causes the internally-resonant tearing modes to lock to the wall, and develop a so-called wall-locked mode, which is a toroidally localized (/Xqb 60), large (/XBr (a) < 0. 1 Bo (a)) radial magnetic field perturba- tion. Toroidal flux measurements q = rra 2 (B+) show large (/xq/q < 0. 2) stationary perturbations of the toroidal flux. Although the toroidal flux perturbation is stationary, the poloidal voltage producing the perturbation is fluctuating and occurs as local dynamo events. These local dynamo events, or Vo spikes, appear at the position of the wall-locked mode and rotate toroidally around the toms, diffuse toroidally and reconnect toroidally in less than one toroidal turn, thus yielding an axisymmetric toroidal flux contribution. The stationary toroidal field perturbation is a result of a fixed starting position of these local dynamo events determined by the walllocked mode. The wall <b>locking</b> <b>position</b> can be affected by applying external magnetic field errors, which in turn interact with the plasma {{in such a way that}} the initial field error is amplified.
