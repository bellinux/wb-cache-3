40|$|Background Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} is {{the second}} deadliest cancer with limited treatment options. Loss of PTEN causes the P 13 K/Akt pathway to be hyperactive which contributes to cell survival and resistance to therapeutics in various cancers, including the liver cancer. Hence molecules targeting this pathway present good therapeutic strategies for liver cancer. Hypothesis It was previously reported that Cardiac glycosides possessed antitumor activity by inducing apoptosis of multiple cancer cells through oxidative stress. However, whether Cardiac glycoside <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> can induce oxidative stress in liver cancer cells and induce cell death both in vitro and in vivo remains unknown. Methods Cell viability was measured by SRB assay. Cell death analysis was investigated by propidium iodide staining with flow cytometry and PARP cleavage. DCFH-DA staining and cytometry were used for intracellular ROS measurement. Protein levels were analyzed by western blot analysis. Antitumor activity was investigated on mice xenografts in vivo. Results In this study, we found that Cardiac glycosides, particularly <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> from Digitalis ferruginea could significantly inhibit PTEN protein adequate Huh 7 and PTEN deficient Mahlavu human liver cancer cell proliferation by the induction of apoptosis and G 2 /M arrest in the cells. <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> was further shown to induce oxidative stress and alter ERK and Akt pathways. Consequently, JNK 1 activation resulted in extrinsic apoptotic pathway stimulation in both cells while JNK 2 activation involved in the inhibition of cell survival only in PTEN deficient cells. Furthermore, nude mice xenografts followed by MRI showed that <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> caused {{a significant decrease in}} the tumor size. In this study apoptosis induction by <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> was characterized through ROS altered ERK and Akt pathways in both PTEN adequate epithelial and deficient mesenchymal liver cancer cells. Conclusion The results indicated that <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> could be contemplated in liver cancer therapeutics, particularly in PTEN deficient tumors. This is due to Lanatoside C's stress inducing action on ERK and Akt pathways through differential activation of JNK 1 and JNK 2 by GSK 3 β. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) is {{the most}} common {{malignant}} brain tumor in adults. We designed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector for intracranial delivery of secreted, soluble tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL) to GBM tumors in mice and combined it with the TRAIL-sensitizing cardiac glycoside, <b>lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> (lan C). We applied this combined therapy to two different GBM models using human U 87 glioma cells and primary patient-derived GBM neural spheres in culture and in orthotopic GBM xenograft models in mice. In U 87 cells, conditioned medium from AAV 2 -sTRAIL expressing cells combined with lan C induced 80 % cell death. Similarly, lan C sensitized primary GBM spheres to sTRAIL causing over 90 % cell death. In mice bearing intracranial U 87 tumors treated with AAVrh. 8 -sTRAIL, administration of lan C caused a decrease in tumor-associated Fluc signal, while tumor size increased within days of stopping the treatment. Another round of lan C treatment re-sensitized GBM tumor to sTRAIL-induced cell death.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli are {{resistant}} to wide range of antibiotics rendering the treatment of infections very difficult. A main mechanism attributed to the resistance is the function of efflux pumps. MexAB-OprM and AcrAB-TolC are the tripartite efflux pump assemblies, responsible for multidrug resistance in P. aeruginosa and E. coli respectively. Substrates that are more susceptible for efflux are predicted to have a common pharmacophore feature map. In this study, a new criterion of excluding compounds with efflux substrate-like features was used, thereby refining the selection process and enriching the inhibitor identification process. An in-house database of phytochemicals was created and screened using high-throughput virtual screening against AcrB and MexB proteins and filtered by matching with the common pharmacophore models (AADHR, ADHNR, AAHNR, AADHN, AADNR, AAADN, AAADR, AAANR, AAAHN, AAADD and AAADH) generated using known efflux substrates. Phytochemical hits that matched with any {{one or more of}} the efflux substrate models were excluded from the study. Hits that do not have features similar to the efflux substrate models were docked using XP docking against the AcrB and MexB proteins. The best hits of the XP docking were validated by checkerboard synergy assay and ethidium bromide accumulation assay for their efflux inhibition potency. <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> and diadzein were filtered based on the synergistic potential and validated for their efflux inhibition potency using ethidium bromide accumulation study. These compounds exhibited the ability to increase the accumulation of ethidium bromide inside the bacterial cell as evidenced by these increase in fluorescence in the presence of the compounds.

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether the impaired reflex response to cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading in hypertensive patients with {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} can be promptly improved by a pharmacological challenge. For this purpose we studied the effects of acute digitalis administration on cardiopulmonary baroreflex, evaluated by forearm noradrenaline spillover. Eleven hypertensives with left ventricular hypertrophy and 10 age- and sex-matched normotensives underwent the application of - 5 and - 10 mmHg lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) {{before and after the}} administration of digitalis. Forearm noradrenaline spillover, measured using a tracer technique, was used to estimate the reflex sympathetic response. Under control conditions LBNP evoked a similar fall in right atrial pressure in the two study groups. In the normotensives there was a significant increase in forearm noradrenaline spillover. In the hypertensives no significant changes in forearm noradrenaline spillover were found. Intravenous administration of 0. 02 mg/kg <b>lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> was associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure and a reduction in forearm noradrenaline spillover in both groups. In the normotensives the percentage change in forearm noradrenaline spillover induced by LBNP increased significantly in response to digitalis administration. However, digitalis restored the response of forearm noradrenaline spillover to LBNP in the hypertensives, so that no significant difference in this response was detected between the two study groups. Digitalis did not modify the effects of LBNP on cardiac pressures in either group. The present results demonstrate that administration of <b>lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> restores the response of forearm noradrenaline spillover to cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. This indicates that the impairment of cardiopulmonary baroreflexes in these patients can be reversed by acute pharmacological treatment. Therefore, impairment of this reflex response seems to be related to functional rather than to structural abnormalities of the hypertrophied ventricle...|$|E

Hepatocellular carcinoma {{is the second}} deadliest and fifth most common cancer type worldwide. Due to the limited therapy options, {{it is crucial to}} develop novel targeted therapeutic agents that provide better prognosis and enhance life quality of patients. The specific aim of this thesis was to identify and characterize novel compounds with anticancer properties in liver cancer. Three groups of molecules were investigated. First group were cardiac glycosides extracted and purified from Digitalis Ferruginea. Extensive analysis Glycoside <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> revealed that these molecules induced ROS accumulation in liver cancer cells with differential downstream targets in mesenchymal-like PTENdeficient drug-resistant Mahlavu and epithelial-like PTEN-adequate drug-sensitive Huh 7 liver cancer cells. Xenograft models on nude mice also confirmed the anticancer activities of <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> in vivo with decreased tumor volume and weight. The second group of compounds were novel molecules that contains triazolothiadiazine and triazolothiadiazole scaffold, derived from known NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and flurbiprofen). Results indicated that SubG 1 /G 1 cell cycle arrest is induced in treated cells. In addition, extensive molecular analysis disclosed oxidative stress induction and COX activity inhibition leading to ASK 1 activation and Akt inhibition. The levels of downstream elements GSK 3 β, β-catenin and CyclinD 1 were also altered. Apoptosis was characterized as the cell death mechanism that is triggered by these molecules in liver cancer cells. Novel nucleobase/nucleoside analogues were the third group of molecules explored in this study. 24 of 127 investigated compounds showed significant cytotoxicity during initial screening. 6 molecules were selected for further molecular analysis upon real-time cytotoxicity assay. It was observed that the molecules induced SubG 1 /G 1 cell cycle arrest through Src pathway inhibition. CyclinE-cdk 2 complex formation was prevented then the inhibition of Rb leading to a decrease in cell growth and proliferation and induction of apoptosis in liver cancer cells. This thesis disclosed the mode of action of three groups molecules, glycosides are pure examples of drug repurposing.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{increasing}} clinical use of pure digitalis glycosides and the claims made for the various substances now available it becomes desirable to clarify {{as far as possible}} important differences in individual glycosides. To date there is little agreement in reported studies, owing to differences in methods used and criteria for comparison. Visscher and LaDue (1) pointed out that when the basis for comparison was the single intravenous dose required for “full digitali-zation ” in auricular fibrillation there was a remarkably small difference in the molar quantity of ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin and <b>lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> required to pro-duce comparable effects. They added that it was by no means certain that such a comparison would hold for other criteria. Because of the dual mechanism of digitalis action on the heart itself, vagal and direct muscle actions, and sub-sequent changes in the circulation, evaluation of these drugs in the intact animal becomes difficult.

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{the most}} {{malignant}} variant of glioma. This tumor does not only display an extremely aggressive, invasive growth pattern, but is also very difficult to treat. With a two-year survival rate of 40 % and a median survival of 12 - 18 months after treatment, prognosis is poor. Current treatment options are not successful in halting tumor progression and GBM tumors are highly heterogeneous, display all kinds of anti-apoptotic escape routes, suppress the immune system, invade the surrounding parenchyma with unmatched aggressiveness and possess a whole array of tools to rearrange the extra tumoral environment to their advantage.

40|$|THE {{value of}} the {{foxglove}} as. a diuretic in dropsy was first recognized by William Withering in 1785. Since that time the digitalis glucosides have come to assume the primary therapeutic role {{in the treatment of}} congestive cardiac failure, and their pharmacological action upon the mammalian heart {{has been the subject of}} extensive studies. Cushny (1925), Schafer (1934), Cattell and Gold (1938), and Gold and Cattell (1940), employing heart-muscle strips, isolated hearts, and heart-lung preparations, showed that digitalis increases the force of the myo-cardial contraction, and Peters and Visscher (1936), in metabolic studies of the isolated heart, showed that it can increase the efficiency as well as the force of the myocardial contraction. The slowing of the heart-rate which follows digitalization both in man and in animals has been found to be due in part to vagal stimulation, and therefore abolished by atropine, and in part to depression of atrio-ventricular conduction—an observation which we owe to the electro-cardiographic studies of Lewis, Drury, and Hiescu (1921 - 2). The mode of action of digitalis upon the failing human heart has been a subject of renewed interest since the technique of right heart catheterization has made possible the measure-ment of the cardiac output and intracardiac pressures.

Cardiac glycosides are important group of molecules for both their treating properties in heart failure and their potential effects in cancer therapy. We investigated the cardiac glycosides that are extracted from Digitalis Ferruginea which can be frequently found in Turkey. These glycosides are Lanatoside A, <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> and Glucogitorosid. Our results showed that they constitute high cytotoxicity effect against liver cancer cell lines. In addition they cause G 2 /M cell cycle arrest and thereby induce apoptosis. For the synthetic molecules, we first tested a set of molecules that are synthesized as derivatives of kinase inhibitors. There are some commercial drugs such as imatinib or erlotinib that are used frequently for cancer treatment. Thus we wanted to investigate if these molecules comprise cytotoxic activities. Our data revealed that especially one of the molecules out of 16 display high cytotoxicity and high kinase inhibitory effect in liver cancer cell lines. The final group of molecules we tested was compoused of thiazolidine ring. In this group of molecules, only one molecule, the one with alkyne terminal precursor, caused cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines.

40|$|In this study, {{a simple}} and {{reliable}} HPLC method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of cardiac glycosides in Digitalis lanata Ehrh. raw material was developed and applied to healthy and phytoplasma-infected plants. The target analytes cover {{a broad range of}} secondary metabolites, including primary, secondary and tertiary glycosides and the corresponding aglycones. The sample preparation was carried out by sonication of the plant material with 70 % (v/v) aqueous methanol at room temperature, followed by reversed-phase solid-phase extraction purification from interfering pigments. The HPLC analyses were performed on a Symmetry C(18) column (75 mm x 4. 6 mm I. D., 3. 5 microm), with a gradient elution composed of water and acetonitrile, at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min. The column temperature was set at 20 degrees C and the photodiode array detector monitored the eluent at 220 nm. The method was validated with respect to ICH guidelines and the validation parameters were found to be highly satisfactory. The application of the method to the analysis of D. lanata leaves indicated that air-drying was the optimum method for raw material processing when compared with freeze-drying.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of digitalis-induced emesis {{has been extensively}} investigated (see Borison and Wang, 1953). Hatcher and Weiss (1922) and Dresbach and Waddell (1926) failed to elicit emesis in cats by topical application of cardiac glycosides {{to the floor of}} the fourth ventricle. On the other hand, it was shown by Dresbach (1947) that digitalis was capable of evoking emesis even after extensive chronic denervation of the abdominal viscera and heart. Borison and Wang (1951) abolished emesis to intravenously administered digitalis in dogs by ablation of the medullary emetic chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). Borison (1952) extended this observa-tion to cats and demonstrated further that oral digitalis was just as effective in causing emesis after gut denervation as before, but that CTZ ablation reduced the incidence of vomiting. Thus, in spite of convincing evidence for a direct ac-tion of digitalis on the CTZ, two features of the emetic process required explanation, namely: 1) the reported failure of topical application to produce vomiting, and 2) the consistent de-lay in emetic response after intravenous ad-ministration. Recent experiments of Share et al. (1964) indicate that, in contrast to the in-effectiveness of local application, intracerebro-ventricular injection of deslanoside in dogs is an effective means of eliciting emesis.

40|$|The {{effect of}} cardiac glycosides on {{auricular}} flutter {{produced by the}} method of Rosenblueth and Garcia Ramos is studied. In the denervated heart these drugs produce {{an increase in the}} effective refractory period, a decrease in conduction velocity and excitability. The flutter is reverted to a sinus rhythm because of the increase in the effective refractory period. In the innervated heart these glycosides can change the auricular flutter to auricular fibrillation. This change is mediated through the vagus since atropine or cutting the vagi promptly reverts the fibrillation to a sinus lhythmii. The change from auricular flutter to fibrillation ws-as never observed in vagotomized dogs. RSOSENBLUETH and Garcia Ramosl-' have developed a method for the pro-duction of a long lasting, self-perpetu-ating type of auricular flutter in anesthetized dogs. Evidence has been presented by these investigators which indicates that this phe-nomenon is due to a circus movement traveling around a central obstacle. '-' The action of cardiac glycosides on the heart has been extensively studied; little is known, however, concerning the action of these drugs in auricular flutter.

40|$|Summary: The {{process of}} {{hemodialysis}} (HD) produces a pro-inflammatory state {{that can lead}} to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. In part, this is the result of activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB in response to uremia as well as in response to HD itself, which not only involves exposure of blood leukocytes to abnormal surfaces but also potentially to any bacterial contamination associated with HD. Previously, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to activate isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as a model of HD-induced stress, and demonstrated that specific natural products that are known to inhibit the activation of NF-kB exhibited a broad anti-inflammatory activity.   These natural products, however, were not effective when whole blood was used. In the present study, a natural product library (TimTec NPL 480) was screened, using whole blood, for the abilities of these natural products to protect against LPS-induced expression and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL- 1 b and IL- 6.   We report here that the cardiac glycosides strophanthidin, ouabain, proscillaridin A, digoxin, digitoxin and <b>lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> are effective natural products that limit the development of a pro-inflammatory state by preventing the activation of these pro-inflammatory signals. These active natural products also inhibited the stress-induced activation of NF-kB in a reporter assay, suggesting that inhibition of NF-kB is at least partly the mechanism by which these natural products protect whole blood leukocytes from activation by LPS. Industrial relevance: Media for hemodialysis is used millions of times annually for patients with end stage renal disease, each use representing a potential pro-inflammatory insult. It would be useful to have a drug that could be added to the media which would protect blood leukocytes from any pro-inflammatory activation that may accompany the dialysis procedure. A natural product, if demonstrated to have low toxicity, could be especially attractive as a drug candidate for this application. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{of different}} cardiac glycosides are altered by renal dysfunction in different ways, {{depending on their}} basic pharmacokinetic properties. Digoxin: The linearity of digoxin pharmacokinetics is unchanged by renal dysfunction, as is the bioavailability. Protein binding may be slightly reduced, but the change is of no clinical significance. The apparent volume of distribution is reduced by one-third to one-half, the change being roughly proportional {{to the degree of}} renal impairment. The significance of this change in terms of adjustment of the loading dose is controversial. The renal clearance of digoxin is reduced in renal dysfunction and becomes very closely related to the measured creatinine clearance at values of creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min. Digitoxin: There are technical problems with the measurement of digitoxin because of the need to separate digitoxin and its metabolites chromatographically before using the measurement techniques commonly applied. Such separation has not always been carried out, and this makes the interpretation of the available data more difficult. The bioavailability of digitoxin is unaffected by renal dysfunction. Protein binding is probably significantly reduced but the clinical significance of this effect is unclear since the apparent volume of distribution and total body clearance of digitoxin appear to be unchanged. In the nephrotic syndrome, which must be considered separately from the other forms of renal dysfunction, there is impaired protein binding but also probably loss of protein bound drug via the renal glomerulus. This leads to a proportionately large increase in total body and renal clearances, a shortening of the half-life and a fall in the steady-state plasma digitoxin concentrations. In other forms of renal dysfunction there is probably no change in half-life or in steady-state plasma digitoxin concentrations. There does seem to be a decrease in digitoxin renal clearance but this may be compensated for by increases in non-renal clearance, both by non-renal excretion of unchanged digitoxin and by metabolic clearance, with increased formation of the active hydroxylated and hydrolysed metabolites, as well of the relatively inactive reduced metabolites. Overall, the changes seem to contribute little of clinical importance. Little digitoxin is removed from the body by dialysis procedures. <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C,</b> deslanoside, and the acylated digoxins: Since these glycosides are largely metabolised to digotxin, one would expect changes in their pharmacokinetics similar to those of digoxin. However, there is only enough information to conclude that this is probably so in the case of β-methyldigoxin. The protein binding of β-methyldigoxin is reduced, as is its apparent volume of distribution, and total body clearance. The reduction in total body clearance is mostly attributable to a reduction in renal clearance, which falls in parallel with creatinine clearance, although always remaining lower than creatinine clearance. Non-renal clearance falls little or not at all. As a result of these changes the ovarall half-life of β-methyldigoxin is prolonged and the fractional daily loss at steady-state is decreased. Dosages of β-methyldigoxin therefore need to be reduced in renal dysfunction. Little-β-methyldigoxin is removed by haemodialysis. For α-acetyldigoxin, renal clearance is reduced in proportion to renal function, and the half-life is prolonged. Little is removed by haemodialysis. Other glycosides: Little information is available about other cardiac glycosides. What little information there is, however, suggests that, as one would expect, the half-life is prolonged and renal clearance reduced for those glycosides which are mostly eliminated via the urine, while little or no change occurs for those glycosides which are mostly metabolised. Thus, for ouabain (g-strophanthin), and k-strophanthin, the half-life is prolonged and renal excretion decreased, while for proscillaridin, methylproscillaridin, and peruvoside there is no change. None of these glycosides is much affected by haemodialysis. Despite the changes in pharmacokinetics of digoxin compared with digitoxin, there is little to choose between the two drugs for use in patients with renal dysfunction. Arguments in favour of one or other can be marshalled but there is no good evidence that one is preferable to the other...|$|E
40|$|The circulatory {{dynamics}} of experimental myocardial infarction of dogs was analysed {{by means of}} newly improved Prof. Wezler 2 ̆ 7 s method (1949) with special reference {{to the effects of}} various cardio-respiratory stimulants upon the hemodynamics at the e-mergency with due regards to 2 ̆ 2 centralization 2 ̆ 2. 1. Elastic (E 2 ̆ 7) and peripheral resistance (W) were transitorily reduced soon after the ligation of coronary arteries or the cauterization of myocard. However the blood pressure did not usually showed the extreme decrease in its height so far as the augmented output (Vm) was concerned. The tendency to the shock diminished by the use of the anesthesia properly administered, as Revy et al. had emphasized in this sort of experiments. 2. The intravenous injection of Epinephrine arose markedly but temporarily the blood pressure level in the state on the verge of shock immediately after the experimental infarction. This elevation of the blood pressure is due to the increase in Vm, W, and E 2 ̆ 7. With this extent of the dosage, there could be often found the tendency to the respiratory inhibition. In Ecg, depending upon the severity of the experimental infarction, arrythmias developed by the administration of the Epinephrine more frequently than those in the undamaged hearts. 3. The effect of the elevation of the blood pressure was proved less potent in Neosynephrine than in Epinephrine, but its duration longer in the former than in the latter. The respiratory inhibition of Neosynephrine was found inferior to that of Epinephrine. The effect of Neosynephrine varied more largely according to the time point of the application soon after the experimental infarction than that of Epinephrine. 4. Suprif en showed the elevation of the blood pressure in the type of E 2 ̆ 7 +W at this emergency without so marked respiratory inhibition. 5. Vasopressin showed at first the decrease in the blood pressure in the type of 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungskollaps 2 ̆ 2, and thereafter resulted the arterial hypertension in the type of W+E 2 ̆ 7. From the viewpoint of the cardiac efficiency, Vasopressin can not be regarded as the favourable drug for the treatment of the shock-like state of the experimental infarction, moreover, the large amount of Vasopressin appears to constrict the coronary vessels. 6. Pronestyl did not anyhow improve the peripheral circulatory dynamics itself. But the considerable benefit can be proved for the remedy of arrythmias or of tachycardia due to the experimental infarction. 7. So-called cardiac hormone (Cardinon 2 ̆ 2 Teizo 2 ̆ 2) showed usually the transitory hypotension in the type of 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungskollaps 2 ̆ 2. Therefore when there exists the danger of the circulatory collapse, much notice may be paid for its use with due consideration of the peripheral circulatory state, despite of some coronary dilatatoric action in perfused preparates. 8. Carnigen 2 ̆ 2 Hoechst 2 ̆ 2 consists of two different components, so that the mode of its action varies according to the dosage and the circulatory state at the application. 9. Lacarnol 2 ̆ 2 Hoechst 2 ̆ 2 showed the slight and transitory hypotension in the type of 2 ̆ 2 Entspannungskollaps 2 ̆ 2. The recovery of the blood pressure back to the initial level can be instantly seen by the augmentation of Vm. As to the respiratory state affected with Lacarnol, the trifling and merely temporary hyperventilation appeared immediately after the intravenous injection and then there could be found occasionally the small degree of the bradycardia which may be no obstacle for the clinical praxis even soon later the initiation of the attack. 10. The intravenous injection of Aminophylline decreased in the amount of Vm, W and E 2 ̆ 7 and resulted, as a rule, transitorily the arterial hypotension. However Aminophylline has the respiratory stimulating action, therefore the inhibition of respiration does not occur in spite of reduction of blood pressure level. 11. There could be hardly observed any intended effect of π-oxo-Campher upon the cardio-vascular and respiratory state immediately after the experimental infarction. 12. Strophosid 2 ̆ 2 Sandoz 2 ̆ 2 elevated slightly the blood pressure at this emergency without any significant increase in Vm (Our catheter team had already reported by means of Bing 2 ̆ 7 s method that Strophosid rather reduces the oxygen consumption despite of the moderate increase in the coronary blood flow). The amplitude of the ventilation was occasionally augmented a little, presumably due to its secondary effect. <b>Lanatoside</b> <b>C</b> given intravenously did not show any benefitable effect upon the peripheral circulation immediately after the experimental infarction. Digoxin used intravenously in the state on the verge of shock reduced Vm, W and E 2 ̆ 7 and showed also no favourable effect upon the respiration. 13. The intravenous injection of Coramin-Adenosin 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2 lowered transitorily the blood pressure range, this effect was counteracted with Neosynephrine administered simultaneously. Coramin-Adenosin enhanced the respiration as well as Theraptique. In Ecg, immediately after the injection of Coramin-Adenosin, there appeared the tachycardia in Ecg, which inhibited the bradycardia due to Neosynephrine applied at the same time. The experimental findings of Coramin-Adenosin above mentioned can be almost observed as well as in clininal praxis. 14. Hypertensive action of Theraptique exceeded often that of Neosynephrine, however the former was of shorter duration than the latter. Theraptique augmented firstly W, than Vm., and showed the remarkable respiratory stimulation which differs from the effect of Epinephrine used in considerable dosage. Various kinds of experiments were made in order to analyse the action mode, of Theraptique from which it may be concluded to be of the central origin {{as well as of the}} peripheral...|$|E
