50|$|In India's drylands, <b>ley</b> <b>farming</b> {{is used as}} a way {{to restore}} soil fertility. It {{involves}} rotations of grasses and food grains in a specific area. It is now being promoted even more to encourage organic farming, especially in the drylands. <b>Ley</b> <b>farming</b> acts as insurance against crop failures by frequent droughts. Structurally related physical properties and biological processes of soil often change when different cropping systems, tillage, or management practices are used. Soil fertility can be increased and maintained by enhancing the natural soil biological processes. Farming provides balanced nutrition for sustainable production through continuous turnover of organic matter in the soil.|$|E

According to estimates by Henryk Łowmiański, as cited by Jan Maria Piskorski, this reduced {{the area of}} cultivated land needed to feed a family from 35 to 100 ha (lay farming) to 4 to 8 ha (three-field system); furthermore the growth of both warm- and cool-season grain increased {{the likelihood of a}} good harvest.|$|E
50|$|Farmers in {{the region}} of Waasland (in present-day {{northern}} Belgium) pioneered a four-field rotation in the early 16th century, and the British agriculturist Charles Townshend (1674-1738) popularised this system in the 18th century. The sequence of four crops (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), included a fodder crop and a grazing crop, allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The four-field crop rotation became a key development in the British Agricultural Revolution. The rotation between arable and ley is sometimes called <b>ley</b> <b>farming.</b>|$|E
50|$|Farming Systems in India are {{strategically}} utilised, {{according to}} the locations where they are most suitable. The farming systems that significantly contribute to the of India are subsistence farming, organic farming, and industrial farming. Regions throughout India differ in types of farming they use; some are based on horticulture, <b>ley</b> <b>farming,</b> agroforestry, and many more. Due to India's geographical location, certain parts experience different climates, thus affecting each region's agricultural productivity differently. India is very dependent on its monsoon cycle for large crop yields. India's agriculture has an extensive background which goes back to at least 10 thousand years. Currently the country holds the second position in agricultural production in the world. In 2007, agriculture and other industries made up more than 16% of India's GDP. Despite the steady decline in agriculture's contribution to the country's GDP, agriculture is the biggest industry {{in the country and}} {{plays a key role in}} the socioeconomic growth of the country. India is the second biggest producer of wheat, rice, cotton, sugarcane, silk, groundnuts, and dozens more. It is also the second biggest harvester of vegetables and fruit, representing 8.6% and 10.9% of overall production, respectively. The major fruits produced by India are mangoes, papayas, sapota, and bananas. India also has the biggest number of livestock in the world, holding 281 million. In 2008, the country housed the second largest number of cattle in the world with 175 million.|$|E

50|$|His longest service however was as {{director}} of a plant breeding station in Aberystwyth, a post he held from 1919 to 1942. This {{had been set up}} using a £10,000 grant from Sir Laurence Philipps, who contributed a further £1000 for the first ten years of the institute's existence. Stapledon came to love the natural beauty of Wales and indeed argued that anybody who interfered with the 'shapely outline' of the Cambrian Mountains should be treated as a criminal. Following an ecological approach he developed a number of new varieties of grass, oats and clover, known as 'S' strains, and increased awareness of the importance of grasslands in agriculture, particularly in New Zealand where his work was especially influential. He had visited the country in 1926 during a bout of ill health and whilst there made a strong impression on Bruce Levy who followed much of Stapledon's work. His work was recognised in 1939 when he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and knighted. His work on grasslands continued during the Second World War when he took up the directorship of the grassland research station at Drayton, Stratford upon Avon in 1942, whilst he was also a founder member and first President of the British Grassland Society. Around this time he became a strong advocate of <b>ley</b> <b>farming,</b> feeling that it would help to feed Britain during the conflict. He also persuaded the government to set up a grassland research station at Hurley, Berkshire before his retirement in 1946.|$|E

The {{boundary}} that developed, known as the Landsker Line, follows the January isotherm (contour line) of 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Below this line the milder winters promote the growth of winter crops. This means that farmers can grow new grass earlier in the year than other parts of the county. It also means that early new potatoes can become an important cash crop, subject to competition from earlier crops of potatoes imported from the Mediterranean and elsewhere.The main crops are early potatoes, winter brassicas and root vegetables with the harvesting period being between end of October and mid-May. South Pembrokeshire is [...] "known for wonderful root vegetables" [...] which until recently [...] "gained minimal culinary recognition", although dishes such as creamed swede have become fashionable and have helped change perceptions of the crop. Other Pembrokeshire crops include cauliflower, asparagus and summer fruit The cauliflower is said to be [...] "perhaps one of the most prized vegetables" [...] and requires a frost free climate when the curd is developing. The mild climate of Pembrokeshire means it is an important supplier of this vegetable to national markets.Central Pembrokeshire, from the River Cleddau estuary to the west coast, grows cereals for cattle", while most coastal farms are laid down to 50% arable and with 40% under short <b>ley</b> <b>farming,</b> with 10% permanent pasture close to the farm.

40|$|A second {{generation}} of annual pasture legumes and their root-nodule bacteria has been released to agriculture in Mediterranean-type environments. These new species emanate from selection activity focussed upon ‘alternative legumes’. In 1992, in response to changing constraints upon production, a program was initiated which sought species with different ideotypic traits to the traditional annual medics and clovers used in agriculture in southern Australia. Traits sought in the new species were deeper root systems, improved persistence from higher hardseed levels, acid tolerant symbioses, tolerance to pests and diseases and ease of harvesting with conventional cereal harvesters. Several cultivars of species new to Australian agriculture such as biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus), French serradella (Ornithopus sativus), gland clover (Trifolium glanduliferum) and improved varieties of arrowleaf clover (Trifolium vesiculosum) and yellow serradella (Ornithopus compressus) were developed and have had rapid adoption and impact in southern Australian ley- and phase-farming systems.

Five agropastoral treatments (maize monoculture MMO, maize soybean rotation MRT, maize soybean green manure rotation MGM, native savanna control NSC and maize-agropastoral rotation MAP) under two tillage systems (no till-NT and minimum tillage-MT) were investigated. The effects of NT and MT on SOM and P fractions as well as maize grain yield under the five agropastoral treatments were evaluated. Results showed that soil total C, N and P were generally better under no-till as compared to minimum-tilled soils. While P fractions were also generally higher under no-till treatments, SOM fractions did not show any specific trend. Seven years after establishment of the long-term <b>ley</b> <b>farming</b> experiment (5 years of conventional tillage followed by 2 years alternative tillage systems), MT resulted into moderately higher maize grain yields as compared to NT.

Best-fit varieties of red clover will be identified with help of a biadditive model based on variety tests all over Finland. Whether resistance of pathogens is affected by possible changes in pathogen strains in clover-grass canopies of different age, will be studied with molecular biological methods. Means of biological control of the pathogens will also be studied. The second study aims at 1) finding out the extent of variation in {{the quality and quantity of}} the yield and extent of biolocical fixation of red clover-grass swards, 2) finding out the soil properties affecting the variation and how these parameters could be controlled, 3) developing mehtods to estimate the clover content of the <b>ley</b> on <b>farm</b> and laboratory.

However, previous studies question if a constant efficiency is appropriate, in particular when evaluating carbon (C) cycling across temperatures and various substrates. In the present study, we evaluated the relation between substrate use efficiency, microbial community composition and substrate complexity in contrasting long-term management regimes (47 - 49 years of either arable, <b>ley</b> <b>farming,</b> grassland, or forest systems). Microbial community composition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis and three indices of substrate use efficiencies were considered: (i) thermodynamic efficiency, (ii) calorespirometric ratio, and (iii) metabolic quotient. Three substrates, d-glucose, l-alanine, or glycogen, varying in complexity, were added separately to soils, and heat production as well as C mineralization was determined over a 32 -h incubation period at 12. 5 A degrees C. Microbial communities from forest systems were most efficient in utilizing substrates, supporting our hypothesis that maturing ecosystems become more efficient. These changes in efficiency were linked to microbial community composition with fungi and Gram-negative bacteria being important biomarkers. Despite our initial hypothesis, complex substrate such as glycogen was utilized most efficiently. Our findings emphasize that differences in land use management systems {{as well as the}} composition of soil organic matter need to be considered when modelling C dynamics in soils.

40|$|Experiments {{measuring}} {{seed bank}} size, hardseededness, and seed softening of biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus L.) were conducted at Merredin and Perth in Western Australia. At Merredin, {{a mixture of}} 2 biserrula accessions was grazed, shallow cultivated, or left uncultivated and ungrazed. Seed bank size, seedling regeneration, and seed softening were measured over 2 years. At Perth, softening of biserrula, yellow serradella, and subterranean clover seeds grown at 2 sites (Binnu and Northam) was compared on the soil surface and after burial at 2 and 10 cm {{over a period of}} 2 years. Seed bank size of biserrula at Merredin ranged from 14 000 to 17 500 seeds/m 2. Regeneration was greater in the second year (800 - 1 700 seedlings/m 2) than in the first year (40 - 600 seedlings/m 2). In both years the shallow cultivated treatment recorded the highest number of seedlings. About 90 % of biserrula and serradella seed remained hard after 2 years on the soil surface, compared with only about 10 % of subterranean clover. Serradella softened more rapidly when buried 2 cm below the soil surface (8 - 12 % hard) than it did on the soil surface (84 - 92 % hard) (P < 0. 05). In contrast, the softening of subterranean clover decreased with increasing depth. Biserrula was intermediate, although it too softened most rapidly at 2 cm (78 - 95 % hard compared with 82 - 97 % on the surface) (P < 0. 05). Rate of seed softening in all species decreased with increasing depth of burial below 2 cm. Of the 4 accessions of biserrula, an accession from Greece (83 % hard after 2 years exposure) was significantly softer than the other accessions. The results indicate that biserrula is very hardseeded, although there is sufficient variation in hardseededness for the selection of somewhat softer lines. Its pattern of softening suggests that biserrula may be successful in the <b>ley</b> <b>farming</b> system (crop/pasture rotations) of southern Australia...|$|E

This article {{is the first of}} two papers that describe the process of domestication of T. spumosum as a new species to commercial agriculture. This paper describes a broad range of investigations into the ecology, agronomy and rhizobiology of this new species. Through a series of five experiments, we have tested the general hypothesis that T. spumosum accessions demonstrate a range of sought-after agronomic traits and offer an alternative to annual Medicago spp. for <b>ley</b> <b>farming</b> systems in the medium to low rainfall areas of the mixed crop/livestock zone of southern Australia. T. spumosum presents seeds {{at the top of the}} canopy in heads that do not readily shatter, so seed can be harvested using conventional cereal harvesters instead of the specialist suction equipment required for harvest of seed from annual T. subterraneum and Medicago spp. T. spumosum was found to be relatively fecund and had high levels of biomass production in comparison to the other annual legumes that were tested. The species also demonstrated high levels of within-season hardseededness (remaining hard in summer and softening in autumn) so seedbanks would be protected from summer rainfall events. In addition, T. spumosum showed high levels of between-season dormancy, which allows the species to carry a seedbank through a cropping phase or series of poor seasons. A herbicide experiment showed that clover species varied in tolerances, with T. spumosum the least sensitive of all of the legumes tested to Flumetsulam. A cross-inoculation experiment to measure symbiotic effectiveness revealed that WSM 1325 (current clover strain) surpasses WSM 409 (previous strain) in its relationship with the annual clovers of contemporary interest, while being highly effective at nitrogen fixation with T. spumosum.

It was stated that KRAV fertilizers were less efficient than conventional mineral ones. A better accuracy {{and control of the}} access of soil N, P and K was asked for. A comparison between conventional and organic dairy production at the Ojebyn farm in north Sweden indicated that organic dairy can work if you are allowed to supply mineral food to the stock in order to compensate for the removal of P and other nutrients by milk and meat. The K-balance (added K minus removed K) was more negative in the organic treatments than in the convential ones. Soil weathering {{played an important role in}} clay soils to compensate for the K removal. The P-balance tended to be slightly negative both in conventional and organic systems and a small leaching of P was recognized in both systems. After fertilization for many years soil fertility and microbial enzyme activity was larger in organic treatments of a frame experiment. At last aspects on experimental difficulties and pitfalls you will meet when performing comparisons between organic and conventional farming were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Herbage {{production}} and utilization on Irish dairy farms is well below its potential. A {{number of factors}} influence herbage {{production and}} utilization, not least the level of annual reseeding (introduction of a new grass <b>ley)</b> on the <b>farm.</b> The potential farm performance is reduced by old permanent pasture due to the combined effects of reduced out-of-season herbage production and lower overall herbage yield when compared to perennial ryegrass. Based on the sales of grass seed, {{it is estimated that}} approximately 2 % of the land area on dairy farms in Ireland is reseeded annually. This has created a situation where the overall percentage of perennial ryegrass in sward is low. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the economic benefits of reseeding through simulating the consequences of reseeding different proportions of the farm on an annual basis. Four levels of an annual reseeding programme were evaluated: 1 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 % of the farm reseeded annually; evaluated at three milk prices (20 c/L, 27 c/L and 33 c/L). Increasing the level of reseeding resulted in an increase in total and seasonal herbage production and, when accompanied by an increased stocking rate, increased herbage utilization. At a milk price of 27 c/L, farm profitability was € 20 764, € 24 794, € 30 073 and € 33 515 on a 40 ha farm when 1 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 %, respectively, of the farm was reseeded annually. Irrespective of milk price, increasing the level of reseeding had a positive effect on profitability and the highest gain was achieved at the highest milk price. Sensitivity analysis showed that sward persistency and, to a lesser extent, herbage utilization had significant effects on the benefit from reseeding. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Biogas {{solutions}} {{can contribute}} to more renewable and local energy systems, and also involve other essential aspects such as nutrient recycling. From a theoretical feedstock perspective {{there is a great}} biogas potential in Sweden, but the development has been relatively slow as many biogas producers face challenges of different types. Among the many influencing factors, the choice of feedstocks (biomass) is of strategic importance. Within the Biogas Research Center (BRC), hosted by Linköping University in Sweden, a research project focused on feedstock has been ongoing for several years. It has involved researchers, biogas and biofertilizer producers, agricultural organizations and others. The main aim has been to develop a method to assess the suitability of feedstock for biogas and biofertilizer production, and to apply this method on a few selected feedstocks. A multi-criteria method has been developed that covers potential, feasibility and resource efficiency, operationalized via 17 indicators directed towards cost efficiency, technological feasibility, energy and environmental performance, accessibility, competition, policy and other issues. Thus the method it is relatively comprehensive, yet hopefully simple enough to be used by practitioners. The main ambition, applying the method, has been to collect and structure relevant information to facilitate strategic overviews, communication and informed decision making. This is relevant for development within the biogas and biofertilizer industry, for policymakers, to define and prioritize among essential research projects, etc. This report presents some essential parts of this project, focusing on the multi-criteria method and results regarding <b>ley</b> crops, straw, <b>farmed</b> blue mussels and food waste (and stickleback to some extent). It clarifies how the method can be applied and highlights barriers, drivers and opportunities for each feedstock. Comparisons are also made. The results indicate that biogas production from food waste and ley crops is the most straightforward, and for straw and farmed blue mussels there are more obstacles to overcome. For all of them, the dynamic and very uncertain policy landscape is a barrier. In the final chapter, some conclusions about the method and its application are drawn...|$|R
