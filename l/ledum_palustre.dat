50|$|Oeneis jutta, the Jutta Arctic or Baltic grayling, is {{a species}} of {{butterfly}} in the subfamily Satyrinae with a Circumboreal distribution.

Larvae feed on Carex and Eriophorum, possibly also Glyceria, Molinia, and Juncus. <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre</b> is the preferred nectar plant of the adult butterflies.

50|$|The larvae feed on Myrica gale and <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre.</b> They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow {{corridor}} with a central frass line, that runs along the leaf margin towards the tip. From there a blotch is made. Small leaves may be mined out completely. They make a few slits {{in the side of}} the blotch away from the tip, through which most of the frass is ejected. Finally the larvae leave the mine, to make new blotches in one or two more leaves. Pupation takes place outside of the mine in a cocoon that hangs freely.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre,</b> Ledum groenlandicum and Chamaedaphne calyculata. They {{create a}} {{strongly}} curved lobe case.

When feeding and larval growth are resumed in early spring, the larvae enlarge their cases by adding a series of rings of leaf epidermis with pieces sticking out on all sides. They make underside mines that are easily detected as large brown blotches visible from the upper surface of the leaves. The larvae mature in late April and early May feeding on the previous year's foliage. The adults emerge in early to mid-May and are possibly diurnal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre</b> is an {{important}} perfume plant in northeast China, and widely distributed at Changbai mountain of Jilin province. The components and contents of essential oils in <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre</b> were highly correlated with their growth environment. By using GC-MS, about 32 compounds were identified from <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre</b> essential oils of Changbai mountain. The chemical components were L-bornyl acetate (20. 2 %), 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetramethyl-benzene (16. 5 %), (−) -myrtenal (4. 4 %), terpinen- 4 -ol (4. 3 %), 2, 6 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadiene (3. 8 %), trans-pinocarveol (3. 7 %), L(-) -borneol (3. 0 %), geranyl acetate (2. 8 %), (+) -aromandendrene (2. 3 %), ledol (1. 7 %), sabenene (1. 6 %), β-pinene (1. 4 %), camphene (1. 1 %), caryophyllene oxide (1. 1 %), and citronellyl formate (0. 5 %), which indicate the application of <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre</b> essential oils from Changbai mountain should be different from other areas.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Ocimum sanctum Linn on uric acid levels in 200 humans was {{observed}} in this study. Three times oral administration of Ocimum sanctum Linn (test medicine) to the 100 patients (60 males and 40 females), and <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre</b> Linn (reference remedy) to 100 patients was given. For analysis of uric acid in blood samples the enzymatic method was selected due to its accuracy and reproducibility. The value of reduction in serum uric acid by Ocimum sanctum Linn (OSL) in males was 2. 6 ± 0. 3 and reduction in serum uric acid (SUA) by <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre</b> Linn (LPL) in males was 4. 3 ± 0. 3. On the other hand, the value of reduction in SUA by OSL in females was 2. 5 ± 0. 3 and reduction in serum uric acid by LPL in females was 4. 6 ± 0. 4. It can be concluded that LPL has better results in the reducing SUA levels than OSL in both males and females. DOI: [URL]...|$|E

The study site was not a closed canopy, but was sunny with occasional shading by mature trees (P. glauca, Populus balsamifera). Vegetation was composed of evergreen (Juniperus communis, V. vitis-idaea, Rhododendron groenlandicum (formerly known as <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre</b> ssp. groenlandicum), Empetrum nigrum) and deciduous (V. uliginosum) shrub species, and a thick (more than 20  cm deep) layer of mosses.|$|E

LP extract at doses of 2. 5, 5. 0 and 10. 0 g/kg BW had no genotoxicity in mice and could inhibit cyclophosphamide (CP), a well known anti-tumor drug, induced genotoxicity in mice. LP extract at concentrations of 0. 05 g/mL, 0. 005 g/mL, and 0. 0005 g/ mL had scavenging activity on O 2 -·in a dose-related way.

40|$|To {{understand}} the relationship between resource limitation and essential oil production of the widely-distributed boreal/arctic shrub, <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre</b> ssp decumbens, I documented naturally occurring variation of essential oils over a growing season withfield collections along a latitudinal transect spanning boreal forest to arctic tundra. Collections from a long-term resource manipulation experiment at a single tundra site served as a means of teasing apart those factors that might be influencing the essential oil production of the species. The essential oil composition varied significantly along thetransect in the number of detectable components, but the relationships among resources and essential oil production were complex. In the manipulation experiment, essential oil components varied greatly among the treatments, with significant differences in the qualitative expression of the specific essential oil components.

40|$|A simple, fast {{method of}} {{high-performance}} liquid chromatography for the determination and quantification of arbutin and hydroquinone in many different raw materials was developed and validated. The optimum conditions for the separation and detection of these two constituents were achieved on a LiChro-CARD 125 - 4 Superspher® 100 RP- 18 column with the water-methanol (gradient elution) mobile phase and recorded at 289 nm. The purities of peaks were verified by PDA analysis of impurities. The results of validation have shown that the HPLC method is stable and accurate for the simultaneous determination of arbutin and hydroquinone in extracts from various plants. The developed method gave a good sensitivity (LOD 1 µg/ml for arbutin and 0. 49 µg/ml for hydroquinone) with linearity R 2  > 0. 9993 (for both).

In total, 87 individuals of 21 plant taxa were investigated in four different vegetation sites {{and the surrounding}} area. Ericaceous plants such as Empetrum nigrum var. japonicum, <b>Ledum</b> <b>palustre</b> var. diversipilosum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea var. minus and Loiseleuria procumbens were the main colonizers at the study sites and dominated under even the most severe conditions of low soil moisture and nutrient content.

They commonly associated together with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi only at sites where Sasa senanensis dominated. Among the ericaceous plants, only Enkianthus campanulatus associated with AM and DSE fungi and had no associations with ERM fungi. Other herbaceous and woody plants associated commonly with AM or erratically with DSE fungi, except for Carex sp. and Polygonum spp. which erratically associated with AM and DSE fungi.

30|$|The near treeline site (63 ° 31 ’ 09 ”N, 150 ° 53 ’ 52 ”W, {{elevation}} 670  m) {{was on a}} south-facing slope in open shrub tundra with occasional, scattered P. glauca saplings (Figure  2 b, c). It {{was lower}} than altitudinal treelines elsewhere in the Alaska Range (up to 1, 550  m, Sveinbjörnsson 2000), possibly because of poorly drained soils underlain by permafrost. Recent climate change, however, has promoted white spruce establishment and growth in this area for the past 50  years (Hamm, 2007). Treeline is defined not only by elevation (Sveinbjörnsson 2000); considering heterogeneity of treeline including topology, interaction with neighboring vegetation and local climate that affect treeline, we followed the broad definition of treeline as Stueve et al. (2011) employed, which made us define this site as “near treeline tundra.” There were very few juvenile P. glauca saplings in this area (Figure  2 b,c). Those that could be measured had an average age between 18 and 19  years (n[*]=[*] 3), based on counting annual extension growth.
