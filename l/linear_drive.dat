This paper presents a novel design approach for decoupled drives which necessitates rather minor cost effective modifications. The guidance are substituted by elements that cover guidance and decoupling function and the sensor can be omitted under certain circumstances. In order to evaluate the approach a drive axis is designed and experimentally investigated.

At {{least one of the}} <b>linear</b> <b>drives</b> comprises two parallel, active material surface areas, between which the passive material surface areas are arranged.

40|$|Developments in microelectronics, {{micromechanics}} and microelectromechanical systems (e. g. micromotors, microsensors) require {{significant improvements}} in manufacturing tools for mass productions. Especially the assembling tools have to become faster and more precise. Many assembly devices use XY stages driven by DC servomotors with ball screws or parallel structures; others use <b>linear</b> <b>drives</b> with traditional ball bearings. Only a few devices use <b>linear</b> <b>drives</b> together with air bearings, but always together with an angular guide for X and Y direction. The novel approach {{presented in this paper}} is based on <b>linear</b> <b>drives</b> together with a planar air bearing. In contrast to other stages, it doesn't need any angular guide. This reduces the moved mass and leads to higher accelerations. It consists of an arrangement of four identical moving-coils attached to a slide, which is suspended by a planar air bearing. This new configuration allows a workspace of 60 x 60 mm² and an acceleration exceeding 10 g 1 with a resolution better than 100 nm.

50|$|Laser-drilled micro nozzle air {{bearings}} {{make use}} of computerized manufacturing and design techniques to optimize performance and efficiency. This technology allows manufacturers more flexibility in manufacturing. In turn this allows a larger design envelope in which to optimize their designs for a given application. In many cases engineers can create air bearings that approach the theoretical limit of performance.Rather than a few large nozzles, air bearings with lots of micro nozzles avoid dynamically disadvantageous dead volumes. Dead volumes refer to all cavities in which air cannot be compressed during decrease of the air gap. These appear as weak gas pressure stimulates vibration. Examples of the benefits are: <b>linear</b> <b>drives</b> with accelerations of more than 1,000 m/s² (100 g), or impact drives with even more than 100,000 m/s² (10,000 g) due to high damping in combination with dynamic stiffness; sub-nanometer movements due to lowest noise-induced errors; and seal-free transmission of gas or vacuum for rotary and <b>linear</b> <b>drives</b> via the gap due to guided air supply.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, linear motors {{are widely}} used in machine tools to {{eliminate}} the gear re-lated problems of rotative drives with lead-screw transmission. With linear motors the performance increases considerably since mechanical transmission elements are re-moved. This leads to a better precision, a higher acceleration and a higher speed of the moving part. Therefore, direct <b>drives</b> with <b>linear</b> motors are increasingly used in indus-trial applications although these solutions often need higher investment costs. In industrial processing plants, raw materials are transferred into the production process, typically then they pass several processing stations and finally, the processed article {{is removed from the}} processing chain. In today’s production plants, different equipment is used for transportation and processing materials. Advantages can be ex-pected by using the same system of <b>linear</b> <b>drives</b> for transportation as well as for proc-essing materials. Hence, this dissertation discusses a proposal for process-integrated material handling based on <b>linear</b> <b>drives.</b> The integration of <b>linear</b> <b>drives</b> into the pro-duction plant calls for a new view of the production process. The integrative viewpoint where a co-design of drive and plant is introduced should be developed for future appli-cations. To fulfill the demand of a material handling system, two alternatives are compared. The first one is based on active vehicles and passive tracks and the second one is based in passive vehicles and active tracks. Advantages and disadvantages of both alternatives are discussed, considering aspects of the power supply system as well as control and communication demands. The control of Long Stator PM Linear Synchronous motors with passive, lightweight transportation units is investigated in detail. Hard- and software for an experimental setup is developed for a sectioned Long Stator Linear Motor and used to validate the proposed system. Finite Element tools are applied to introduce information into the con-trol loop about section’s transition and thrust force ripple. Field oriented control, direct flux control and resonant control are supported by the Finite Element information to suppress detent forces and achieve a smooth movement overall the track. A control method for soft transition between separately fed sections of the track without affecting the dynamic are implemented. Experimental results validate the proposed system and it opens a new application area for the <b>linear</b> <b>drives</b> in future...|$|R
50|$|Details of {{the gear}} differ principally in the {{arrangement}} of the expansion link. In early locomotive practice, the eccentric rod ends were pivoted at the ends of the link while, in marine engines, the eccentric rod pivots were set behind the link slot (or below on a vertical engine). These became known respectively as the 'locomotive link' and the 'launch link'. The launch link superseded the locomotive type as it allows more direct <b>linear</b> <b>drive</b> to the piston rod in full gear and permits a longer valve travel within a given space by reducing the size of eccentric required for a given travel. Launch-type links were pretty well universal for American locomotives right from the 1850s but, in Europe, although occurring as early as 1846, they did not become widespread until around 1900. Larger marine engines generally used the bulkier and more expensive marine double-bar link, which has greater wearing surfaces and which improved valve events by minimising geometric compromises inherent in the launch link.|$|E
