Focusing on an event with two students from a class of 11 -year-olds, {{the aim of the}} paper is to explore schools’ common uses of computer software for registering absence in order to understand how materialities – <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>software</b> – are entangled with the production of school absence. In the paper, the Deleuzio–Guattarian concept of the assemblage is put to work within a feminist relational materialist framework.  This enables an understanding of the complexity of school absence, where materialities of the educational setting are theorized as entangled with social and gendered discursive components...|$|R
40|$|Raising {{the level}} of {{abstraction}} for software engineers to write applications is still an undergoing issue. So, models will most likely become the dominant artifact in <b>the</b> development of <b>software.</b> However, models are nothing without the framing of a methodology, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>software</b> factories methodology, which includes <b>the</b> <b>software</b> product lines approach. In <b>the</b> context of <b>software</b> product lines, modeldriven development imposes the structuring of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> development process around models adequate to {{each one of the}} moments within <b>the</b> <b>software</b> supply chain. <b>The</b> different moments are the different stages that comprise different development teams, as well as the target user of <b>the</b> different <b>software</b> family members.

Some manufacturers additionally equip their TPMs with a serial, two-wire interface making them suitable for embedded systems. Grossmann et al.

In this scenario, <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> embedded device is attested using the TPM before sensitive information is transmitted. The authors also give measurement results for runtime and energy consumption for selected TPM commands. For example, the TPM_Quote operation was measured to take about 800 ms during which a current of 39 mA (@ 3.3 V) is drawn.|$|R

40|$|Tabular {{notation}} is a {{very important}} part of the functional documentation method that is used to produce computer system specifications. Many types of tables are currently used by <b>the</b> <b>Software</b> Engineering Research Group at McMaster University. Generalized decision tables are one of the types. In order to facilitate the use of tabular notation, a variety of tools were built or are being built to simplify tables, convert between table formats, check syntax, automatically generate test oracles, etc. Other types of decision tables are used by industry to write software specifications. Structured decision tables are one of the four types of tables adopted by Ontario Hydro for their safety critical <b>software</b> documentation. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Software</b> Engineering Research Group, they also have tools to conduct syntax checking, software design verification, table completeness checking, table consistency checking, etc. The two sets of tools overlap in some areas but not others.

40|$|Technology underpins business. This {{is evident}} in service sectors <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>software</b> industry, which is global in nature. The {{management}} of technology {{is well known in}} <b>the</b> <b>software</b> industry, where <b>software</b> professionals are <b>the</b> key enabler and knowledge carriers. The performance of the firm depends on the effective management of the technology by its workforce. Indian software industry is well known for its skilled software professionals and their technological knowledge to handle the domestic market and global projects as well. However, the global market share of Indian software industry is less than two percent. With such a dismal market share, can <b>the</b> Indian <b>software</b> industry call itself a global player? In view of this, {{there is a need to}} re-look into the strategies for sustainable and healthy industry. This paper discusses two key issues, people and technology, for enhancing the competitiveness of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> industry of India.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) simulation {{allows one}} to predict the time evolution {{of a system of}} interacting particles. It is widely used in physics, chemistry and biology to address specific questions about the structural properties and dynamical mechanisms of model systems. MD earned a great success in genome research, as it proved to be beneficial in sorting pathogenic from neutral genomic mutations. Considering their computational requirements, simulations are commonly performed on HPC computing devices, which are generally expensive and hard to administer. However, variables <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>software</b> tool used for modeling and simulation or the size of the molecule under investigation might make one hardware type or configuration more advantageous than another or even make the commodity hardware definitely suitable for MD studies.

[...] The company that produces MeDoc claimed they had no intentional involvement in the ransomware attack, as their computer offices were also affected, and they are cooperating with law enforcement to track down the origin. Similar attack via MeDoc software was carried out on 18 May 2017 with a ransomware XData. Hundreds of accounting departments were affected in Ukraine.|$|R
40|$|Backdoors {{is a novel}} {{architectural}} {{approach that}} enables remote monitoring and recovery/repair of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>state</b> of a system without using its processors or relying on its OS resources. We have implemented a Backdoors prototype in the FreeBSD kernel using Myrinet NICs for remote access to the target machine. In a previous paper we have shown how Backdoors {{can be used for}} recovery of useful OS and application state from a failed system. In this paper, we describe how a Backdoors architecture can be used to detect and repair damage to the OS state of a computer system. We present two case studies of remote repair of an OS subject to resource depletion (fork bomb and memory hog) {{to the point where it}} cannot perform useful work and local repair is impossible.

Even when hardware security elements are used (e. g. cryptographic accelerators) <b>software</b> is still—in <b>the</b> form of drivers and libraries—critical for secure operations. This chapter introduces the features and foundations of Trusted Computing, an architecture that exploits the low-cost TPM chip {{to measure the}} integrity of a computing platform. This allows the detection of static unauthorized manipulation of binaries (be them OS components or applications) and configuration files, hence quickly detecting software attacks. For this purpose, Trusted Computing provides enhanced security controls, such as sealed keys (that can be accessed only by good applications when the system is in a safe state) and remote attestation (securely demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>state</b> of a platform to a remote network verifier). Besides the theoretical foundation, the chapter also guides the reader towards creation of applications that enhance their security by using the features provided by the underlying PC-class trusted platfor...|$|R
