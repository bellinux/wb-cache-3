500|$|In 2010, Nas {{released}} his tenth studio album Distant Relatives, a collaboration with Damian Marley that reinvigorated the rapper creatively. He soon became distracted by tax problems and an expensive, highly publicized divorce {{from his wife}} Kelis months before their son's birth, events that influenced his direction for <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Good.</b> His songwriting on the album was also influenced by adjusting back to life as a single man. Nas also wanted to write more original subject matter rather than another album [...] "about how you {{came up in the}} hood and how you had to make it out of the hood". Although he did not find his album [...] "quite so much about the marriage or the divorce", Nas likened <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Good</b> to Marvin Gaye's 1978 album Here, My Dear, which was written by Gaye in response to his own deteriorating marriage and released as a financial settlement. For Life Is Goods album cover, a photo was taken of Nas in a polished white suit, sitting in a night club's VIP lounge, appearing forlorn, and holding over his knee Kelis' actual green wedding dress, which he said was the only item she left him. When writing the album, Nas also reflected on aging and maturation, fatherhood, and his 20-year experience in hip hop music.

Writing for MTV News, Rob Markman called the production [...] "a sonic departure" [...] from Nas' previous work, but complimented his lyrics as [...] "vintage" [...] and pointed out {{the consistency of the}} lyrical quality throughout the song. In his review of [...] "The Don" [...] for About.com, Henry Adaso described the song as [...] "the type of lyrical exercise Nas only throws down once or twice per album", and that songs such as [...] "The Don" [...] gave a case for Nas' inclusion [...] "as one of hip-hop's all-time greats", also picking up on his [...] "assured" [...] boasts and the [...] "quiet confidence" [...] enveloped in his tone. Adaso also expressed a positive response towards the song's production, expressing his surprise that having three different producers working on the song had not led to a [...] "case of too many cooks in the kitchen", writing that [...] "instead, we get a cohesive, hard-hitting, face-melting, reggae-tinged beat". A reviewer of the song for DJBooth wrote of Nas' performance as [...] "at turns wistful, threatening and braggadocious", and praised the production's [...] "compulsively head-noddable groove". In their review of <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Good,</b> Sputnikmusic recommended [...] "The Don" [...] to first-time listeners of Nas, stating to be an exhibition of Nas' [...] "incredible lyrical structures" [...] and [...] "how rapidly this guy can punch out the syllables". They also noted it as a [...] "change of pace" [...] from the more downtempo material on <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Good.</b> In his review of <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Good</b> for Prefix Magazine, Charlie Kaplan called [...] "The Don" [...] the album's [...] "clear highlight" [...] and felt it a fitting tribute to Heavy D's life and work, writing that it [...] "raises a glass to the recently departed overweight lover with a vivid tour of New York rap's classic soundscapes".

The moment you hear it — I hear what he's sayin', and I relate." [...] Nas also stated on Twitter that he and Ocean were collaborating on a song from Nas's tenth studio album <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Good,</b> though the {{material}} never made the album.

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} MSN Music, Robert Christgau gave <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Good</b> a three-star honorable mention, citing [...] "Daughters" [...] and [...] "Accident Murderers" [...] as highlights and deeming the record [...] "reflections of a bigshot who, as he mentions several times, is damn big".

[...] New York Times critic Jon Caramanica felt his narratives were [...] "sometimes distractingly fanciful" [...] and his lyrics occasionally [...] "overstuffed", even though the record possessed [...] "a simulacrum of the sound that made him legendary". Matthew Fiander from PopMatters was more critical, finding the production [...] "uneven" [...] and calculated [...] "as product", with [...] "half-done ideas".|$|E
