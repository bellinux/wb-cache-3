500|$|Critics {{have called}} the video NSFW, {{comparing}} it to the 2013 video for [...] "Blurred Lines" [...] by Robin Thicke with Pharrell Williams and T.I.. In an interview with Capital FM, Thicke responded {{to a question about}} the videos' similarity: [...] "No comment. I'll <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> all the talking. It's a subject that has no good ending." [...] Fact magazine called the video's concept simple, and said its production team was unconcerned. According to Spins Jordan Sargent, [...] "Like his new album The 20/20 Experience, in which half the songs run longer than seven minutes, the 'Tunnel Vision' video is self-consciously artistic and mature. But the video is also at times effective, particularly when the editing gets choppier during the bridge." ...|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} {{announcement}} of the Ballroom Blitz Tour in March 2010, the title for the new album was revealed as [...] Later that month, Munky announced that Korn has officially signed to Roadrunner Records. Jonathan Davis later confirmed the record deal: [...] "We're going to go to Roadrunner. [...] real exciting for us, too, because they're one of the last record companies to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> what you want to do." [...] Davis continued, [...] "All the great bands around are on that label and everything seems to just work out right and it seems like a good home for us right now." [...] The lead single, [...] "Oildale", was made available for streaming in May 2010. [...] "Oildale (Leave Me Alone)" [...] was simultaneously released to radio stations, and became a top-ten hit on the Billboard Active rock and Mainstream Rock airplay charts. A music video, directed by Phil Mucci, received an exclusive premiere on MTV2.|$|E

In the steak restaurant, a photo of actor and comedian Tony Randall can be seen next to Barclay's photo. Homer's postcard, which reads [...] "Wish you were her", shows a picture of American model Bettie Page. In the scene where Homer drives Barclay's truck into the convoy, Navitron Autodrive System says [...] "I'm afraid I can't <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this, Red. The risk is unacceptable." [...] The line, {{as well as the}} Navitron Autodrive System's, is {{a reference}} to HAL 9000, the antagonist in the 1968 science fiction film [...] The episode also references media mogul Ted Turner, with a sign that reads [...] "Atlanta: the home of Ted Turner's mood swings". The title of the episode references the infamous 1986 Stephen King movie Maximum Overdrive, which was one of Simpsons cast member Yeardley Smith's first credited screen roles.|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Jennings {{recalled}} the restrictions of the Nashville establishment: [...] "They wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> anything. You had to dress a certain way: {{you had to}} do everything a certain way.... They kept trying to destroy me.... I just went about my business and did things my way.... You start messing with my music, I get mean." [...] By 1972, after the release of Ladies Love Outlaws, his recording contract was nearing an end. Sick with hepatitis, Jennings was hospitalized. Afflicted by disease, and the music industry, he was considering retirement. Albright visited him and convinced him to continue. Albright talked to him about making Neil Reshen his new manager. Meanwhile, Jennings requested a US$25,000 royalty advance from RCA Records to cover his living expenses during his recovery. The same day he met Rashen, RCA sent Jerry Bradley to offer Jennings US$5,000 as a bonus for signing a new 5% royalty deal with RCA, the same terms he had accepted in 1965. After reviewing with Reshen, he rejected the offer and hired Reshen.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, {{recording}} engineer Gordon [...] "Commissioner Gordon" [...] Williams recalled {{the recording of}} [...] "Lost Ones", stating: [...] "It was our first morning in Jamaica and I saw all of these kids gathered around Lauryn, screaming and dancing. Lauryn was {{in the living room}} next to the studio with about fifteen Marley grandchildren around her, the children of Ziggy, and Stephen, and Julian, and she starts singing this rap verse, and all the kids start repeating the last word of each line, chiming in very spontaneously because they were so into the song." [...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself: [...] "It would have been more difficult to articulate to other people. Hey, it's my album. Who can tell my story better than me?" [...] She recalled Ruffhouse Records executive Chris Swartz ensuring her artistic freedom while recording the album: [...] "I had total control of the album. Chris Swartz at Ruffhouse, my label, said, 'Listen, you've never done anything stupid thus far, so let me <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> your thing.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Lucasfilm Games {{began to}} design Labyrinth: The Computer Game in 1985. Company head George Lucas had {{requested}} a tie-in video {{game for the}} movie of the same name, which was under production at Lucasfilm. As was common with Lucasfilm Games projects, Lucas himself provided very little direction to the team. Labyrinth was the first licensed game developed by the company: earlier products, such as Rescue on Fractalus! and The Eidolon, had been original intellectual properties. According to project leader David Fox, working with a license [...] "frees you up in some ways and restricts you, too". With their adaptation, the team was not pressured to reuse events and characters from the Labyrinth film; but they [...] "felt obligated" [...] to follow the source material. Because they saw the film as an adventure story, they chose to set their adaptation in the adventure game genre. However, Fox disliked the genre's then-reliance on text parsers and syntax guessing, and so he created the word wheel menus as a replacement. They were meant to supply [...] "a limited set of words that still <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a lot of things", in order to streamline the game without hampering the player's freedom. The game's visual design was shared by Lucasfilm's Habitat, a massively multiplayer online game under production at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Moonlighting {{frequently}} {{broke the}} fourth wall, with many episodes including dialogue that made direct {{references to the}} scriptwriters, the audience, the network, or the series itself. (For example, when a woman is trying to commit suicide by jumping into a bathtub with a television playing The Three Stooges, Addison says, [...] "The Stooges? Are you nuts? The network'll never <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that, lady!") Variations of this technique had been used previously in television programs such as The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show (a sketch comedy series) and The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (a sitcom which sometimes opened with the main character addressing an interior monologue to the audience).|$|E

2500|$|Thiệu's {{aversion to}} public {{appearances}} {{was attributed to}} a fear of hostility from South Vietnamese who believed that he failed them. He acknowledged his compatriots’ low esteem of his administration in a 1992 interview, but said, [...] "You say that you blame me for the fall of South Vietnam, you criticize me, everything. I <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that. I [...] {{like to see you}} do better than I." [...] Thiệu continually predicted the demise of the Vietnamese Communist Party's grip on power and warned against the United States establishing diplomatic relations with the communist regime. [...] (Relations between the U.S. and the communist regime in Hanoi were formally established in 1995.) Thiệu said that when the communists were deposed and when [...] "democracy is recovered" [...] that he would return to his homeland, but their hold on Vietnam remained unchallenged during his lifetime. He futilely offered to represent the refugee community in reconciliation talks with Hanoi to allow exiles to return home.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2011, the {{president}} and CEO of Diamond Aircraft Canada, Peter Maurer, indicated that his company's future was in doubt and relied on getting the D-Jet to market, as piston sales remained slow {{since the start of}} the Great Recession in 2007. To get the D-Jet into production the company found $20M in private investment, plus the commitment of an additional $35M from the Government of Ontario. The Ontario government investment was contingent on Diamond also securing an additional $35M from the Government of Canada. If both federal and provincial loans were provided then, combined with funds already provided, the total provincial and federal government investment would have been $100M. Maurer indicated [...] "If we don’t get the funding from the federal government, it puts us in a difficult situation. If the D-JET, for example, in a worse case scenario, were not to continue it would have a negative impact on the rest of the company’s operations. [...] at a level that would be very difficult to satisfy out of piston sales,” he said. “I’ll <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> the extrapolation." ...|$|E
2500|$|After pacifying Ji Province, Cao Cao wrote a {{memorial}} to Emperor Xian to recommend him to award Xun You a marquis title to honour him for his contributions. Xun You was thus enfeoffed as the [...] "Marquis of Lingshu Village" [...] (陵樹亭侯). In 207, while assessing his subordinates' contributions and recommending Emperor Xian to give out rewards accordingly, Cao Cao credited Xun Yu and Xun You for developing grand strategic plans for him. Xun You received an additional 400 taxable households in his marquisate, making it 700 households in total. He was also reassigned to serve as Central Military Adviser (中軍師). The Wei Shu recorded that Cao Cao visited Xun You's residence {{when he returned from}} Liucheng (柳城; southwest of present-day Chaoyang, Liaoning) after a campaign. He told Xun You, [...] "Now that the Empire has basically been pacified, it's time for me to share the rewards with virtuous scholar-officials like you. In the past, Emperor Gaozu allowed Zhang Zifang to choose 30,000 taxable households to form his own marquisate.

2500|$|Western RPGs {{have also}} {{received}} criticism in recent years. They remain less popular in Japan, where, until recently, Western games in general {{had a negative}} reputation. In Japan, where {{the vast majority of}} early console role-playing video games originate, Western RPGs remain largely unknown. [...] The developer Motomu Toriyama criticized Western RPGs, stating that they [...] "dump you in a big open world, and <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> whatever you like [...] difficult to tell a compelling story." [...] Hironobu Sakaguchi noted that [...] "users like to categorise" [...] Western RPGs as [...] "a sort of different style, born from first person shooters." [...] In recent years, some have also criticized Western RPGs for becoming less RPG-like, instead with further emphasis on action Christian Nutt of GameSpy states that, in contrast to Japanese RPGs, Western RPGs' greater control over the development and customization of playable characters has {{come at the expense of}} plot and gameplay, resulting in what he felt was generic dialogue, lack of character development within the narrative and weaker battle systems. He also states that Western RPGs tend to focus more on the underlying rules governing the battle system rather than on the experience itself. Tom Battey of Edge Magazine noted that the problems often cited against Japanese RPGs (mentioned above) also often apply to many Western RPGs as well as games outside of the RPG genre. BioWare games have been criticized for [...] "lack of innovation, repetitive structure and lack of real choice." [...] Western RPGs, such as Bethesda games, have also been criticized for lacking in [...] "narrative strength" [...] or [...] "mechanical intricacy" [...] due to the open-ended, sandbox structure of their games.|$|E
