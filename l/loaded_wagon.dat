500|$|After being weighed, a <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon,</b> {{which would}} hold about [...] of coal, was {{pulled from the}} weighbridge, onto a raisable or {{lowerable}} cradle at the hoist to suit the coal chute and a vessel's open hold.|$|E
500|$|A single wagon {{containing}} five tons of ore {{could be}} lowered down {{the plane in}} twelve minutes. Railway-type signals were used to indicate that an ascending wagon had been attached to the rope; the brakesman at the upper level then levered the descending, <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon</b> to the brow of the hill, and the descent and ascent began. The descent was controlled by braking. The WSMR line was leased to the Brendon Hills Iron Ore Company for seven years from 1859, and the latter was to work the line. The lease was extended and transferred to the Ebbw Vale Iron Company on 24 June 1864. In the same year an advertisement {{was placed in the}} Somerset County Gazette announcing that [...] "coal, culm, lime corn, flour, manure, building materials and other goods" [...] would be carried on the railway at reduced rates.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, {{sculptor}} José Belloni's [...] "La Carreta", {{a bronze}} monument on granite base, was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario.

Another statue {{on the same side}} of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} {{traffic was}} china clay downhill to the Cattewater or Laira exchange sidings and stores and coal uphill to Lee Moor. The inclines operated by balancing <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> with empties; at Cann incline five <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> downhill would pull three empties and two <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> up. At Torycombe water tank wagons were kept ready when an unbalanced uphill movement was required.|$|R
5000|$|One {{arrangement}} {{used at the}} Dinorwic Quarry {{was known}} as the [...] "Ballast" [...] method. This involved a two track incline with one track reserved for fully <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> and the second used by partially <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons.</b> The line used by the partially <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> {{was known as the}} [...] "ballast" [...] track and it had a stop placed on it part way down. The distance {{from the top of the}} incline to the stop was the same as the distance that the fully <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> needed to travel. Empty wagons were hauled up the incline, counterbalanced by the descending ballast wagons. These empty wagons were replaced by fully <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> ready to descend. The descending <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> then returned the ballast wagons to the top of the incline. One of the major inclines at Dinorwic had four parallel tracks, two worked by the ballast method and two as conventional gravity balance.|$|R

2500|$|Chuckwagon {{racing is}} a team event, led by a driver who {{commands}} a team of horses pulling the chuckwagon, and is supported by two or four outriders, each racing individual thoroughbred horses that follow the chuckwagon. [...] Each race typically involves three or four teams, and begins with the outriders [...] "breaking camp", by tossing two tent poles (with four outriders only) and a barrel representing a camp stove {{into the back of}} their wagon before mounting their horses and following the wagons as they complete a figure eight around two barrels before circling a race track. [...] The first wagon to cross the finish line typically wins, although various time penalties are handed out for infractions such as a barrel being knocked over, a tent pole or stove not <b>loaded,</b> <b>wagon</b> interference or an outrider crossing the finish line too far behind his wagon driver.|$|E
60|$|Looking up, Mowbray saw Harding {{coming down}} the trail, and the <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon</b> and the fine Clydesdale horses {{standing}} among the trees. The sight angered him. Harding had not been ruined by his rash experiment, as Mowbray had honestly believed would happen. On the contrary, he had prospered, and Mowbray suspected him of a wish to flaunt his success {{in the faces of}} his less fortunate neighbors. It was in a very uncompromising mood that he waited for him to speak.|$|E
60|$|The wooden {{buildings}} rose very slowly, {{though he}} several times urged the jaded horses. They {{had made a}} long haul that day, and the man, who had trudged at their head since early morning, was almost as weary. On the odd days that they had spent in the stable he had toiled arduously on his house and half-finished barn, beginning with the dawn and ceasing at dark. Now he was grimed with dust and dripping with perspiration, and a tantalizing cloud of flies hovered over him. All this was a decided change from driving a few hours daily in a lightly <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon,</b> but what at first had appeared an almost unexplainable liking for the constant effort had grown upon him. He would not have abandoned it now had that course been open to him.|$|E

50|$|Once {{raised up}} the shaft, the coal was yarded or emptied into wagons; each of 1 t capacity. <b>Loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> were run in pairs down a {{self-acting}} inclined plane railway (two <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> going down hauled another two emptied ones up). They were then pushed by hand, assisted by gravity, along a graded wooden trestle. It crossed a sandy area, now occupied by Hunter Street and the Great Northern Railway, to a loading staith at which small ships could berth while coal was tipped into their holds.|$|R
50|$|The engines, {{which became}} nos. 2492 and 2493, arrived early in 1900. Of the 0-8-2T wheel arrangement, they had {{flangeless}} wheels {{on the central}} two axles with only an inch clearance, probably due to difficulty in inserting the changed wheel arrangement into a standard frame design. They had a tractive effort of 25,490 lb. At the end of January 1900 a joint test of the engines with thirty <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons</b> and a 20-ton brake van was undertaken. (The existing limit was 24 <b>loaded</b> <b>wagons.)</b> It was immediately clear that performance was far below that specified.|$|R
60|$|In the stackyard, the summer's splendid monuments {{of wheat}} and grass were reared {{in gold and}} grey. The wheat was {{littered}} brightly round the rising stack. The <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon</b> clanked slowly up the incline, drew near, and rode like a ship at anchor against the scotches, brushing the stack with a crisp, sharp sound. Tom climbed the ladder and stood a moment there against the sky, amid the brightness and fragrance of the gold corn, and waved his arm to his wife who was passing {{in the shadow of}} the building. Then Arthur began to lift the sheaves to the stack, and the two men worked in an exquisite, subtle rhythm, their white sleeves and their dark heads gleaming, moving against the mild sky and the corn. The silence was broken only by the occasional lurch of the body of the wagon, as the teamer stepped to the front, or again to the rear of the load. Occasionally I could catch the blue glitter of the prongs of the forks. Tom, now lifted high above the small wagon load, called to his brother some question about the stack. The sound of his voice was strong and mellow.|$|E
6000|$|Alton smiled dryly. [...] "I left Okanagan and Seaforth {{with enough}} of the boys to hold the claim sitting tight," [...] he said. [...] "Talked to the chiefs in Victoria, and showed them Damer's testimony. They told me that nobody had a patent, and that {{everything}} {{that had been done}} was informal, and because they would probably have to submit the case to Ottawa it would take time for them to come to a decision. And now for Somasco. The new mill's finished, but it has got to live on the local demand, and just now there isn't any. We're half through with the desiccatory, but as it seems the Government will not make us roads, the California people with their cheap transport will beat us easily. I've got thirty men chopping out a new trail one could haul a <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon</b> on, and don't quite know how to pay them. We've raised a piece of the cannery, but for want of dollars don't go on, and, to put it straight, unless that railroad comes in, Somasco will be busted when the loans come due." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{preliminary}} step taken towards {{covering the}} face of the mount with verdure, our mariners went to work to lay out their garden, regularly, within the crater. Mark manifested a good deal of ingenuity in this matter. With occasional exceptions the surface of the plain, or the bottom of the crater, was an even crust of no great thickness, compared of concrete ashes, scoriæ &c., but which might have borne the weight of a <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon.</b> This crust once broken, which it was not very difficult to do by means of pick and crows, the materials beneath were found loose enough for the purposes of agriculture, almost without using the spade. Now, space being abundant, Mark drew lines, in fanciful and winding paths, leaving the crust for his walks, and only breaking into the loose materials beneath, wherever he wished to form a bed. This variety served to amuse him and Betts, and they worked with so much the greater zeal, as their labours produced objects that were agreeable to the eye, and which amused them now, while they promised to benefit them hereafter. As each bed, whether oval, winding or straight, was dug, the loam and sea-weed was mixed up in it, in great abundance, after which it was sown, or planted.|$|E

60|$|When {{this little}} {{apparatus}} worked to my satisfaction I called my wife into my laboratory and {{explained to her}} my invention and its value. She had known that I had been at work with an important object, but I had never told her what it was. I had said that if I succeeded I would tell her all, but if I failed she need not be troubled with the matter at all. Being a very sensible woman, this satisfied her perfectly. Now I explained everything to her--the construction of the machine, and the wonderful uses to which this invention could be applied. I told her that it could diminish, or entirely dissipate, the weight of objects of any kind. A heavily <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon,</b> with two of these instruments fastened to its sides, and each screwed to a proper force, would be so lifted and supported that it would press upon the ground as lightly as an empty cart, and a small horse could draw it with ease. A bale of cotton, {{with one of these}} machines attached, could be handled and carried by a boy. A car, with a number of these machines, could be made to rise {{in the air like a}} balloon. Everything, in fact, that was heavy could be made light; and as a great part of labor, all over the world, is caused by the attraction of gravitation, so this repellent force, wherever applied, would make weight less and work easier. I told her of many, many ways in which the invention might be used, and would have told her of many more if she had not suddenly burst into tears.|$|E
60|$|Then there {{followed}} an interlude of building and well-digging, when we sank down some thirty feet or so, and rammed the shaft sides with nigger-head stones, while occasionally {{some of our}} scattered neighbors rode twenty miles to lend us assistance. Meantime, a tender flush of emerald crept across the crackling sod, and the birches unfolded their tiny leaves until the bluff shimmered with tender verdure silver inlaid, while the jack-rabbits, which had not as yet wholly put off their winter robes of ermine, scurried, piebald and mottled, through its shadows. Then, while the wheat grew taller, and the air warmer every day, the prairie assumed an evanescent beauty which it presently put off again, for the flush faded from the grasses, and only the birch bluff remained for a refuge filled with cool neutral shadow in a sun-parched land. It was now time for the hay cutting, and we drove the rusty mower here and there across the dazzling plain, upon which willow grove and bluff stood {{cut off from the}} levels beneath by glancing vapor, like islands rising out of a shimmering sea. On much of it the grasses grew only to a few inches in length, and we had therefore to seek winter food for our beasts in each dried-up sloo, where they stood sometimes waist-high and even higher. No making was needed; the sun already had done that better than we could, and we merely drove the mower through, after which I went back with the <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon,</b> while Harry rode further out on to the prairie in search of another sloo.|$|E
60|$|I {{occasionally}} {{made use}} of this second machine, but I will give only one instance of its application. Some repairs were needed to the foundation-walls of my barn, and a two-horse wagon, loaded with building-stone, had been brought into my yard and left there. In the evening, when the men had gone away, I took my two machines and fastened them, with strong chains, {{one on each side}} of the <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon.</b> Then, gradually turning the screws, the wagon was so lifted that its weight became very greatly diminished. We had an old donkey which used to belong to Herbert, and which was now occasionally used with a small cart to bring packages from the station. I went into the barn and put the harness on the little fellow, and, bringing him out to the wagon, I attached him to it. In this position he looked very funny with a long pole sticking out in front of him and the great wagon behind him. When all was ready I touched him up; and, to my great delight, he moved off with the two-horse load of stone as easily as if he were drawing his own cart. I led him out into the public road, along which he proceeded without difficulty. He was an opinionated little beast, and sometimes stopped, not liking the peculiar manner in which he was harnessed; but a touch of the switch made him move on, and I soon turned him and brought the wagon back into the yard. This determined the success of my invention in one of its most important uses, and with a satisfied heart I put the donkey into the stable and went into the house.|$|E

60|$|Julia {{was amused}} with his condescension, which she thought augured perfect good-nature and affability. After all, thought Julia, if noble and {{commanding}} qualities {{are necessary to}} excite admiration or to command respect, familiar virtues induce us to love more tenderly, and good temper is absolutely necessary to contribute to our comfort. On the whole, she was rather pleased than otherwise, that Antonio could receive and return what was evidently intended for a witticism, although as yet she did not comprehend it. But Charles did not leave her long in doubt. On {{the north side of}} the Mohawk, and at about fifty miles from its mouth, is a mountain which, as we have already said, juts, in a nearly perpendicular promontory, into the bed of the river; its inclination is sufficient to admit of its receiving the name of a nose. Without the least intention of alluding to our hero, the early settlers had affixed the name of St. Anthony, who appears to have been a kind of Dutch deity in this state, and to have monopolized all the natural noses within her boundaries to himself. The vulgar idiom made the pronunciation an-TONY'S nose--and all this Charles briefly explained to Miss Emmerson and her niece by way of giving point to his own wit. He had hardly made them comprehend the full brilliancy and beauty of his application of the mountain to their driver, when they reached the pass itself. The road was barely sufficient to suffer two carriages to move by each other without touching, being from necessity dug out of the base of the mountain; a precipice of many feet led to the river, which was high and turbulent at the time; there was no railing nor any protection on the side next the water--and in endeavouring to avoid the unprotected side of the road, two wagons had met a short time before, and one of them lost a wheel in the encounter--its owner had gone to a distance for assistance, leaving the vehicle where it had fallen. The horses of Antonio, unaccustomed to such a sight, were with some difficulty driven by the <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon,</b> and when nearly past the object, took a sudden fright at its top, which was flapping in the wind. All the skill and exertions of Antonio to prevent their backing was useless, and carriage and horses would inevitably have gone off the bank together, had not Charles, with admirable presence of mind, opened a door, and springing out, placed a billet of wood, which had been used as a base for a lever in lifting the broken wagon, under one of the wheels. This checked the horses until Antonio had time to rally them, and, by using the whip with energy, bring them into the road again. He certainly showed great dexterity as a coachman. But, unhappily, the movement of Charles had been misunderstood by Julia, and, throwing open the door, with the blindness of fear, she sprang from the carriage also: it was on the side next the water, and her first leap was over the bank; the hill was not perpendicular, but too steep for Julia to recover her balance--and partly running, and partly falling, the unfortunate girl was plunged into the rapid river. Charles heard the screams of Miss Emmerson, and caught a glimpse of the dress of Julia as she sprang from the carriage. He ran to the bank just in time to see her fall into the water.|$|E

50|$|Early wagonways were {{industrial}} railways for transporting goods—initially bulky {{and heavy}} items, particularly mined stone, ores and coal—from {{one point to}} another, most often to a dockside to be loaded onto ships.

5000|$|In 1805 {{the growing}} village of Roodezand was renamed 'Tulbagh' and a {{landdrost}} was stationed there. Travellers and residents took to referring to Nieuwekloof as 'Tulbagh Kloof', {{and the name}} persisted.

50|$|The {{first true}} {{diesel-powered}} locomotives were not built until after Dr. Diesel's patents expired in 1912, {{but a number}} of successful oil engine locomotives were produced before then. The first of these was built in 1894 by the Priestman Brothers of Hull. This standard gauge locomotive was built using a 12 hp double-acting marine type engine, running at 300 rpm, mounted on a 4-wheel wagon chassis. It was only able to haul one <b>loaded</b> <b>wagon</b> at a time, due to its low power output, and was not a great success.|$|E
