5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough <b>literature</b> <b>search,</b> she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E
25|$|In its risk {{assessment}} of methyl iodide, the U.S. EPA conducted an exhaustive scientific and medical <b>literature</b> <b>search</b> {{over the past}} 100 years for reported cases of human poisonings attributable to the compound. Citing the EPA as its source, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation concluded, “Over the past century, only 11 incidents of iodomethane poisoning {{have been reported in}} the published literature.” (Hermouet, C. et al. 1996 & Appel, G.B. et al. 1975) “An updated <b>literature</b> <b>search</b> on May 30, 2007 for iodomethane poisoning produced only one additional case report.” (Schwartz MD, et al. 2005). All but one were industrial—not agricultural—accidents, and the remaining case of poisoning was an apparent suicide. Methyl iodide is routinely and regularly used in industrial processes as well as in most university and college chemistry departments for study and learning related to a variety of organic chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, SfN {{announced}} the Neuroscience Database Gateway (NDG) {{as a universal}} resource for neuroscientists through which almost any neuroscience databases and tools may be reached. The NDG was established with funding from NIDA, NINDS and NIMH. The Neuroscience Database Gateway has transitioned to a new enhanced platform, the Neuroscience Information Framework.

The NIF builds upon {{the foundation of the}} NDG, but provides a unique set of tools tailored especially for neuroscientists: a more expansive catalog, the ability to search multiple databases directly from the NIF home page, a custom web index of neuroscience resources, and a neuroscience-focused <b>literature</b> <b>search</b> function.|$|E
40|$|This project {{seeks to}} develop an {{innovative}} training course to provide <b>literature</b> <b>searching</b> skills to students within the Faculty of Health and Social Care. Students need to access information to complete coursework, undertake research and, once qualified, to identify best practice {{within the context of}} evidence based practice. Although students may have experience of using IT and web technologies, they are rarely taught information skills. This can result in information being found by chance, the possibility of missing important information, and frustration in using technology that should make information retrieval easier. With appropriate training, students can efficiently conduct thorough and systematic <b>literature</b> <b>searches</b> essential for robust and quality work. This project has two objectives. Objective One: To develop one session of theoretical and two sessions of web based practical <b>literature</b> <b>searching</b> skills training. Objective Two: To evaluate the sessions to determine their usefulness and effectiveness in improving <b>literature</b> <b>searching</b> skills. The first student intake for the MRes in Health and Social Work begins in February 2001.

25|$|In {{the year}} 1975, {{timoprazole}} {{was found to}} inhibit acid secretion irrespective of stimulus, extracellular or intracellular. Studies on timoprazole revealed enlargement of the thyroid gland due to inhibition of iodine uptake as well as atrophy of the thymus gland. A <b>literature</b> <b>search</b> showed that some substituted mercapto-benzimidazoles {{had no effect on}} iodine uptake and introduction of such substituents into timoprazole resulted in an elimination of the toxic effects, without reducing the antisecretory effect. A derivative of timoprazole, omeprazole, was discovered in 1979, and was the first of a new class of drug that control acid secretion in the stomach, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Addition of 5-methoxy-substitution to the benzimidazole moiety of omeprazole was also made and gave the compound much more stability at neutral pH. In 1980, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application was filed and omeprazole was taken into Phase III human trials in 1982. A new approach for the treatment of acid-related diseases was introduced, and omeprazole was quickly shown to be clinically superior to the histamine H2 receptor antagonists, and was launched in 1988 as Losec in Europe, and in 1990 as Prilosec in the United States. In 1996, Losec became the world's biggest ever selling pharmaceutical, and by 2004 over 800 million patients had been treated with the drug worldwide. During the 1980s, about 40 other companies entered the PPIs area, but few achieved market success: Takeda with lansoprazole, Byk Gulden (now Nycomed) with pantoprazole, and Eisai with rabeprazole, all of which were analogues of omeprazole.|$|E

The following April, Colbung applied to exhume the remains under Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857.

Colbung's solicitors requested waiver of this condition on grounds that the exhumation would be of great personal significance to Yagan's living relatives, and great national importance to Australia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Two {{of the key}} {{steps in}} {{evidence}} based medicine (EBM) are being able to construct a clinical question and effectively <b>search</b> the <b>literature</b> to source relevant information. No evidence currently exists that informs whether such skills should be taught to medical students during their pre-clinical years, or delivered to include both the pre-clinical and clinical years of study. This {{is an important component}} of curriculum design as the level of clinical maturity of students can affect their perception of the importance and uptake of EBM principles in practice. Methods/Design A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to identify the effectiveness of delivering a formal workshop in EBM <b>literature</b> <b>searching</b> skills to third year medical students entering their clinical years of study. The primary outcome of EBM competency in <b>literature</b> <b>searching</b> skills will be evaluated using the Fresno tool.

2500|$|The most {{commonly}} used method to predict clinical probability, the Wells score, is a clinical prediction rule, whose use is complicated by multiple versions being available. In 1995, Philip Steven Wells, initially developed a prediction rule (based on a <b>literature</b> <b>search)</b> to predict the likelihood of PE, based on clinical criteria. The prediction rule was revised in 1998 This prediction rule was further revised when simplified during a validation by Wells et al. in 2000. In the 2000 publication, Wells proposed two different scoring systems using cutoffs of 2 or 4 with the same prediction rule. In 2001, Wells published results using the more conservative cutoff of 2 to create three categories. An additional version, the [...] "modified extended version", using the more recent cutoff of 2 but including findings from Wells's initial studies were proposed. Most recently, a further study reverted to Wells's earlier use of a cutoff of 4 points to create only two categories.|$|E

This study aims {{to evaluate the}} <b>literature</b> <b>searching</b> anxiety in graduate students in practicing EBM. Method The study participants were 48 graduate students who enrolled the EBM course at aMedical Universityin central Taiwan. Student’s t-test, Pearson correlation and multivariate regression, interviewing are {{used to evaluate the}} students’ <b>literature</b> <b>searching</b> anxiety of EBM course. The questionnaire is <b>Literature</b> <b>Searching</b> Anxiety Rating Scale -LSARS. Results The sources of anxiety are uncertainty of database selection, literatures evaluation and selection, technical assistance request, computer programs use, English and EBM education programs were disclosed. The class performance is negatively related to LSARS score, however, the correlation is statistically insignificant with the adjustment of gender, degree program, age category and experience of publication. Conclusion This study helps in understanding the causes and the extent of anxiety in order to work on a better teaching program planning to improve user’s searching skills and the capability of utilization the information; At the same time, provide friendly-user facilities of evidence searching. In short, we need to upgrade the learner’s searching 45 skills and reduce theanxiety.
