5000|$|In the winter, the codfish {{comes to}} the coastal waters to spawn, {{especially}} to the cod fisheries of Lofoten. Mølja, boiled codfish with <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> <b>roe,</b> is a delicacy that today is served in the best restaurants. In the summer, the coalfish, or saithe, bites, and fresh saithe is often served on the beach, boiled in seawater over an open fire, or fried (typically the smaller coalfish). Halibut is traditional Christmas food. Most fish is served plainly poached, only accompanied by boiled potatoes, carrots and possibly fried bacon. A more particular kind of fish is [...] "gammelsei", saithe that has been conserved {{for a year or}} more. Other traditions are lutefisk and boknafisk, the latter made from stockfish, and in Nordland often from herring. Seawolf and rose fish are regarded as good food, the latter often eaten salted and poached, with the brain (krus) highly regarded, sometimes fried with onions. In addition to cod, herring and potatoes were traditional staple foods (except in the most northern area). Salmon has long traditions as food along the rivers, and also trout which are common also in the numerous lakes. In the latest decades consumption has increased in correspondence with increased salmon fish farming; smoked salmon is very popular, often on open sandwiches, alone or together with boiled or scrambled eggs or salad.|$|R

Fresh samples were collected, usually from alive fish. They were minced and stored at below - 15 ° C during the investigation. Niacin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid and vitamin B 12 were determined {{in the different}} organs by microbiological assays.

40|$|The report gives {{a survey}} of the samples (muscle, <b>liver</b> <b>and</b> kidney) of one year old <b>roe</b> <b>and</b> red deer {{investigated}} between 1992 and 1994. A total of 179 animals from the areas Hochharz, Duebener Heide and Ostufer Mueritz was investigated for environmental chemicals (Pb, Cd, Hg, 6 PCB, 21 pesticides). Beside differences in the concentrations of Cd in kidneys <b>and</b> <b>livers</b> of fawns <b>and</b> roebucks dependent on age there are differences in the concentrations of Cd in kidneys <b>and</b> <b>livers</b> between <b>roe</b> deer <b>and</b> red deer. The concentrations of Cd of young red deer are lower wherea young red deer possibly reacts stronger to Pb exposition. There are differences in the concentration of Cd <b>and</b> Pb in <b>livers</b> <b>and</b> kidneys between the areas where the samples had been taken. Partially the concentrations of b-HCH, a-HCH, PCB 138, PCB 153 and PCB 180 in liver exceeded the maximum permissible value. Despite significantly higher concentrations of b-HCH (partially also g- and a-HCH) with roebucks from the Duebener Heide area in 1994 tendentious differences between the areas are hardy noticeable. Tendentious differences between the areas could not be detected {{in the course of the}} three years of investigation. (orig.)

40|$|Technological {{solutions}} regarding automated sorting of food {{according to}} their quality parameters are {{of great interest to}} food industry. In this regard, automated sorting of fish rest raw materials remains as one of the key challenges for the whitefish industry. Currently, the sorting of <b>roe,</b> milt, <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> in whitefish fisheries is done manually. Automated sorting could enable higher profitability, flexibility in production and increase the potential for high value products from <b>roe,</b> milt <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> {{that can be used for}} human consumption. In this study, we investigate and present a solution for classification of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) <b>roe,</b> milt <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> using visible <b>and</b> near-infrared hyperspectral imaging. Recognition <b>and</b> classification of <b>roe,</b> milt <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> from fractions is a prerequisite to enabling automated sorting. Hyperspectral images of cod <b>roe,</b> milt <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> samples were acquired in the 400 – 2500 nm range and specific absorption peaks were characterized. Inter- and intra-variation of the materials were calculated using spectral similarity measure. Classification models operating on one and two optimal spectral bands were developed and compared to the classification model operating on the full VIS/NIR (400 – 1000 nm) range. Classification sensitivity of 70 % and specificity of 94 % for one-band model, and 96 % and 98 % for two-band model (sensitivity and specificity respectively) were achieved. Generated classification maps showed that sufficient discrimination between cod <b>liver,</b> <b>roe</b> <b>and</b> milt can be achieved using two optimal wavelengths. Classification between <b>roe,</b> milt <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> is the first step towards automated sorting...|$|R
