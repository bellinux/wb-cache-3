5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only <b>light</b> <b>at</b> the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. <b>Light</b> <b>at</b> the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996–97 season Sunderland {{relocated}} to the 42,000-seat Stadium of <b>Light</b> <b>at</b> Monkwearmouth, after 99years at Roker Park. The stadium's capacity was later expanded to 49,000seats, {{making it the}} fourth largest club stadium in England. In recognition of the historical importance of the mining industry in the club's main area of support, a Davy Lamp currently stands outside the stadium.|$|E

5|$|Samarium-doped calcium {{fluoride}} crystals {{were used as}} an active medium {{in one of the}} first solid-state lasers designed and constructed by Peter Sorokin (co-inventor of the dye laser) and Mirek Stevenson at IBM research labs in early 1961. This samarium laser emitted pulses of red <b>light</b> <b>at</b> 708.5nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and thus did not find practical applications.|$|E

5|$|Ultraviolet telescopes make {{observations}} at ultraviolet wavelengths, i.e. between approximately 10 and 320 nm. <b>Light</b> <b>at</b> these wavelengths {{is absorbed}} by the Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Objects emitting ultraviolet radiation include the Sun, other stars and galaxies.|$|E

5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were {{stunned by the}} size and ferocity of the offensive. The <b>light</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} tunnel had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|At 18:35, {{although}} Meldrum {{believed they}} {{could at least}} hold where they were, the regiment was ordered by Chetwode to withdraw. At 19:00 horse teams arrived to recover the guns, and at 19:45 they slowly retired back to the suburbs of Gaza. At 21:40 they rejoined the brigade and left the town. The next morning at 08:30 they arrived at Deir El Belah, where the division was now located. Casualties during the battle had again been rather <b>light,</b> <b>at</b> one dead and nineteen wounded. They had captured 197 prisoners, {{as well as the}} guns and field hospital.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected <b>light.</b> <b>At</b> differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E
5|$|India {{followed}} the NZ tour with {{a trip to}} Australia. India lost the Test series 3–0 and the margin of defeat was heavy {{in each of these}} matches – 285 runs, 180 runs, innings and 141 runs. The highlight of the Test series came in the final Test when V. V. S. Laxman scored 167 at a run a ball in fading <b>light</b> <b>at</b> the Sydney Cricket Ground and came for much praise from the media. India's ODI series performance matched the Test series in failure as India managed to win just one match against Pakistan and Kapil had to come out in defense of his team.|$|E
5|$|Ivry {{received}} the green <b>light</b> <b>at</b> 10:00 AM {{to execute the}} operation, but by then he had postponed the attack until 2:00 PM. At 1:30 PM, Eitan ordered Ivry to strike, and the Israeli aircraft took off in pairs. The first wave {{was made up of}} 96 F-15s and F-16s. The second wave which attacked the SAM batteries at 3:50 PM was made up of 92 aircraft. When the attack was launched, the Syrians ordered their combat air patrols to return to base and land.|$|E

5|$|Kalpavrikshas are wish-granting trees which {{fulfill the}} desires of people in initial stages of worldly cycle as per Jain Cosmology. In initial times {{children}} are born in pairs (boy and girl) and don't do any karma.

5|$|Mechanical gun games {{existed before}} the {{emergence}} of electronic video games, {{as far back as}} the 1920s. The first light guns appeared in the 1930s, with the Seeburg Ray-O-Lite. Games using this toy rifle were mechanical and the rifle fired beams of <b>light</b> <b>at</b> targets wired with sensors. These evolved throughout subsequent decades, culminating in games such as Sega's electro-mechanical arcade game Periscope, the company's first successful game, released in 1966. It required the player to target cardboard ships.|$|E
5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} sperm whales. Sperm whales consist {{the largest and}} {{smallest}} odontocetes, and spend {{a large portion of}} their life hunting squid. P. macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require any degree of <b>light</b> <b>at</b> all, in fact, blind sperm whales have been caught in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|E

5|$|SGDs {{have their}} roots in early {{electronic}} communication aids. The first such aid was a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the patient-operated selector mechanism (POSSUM) prototyped by Reg Maling in the United Kingdom in 1960. POSSUM scanned {{through a set of}} symbols on an illuminated display. Researchers at Delft University in the Netherlands created the lightspot operated typewriter (LOT) in 1970, which made use of small movements of the head to point a small spot of <b>light</b> <b>at</b> a matrix of characters, each equipped with a photoelectric cell. Although it was commercially unsuccessful, the LOT was well received by its users.|$|E

5|$|The Earth {{receives}} 174petawatts (PW) {{of incoming}} solar radiation (insolation) {{at the upper}} atmosphere. Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar <b>light</b> <b>at</b> the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet. Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150–300 watts/m², or 3.5–7.0 kWh/m² per day.|$|E
