30|$|In general, load {{restoration}} {{is composed}} of multi-step load pickups. Single-step load restoration in a substation usually aims to activate one or more circuits at the same time. If the single pick-up is too heavy, {{it will lead to}} lower voltage and even frequency excursion. On the other hand, if the <b>load</b> <b>pick-up</b> is too light it will increase the number of operations and delay the restoration process. To evaluate load restoration amount, the cold <b>load</b> <b>pick-up</b> (CLPU) characteristics should be considered [58]. Ref. [59] uses linearization techniques to construct a generic model for a fast assessment of the dynamic characteristics of system frequency during the period of cold load pickup. The PSO algorithm is applied to determine the optimal load restoration amounts and locations in the case of cold load pickup [60]. Ref. [61] deals with discrete load restoration based the real-time system status measured by the WAMS.|$|E

High-resolution load models are developed by combing Monte CarloMarkov Chain bottom-up demand models, hot water demand models, discrete {{state space representation}} of thermal appliances and composite time-variant electrical load models. Price based demand response is then modeled through control algorithms for thermostatically controlled loads, optimal scheduling of wet appliances and price elasticity matrices for representing the inherent elastic response of the consumer. The developed model is used in a case study to examine the potential distribution network impacts of the introduction of dynamic pricing schemes. The effects of cold <b>load</b> <b>pick-up,</b> rebound peaks, decrease in electrical and demand diversity and impacts on loading and voltage are presented...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a multi vehicle {{version of the}} Time-Dependent Prize-Collecting Arc Routing Problem (TD-MPARP). It is inspired by a situation where a transport manager has to choose between a number of full truck <b>load</b> <b>pick-ups</b> and deliveries to be performed by a fleet of vehicles. Real-life traffic situations where the travel times change with {{the time of day}} are taken into account. Two metaheuristic algorithms, one based on Variable Neighborhood Search and one based on Tabu Search, are proposed and tested for a set of benchmark problems, generated from real road networks and travel time information. Both algorithms are capable of finding good solutions, though the Tabu Search approach generally shows better performance for large instances whereas the VNS is superior for small instances. We discuss the structural differences of the implementation of the algorithms which explain these results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{describes}} a methodology for determination of system reserve requirement during power system restoration. Types of reserves are defined and their amount {{is determined to}} improve frequency control process. Reserve requirements are calculated from characteristic of different power plants basic principles, {{taking into account the}} largest unit dispatch and the frequency sensitivity of loads. It is shown that effectiveness of reserves is one of the important problems during <b>load</b> <b>pick-up.</b> Aim {{of this paper is to}} propose a novel method for investigation of reserves capability in different power plants which can be used for evaluating the stability and frequency response of power plants during load pickup in the early stages of power system restoration. The proposed scheme for reserves calculation provides good performance for load pickup.

40|$|The load {{behaviour}} of {{the industrial}} and residential sector following different types of outages is dealt with in this dissertation. Data on the power consumption after these outages {{have been used for}} deriving models of the cold <b>load</b> <b>pick-up.</b> In the industrial sector the investigation covers a variety of branches and special attention has been given to plants having a high degree of electric energy consumption. Data of the power consumption after planned and forced outages have been collected and descriptions over typical restarting procedures and common restoration problems have been summarized. Due {{to the fact that the}} production can not start immediately after voltage is restored, the power consumption from the industrial sector will be lower after an outage as compared with the pre disturbance condition. The time it takes to enter a normal production again varies considerably and may take minutes or up to days fo...|$|E

40|$|The {{transfer}} lines from GSI´s heavy ion synchrotron (SIS) {{to the experimental}} set ups are equipped with segmented capacitive pick-ups for beam position mea-surement. This beam position measurement will be designed for single-bunch evaluation. Best choice for taking measurements with maximum sensitivity is a high-impedance tap at the pick-up referring to the bunch length of 50 [...] . 500 ns. Therefore the feeding of 50 Ω coaxial cables will be realized by an impedance-matching transformer located close to the pick-up. It should have an impedance> 10 kΩ on the primary side and 50 Ω matching on the secondary side with a fore-seen bandwidth of 200 MHz.

40|$|Within the {{real-time}} unconstrained (market) schedule sequence, {{the energy}} ramping capability of all dispatchable facilities {{is assumed to}} be 12 times higher than the actual ramping ability. This means that the market schedules for these facilities and the uniform market clearing price for Ontario are set using ramp capability equal to what can be achieved in 60 minutes, rather than 5 minutes. Background This feature was implemented via a change to an adjustable input parameter of the dispatch algorithm in April 2002, just prior to market launch. Market Rules appendix 7. 5 section 4. 13. 1 was changed by an urgent market rule amendment to authorize this feature. The need for this was based on results during the last phase of market testing in April of 2002, where there was extreme real-time price volatility during periods of large change in market demand – e. g. morning <b>load</b> <b>pick-up,</b> hour-to-hour changes in intertie transactions. Also observed were significant differences between the pre-dispatch prices and real-time prices. This price volatility resulted from a lack of ramp depth of scheduled lower price...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: During service restoration, {{the power}} level at buses can {{significantly}} {{differ from the}} one presented under steady-state conditions, demanding an amount of electric power {{significantly higher than the}} normal load. Hence, their post-outage behavior must be adequately forecasted in order to permit the development of reliable restoration plans, or to avoid inadequate actions that may lead to a subsequent shutdown of the electric power system. This problem is known in the literature as cold <b>load</b> <b>pick-up</b> and the thermostatically controlled loads can be pointed as the main responsible for this behavior. Approach: This study proposes a methodology to model the thermostatically controlled load behavior during the reenergization process, based on object oriented programming and the physical modeling of individual loads, avoiding the explicitly modeling of the electric distribution feeder. In this context, the load aggregation is also implemented using “feeder” classes in an hierarchical structure. Results: The methodology was tested considering distinct devices distributed along a hypothetical feeder and the results show the impacts of interruption duration and environmental temperature in the load behavior. Conclusion: The Cold-load phenomena can be successfully simulated based on physical parameters of thermostatically controlled loads using object-oriented programming, yielding satisfactory results.

40|$|While {{texturing}} of workpiece surfaces {{to promote}} lubrication in metal forming {{has been applied}} for several decades, tool surface texturing is rather new. In the present paper, tool texturing is studied as a method to prevent galling. A strip reduction test was conducted with tools provided with shallow, longitudinal pockets oriented perpendicular to the sliding direction. The pockets had small angles to the workpiece surface and {{the distance between them}} were varied. The experiments reveal that the distance between pockets should be larger than the pocket width, thereby creating a topography similar to flat table mountains to avoid mechanical interlocking in the valleys; otherwise, an increase in drawing <b>load</b> and <b>pick-up</b> on the tools are observed. The textured tool surface lowers friction and improves lubrication performance, provided that the distance between pockets is 2 – 4 times larger than the pocket width. Larger drawing speed facilitates escape of the entrapped lubricant in the pockets. Testing with low-to-medium viscosity oils leads to a low sheet roughness on the plateaus, but also local workpiece material pick-up on the tool plateaus. Large lubricant viscosity results in higher sheet plateau roughness, but also prevents pick-up and galling...|$|R
40|$|Anticipatory {{control of}} motor output enables fast and fluent {{execution}} of movement. This applies also to motor tasks {{in which the}} performance of movement brings about a disturbance to balance that is not completely predictable. For example, in bi-manual lifting the pick-up of a load causes a forward shift of the centre of mass with consequent disturbance of posture. Anticipatory postural adjustments are scaled to the expected magnitude of the perturbation and are initiated well before the availability of sensory information characterising the full nature of the postural disturbance. However, when the postural disturbance unexpectedly changes, the anticipatory adjustment of joint torques is not equilibrated and {{may result in a}} disturbance to balance. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that apart from anticipatory postural adjustments, corrective responses after <b>load</b> <b>pick-up</b> are used to further compensate the postural disturbance. In this study it was examined whether the central nervous system (CNS) assembles a strategy that incorporates both anticipatory control and corrective responses, in which the magnitude of the anticipatory postural adjustments depends on the perceived level of predictability of the postural disturbance. Subjects performed series of lifts in which the magnitude of the load was never revealed to the subject. Two boxes equal in size and colour, but different in mass (6 and 16 kg), were used. Differences in expectation were created by several lifts with the 16 -kg load before the 6 -kg box was presented. It was observed that the number of strong corrective responses (stepping) varied with the number of 16 -kg trials that formed the prior experience when the final 6 -kg trial was presented. The follow-up question was whether control relied more on anticipation in the stepping trials, compared with trials in which such gross signs of imbalance were absent. In this study it was shown that subjects when stepping (i) exhibited differential anticipatory postural adjustments in comparison with 6 -kg trials in which expectation was not shaped by preceding 16 -kg trials, and (ii) scaled the anticipatory postural adjustments similar to those preceding lift-off of the 16 -kg trial preceding it. These findings emphasise the programmed nature of the anticipatory postural adjustments and the ability of the CNS to selectively tune the anticipatory postural adjustments to stored information gained during the previous lift(s) ...|$|E

Multiple pick-up locations with partial <b>pick-up</b> <b>loads</b> and allowing shortages or back ordering can be included in the case study. The treatment of uncertainty should be further explored. Furthermore, multi-objective approaches can also be addressed as an extension of the present study.|$|R
