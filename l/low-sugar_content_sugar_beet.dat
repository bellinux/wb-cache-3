40|$|The United States {{produces}} about 1. 8 {{million tons}} of sugar annually. Approximately 75 per cent of this production is derived from <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> The importance of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> crop in national and world economy is justification for research effort {{as a means to}} more economical production. It is desirable that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> processing be carried out in the most efficient manner. More effective utilization of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> and its by-products will add stability to the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry. For the past 170 years, since Achard found that sugar could be used for human consumption and that pulp might be fed to cattle, sugar processors have made limited use of the non-sugar constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet.</b> These materials have been disposed of almost exclusively as livestock ration supplements. The non-sugar constituents have been largely responsible for failure to extract all of the <b>sugar</b> from the <b>beet</b> (13). As a result they have been viewed with suspicion by most <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> processors. However, recent development suggest that the utilization of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> by-products will constitute a more important phase of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry in the future. At this critical period in the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry, it is difficult to overemphasize the need for {{a better understanding of the}} chemical constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> and the effects of various physiological factors upon them. One of the non-sugar constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> which has recently received attention is glutamic acid. This has been brought about primarily by the discovery that the salt, monosodium glutamate, has an enhancing effect upon the flavor and palatability of many foods. Using the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> as almost the exclusive source of glutamic acid, a new industry (utilizing over 100 tons of beet molasses daily) has developed to manufacture and market this food seasoner (28). Preliminary investigations at the Utah Experiment Station (14) showed that of all the chemical constituents determined, glutamic acid was the most variable. This agreed with earlier work in this field (16, 42). Being highly variable this constituent is a chief contributor to difficulties in sugar processing. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of some of the major agronomic factors, such as moisture, fertility, variety, and sampling date, upon the glutamic acid <b>content</b> of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet...</b>|$|R

The calculated evaporation from the crop was compared with the potential. The water content in the subsoil changed more slowly than in the topsoil. The cereal crop absorbed more water than the <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> until the middle of the summer, but during late summer and autumn the water content in the soil was lower in the <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> than in the cereal crop.

40|$|Two field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} 1998 and 1999 in the Khorasan Agricultural Research Center at Mashhad with the aim to study the effect of early season drought stress {{on a variety of}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> genotypes. The irrigation of the field was withhold for a period of about 50 days in order to impose a severe drought stress at the 8 to 10 leaf stage of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> crop. The drought stress was evaluated by changes in chlorophyll fluorescence, measured in the fully expanded leaves of three beet genotypes in 1998 and nine genotypes in 1999, both in stressed and non-stressed plants. The results showed that in the 1998 experiment, both maximal (F m) and variable (F v) fluorescence were reduced during the growth period, but the reduction was greater under drought conditions than under non-stress conditions. The quantum yield of photochemistry in Photosystem II (F v /F m) remained unaffected under non-stress conditions, but reduced under drought stress. In the 1999 experiment, initial fluorescence (F o) was not affected by drought stress, whereas chlorophyll content of stressed plant was greater than that of non-stressed. Thus, drought stress had no destructive effect on the initial fluorescence, presumably due to increase in chlorophyll <b>content</b> of stressed <b>sugar</b> <b>beet.</b> Under stress conditions, F v, F m and F v /F m were reduced for all genotypes, but the reduction rates varied between genotypes. The genotype 7219. P 129 showed the highest reduction of F v, F m and F v /F m under drought stress conditions, that suggests the highest sensitive to drought stress. In all genotypes, F v /F m recovered 16 days after stress relief, although, their reactions were different. Strong correlation (R 2 = 0. 75) between the white sugar yield and F v /F m has been found, suggesting that chlorophyll fluorescence {{can be used as a}} tool for screening <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> genotypes for early season drought stress...|$|R

40|$|Studies of root {{yield and}} quality of 38 <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> hybrids were carried out {{depending}} on digging time on two locations, in Topolje and Seleš. Two trials were done in Topolje, one with application of fungicides that preserved <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> leaves in vegetation period, another, with recorded heavy damage (no fungicide applied) on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> leaves by C. beticola Sacc. disease. Trial with fungicides provided protection was conducted in Seleš. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> digging {{in the first period}} was done on 13 thand 14 thSeptember, and 34 days later in the second period (18 thand 19 thOctober). Weather conditions between the terms of digging were characterized by shortage in precipitation when compared to the multiyear average, which influenced autumn growth and technological maturation of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> root. Prolonged vegetation period for 34 days in the second term of digging in the trial with leaves preserved (fungicide application) for two locations on the average resulted in root yield increase by 9. 75 t/ha i. e. 11. 34 %, <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> by 0. 79 % and pure sugar yield by 2. 17 t/ha. Consequently, {{in the second half of}} September and the first half of October root yield was daily increased by 278 kg/ha, <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> by 0. 02 % and pure sugar yield by 63. 8 kg/ha. The trial with leaves damaged (no fungicide application) had daily root growth of 217 kg/ha i. e. 7. 39 t/ha in 34 days. However, <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> was not increased, but lowered by 0. 08 %. In addition, the rate of soluble non-sugars (K, Na, AmN) was increased which made values of sugar in molasses higher giving rise to the decrease in sugar utility. In this trial with 34 days prolonged vegetation period, sugar yield was increased by 0. 94 t/ha (8. 47 %), daily only 27. 6 kg/ha. Considerable differences in yield were also determined between these hybrids. Therefore, recommendation, and intention for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> digging as later as possible, can be justified only with health and preserved <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> leaves, selecting adequate hybrids...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{production}} values of 10 <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> hybrids was conducted on chernozem soil type in Eastern Croatia (Tovarniklocation). The used treatments with and without fungicides application were investigated in 2013 and 2014. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> hybrids {{used in the study}} originate from three market-leading <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> seed companies in Croatia, whose varieties provide disease tolerance to C. beticola. The years of the study were quite warm with higher mean monthly air temperature (°C) and increased amount of rainfall, as compared to the long-term mean. In the second year of the study, due to increased amount of rainfall (mm) in July and August, as well as the total loss ofstrobilurin efficiency and low effectiveness ofthe cyproconazole treatment, the destruction ofthe leaves by C. beticola Sacc. was significantly higher. The results of the study showed a huge coherence of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> yield and quality with leaf conservation through the vegetation (the number of treatment), and with the hybrids. Due to leaves destruction on control treatments, as compared to fungicide application three times, the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> root yield was reduced on the average by 9. 79 t ha' 1 (10. 03 %), <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> by 0. 69 % (rel. 4. 89 %) and sugar yield by 2. 041 ha 1 (17. 04 %).
