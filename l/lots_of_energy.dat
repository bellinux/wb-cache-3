The weather was cold, that damp coldness of some mornings in June which makes you search for a light jacket and freezes your hands; but we were full of ardour, replete with good advice and <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and it was happily that Richard and I on the tandem and our trainer Lambert on a bicycle started our long journey for the record from Paris to Agen.|$|E
500|$|The Hollywood Reporters Sheri Linden {{described}} {{the film as}} feeling like [...] "part three of a past-its-prime franchise", criticizing the plot as moving [...] "lazily from setup to punchline to setup, with no particular point and almost no punch". Roger Ebert awarded the film 2 out of 4 stars, stating that the film [...] "has <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> but not much inspiration". Ebert commented that the comic timing of the lead actors benefits the dialog, but frequent instances of [...] "crude, vulgar and offensive" [...] comedy became unwelcome and unamusing. Rolling Stones Peter Travers awarded the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, stating {{that it should have}} been a [...] "Ghostbusters lite" [...] and [...] "should be crazy, stupid fun but settles for just stupid." [...] He was also critical of the use of Costco in the plot, which he considered product placement. However, he praised Hill's [...] "scene-stealing" [...] performance.|$|E

2500|$|Kournikova {{received}} her first tennis racquet as a New Year gift in 1986 at age 5. Describing her early regimen, she said, [...] "I played two {{times a week}} from age six. It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I {{was going to play}} professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I'd {{spend the rest of the}} day there just having fun with the kids." [...] In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the Spartak Tennis Club, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya. In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world. Kournikova signed a management deal at age ten and went to Bradenton, Florida, to train at Nick Bollettieri's celebrated tennis academy.|$|E
2500|$|In Laser fusion progressed: in 1983, the NOVETTE laser was completed. The {{following}} December 1984, the ten beam NOVA laser was finished. Five years later, NOVA {{would produce}} a maximum of 120 kilojoules of infrared light, during a nanosecond pulse [...] Meanwhile, efforts focused on either fast delivery or beam smoothness. Both tried to deliver the energy uniformly to implode the target. One early {{problem was that the}} light in the infrared wavelength, lost <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> before hitting the fuel. Breakthroughs were made at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester. Rochester scientists used frequency-tripling crystals to transform the infrared laser beams into ultraviolet beams. In 1985, Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou invented a method to amplify lasers pulses by [...] "chirping". This method changes a single wavelength into a full spectrum. The system then amplifies the laser at each wavelength and then reconstitutes the beam into one color. Chirp pulsed amplification became instrumental in building the National Ignition Facility and the Omega EP system. Most research into ICF was towards weapons research, because the implosion is relevant to nuclear weapons.|$|E
2500|$|Work for Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace {{dates back}} to September 2004, when {{frontman}} Dexter Holland said {{that he wanted to}} put out the next Offspring album in 2005 and new songs felt [...] "pretty good". From June to August 2005, the band played the Vans Warped Tour for the first time, and followed that with a tour of Europe and Japan. To coincide with that tour, Sony Music released the first Offspring compilation album, Greatest Hits, which includes their hits from 1994 to 2005. After the Greatest Hits tour ended in the fall of 2005, the band took a break from writing, recording and touring. On February 7, 2006, Holland said in his journal that the band entered a demo studio to work on guitar tracks, and a week later, Holland said in his journal that he went out of town to [...] "meet with a guy who might produce" [...] the album. On June 13, 2006, Holland stated that the band (minus Willard) had been meeting every week and would begin recording shortly. On August 18, he posted another update on the band's journal, saying that they had demoed five songs and were looking to go into the studio soon. He described the new songs as [...] "lots of guitar, energy, <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> and good songs." [...] In September 2006, it was announced that the album would be produced by Bob Rock, who was working with Holland and [...] "helping him sort out songs." ...|$|E

6000|$|This man, whose usual duty {{apparently}} consisted in {{sitting behind}} a little table in an outer room of Consular offices, when ordered to assist {{me in my}} search for Johnson displayed <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and a marvellous amount of local knowledge of a sort. But he did not conceal an immense and sceptical contempt for the whole business. We explored together on that afternoon an infinity of infamous grog shops, gambling dens, opium dens. We walked up narrow lanes where our gharry--a tiny box of a thing on wheels, attached to a jibbing Burmah pony--could by no means have passed. The constable {{seemed to be on}} terms of scornful intimacy with Maltese, with Eurasians, with Chinamen, with Klings, and with the sweepers attached to a temple, with whom he talked at the gate. We interviewed also through a grating in a mud wall closing a blind alley an immensely corpulent Italian, who, the ex-sergeant-major remarked to me perfunctorily, had [...] "killed another man last year." [...] Thereupon he addressed him as [...] "Antonio" [...] and [...] "Old Buck," [...] though that bloated carcase, apparently more than half filling the sort of cell wherein it sat, recalled rather a fat pig in a stye. Familiar and never unbending, the sergeant chucked--absolutely chucked--under the chin a horribly wrinkled and shrivelled old hag propped on a stick, who had volunteered some sort of information: and with the same stolid face he kept up an animated conversation with the groups of swathed brown women, who sat smoking cheroots on the door-steps of a long range of clay hovels. We got out of the gharry and clambered into dwellings airy like packing crates, or descended into places sinister like cellars. We got in, we drove on, we got out again for the sole purpose, as it seemed, of looking behind a heap of rubble. The sun declined; my companion was curt and sardonic in his answers, but it appears we were just missing Johnson all along. At last our conveyance stopped once more with a jerk, and the driver jumping down opened the door.|$|E
