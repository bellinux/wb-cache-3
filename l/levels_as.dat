5|$|Despite new investment, poverty {{remains an}} entrenched problem {{as it does}} in most post-industrial New England cities. Approximately 27.9 percent of the city {{population}} is living below the poverty line. Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income <b>levels,</b> <b>as</b> Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005.|$|E
5|$|Fischer heavily disparaged chess {{as it was}} {{currently}} being played (at the highest <b>levels).</b> <b>As</b> a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was {{to ensure that a}} game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, rather than their abilities to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, an unofficial, high-definition remake was {{announced}} titled Sonic the Hedgehog 2 HD, which included development members {{who would later}} work on Sonic Mania. In 2012, {{it was reported that}} a potential keylogger was included with an alpha build of the game, which led to the project being discontinued due to the controversy. In 2014, the project was restarted under a new development team. The final version is planned to feature additional stages and the option to play <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> Knuckles the Echidna.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, a {{historic}} district {{is a group}} of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within {{a historic}} district are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing.

5|$|Route 139 is {{essentially}} three distinct, but connected highways: the upper level, the lower level, and the Holland Tunnel approach (the Interstate78 concurrency). NJDOT officially charts the lower and upper <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> independent highways, {{with the lower}} level considered Route139 with a notation that the highway then coincides with I-78, and the upper level considered Route139U.|$|E

5|$|The {{respiratory}} system {{is an important}} factor that limits the size of insects. As insects get bigger, this type of oxygen transport gets less efficient and thus the heaviest insect currently weighs less than 100g. However, with increased atmospheric oxygen <b>levels,</b> <b>as</b> happened in the late Paleozoic, larger insects were possible, such as dragonflies with wingspans of more than two feet.|$|E
5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests {{that young people}} were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were hopeful that the changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime <b>levels,</b> <b>as</b> figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of skills and qualifications.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 2012 {{revealed}} that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised {{that the older}} vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — were outdated {{and the cause of}} much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A survey in 2013 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom – Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway – Metrolink had the lowest overall satisfaction rating in the United Kingdom. Respondents were surveyed on value for money, punctuality, seating availability, tram stops and overall satisfaction. Metrolink was below average on all criteria, and 47% believed Metrolink was value for money compared to a national average of 60%.|$|E

5|$|ACS {{refers to}} grade <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> groups, a {{practice}} rooted in progressive education {{that dates back}} at least to the Junior Elementary School. There are three divisions of students: the early school, which includes the early childhood Program (EC) for three-year-olds and junior kindergarten (JK) for four-year-olds; the lower school for kindergarten through group four, and middle school for groups five through eight. Each class in kindergarten through group eight has 32students. Each lower school class is team taught by two teachers. The student-to-teacher ratio in the lower and middle school is 16 to 1, 11 to 1 in kindergarten, 8 to 1 in junior kindergarten, and 7 to 1 in the early childhood program.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Sonic games, Sonic 3 uses rings, {{scattered throughout the}} <b>levels,</b> <b>as</b> a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a life {{and return to the}} most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.|$|E

5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. <b>Levels</b> <b>as</b> low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E
5|$|Each level {{starts with}} the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined. If all of the pigs are {{eliminated}} after the last bird is launched, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed, the level is incomplete and must be repeated. Points are scored for each pig killed {{as well as for}} damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received. Players may re-attempt unlocked <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> many times as they wish in order to complete them successfully or to earn additional points to get more stars.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane <b>levels,</b> <b>as</b> PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
