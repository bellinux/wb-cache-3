50|$|This {{light was}} {{constructed}} in 1827 by John Donahoo to mark {{the entrance to the}} Kedges Strait north of Smith Island. Originally equipped with 10 Argand <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflectors,</b> it received a fifth-order Fresnel lens in 1855.|$|R
50|$|In {{subsequent}} versions, {{beginning with}} the Model 17, the layup was fed into a slot, and continuously exposed as it passed the <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector.</b> The Model 17 and successors were table-top machines, approximately {{the size of a}} typewriter from the same era.|$|R
5000|$|The Electronic Theatre Controls Source Four, {{released}} in 1992, updated the traditional ERS design. The company {{took advantage of}} advances in <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> technology to increase luminous output with less wattage. The Source Four name comes from the improved lamp design utilizing 4 filament elements.|$|R
50|$|The first {{tower at}} this site was {{constructed}} in 1853; though appropriations were made starting in 1848; disputes over land ownership delayed acquisition of the land. This tower was built of brick and was initially equipped with a multiple <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> system; three years later, it was upgraded to a fourth-order Fresnel lens.|$|R
50|$|The {{degree to}} which the lamp may be focused is limited by the length of the housing. To reduce the width of the beam, the <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> are moved further back from the lens (spot focus). However, the farther back in the housing the lamp is placed, the more light is wasted in the housing.|$|R
50|$|The {{masonry work}} {{on which the}} {{lighthouse}} rests was constructed to such a high standard {{that it has not}} been replaced or adapted in 200 years. The <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflectors</b> were replaced in 1843 and used in the lighthouse at Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland, where they are currently on display. The working of the lighthouse has been automated since 1988.|$|R
5000|$|The first commercially {{available}} Thermofax machine was the Model 12. The 'layup' {{of the original}} and the copy paper was placed on a stationary glass platen <b>and</b> an infrared <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> assembly moved beneath the glass, radiating upwards. The layup was held in position by a lid with an inflatable rubber bladder that was latched down by the user.|$|R
25|$|The Electronic Theatre Controls (ETC) Source Four (also known unofficially as Source 4 or S4) is an {{ellipsoidal}} reflector spotlight (ERS) used in stage lighting. First released in 1992, the Source Four {{was invented by}} David Cunningham and features an improved <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> compared to previous ERS designs, tool-free <b>lamp</b> adjustment, <b>and</b> a rotating, interchangeable shutter barrel. The Source Four is widely used by professional theaters across the globe.|$|R
50|$|A light {{station was}} {{established}} {{on the island}} in 1826, displacing a private beacon consisting of a lantern on a post. The tower constructed was of brick, 30 feet tall, and lit with the <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> system typical of the period. The light was intended to indicate to ships the proximity of Burlington's harbor. This tower {{was reported to be}} in disrepair by 1838.|$|R

5000|$|Three Argand <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflectors</b> were fitted, one {{towards the}} Lynch Pool or south channel, one towards Burry Port, and one towards Llanelli. In 1876, the Harbour Master set a fourth lamp to shine west {{along the north}} channel. The Admiralty chart of 1887 shows the [...] "Arc of Visibility" [...] of the lights from {{slightly}} west of south, through north, to slightly south of east.|$|R
50|$|The {{three most}} common types of {{incandescent}} lamps are standard incandescent lamps, tungsten halogen <b>lamps,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> <b>lamps.</b> Standard incandescent lamps have an efficacy of 10-17 lumens per watts and {{a lifetime of}} 750-2500 hours. Tungsten halogen lamps have an efficacy of 12-22 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000-4000 hours. Finally reflector lamps have an efficacy of 12-19 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000-3000 hours.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} candles {{were replaced}} by oil <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflectors</b> from 1810. Further major renovations were carried out in 1841 by engineer Henry Norris, including the filling of {{a hole in the}} rock close to the tower's foundation. The lighthouse remained in use until 1877, when it was discovered that rocks upon which it stood were becoming eroded. Each time a large wave hit, the lighthouse shook from side to side.|$|R
500|$|The Falkner Island Lighthouse was {{commissioned}} by President Thomas Jefferson in 1802. It was constructed and completed by Abisha Woodward in 1802. Woodward also built New London Harbor Light in 1801 and the Black Rock Harbor Light in 1808. Falkner Island Lighthouse cost $5977.62 to build, according to the United States government. The [...] octagonal tower was made of brownstone lined with brick, and it originally had a spiral wooden staircase that led outside to the lantern room. This staircase was an unusual and distinguishing characteristic of the Falkner Island Light. The original fixed light used twelve <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflectors</b> on two stacked tables. It was replaced in 1840, {{at a cost of}} $2842.00, with a lantern that used nine <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> sixteen-inch <b>reflectors.</b> A [...] cast iron spiral staircase was installed in a major renovation in 1871.|$|R
50|$|For {{crossing}} broad valleys, a large {{distance between}} the conductors must be maintained to avoid short-circuits caused by conductor cables colliding during storms. To achieve this, sometimes a separate mast or tower is used for each conductor. For crossing wide rivers and straits with flat coastlines, very tall towers must be built due to {{the necessity of a}} large height clearance for navigation. Such towers and the conductors they carry must be equipped with flight safety <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{light was}} erected {{to help guide}} boats into the Wellfleet, Massachusetts harbor. The first light {{consisted}} of a brick house with a lantern set {{in the center of}} the roof. The usual multiple <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> system of the day was used, though four of the ten lamps were found to shine over land only and were shortly discontinued. Ironically, three wrecks occurred in the light's vicinity within the first fifteen years of its operation.|$|R

Such lamps may burn steadily, blink, or flash, depending on their intended and regulated function. Most must be fitted in pairs—one left and one right—though some vehicles have multiple pairs (such as two left and two right stop lamps) and/or redundant light sources (such as one left and one right stop lamp, each containing two bulbs).|$|R
50|$|The Pass Christian Light, {{along with}} the Cat Island Light, was built by Winslow Lewis, {{constructor}} of many early lighthouses. The tower was originally 28 ft and equipped {{with an array of}} eight <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflectors,</b> first lit in 1831; in 1857 this was replaced with a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The lighthouse and keeper's dwelling sat {{in the center of town}} on the main street on a half-acre (0.2 ha) plot purchased for $250 from Senator Edward Livingston of Louisiana.|$|R

5000|$|In 1826 {{the west}} end of Plum Island was {{purchased}} from Richard Jerome for $90 for the purpose of building a lighthouse.The following year a 35 ft high stone tower had been constructed to support the first light. That first lightconsisted of ten whale oil lamps with reflectors. The light helped navigation near the entrance to Long Island Sound, especially through the [...] "Plum Gut" [...] channel between Orient Point and Plum Island. In 1856 the original <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflectors</b> were replaced by a sixth-order Fresnel lens.|$|R
25|$|Fresnels use a spherical reflector, {{with the}} lamp at the focus point. The <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> remain a fixed unit inside the housing, and are moved {{forward and back}} to focus the light. This is {{accomplished}} using a slider on the bottom or side of the lantern, or using a worm track. At very tight focus, the lanterns are the least efficient, as the least light can escape the housing. Therefore, Fresnels are not good for tight focus on small areas. They are most often used at medium distances from the stage for area lighting.|$|R
50|$|The first lighthouse, a 50 ft brick tower, was {{completed}} in 1839. A storm in 1842 destroyed the keeper's house and badly damaged the lighthouse tower. A 40 ft wooden tower {{was completed}} in 1843 to replace the brick tower. This second tower was destroyed by a hurricane in 1851. A 40 ft brick tower was built in 1851. This is the lighthouse in the photo above. The obsolete <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> system in the light {{was replaced by a}} Forward drop lens in 1856, which was more efficient.|$|R
50|$|The 70 ft {{tower was}} {{completed}} in 1789 {{under the supervision of}} Thomas Smith assisted by his stepson Robert Stevenson. It was to be the first of many island lighthouses for Smith (he had previously worked on the lights at Kinnaird Head and Mull of Kintyre). Its lighting system, although advanced for its time, consisting of a cluster of oil-burning <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflectors</b> was not very effective, often being mistaken for the mast-head of another ship by mariners and was removed in 1809. A new lighthouse was built in 1854.|$|R
25|$|The use of full cutoff {{fixtures}} help {{to reduce}} sky glow by preventing light from escaping above the horizontal. Full cutoff typically reduces {{the visibility of}} the <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> within a luminaire, so the effects of glare are also reduced. Campaigners also commonly argue that full cutoff fixtures are more efficient than other fixtures, since light that would otherwise have escaped into the atmosphere may instead be directed towards the ground. However, full cutoff fixtures may also trap more light in the fixture than other types of luminaires, corresponding to lower luminaire efficiency, suggesting a re-design of some luminaires may be necessary.|$|R
25|$|Many jurisdictions {{require the}} use of a {{headlight}} and a rear light or reflector after dark. Most European countries and some US states require front and rear lights at night, while others allow reflectors only at the rear. Some jurisdictions impose requirements on light output and the size of <b>lamp</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflector</b> lenses; some require compliance with standards defined by third parties; some simply stipulate a minimum distance from which any lighting device should be visible. In some jurisdictions such as Germany and the Netherlands, flashing red tail lights are illegal, in others they are allowed.|$|R
40|$|The <b>lamps</b> <b>and</b> <b>reflectors</b> {{used for}} {{infrared}} radiation simulation tests at ESTEC {{did not allow}} researchers to predict the intensity needed for test conditions with the desired accuracy. This was due to poor reproducibility of the polar diagrams, the unknown contribution of the radiation in the long wavelength range in vacuum, imperfections in the quartz bulbs, and misalignment of the lamp in the reflector. When using a 1000 W coiled spiral quartz lamp with a diffuse reflector, these shortcomings are overcome. Due to the good reproducibility, an overall accuracy within plus or minus 2 percent should be obtained...|$|R
