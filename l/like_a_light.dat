25|$|VTA {{plans to}} add {{distinctive}} vehicles, separate bus-exclusive lanes on Alum Rock Avenue, El Camino Real, and Stevens Creek Road, ticketing platforms separate from other buses, and possible amentities such as wait time for successive BRT buses by 2016 (making BRT behave more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> rail or tram system, instead of bus service). This would also upgrade the existing 522 bus service to official BRT, and rename the entire VTA-operated BRT service to VTA Rapid, differentiating it from VTA's buses division.|$|E
25|$|Bus {{services}} use buses {{on conventional}} roads to carry numerous passengers on shorter journeys. Buses operate with low capacity (compared with trams or trains), and can operate on conventional roads, with relatively inexpensive bus stops to serve passengers. Therefore, buses {{are commonly used}} in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas, and for shuttle services supplementing other means of transit in large cities. Bus rapid transit is an ambiguous term used for buses operating on dedicated right-of-way, much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> rail. Trolleybuses are electric buses that receive power from overhead wires for mobility. Online Electric Vehicles are buses that run on a conventional battery, but are recharged frequently at certain points via underground wires.|$|E

Transportation is also provided by the DASH buses: the [...] "Downtown Area Shuttle." [...] These provide transportation to and from the parking lots in the city of Grand Rapids to various designated loading and unloading spots around the city. The area's Greyhound Bus terminal is integrated into the Central Station of the Rapid, simplifying transfers between Greyhound and local buses. In August 2014, the Silver Line opened, Michigan's first Bus Rapid Transit line, an express bus line designed to function <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> rail system. There are plans in the works to add more express routes, secondary stations, a streetcar and dedicated (exclusive) highway lanes.|$|E
