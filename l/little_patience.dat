25|$|Maury Chaykin is the {{armchair}} detective Nero Wolfe, a reclusive genius with <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> {{for people who}} come {{between him and his}} devotion to food, books and orchids. Timothy Hutton is Wolfe's irreverent assistant Archie Goodwin, whose voice narrates the stories. In addition to starring in the series, Hutton directed four episodes and served as an executive producer.|$|E
25|$|The company {{traveled}} to Italy for filming where Tate's fluent Italian proved useful in {{communicating with the}} local crew members. A perfectionist, Polanski had <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> with the inexperienced Tate, and {{said in an interview}} that one scene had required 70 takes before he was satisfied. In addition to directing, Polanski also played one of the main characters, a guileless young man who is intrigued by Tate's character and begins a romance with her.|$|E
25|$|The plots {{occasionally}} are {{intricate and}} always farcical, involving coincidences, misunderstandings, cross-purposes and meetings both missed and accidental. The innuendo {{of the bedroom}} farce is sometimes present (often to the disgust of the socially conservative Basil) but it is his eccentricity, not his lust, that drives the plots. The events test {{to the breaking point}} what <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> Basil has, sometimes causing him to have a near breakdown {{by the end of the}} episode.|$|E

25|$|In May 1958, {{a second}} {{version of the}} Mark E became available, the Mark E Saloon Coupe. Externally, because the roof was longer than that on the tourer, this gave the {{impression}} that the car was a 2+2, but internally it was the same size, and simply replaced the convertibles soft top with a full-length fibreglass roof. Though not described as a detachable hardtop, the roof could (with a <b>little</b> <b>patience!)</b> be removed in one piece, if desired.|$|E
25|$|Taz is {{generally}} {{portrayed as a}} ferocious, albeit dim-witted, omnivore with a notoriously short temper and <b>little</b> <b>patience.</b> Though he can be very devious, he is also sweet at times. His enormous appetite seems to know no bounds, as he will eat anything in his path. He {{is best known for}} his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls, and rasps (in his earlier appearances, he does speak English with primitive grammar) as well as his ability to spin like a vortex and bite through nearly anything. Taz does have one weakness: he can be calmed by almost any music. While in this calm state, he can be easily dealt with.|$|E
25|$|Fasting, {{which plays}} so {{essential}} {{a part in}} the practices of ascetics, classically found official recognition only {{in the development of the}} Day of Atonement. The Prophets, again, had <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> with fasting. There are some obscure allusions to fast days of popular observance, but the Prophets of exilic and postexilic days insist on the futility of this custom. Isaiah (lviii.), while appealing for a broader charity and deeper sense of justice, maintains that these, and not fasting, are the expression of a will sanctified unto God. It is characteristic of the attitude of later Judaism that this very chapter has been assigned for the Hafṭarah for the Day of Atonement, the one penitential fast-day of the synagogue.|$|E

25|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} family in the summer of 1883, when a {{debilitating}} fever swept through the family. Johnny's half-sister Annie, 13, was the first to succumb; and his mother died shortly thereafter. By the time September 1883 had passed, three more McGraw children had died. The devastated family moved from their house in the country into a hotel in town. Johnny's father, understandably bitter, heaped even more responsibility on the young boy's shoulders, and had very <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> for his son's passion for baseball. He became abusive toward the boy; and later on in 1885 (still only 12 years old), Johnny ran away. From that day onward, young John was raised by a kindly neighbor, Mary Goddard, under whose care he did quite well.|$|E
500|$|Despite his influence, Kennan {{was never}} really {{comfortable}} in government. He always regarded himself as an outsider and had <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> with critics. W.Averell Harriman, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow when Kennan was deputy between 1944 and 1946, remarked that Kennan was [...] "a man who understood Russia but not the United States".|$|E
500|$|Broderick was put {{in charge}} of the Industrial Squad, a plainclothes unit was created in 1917 to monitor the labor movement, to keep it free from {{political}} radicals, Communists and racketeers, and to suppress violence during strikes. Broderick [...] "had <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> with labor militants," [...] according to one history of the NYPD in that era, and he led the Industrial Squad in violent confrontations with the fur workers' union, which was led by Communists, and railroad workers insurgents in 1926 and 1927. Strikes in the city's Garment District also turned violent, and in August 1925 Broderick's nose was broken when he tried to disperse a crowd of striking garment workers.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{confinement}} to {{a psychiatric}} institution had become the most commonly used method of punishing leaders of the political opposition. In the 1960s and 1970s, the trials of dissenters and their referral for [...] "treatment" [...] to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals under MVD control and oversight came out into the open, and the world learned of a wave of [...] "psychiatric terror" [...] which was flatly denied by those in charge of the Serbsky Institute. The bulk of psychiatric repression spans the period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. As CPSU General Secretary, from November 1982 to February 1984, Yury Andropov demonstrated <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> with domestic dissafection and continued the Brezhnev Era policy of confining dissenters in mental hospitals.|$|E
500|$|Virtually {{nothing is}} known about Sviatoslav's {{childhood}} and youth, which he spent reigning in Novgorod. Sviatoslav's father, Igor, was killed by the Drevlians around 945, and his mother, Olga, ruled as regent in Kiev until Sviatoslav reached maturity (ca. 963). Sviatoslav was tutored by a Varangian named Asmud. The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century. Sviatoslav appears to have had <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> for administration. His life was spent with his druzhina (roughly, [...] "company") in permanent warfare against neighboring states. According to the Primary Chronicle, he carried on his expeditions neither wagons nor kettles, and he boiled no meat, rather cutting off small strips of horseflesh, game, or beef to eat after roasting it on the coals. Nor {{did he have a}} tent, rather spreading out a horse-blanket under him and setting his saddle under his head, and all his retinue did likewise.|$|E
500|$|Jardine, {{who retired}} from regular {{first-class}} cricket after the tour, had <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> with his fast bowlers on the tour. On one occasion, {{when they were}} having difficulty in the heat, Jardine said: [...] "Thank God we have one bowler in the side"—referring to Verity. The two men admired each other greatly. Verity {{was impressed with the}} depth of Jardine's thinking on the game and his intelligence, enjoying tactical discussions with him on the voyage to Australia. According to Alan Hill, Verity did not relish the Bodyline tactics on that tour but supported his captain's stance completely. Verity even named his second son Douglas after Jardine. Jardine considered Verity to be the best slow left-arm bowler of all time, writing: [...] "I venture to doubt whether any other bowler of his type has proved such a master on all kinds of wickets... No captain could have a greater asset on his side than Verity. He would make a great captain himself." [...] Historian David Frith writes that Verity was [...] "probably the cricketer [...] admired above all others", while Bob Wyatt believed the two men were very similar in outlook, temperament and desire to succeed.|$|E
50|$|Tableau is a {{solitaire}} that founds its own style, {{which means}} all cards {{are open and}} arranged {{to the left and}} right of the foundations. This is a similar setup like <b>Little</b> Napoleon <b>Patience</b> (solitaire), Beleaguered Castle, Fortress (solitaire), Kings Solitaire (solitaire), or Fürst Bismarck (solitaire). This is a thinking and planning game that starts hard and gets easier the farther one advances.|$|R

500|$|At the time, multi-tracking equipment, though common, {{was less}} elaborate, and {{instrumental}} backing tracks were often recorded [...] "hot" [...] with an ensemble playing {{live in the}} studio. Musicians had to be available [...] "on call" [...] when producers needed a part to fill a last-minute time slot. [...] Los Angeles was then considered the top recording destination in the United States—consequently studios were constantly booked around the clock, and session time was highly sought after and expensive. [...] Songs had to be recorded quickly in the fewest possible takes. [...] In this environment, Los Angeles producers and record executives had <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> for needless expense or wasted time and depended on the service of reliable standby musicians who {{could be counted on}} to record in a variety of styles with minimal practice or takes, and deliver hits on short order. [...] The Wrecking Crew were the [...] "go to" [...] session musicians in Los Angeles during this era. The Wrecking Crew's members were musically versatile but typically had formal backgrounds in jazz or classical music, and were exceptional at sight reading. [...] The talents of this group of [...] "first call" [...] players were used on almost every style of recording, including television theme songs, film scores, advertising jingles and almost every genre of American popular music from the Monkees to Bing Crosby.|$|E
500|$|The {{horse had}} {{nationwide}} appeal, but California Chrome's core fan base was {{centered in the}} Central Valley of California; the Sacramento television market ranked sixth in the nation for television viewership on Preakness day, and third in the nation on Belmont day. Prior to the Belmont, singer–songwriter team Templeton Thompson and Sam Gay wrote and recorded a song titled [...] "Bring it on Home, Chrome" [...] and a rap video featuring an elementary school children was released on YouTube. Even after his Belmont loss, Harris Farms fielded many calls daily from fans wanting to visit the horse while he had a break from racing in June and July 2014. In contrast to his admirers, California Chrome's image was somewhat diminished by the criticism that followed Coburn's post-Belmont comments. [...] Additional negative press occurred when Martin turned down an offer to bring California Chrome to parade in the paddock at Del Mar {{on the day of}} the Pacific Classic. [...] NPR's Frank Deford had <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> with the horse's story exemplifying the American dream; DeFord felt that the horse's victories would have little impact on the popularity of horse racing, which he viewed as [...] "a sport that is struggling against time and culture" [...] due to the prevalence of other types of gambling and the reduced impact of horses in the daily lives of most people.|$|E
500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell {{called it}} the most pivotal episode {{of the season in}} terms of [...] "resolving and resetting narrative stakes", as well as the most complex from a production perspective. Kandell wrote, [...] "There's something that feels particularly satisfying about watching a wholly sympathetic, albeit fictional, character like Leslie Knope do well by her own ambition and by her friends." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker said the episode placed Parks and Recreation [...] "squarely in the tradition of great gentle-hearted sitcoms" [...] that treated its characters [...] "with equal affection, and has relatively <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> for irony and cool detachment". He praised Amy Poehler's performance, and enjoyed how the characters' excitement over Li'l Sebastian demonstrated how [...] "in some parts of this great land, there are people who aren’t jaded, who are open to wonderment, who find vessels in which to pour their joy". HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] may be his favorite episode of the season thus far, and demonstrates how the series has evolved. While in the first season he said Leslie was too over-the-top in a relatively ordinary setting, Sepinwall said this episode showed Parks and Recreation [...] "has successfully made the rest of Pawnee seem as believably crazy as Leslie, if not moreso". TV Squad television reviewer Maureen Ryan called [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] a [...] "delightful, comedically deft episode, one that depicts the mildly demented world of Pawnee in loving detail".|$|E

2500|$|European naturalists studied crickets {{since the}} 18th century. William Gould {{described}} feeding ant nymphs to a captive mole cricket for several months. The European approach to cricket breeding has been popularized by Jean-Henri Fabre. Fabre wrote that breeding [...] "demands no particular preparations. A <b>little</b> <b>patience</b> is enough." [...] According to Fabre, home breeding may start {{as early as}} April or May with the capture {{of a couple of}} field crickets. They are placed in a flower pot with [...] "a layer of beaten earth" [...] inside, and a tightly fitting lid. Fed only with lettuce, Fabre's cricket couple laid five to six hundred eggs, and practically all of them hatched.|$|E
