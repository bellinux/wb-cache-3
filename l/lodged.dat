5000|$|The Grand <b>Lodge</b> Of Nebraska was formed, in 1857, {{when the}} Masters and Wardens of three <b>lodges</b> {{organized}} a Grand <b>Lodge</b> for the then newly established Nebraska Territory.

5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets <b>lodged</b> in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets <b>lodged</b> in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E

On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due {{to at least one}} lead-shot pellet <b>lodged</b> in or near his heart.
