500|$|Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stay at the club, despite interest from Chelsea, who had been acquired by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in the summer. Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand that we <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and you will see that we look good. To write us off just because we haven't spent £100million is a bit easy." ...|$|E

Both Francis and Geary {{were part of the}} supercouple pairing of Luke and Laura on the ABC Daytime soap opera General Hospital. When {{questioned}} by show host Oprah Winfrey if Francis would ever reprise the role of Laura Spencer, she revealed: [...] "I would like her to be funny and {{have a little bit of}} an agenda that might <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> vengeful, but it really isn’t. I think she’d have a plan. If there is a way to go forward with Laura and make her into what I'd like her to be now, then perhaps I would do it. There is nothing in me that is willing to play a victim anymore. I’m sort of done with the wounded dove in my life." ...|$|E

He would develop a brief habit of wearing three [...] neckties at a time, which he understands {{to have been a}} manifestation of his personal insecurity. He also points to a particular image from his childhood that shaped his understanding of the world—" [...] was a dream world, those droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it was supposed to be. But then on the cherry tree would be this pitch oozing out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions and millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree. So you see, there's this beautiful world and you just <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> closer and it's all red ants".|$|E

500|$|Bart's ballet {{teacher was}} voiced by Susan Sarandon, and was {{designed}} to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> like her. Sarandon had wanted to guest star on the show because her children were big fans; she brought them {{with her to the}} recording session. Due to a traffic jam, she was late for the recording session, but once she arrived, she fell into character and worked very hard on getting her accent accurate. Sarandon would later have a cameo appearance as the voice of a computer in the season 17 episode [...] "Bart Has Two Mommies". Mel Brooks has a cameo appearance as himself. His wife Anne Bancroft had {{played a role in the}} episode [...] "Fear of Flying" [...] and Brooks had accompanied her to the recording session. David Mirkin realized that Brooks was [...] "dying to do the show" [...] and asked him if he would be willing to do a guest part, and he agreed. Many of the writers were fans of Brooks, and Matt Groening described the chance to have him guest star as [...] "an incredible honor".|$|E
