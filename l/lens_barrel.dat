5000|$|Some older USM lenses are {{identified}} with a gold ring and the word [...] "Ultrasonic" [...] printed in gold on the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel.</b> L lenses with USM don't have the gold ring, {{but they still have}} the word [...] "Ultrasonic" [...] printed on the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E

50|$|Certain {{third-party}} mechanical adapters {{also provide}} circular control rings that provide some mechanical {{control of the}} aperture of Nikon G, Pentax DA and Canon EF lenses, as these {{do not have a}} mechanical aperture control ring on their <b>lens</b> <b>barrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Waterhouse stop or Waterhouse {{diaphragm}} is an interchangeable diaphragm with an aperture (hole) {{for controlling}} {{the entry of}} light into a camera. A thin piece of metal (the diaphragm) is drilled with a hole (the aperture); a set of these with varying hole sizes makes up a set of Waterhouse stops, corresponding to what today we call f-stops or f-numbers. Photographic lens makers provided slots in <b>lens</b> <b>barrels</b> for the insertion of the chosen stop.|$|R
50|$|In November 2005, ETC {{released}} the Enhanced Definition Lens Tube (EDLT). The EDLT {{is designed to}} produce images from gobos and other focus-critical instrument accessories more clearly and accurately than with the standard <b>lens</b> <b>barrels.</b> The <b>lenses</b> in the tube are coated with an anti-reflective material and are machined to more exact standards than the standard Source Four lens. The EDLT also increases lumen output. It is available in 19, 26, 36 and 50 degree barrels.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the use of}} the E18 error coding {{made this}} problem seem to be the {{particular}} domain of Canon cameras, the problem is actually quite common throughout all cameras with telescopic <b>lens</b> <b>barrels.</b> As a result, Canon has since dropped the use of this error code in its newer cameras. In its place it has adopted the more common term [...] "lens error" [...] that other manufacturers use. As such, its newer cameras report this term when the problem occurs.|$|R

50|$|The 18-105mm {{features}} a minimalist metal exterior reminiscent of Sony's Zeiss lenses. The 18-105mm lens {{features a}} wide digital zoom ring encircling the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel,</b> {{as well as}} a much narrower electronic focusing ring. A two-speed power-zoom rocker {{can be found on the}} side of the lens. There is no zoom lock to prevent zoom creep due to the zoom mechanism being inside the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel</b> itself.|$|E

5000|$|The SeaChanger line by Ocean Thin Films is a {{color mixing}} unit {{intended}} to be installed into the ETC Source Four. The SeaChanger unit completely replaces the shutter assembly of a Source Four fixture, retaining only the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel</b> and lamp assembly. Variations of the SeaChanger line replace (alternately) the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel</b> or lamp assembly with integrated components, essentially creating a whole new fixture.

50|$|The mount {{itself has}} two bayonets, one inside {{the camera and}} another outside. Lenses that use the bayonet inside the camera need have no {{focusing}} helicoid built into the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel.</b> As a consequence, the 5 cm f/1.4 lens that was normally sold with the body is extremely small (about {{the size of a}} golf ball) since the lens contains the optics only. Focusing of such lenses could be done by rotating the toothed wheel on the top front of the camera body or by rotating the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel</b> itself (the distance scale is on the camera body). The external bayonet is used to mount longer and heavier lenses where the built-in helicoid would not be strong enough to rotate the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel.</b> Such lenses are focused using a focusing ring and distance scale on the lens just like typical SLR lenses (the distance scale on the camera body will be covered by the lens flange and thus not visible).|$|E
50|$|The need to {{accommodate}} the shutter mechanism within the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel</b> limited the design of wide-angle lenses {{and it was not}} until the widespread use of focal-plane shutters that extreme wide-angle lenses were developed.|$|E
50|$|The SeaChanger Color Engine is {{designed}} to fit between the reflector assembly and <b>lens</b> <b>barrel</b> of a Source Four ellipsoidal, replacing the gobo slot and accessory slot. It {{is designed}} to be installed without tools.|$|E

50|$|Shutter speeds are B and 1 sec to 1/300s. Depth {{of field}} is {{indicated}} on the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel.</b> The distance scale is in metres. It has no exposure meter. Users on internet newsgroups report the camera scratches their film.|$|E
50|$|Some cameras {{have the}} DOF scale not on <b>lens</b> <b>barrel,</b> but on {{focusing}} knob or dial; for example, the Rolleiflex TLR has its DOF scale on the focusing knob; the subminiature camera Tessina has DOF a scale on the focusing dial.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the side}} of the <b>lens</b> <b>barrel</b> is a trio of {{switches}} controlling the lens' [...] "power zoom", zooming speed, and Autofocus (Servo)-Manual Focus switch. These added features have increased the size and weight of the lens slightly from the original.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Source Four is {{designed}} to accept {{the same types of}} accessories as other lighting instruments, when launched in 1992 the smaller <b>lens</b> and <b>barrel</b> size required accessories that fit in a 6.25" [...] holder rather than the 7.5" [...] that was the standard for Lekos at the time. [...] Many third party manufacturers have designed products specifically for the Source Four.|$|R
