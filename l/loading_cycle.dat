50|$|Unlike purely elastic substances, a {{viscoelastic}} substance has {{an elastic}} component and a viscous component. The viscosity of a viscoelastic substance gives the substance a strain rate dependence on time. Purely elastic materials do not dissipate energy (heat) when a load is applied, then removed.

The computational approach is based on continuum mechanics, where a homogenous and elastic material model isassumed {{in the framework of}} the finite element method analysis.

40|$|The skeleton's osteogenic {{response}} to mechanical loading {{can be affected}} by loading duration and rest insertion during a series of loading events. Prior animal loading {{studies have shown that}} the cortical bone response saturates quickly and short rest insertions between <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> can enhance cortical bone formation. However, it remains unknown how loading duration and short rest insertion affect load-induced osteogenesis in the mouse tibial compressive loading model, and particularly in cancellous bone. To address this issue, we applied cyclic loading (- 9 N peak load; 4 Hz) to the tibiae of three groups of 16 week-old female C 57 BL/ 6 mice for two weeks, with a different number of continuous <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> applied daily to each group (36, 216 and 1200). A fourth group was loaded under 216 daily <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> with a 10 s rest insertion after every fourth cycle. We found that as few as 36 <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> per day were able to induce osteogenic responses in both cancellous and cortical bone. Furthermore, while cortical bone area and thickness continued to increase through 1200 cycles, the incremental increase in the osteogenic response decreased as load number increased, indicating a reduced benefit of the increasing number of <b>load</b> <b>cycles.</b> In the proximal metaphyseal cancellous bone, trabecular thickness increased with load up to 216 cycles. We also found that insertion of a 10 s rest between <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> did not improve the osteogenic response of the cortical or cancellous tissues compared to continuous loading in this model given the age and sex of the mice and the loading parameters used here. These results suggest that relatively few <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> (e. g. 36) are sufficient to induce osteogenic responses in both cortical and cancellous bone in the mouse tibial loading model. Mechanistic studies using the mouse tibial loading model to examine bone formation and skeletal mechanobiology could be accomplished with relatively few <b>load</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} in the fatigue-life analysis of structures is predicting the parameters of the structure loading spectra under real operating conditions. If the loading spectrum is obtained from a load time series using a two-parametric rainflow counting method, then it is possible topresent the distribution of the corresponding <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> in the two-dimensional space of the loading-spectrum parametersČ the amplitude and the mean of the <b>load</b> <b>cycles.</b> It is beneficial for the prediction of the <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> if the distribution of <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> is described by a continuous probability density function. We found in our previous studies that the different shapes of the multi-component probability density functions of <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> can be modelled by a mixture of Gaussian functions if the parameters ofthe mixture are estimated using a maximum-likelihood method. One of the mainproblems connected with such an approach is the estimation of the number of components of the load-cycle distribution.

In this paper, we will describe two methods for estimating the parameters of the mixture of Gaussian functions that almost eliminate the subjective influence of a researcher.

40|$|Results of {{a series}} of back-analyses of the {{interaction}} between longwall shields and strata at a number of mines are presented. The purpose of these back-analyses was to quantify the impact of cover depth and panel width on shield performance. Recently developed shield <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> analysis theories were used to quantify the interaction between shields and strata. A <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> is the change in support pressure with time from the initial setting of the shield against the roof until the subsequent release and movement of the support, which typically corresponds to a single shear. Historical shield pressure data from five longwall mines in Australia and Europe were back-analysed, together with strata delay data for the longwall faces. An assessment of the geology of the near-seam overburden was also made for each site. The longwall panels incorporated cover depths ranging from 50 to 770 m and panel widths ranging between 168 to 319 m. Use was made of {{a modified version of the}} longwall visual analysis (LVA) software that was specifically extended for this project and provided maps of the critical <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> parameters implicit to the utilised analysis methodology. The major extension of the software involved presenting the outputs on the basis of individual <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> for every shield as opposed to a time or chainage basis, thus allowing <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> analysis to be carried out. In total about 6. 5 km of longwall retreat and over 2 000 000 individual <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> were back-analysed.

The numerical approach combines a classical mechanical constitutive model to simulate the static load and the first <b>load</b> <b>cycle</b> and empirical accumulation functions to track the accumulation of deformations during repetitive loading. The hybrid model captures fundamental characteristics of soil behavior under repetitive loading, such as threshold strains, terminal density, and ratcheting response; it also predicts volumetric and shear strains as a function of the static stress obliquity, the number of <b>load</b> <b>cycles,</b> and the plastic strain during the first <b>load</b> <b>cycle.</b> The proposed numerical scheme is used to analyze shallow foundations subjected to repetitive loads.

The La France M16K, {{was basically a}} standard military M16 rifle, chambered for the standard issue 5.56 mm cartridge with an 8 3/8 inch (213 mm) barrel. The standard barrel length is 20 inches (508 mm). Like many automatic and semi-automatic weapons the M16 utilizes pressure from the propellant gases in the barrel to cycle the bolt of the firearm. Most automatic weapons use a mechanical device such as a rod and piston between the bolt and the propellant gases. This {{is not the case}} in the M16 design in which gases are tapped off the barrel near the muzzle and flow though a tube to directly impinge on the bolt to initiate the auto <b>loading</b> <b>cycle.</b> In a standard issue M16, the gas tube is roughly 16 inches (406 mm) long to produce an automatic (cyclic) rate of fire of approximately 650 rounds per minute. Shortening the barrel increases the rate of fire significantly and thereby makes the weapon difficult to control and less reliable. To use a significantly shorter barrel than the standard issue without increasing the rate of fire, La France designed (and subsequently patented) an adjustable gas system that would keep the rate of fire the same as with a full-length barrel.|$|E

The concept has been validated through the back-analysis of more than 500 000 individual <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> in five longwall panels at four mines and seven geotechnical domains.

For existing sites, the load-cycle characteristic concept allows for a diagnosis of strata-support problem areas, enabling changes to be made to set pressure and mining strategies to manage better, or avoid, strata control problems.

Indeed, in the design stage the electric field distributions are determined by the cable geometry and by temperature gradient in the insulation.

Before extrapolating the sample load spectrum, the signal denoising of the field-tested time-history load signals is performed. After that, the sample <b>load</b> <b>cycles</b> are obtained using the rainflow counting method and the corresponding kernel function shape is determined. Then the NSEM of rainflow matrix is proposed, by which the whole-life load spectrum is estimated.

5000|$|The next crucial {{stage is}} load application. This {{issue has been}} widely {{investigated}} {{but there is no}} loading path universally adopted by the testing laboratories. It has to be said that the loading cycles mainly depend on the scope of the test and it is unrealistic to consider the possibility of elaborating a single loading path able to fulfil at the same time all the requirements imposed by the investigation of the initial behaviour, the service behaviour, the behaviour at breaking load and long term behaviour. This part of the procedure should provide a valid approach to the establishment of a load profile, describing the effects of the parameters involved, in order to fully investigate the material response according to the required repeatability.Since coated fabrics do not follow an elastic behaviour, once the stress is removed the sample maintains a certain level of permanent strain, a plastic deformation. This behaviour is known as residual strain and is present both in monoaxial and biaxial tests. The main value of residual strain is shown {{between the first and second}} load cycle, decreasing to zero after a number of cycles that depends on the material properties, the applied load and the time for which it has been applied. This is due to the creep of the yarns and the coating material and to the internal frictional effects. In order to obtain a realistic description of the material the strain should be measured within a unique load cycle, assuming equal to zero the strain at pre-stress. For this reason the <b>loading</b> <b>cycle</b> considered for the strain measure is generally preceded by identical cycles in a number sufficient to stabilise the sample response. In order to remove the residual strain previous researches considered adequate the application of five identical loading and unloading cycles, the TensiNet design guide consider three or five repetitions to be sufficient, depending on the testing protocol. While the Membrane Structures Association of Japan [...] prescribes the repetition of the cycles three times, but only for the 1:1 load ratio which separates the others. This offers several advantages in the comparison of readings carried out within the same test and with other tests.|$|E
