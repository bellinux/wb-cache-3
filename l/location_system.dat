25|$|Amateur {{radio and}} some {{cellular}} or PCS wireless systems use direction finding or triangulation of transmitter signals radiated by the mobile. This {{is sometimes called}} radio direction finding or RDF. The simplest forms of these systems calculate the bearing from two fixed sites to the mobile. This creates a triangle with endpoints at the two fixed points and the mobile. Trigonometry tells you roughly where the mobile transmitter is located. In wireless telephone systems, the phones transmit continually when off-hook, making continual tracking and the collection of many location samples possible. This is one type of <b>location</b> <b>system</b> required by Federal Communications Commission Rules for wireless Enhanced 911.|$|E

A successful weapon strike against the body or chest kills you, whereas a successful strike made against a limb either breaks or severs that limb, rendering it useless.

40|$|Wi-Fi based indoor <b>location</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} shown to be both {{cost-effective}} and accurate, since they can attain meter-level positioning accuracy by using existing Wi-Fi infrastructure in the environment. However, two major technical challenges persist for current Wi-Fi based <b>location</b> <b>systems,</b> instability in positioning accuracy due to changing environmental dynamics, and the need for manual offline calibration during site survey. To address these two challenges, three environmental factors (people, doors, and humidity) that can interfere with radio signals and cause positioning inaccuracy are identified. Then, we have proposed a sensor-assisted adaptation method that employs RFID sensors and environment sensors to adapt the <b>location</b> <b>systems</b> automatically to the changing environmental dynamics. The proposed adaptation method performs online calibration to build multiple contextaware radio maps under various environmental conditions. Experiments were performed on the sensor-assisted adaptation method.
