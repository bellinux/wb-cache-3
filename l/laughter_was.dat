5|$|Though the {{exterior}} shots were always filmed {{on location in}} Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior shots were, until the early 1990s, filmed {{in front of a}} live studio audience at BBC Television Centre in London. The amount of location work increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, Last of the Summer Wine became the first comedy series {{to do away with the}} live studio audience, moving all of the filming to Holmfirth. The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose <b>laughter</b> <b>was</b> recorded and then mixed into each episode's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of canned laughter.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, he {{made his}} third and final {{appearance}} as art dealer James Garrett in My Family. He also {{played the role of}} Mr Weston in the BBC costume drama Emma, which was broadcast in October 2009 on BBC One. He previously played Weston in a two-part adaptation of Emma for BBC Radio 4 in 2000. Between January and April 2010, Bathurst starred as Garry Essendine in a national touring revival of Noël Coward's Present Laughter. He had not seen Present Laughter before, though had seen several Coward plays in his 20s and did not imitate Coward's speech patterns while performing. Present <b>Laughter</b> <b>was</b> the first time Bathurst had appeared in a Coward play and he was cast in another, Blithe Spirit, later in the year. He plays Charles Condomine opposite Alison Steadman and his Cold Feet co-star Hermione Norris. The play toured theatres around southern England in 2010 and early 2011 before beginning a three-month run at the Apollo Theatre in London.|$|E

5000|$|Nervous <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> <b>laughter</b> evoked from an audience's {{expression}} of embarrassment, alarm, discomfort or confusion, rather than amusement. Nervous <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> usually less robust in expression than [...] "a good belly laugh", {{and may be}} combined with confused glances or awkward silence {{on the part of}} others in the audience. Nervous <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> considered analogous to a courtesy laugh, which may be rendered by more of a conscious effort in an attempt to move a situation along more quickly, especially when the comedian <b>is</b> pausing for <b>laughter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{general theory}} that {{explains}} <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> called the relief theory. Sigmund Freud summarized {{it in his}} theory that laughter releases tension and [...] "psychic energy". This theory {{is one of the}} justifications of the beliefs that <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> beneficial for one's health. [...] This theory explains why <b>laughter</b> can <b>be</b> used as a coping mechanism when one is upset, angry or sad.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Laughter</b> <b>is</b> a part {{of human}} {{behavior}} regulated by the brain, helping humans clarify their intentions in social interaction and providing an emotional context to conversations. <b>Laughter</b> <b>is</b> used as a signal for {{being part of a}} group—it signals acceptance and positive interactions with others. <b>Laughter</b> <b>is</b> sometimes seen as contagious, and the laughter of one person can itself provoke laughter from others as a positive feedback. [...] This may account in part for the popularity of laugh tracks in situation comedy television shows.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, drama {{was added}} to the {{standard}} bill of fare at the theatre. Hugh Paddick starred in the Joyce Rayburn farce Out on a Limb at the theatre in 1976, Noël Coward's Present Laughter with Donald Sinden in the lead was revived in 1981 and Patrick Cargill and Moira Lister co-starred in the farce Key for Two in 1982. Noël Coward's Blithe Spirit was revived at the theatre in 1986, and Willy Russell's play Shirley Valentine played in 1988, starring Pauline Collins. In 1990, Simon Gray's play Hidden <b>Laughter</b> <b>was</b> produced at the theatre, followed by Kander and Ebb's 1991 musical, 70, Girls, 70, starring Dora Bryan.|$|E

500|$|The {{reaction}} in Britain to Wodehouse's broadcasts was hostile, {{and he was}} [...] "reviled... as a traitor, collaborator, Nazi propagandist, and a coward", although, Phelps observes, {{many of those who}} decried his actions had not heard the content of the programmes. A front page article in The Daily Mirror stated that Wodehouse [...] "lived luxuriously because Britain laughed with him, but when the <b>laughter</b> <b>was</b> out of his country's heart,... was not ready to share her suffering. He hadn't the guts... even to stick it out in the internment camp." [...] In the House of Commons Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, regretted Wodehouse's actions. Several libraries removed Wodehouse novels from their shelves.|$|E
50|$|Neurophysiology {{indicates}} that <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> {{linked with the}} activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, that produces endorphins.

40|$|Although <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} in human social interaction, {{its role as}} a communicative signal is poorly understood. Because <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> expressed in various emotional contexts, the question arises as to whether different emotions are communicated. In the present study, participants had to appraise 4 types of laughter sounds (joy, tickling, taunting, schadenfreude) either by classifying them according to the underlying emotion or by rating them according to different emotional dimensions. The authors found= that emotions in <b>laughter</b> (a) can <b>be</b> classified into different emotional categories, and (b) can have distinctive profiles on W. Wundt’s (1905) emotional dimensions. This shows that <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> a multifaceted social behavior that can adopt various emotional connotations. The findings support the postulated function of laughter in establishing group structure, whereby <b>laughter</b> <b>is</b> used either to include or to exclude individuals from group coherence.

2500|$|Around {{the time}} of working on {{producing}} Condemned Building Darden began {{to work on a}} new project with a former student of his, James Trewitt, entitled The Laughing Girls from Troy, New York, but was never completed due to Darden's untimely death.

[...] That narrative was driven by laughter, and that laughter would become the process for architecture. The <b>laughter</b> <b>was</b> the laughter of three young girls, who were, in essence, their clients: the fourteen year-old twins, Cass and Polly, and their nineteen-year-old friend, Helen.

This {{turned out to be}} incorrect, and Pellot soon learned that the real source of the <b>laughter</b> <b>was</b> not his race, but his last name: the similar-sounding word plotte is slang for [...] "vagina" [...] in the Quebec French.

[...] He kept the name after getting promoted to the majors in United States, but retained [...] "Pellot" [...] when playing winter ball in Puerto Rico.

2500|$|When Benny {{moved to}} television, audiences {{learned that his}} verbal talent was matched by his {{controlled}} repertory of dead-pan facial expressions and gesture. The program {{was similar to the}} radio show (several of the radio scripts were recycled for television, as was somewhat common with other radio shows that moved to television), but with the addition of visual gags. Lucky Strike was the sponsor. Benny did his opening and closing monologues before a live audience, which he regarded as essential to timing of the material. As in other TV comedy shows, canned <b>laughter</b> <b>was</b> sometimes added to [...] "sweeten" [...] the soundtrack, as when the studio audience missed some close-up comedy because of cameras or microphones in their way. The television viewers learned to live without Mary Livingstone, who was afflicted by a striking case of stage fright. Livingstone appeared rarely if at all on the television show. [...] In fact, {{for the last few years}} of the radio show, she pre-recorded her lines and Jack and Mary's daughter, Joan, stood in for the live taping, with Mary's lines later edited into the tape replacing Joan's before broadcast. [...] Mary Livingstone finally retired from show business permanently in 1958, as her friend Gracie Allen had done.|$|E
2500|$|Blanc was {{a regular}} on the NBC Red Network show The Jack Benny Program in various roles, {{including}} voicing Benny's Maxwell automobile (in desperate need of a tune-up), violin teacher Professor LeBlanc, Polly the Parrot, Benny's pet polar bear Carmichael, the tormented department store clerk, and the train announcer. The first role came from a mishap when the recording of the automobile's sounds failed to play on cue, prompting Blanc to take the microphone and improvise the sounds himself. The audience reacted so positively that Benny decided to dispense with the recording altogether and have Blanc continue in that role. One of Blanc's most memorable characters from Benny's radio (and later TV) programs was [...] "Sy, the Little Mexican", who spoke one word at a time. The famous [...] "Sí ... Sy ... Sue ... sew" [...] routine was so effective {{that no matter how}} many times it was performed, the <b>laughter</b> <b>was</b> always there, thanks to the comedic timing of Blanc and Benny. Blanc continued to work with him on radio until the series ended in 1955 and followed the program into television from Benny's 1950 debut episode through guest spots on NBC specials in the 1970s. They last appeared together on a Johnny Carson Tonight Show in January 1974. A few months later, Blanc spoke highly of Benny on a Tom Snyder Tomorrow show special aired the night of the comedian's death.|$|E

Carnac had a trademark entrance {{in which he}} always turned the wrong direction when coming onto stage and then tripped on the step up to Carson's desk. (In one episode, technicians rigged Carson's desk to fall apart when Carnac fell into it.) These comedic missteps were an indication of Carnac's true prescient abilities. Ed McMahon would hand Carnac a series of envelopes containing questions, {{said to have been}} [...] "hermetically sealed in a mayonnaise jar buried under Funk & Wagnall's porch since noon today." [...] Carnac would place each envelope against his forehead and predict the answer, such as [...] "Gatorade". Then, he would read the question: [...] "What does an alligator get on welfare?" [...] Some of the jokes were feeble, and McMahon used pauses after terrible puns and audience groans to make light of Carnac's lack of comic success ("Carnac must be used to quiet surroundings"), prompting Carson to return an equal insult. Pat McCormick wrote some of the zaniest Carnac material. The one that had Ed and Carnac nearly rolling on the floor with sustained <b>laughter</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Siss, boom, bah" [...] Answer – [...] "Describe the sound made when a sheep explodes." [...] McMahon would always announce near the end, [...] "I hold in my hand the last envelope," [...] at which the audience would applaud wildly, prompting Carnac to pronounce a comedic [...] "curse" [...] on the audience, such as [...] "May a flock of wild geese leave a deposit on your breakfast!!", [...] "May your sister elope with a camel!", [...] "May a diseased yak take a liking to your sister", or the most famous: [...] "May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!" ...|$|E
