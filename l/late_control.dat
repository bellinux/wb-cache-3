40|$|There is {{interest}} among some dairy farmers in increasing herbage intake of cows during spring by increasing pasture cover but without compromising pasture quality into the summer. "Late control" is a grazing management strategy developed in Massey University that meets those requirements (Matthews et al., 1996). In addition, {{it has been}} demonstrated in previous trials that <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> increases pasture production in the summer-autumn period by increasing ryegrass tillering vigour. <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> requires a period of lax grazing during spring to allow some reproductive growth development on ryegrass pastures, which is then controlled by hard grazing in late spring before anthesis. However, patchiness may develop in <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> during the lax grazing period when the herbage allowance is high. The objectives for the present experiment were to compare the pasture characteristics under <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> and conventional "Early control" spring management strategies in December-January, with particular reference to the consequences of vegetation heterogeneity to pasture production and utilisation over this period, and to discuss the implications to spring grazing management. The experiment involved detailed studies on three paddocks chosen from each of two farmlets of 22 paddocks used for a system trial comparing Early and <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> spring management on herds of 120 cows. Herbage mass distributions were estimated by taking 200 capacitance meter readings at random on each paddock. Relationships between herbage mass and utilisation and accumulation were estimated by using two 30 m permanent transects in each paddock. To determine botanical composition and tiller population variability within a sward, five tall patches and five short patches were sampled in each paddock. Paddocks in <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> before the control phase in December had more herbage mass than paddocks in Early control (3600 vs. 5000 kg DM/ha), but the variability of herbage mass was similar (1000 vs. 1000, standard deviation in kg DM/ha). The skewness of the herbage mass distribution was positive but greater in Early control than in <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> (0. 57 vs. 0. 32). Botanical composition was similar between treatments and within paddocks. Pasture morphology showed tiller size-density compensation in both treatments. Pasture characteristics in <b>late</b> <b>control</b> were not an impediment for efficient pasture removal in <b>late</b> <b>control</b> and more herbage was harvested than in Early control (1900 vs. 1000 kg DM/ha), although herbage allowance was greater in Early control. Short patches in both treatments were defoliated in less proportion than tall patches, but in <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> the proportion of short patches was less than in Early control. Therefore, low herbage mass and greater proportion of short patches in Early control had {{a negative effect on}} total herbage utilisation. Harvesting efficiency was controlled on <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> paddocks to avoid limitations to herbage intake, and the skewness of the distribution of herbage mass after grazing increased compared to Early control, as well as the proportion of tall poorly utilised patches. Topping of pastures after grazing was effective in removing poorly utilised material and in decreasing patchiness in January. In January, <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> paddocks had more herbage mass, but less patchiness than Early control paddocks (6300 vs. 4700 kg DM/ha). Sward characteristics were affected by treatment, and in general <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> increased ryegrass content and its leafiness during January compared to Early control. In January, herbage utilisation was greater in <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> than in Early control (3000 vs. 1700 kg DM/ha). It was concluded that because <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> had greater responses in tall patches, the objective should be to modify management to a longer rotation length before controlling reproductive growth in late spring, to allow a greater proportion of the sward to achieve high herbage mass. The combination of grazing and topping of pastures gave high herbage intakes and effective pasture control. More pasture was produced in <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> than in Early control and the rotation length can also be increased during the summer in <b>Late</b> <b>control,</b> which may benefit further ryegrass tillering...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{generated}} at Massey University {{demonstrated the}} importance of the manipulation of ryegrass reproductive growth during spring to pasture production. It showed that lax grazing of pastures during spring followed by hard grazing at the time of anthesis could result in an enhancement of summer-autumn herbage production, associated with an enhanced tillering activity of ryegrass plants. Such grazing management was called "late control", and it was thought to be an option for enhancing pasture production, particularly in dairy farms, where conditions for manipulating reproductive swards would be most favourable. Thus, the objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the effects of this <b>late</b> <b>control</b> spring grazing management on summer-autumn herbage production and botanical composition of ryegrass-white clover dairy pastures, and (ii) to investigate the consequences of such a grazing management strategy on pasture quality, herbage intake and milk production by dairy cows. Three field experiments are reported. The first two were sward-based experiments whose results were used to plan and set up the third experiment, which involved evaluation of both sward and animal effects. The results from Experiment 1 (October 1990 to April 1991) and 2 (October 1991 to April 1992) confirmed the expectations of enhanced spring and summer-autumn herbage accumulation from a <b>late</b> <b>control</b> grazing management over the spring time. An average increase in production of the order of 750 Kg DM/ha (25 %) was obtained from October to November, and of 1. 0 t DM/ha (20 %) was obtained from January to April in both years, with ryegrass accumulation being enhanced in Experiment 1 and white clover accumulation enhanced in Experiment 2. Evidence gathered about tillering activity was inconclusive, although it showed that tillers produced under the <b>late</b> <b>control</b> spring grazing management were bigger than those produced under the conventional hard grazing management. White clover response was variable from year to year. It was concluded that the timing as well as the intensity of execution of the <b>late</b> <b>control</b> were very important. <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> should be executed at the time of anthesis of the reproductive development of ryegrass plants (late November-early December), and the removal of seedheads and reproductive stems should be gradual, over two or three successive grazing cycles. Simulation of the implementation of this <b>late</b> <b>control</b> grazing management on a farm basis was then performed, based on the results from Experiments 1 and 2, in order to gain an overview about possible practical implications for farm practice. The models showed that the preparation of pastures to achieve the reproductive stage prior to <b>late</b> <b>control</b> was feasible and would not imply any decrease in the feeding level of dairy cows. However, more information was necessary on how to execute <b>late</b> <b>control</b> and whether or not the increased summer-autumn herbage accumulation could be converted to milk production. Further evaluation of <b>late</b> <b>control</b> grazing in Experiment 3 (October 1992 to April 1993) revealed that increase in spring herbage accumulation by 1000 Kg DM/ha (25 %) was a consequence of the reproductive growth of perennial ryegrass plants, which caused a decrease in the digestibility of the herbage consumed from 78 % to 75 % due to the increased contents of senescent and grass stem material in the sward. On the other hand, increased summer-autumn herbage accumulation (1000 Kg DM/ha, 25 %) after <b>late</b> <b>control</b> was due to enhanced accumulation of both ryegrass and white clover. The digestibility of the herbage was restored soon after <b>late</b> <b>control.</b> Despite the lower digestibility of reproductive swards during the control period, no significant reduction in the herbage intake of dairy cows was detected in comparison with animals grazing leafy and vegetative swards. However, the use of forage conservation to augment grazing pressure during the <b>late</b> <b>control</b> phase proved to be more effective than a grazing only strategy, since a large proportion of senescent material was allowed to form under those circumstances. The increase in summer-autumn herbage accumulation was associated with an increase in milk solids yield per cow of the order of 10 %, with around 25 Kg milk-fat being obtained from the extra tonne of dry matter accumulated per hectare in <b>late</b> <b>control</b> pastures. It is concluded that the <b>late</b> <b>control</b> spring grazing management of perennial ryegrass-white clover pastures can be used as an option to enhance pasture production in dairy farms, particularly during the summer-autumn period, and that this increased herbage accumulation can be effectively converted to milk solids yield. The implementation of this grazing strategy into a farm context and its implications for farm practice are briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, the {{emphasis}} in dairying systems in New Zealand has been on maintaining pasture quality in late spring through increased grazing pressure and occasionally topping. Recent studies have reported an increase in summer and autumn herbage production by allowing some reproductive development during spring, followed by a period of hard grazing {{at the time of}} anthesis when seed heads are immature and still palatable (<b>late</b> <b>control),</b> through effects on tiller population and size. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate whether the benefits of <b>late</b> <b>control</b> can be measured within the management constraints of a self-contained spring calving dairy production system, (ii) investigate the conditions under which <b>late</b> <b>control</b> spring grazing management can be implemented, and (iii) investigate the options available for the use of additional feed over spring and summer assuming <b>late</b> <b>control</b> spring grazing management is effective. A dairying systems study at No 4 Dairy Unit, Massey University was set up in which two 20 -paddock perennial ryegrass/white clover dominant farmlets of 45 hectares were each stocked with 120 spring calving Friesian cows in October 1993 and run for three lactations until May 1996. With the exception of spring grazing management and spring supplement feeding the farmlets were balanced. The first treatment, designated early control (EC), involved strict control of grazing throughout the spring and summer with average pasture cover targeted at approximately 2000 kg DM ha- 1 and a post-grazing residual of approximately 1500 kg DM ha- 1. Pastures in the second treatment (<b>late</b> <b>control</b> - LC) were allowed to develop some reproductive growth through October and November for removal in December. Average pasture cover target was 2700 kg DM ha- 1, with a post-grazing residual of approximately 2000 kg DM ha- 1 over spring. Average pasture cover was reduced to 2000 kg DM ha- 1 in December by grazing to lower residuals {{while at the same time}} removing paddocks from grazing for immediate conservation. Bayesian smoothing provided an alternative to analysis of variance (ANOVA) for those variables where both treatments and/or all replicates were not measured at the same point in time, and for large data sets and produced mean values close to those that would be produced by conventional analysis methods without the need to group arbitrarily. The development of a dynamic rising plate meter calibration equation which accounts for seasonal differences in pasture density allowed clearer definition of herbage mass estimates from rising plate meter measurements. Mass per unit height values showed a distinct seasonal pattern reflecting changes in the sward. The bulk density of pasture in the summer was found to be twice that in the winter. Overall, there was no extended period of difference between early control and <b>late</b> <b>control</b> in either pasture production or animal production during the three years of the trial. However, large differences in animal performance would not be expected considering the marginal differences in pasture production achieved. While treatment differences in average pasture cover and pre- and post-grazing cover were achieved over late spring in all three years, the pasture cover differences required for the <b>late</b> <b>control</b> treatment were not achieved, and as a consequence the response in animal performance was smaller than the results of previous small-plot and paddock-scale experiments suggested. The results of the trial showed good internal consistency between production components and good control of variability was achieved in this large systems trial, providing an objective basis for evaluation. A number of the variables (clover contents and tiller densities) measured during the trial suggest the potential for contrast in system performance between early control and <b>late</b> <b>control.</b> The ability of the system to buffer changes contributed to the difficulties in achieving treatment specifications. Systems research of this type needs to include tight specifications and control of pre- and post-grazing pasture cover in addition to average pasture cover. More flexibility in stocking rate or use of supplements may be needed to establish spring pasture cover contrasts in future studies. A whole farm simulation model (UDDER) was used to investigate alternative management strategies for utilising grazed and conserved herbage, after modifications to achieve effective matching between predicted and measured levels of pasture production and animal performance. The level of milk production predicted by UDDER was not achieved in the field over three years using the same inputs, possibly due to the inability of the model to cope with the limitations of colder/wet winters and wetland dairy farming. The adjustments made to the parameters of UDDER were in general successful, allowing daily and annual milksolids production to be modelled. However, herbage intake was insensitive to higher spring pasture covers and resultant increase in allowance. For most of the year UDDER predicted the herbage intake of lactating cows to be at or near their potential. Early control and <b>late</b> <b>control</b> base models were used to evaluate alternative management strategies for using the extra herbage accumulation generated under the <b>late</b> <b>control</b> management, including feeding conserved forage during summer to lactating cows or during winter to dry cows, stocking rate (2. 6, 2. 8 and 3. 0 cows ha- 1) and the level of conservation (none versus increased). The loss of quality associated with conservation meant that conserving and adding silage back into the system did not increase milksolids production or gross margin, particularly when UDDER predicted that no real feed shortage existed. However, in practice conserving herbage reduces the risk associated with poor growing years. The low stocking rate policy was the best for early control, although the stocking rate policy with 2. 8 cows ha- 1 and conserved supplements being fed back to lactating cows in summer was similar. The latter policy was the best for <b>late</b> <b>control.</b> At the high stocking rate the flexibility of the system was reduced. In general, milksolids production and gross margin were higher for <b>late</b> <b>control</b> than early control, provided the increase in herbage accumulation rate associated with lax spring grazing management (<b>late</b> <b>control)</b> was factored in. Since a search of the literature failed to identify a model capable of predicting the response of pastures to <b>late</b> <b>control</b> spring grazing management, an attempt was made to develop a tiller-based model to allow the <b>late</b> <b>control</b> system to be investigated further. The model developed estimates equilibrium tiller density based on size or mass of ryegrass tillers at the environmental ceiling leaf area based on daily levels of photosynthetically active radiation. However, there was insufficient detailed sward data available to provide conclusive evidence for the validity of the tiller model. Despite the lack of consistent treatment differences obtained from the trial and the difficulties experienced when modelling <b>late</b> <b>control</b> management alternatives, this project has provided a comprehensive data set and considerable insight into the dairy production system. <b>Late</b> <b>control</b> spring grazing management can potentially increase the overall productivity of the seasonal dairying systems of New Zealand. In practical terms the main requirement is for a change in conservation management over the spring period, with no other direct costs involved. However, the timing limitations which are an inevitable consequence of rotational grazing systems restrict the opportunity to impose <b>late</b> <b>control</b> management with the rigorous timing that component research suggests may be necessary. During the course of this trial spring grazing management on dairy farms has tended towards that of <b>late</b> <b>control</b> management, with farmers operating grazing systems with higher average pasture covers through the spring with the aim of improving per hectare production through per cow performance...|$|E

In total, 25 % of the children included in the study (24 % of the kidney units) remained with renal sequelae one year after the initial episode of AP. Conclusions: The persistence of scintigraphic lesions {{six months after}} an episode of AP, does not necessarily correspond to permanent scars, since normalization can sometimes be observed on late controls...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Attempts {{to improve}} late results of bypass {{coronary}} surgery {{have focused on}} the use of arterial conduits because of the high attrition rate of venous grafts. METHODS AND RESULTS: In our institution, 150 patients received an inferior epigastric artery (EPIG) as a free bypass graft, anastomosed to the right coronary artery in 73 % and to a marginal branch in 20 % of cases. These patients were followed prospectively by qualitative and quantitative angiography. Angiographic studies were performed in 122 patients (81 %) early after surgery (11 +/- 5 days), and in 72 cases, a late evaluation (11 +/- 6 months) was also obtained. Quantative angiography (basal and after isosorbide dinitrate [ISDN]) was performed on the in situ EPIG in a large subset of these patients, as well as in 59 patients before bypass surgery. The patency rate was 98 % at early control and remained high (93 %) at <b>late</b> <b>control.</b> However, at <b>late</b> <b>control,</b> 14 EPIGs were occluded or threadlike, but of these 14, eight were grafted on a coronary artery with a moderate stenosis (< or = 60 %) and with good anterograde perfusion. Mean basal EPIG diameter increased from 2. 23 +/- 0. 42 mm before surgery to 2. 57 +/- 0. 52 mm at 11 days (P <. 01) but decreased to 2. 20 +/- 0. 47 mm in late study (P <. 01 versus 11 days and P = NS versus before surgery). Vasodilation of EPIG with ISDN was observed before surgery (+ 0. 34 +/- 0. 20 mm, P <. 001) and at <b>late</b> <b>control</b> (+ 0. 20 +/- 0. 17 mm, P <. 001) but not in the early postoperative period for the whole group. Early after surgery, basal diameter was not different from native EPIG dimensions after ISDN (2. 57 +/- 0. 52 versus 2. 56 +/- 0. 39 mm), suggesting maximal dilation. However, vasodilation with ISDN was observed in a subgroup of patients at this time. These responder patients (n = 51) had a smaller basal diameter (2. 47 +/- 0. 49 versus 2. 67 +/- 0. 54 mm, P <. 05) and a smaller runoff (P <. 001) than nonresponder patients. CONCLUSIONS: EPIG grafts have a good early patency rate. The mid-term patency rate remains high and seems to depend, at least partially, on flow through the native coronary artery. EPIGs initially increase their lumen size, probably to meet the increased blood flow due to myocardial requirements. Over time, EPIG diameters decrease mainly {{as a result of a}} higher basal vasomotor tone. Long-term angiographic follow-up (eg, 5 to 10 years) is needed to assess late patency rate and the relation with these early findings and will define the place of this new coronary bypass conduit...|$|E

40|$|Background: Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) {{is related to}} {{increased}} systemic inflammation and arterial hypertension. We hypothesize that OSA is frequent in patients with acute hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and {{is related to the}} perihematoma edema. Methods: Thirty-two non-comatose patients with a hypertensive ICH underwent polysomnography in the acute phase. Perihematoma edema volume was measured on CT scans at admission, after 24 h (early control) and after 4 - 5 days (<b>late</b> <b>control).</b> The Spearman coefficient (r(s)) was used for correlations. Results: OSA occurred in 19 (59. 4 %) patients. The apnea-hypopnea index was correlated with relative edema at admission CT (r(s) = 0. 40; p = 0. 031), early CT (r(s) = 0. 46; p = 0. 011) and at late CT (r(s) = 0. 59; p = 0. 006). Conclusions: OSA is highly frequent during the acute phase of hypertensive ICH and is related to perihematoma edema. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) {{are small}} DNA viruses that infect various {{epithelial}} tissues. The more than 100 types of HPV described share a circular DNA genome of about 8000 base pairs organized into an early, a late, {{and a long}} con-trol region. The products of 2 genes from the early control region, E 6 and E 7, are essential in the HPV-induced processes of cellular transformation and immortaliza-tion, and 2 genes from the <b>late</b> <b>control</b> region, L 1 and L 2, encode the viral capsid proteins. A few high-risk types of HPV types, including HPV- 16 and HPV- 18, are asso-ciated with more than 99 % of cervical carcinomas. Continuous expression of the E 6 and E 7 oncoproteins by high-risk types of HPV often leads to genomic aberrations, a step toward malignant conversion. Although in most cases innate and adaptive im-mune responses control HPV infection, the high-risk types of virus {{have the ability to}} subvert immune defenses, which explains persistent infection and progression to neoplasia...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequence}} of the nonredundant region of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium temperate, serotype-converting bacteriophage P 22 has been completed. The genome is 41, 724 bp with an overall moles percent GC content of 47. 1 %. Numerous examples of potential integration host factor and C 1 -binding sites were identified in the sequence. In addition, five potential rho-independent terminators were discovered. Sixty-five genes were identified and annotated. While many of these had been described previously, we have added several new ones, including the genes involved in serotype conversion and <b>late</b> <b>control.</b> Two of the serotype conversion gene products show considerable sequence relatedness to GtrA and -B from Shigella phages SfII, SfV, and SfX. We have cloned the serotype-converting cassette (gtrABC) and demonstrated that it results in Salmonella serovar Typhimurium LT 2 cells which express antigen O 1. Many of the putative proteins show sequence relatedness to proteins from {{a great variety of}} other phages, supporting the hypothesis that this phage has evolved through the recombinational exchange of genetic information with other viruses...|$|E

The most important aspects of design building blocks of adaptive internal model control are the choice of architectures, learning algorithms, and examples of learning. The choice of parametric adaptation algorithm for updating elements of the conventional adaptive internal model control shows limitations. To overcome these limitations, we chose the architectures of neural networks deduced from the conventional models and the Levenberg-marquardt during the adjustment of system parameters of the adaptive neural internal model control.

40|$|Since {{the change}} of the Hungarian {{agriculture}} the increased weed infection causes great losses in wheat. It is necessary to apply herbicides on the weedy field as harvest approaches to make the harvest easier and avoid losses. In our small plot trials at Nagygombos, between 1996 and 2002 the applicability of fluroxypyr, bromoxynil, dicamba, tribenuron-methyl and MCPA in <b>late</b> weed <b>control</b> was examined in four wheat varieties. We found that the late application against weeds {{did not have a}} total eliminating effect, however reduced the number of weeds, restricted their development and the reproductive organs below and above ground dried. Weed seed infection was slowed down and the dried stems made harvesting easier. In the last three years, we found that fluroxypyr (Starane) and tribenuron-methyl (Granstar) impeded a little the maturing and water extraction in the milk maturation stage of wheat, but this difference was not seen in full maturation. Examinations showed that after <b>late</b> weed <b>control,</b> all of above-mentioned chemicals except bromoxynil (Pardner) was discharged {{at the time of the}} harvest and were under the maximum residue tolerance limit. So the experimentally involved herbicides can be used for <b>late</b> weed <b>control</b> - in accordance with international experiences...|$|R
