25|$|Historically, the dry and <b>liquid</b> <b>bulk</b> {{segments}} {{have generated}} {{most of the}} canal's revenues. Bulk cargo includes dry goods, such as grains (corn, soy, and wheat, among others), minerals, fertilizers, coal, and liquid goods, such as chemical products, propane gas, crude oil, and oil derivatives. Recently, containerized cargo has replaced dry bulk as the canal's main income generator, moving it to second place. Vehicle carriers have become the third-largest income generator, replacing the <b>liquid</b> <b>bulk</b> segment. Shipping industry analyses conducted by the ACP and top industry experts indicate that the canal expansion will be beneficial to both the canal and its users because of the demand that will be served by allowing the transit of more tonnage.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{providing}} and sustaining {{a difference in}} pH of a first reaction of an immobilized enzyme and a second reaction in a <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> surrounding the immobilized enzyme is carried out with a bilayer pellet containing coimmobilized enzymes. The pellet can contain an enzyme that produces a desired product immobilized in an inner core and urease immobilized in an outer layer. The <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> contains urea and a substrate for the enzyme in the core, and has an acidic pH. The urease reacts with urea diffusing into the outer layer from the <b>bulk</b> <b>liquid</b> to produce ammonia.
