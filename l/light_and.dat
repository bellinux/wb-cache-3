40|$|The {{increase}} in household energy consumption {{has been more}} apparent than such increases in the industrial and transportation sectors. The sources of household energy consumption can be classified into heating and cooling, cooking, hot-water supply, <b>and</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> electric appliances. In particular, energy consumption for <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> electric appliances has been significantly increasing. In order to consider energy-saving measures in the home, we should trace the tendencies of increasing energy consumption due to <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> electric appliances in recent years. In this paper, we analyze {{the current level of}} energy consumption for <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> electric appliances and, moreover, attempt to predict the level we can expect in 2020. Consequently, it is estimated that the energy consumption of <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> electric appliances will decrease by 16 % from the 2010 level, mainly due to the energy savings expected for refrigerators <b>and</b> <b>lighting...</b>|$|R
