5|$|Warm seclusions {{may have}} cloud-free, eye-like {{features}} at their center (reminiscent of tropical cyclones), significant pressure falls, hurricane-force winds, and moderate to strong convection. The most intense warm seclusions often attain pressures less than 950millibars (28.05inHg) with a definitive <b>lower</b> <b>to</b> mid-level warm core structure. A warm seclusion, {{the result of}} a baroclinic lifecycle, occurs at latitudes well poleward of the tropics.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the <b>lower</b> <b>to</b> the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
5|$|Haifa has {{developed}} in tiers, from the <b>lower</b> <b>to</b> the upper {{city on the}} Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part {{to make way for}} government buildings. Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.|$|E

5|$|North Vietnam's {{deployment}} of SAMs forced American pilots to make hard choices: either approach targets at higher altitudes (to avoid anti-aircraft fire) and become prey to SAMs, or fly <b>lower</b> <b>to</b> avoid the missiles {{and become the}} target of anti-aircraft batteries. Due to altered tactics and {{the increased use of}} electronic radar jamming, the record of SAM kills decreased over time. The already dismal missile success rate fell from one kill in 30 launches to less than one kill in 50.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} habitat in the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the dry-oak mixed forest. Common trees in this habitat include northern red oak, white oak, and chestnut oak. This habitat also contains gray and black birch trees. Pine, hemlock, and {{some types of}} oak trees are found on the higher parts of this habitat. <b>Lower</b> <b>to</b> the ground are huckleberry, teaberry, blueberry, and hawthorn and other plants. The wildflowers in this habitat include wild onion and wild strawberries.|$|E
5|$|The {{power plant}} {{operates}} using a lower and upper reservoir {{along with a}} power plant connected to both. Water is either pumped from the <b>lower</b> <b>to</b> the upper reservoir to serve as stored energy or released from the upper to the lower reservoir to generate electricity. Pumping occurs during low demand, cheap electricity, periods such as night and generating will occur during peak demand, expensive electricity, hours such as during the day. The pumping/generating process repeats as needed.|$|E

5|$|There are six main {{requirements}} for tropical cyclogenesis: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the <b>lower</b> <b>to</b> middle {{levels of the}} troposphere, enough Coriolis force to sustain a low pressure center, a preexisting low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. While these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation, they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form.|$|E
5|$|Most {{specimens}} of Gorgosaurus libratus {{have been recovered}} from the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. This formation dates {{to the middle of}} the Campanian, between 76.5 and 74.8million years ago, and Gorgosaurus libratus fossils are known specifically from the <b>lower</b> <b>to</b> middle section of the formation, between 76.6 and 75.1 million years ago. The Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana have also yielded possible Gorgosaurus remains. At this time, the area was a coastal plain along the western edge of the Western Interior Seaway, which divided North America in half. The Laramide Orogeny had begun uplifting the Rocky Mountains to the west, from which flowed great rivers that deposited eroded sediment in vast floodplains along the coast. The climate was subtropical with marked seasonality, and periodic droughts sometimes resulted in massive mortality among the great herds of dinosaurs, as represented in the numerous bonebed deposits preserved in the Dinosaur Park Formation. Conifers formed the forest canopy, while the understory plants consisted of ferns, tree ferns and angiosperms. Around 73million years ago, the seaway began to expand, transgressing into areas formerly above sea level and drowning the Dinosaur Park ecosystem. This transgression, called the Bearpaw Sea, is recorded by the marine sediments of the massive Bearpaw Shale.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the northwestern}} Pacific {{there are no}} {{official}} typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year. Like any tropical cyclone, there are six main requirements for typhoon formation and development: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the <b>lower</b> <b>to</b> middle levels of the troposphere, enough Coriolis force to develop a low pressure center, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. While the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms do occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of Japan. The Philippines receive {{the brunt of the}} landfalls, with China and Japan being impacted slightly less. Some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives. Taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest Pacific tropical cyclone basins.|$|E
