40|$|ABSTRACT: Knowledge {{spillover}} on {{advanced technology}} {{is thought to}} be one of the most significant measures for encouraging regional industries as well as forming regional industrial cluster. However, in many rural areas, it is not easy to produce spillover itself because of lack of effective knowledge source and lack of capability of surrounding regional enterprises for utilizing spilled out knowledge/technology, in addition to the difficulty of forming an effective industrial cluster. The case researched here is one successful example of local business on <b>lily</b> <b>bulbs,</b> in Kochi. Kochi is a warm, mild climate, rural area in Japan, suitable for growing <b>lily</b> <b>bulbs.</b> However, one problem for this industry was the difficulty to ship/grow <b>lily</b> <b>bulbs</b> in winter because <b>lily</b> <b>bulbs</b> cannot be cropped in cold seasons. The company’s unique idea was to import <b>lily</b> <b>bulbs</b> to Japan, located in the north hemisphere, from some countries in the southern hemisphere by using freezing containers and large freezing compartments and ship the bulbs to the flower farmers after warming them up. By this measure, they could monopolize the winter bulb market in Japan. This case implies us significance of finding a competitive business model in rural regions. Here, global collaboration is one very important element to find such a business model. Even by using conventional technology (what we call low-tech), not by using advanced technology (high-tech), regional industries can be effectively encouraged by adapting technologies to such a suitable business model...|$|R

Plants of Lilium Oriental hybrids ‘Sorbonne’ were treated with a foliar spray of CCC or PBZ (both at 300 mg/L) solution, at six weeks after planting (6 WAP). The morphological parameters, endogenous hormone contents (gibberellic acid (GA), abscisic acid (ABA), and indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA)), and carbohydrate contents were measured from 6 to 18 WAP, at 2 -week intervals. The results showed that CCC increased the biomass of leaves and stems which might produce more photoassimilates available for transportation and utilization. However, PBZ treatment suppressed vegetative growth and favored photoassimilate transportation into bulbs. A slight delay of bud and anthesis formation was observed in both treated plants. CCC and PBZ treatments substantially enhanced the sucrose contents in leaves probably due to the increase of chlorophyll contents.

Production of Easter <b>lily</b> <b>bulbs</b> has been controversial because pesticides used to grow the lilies are polluting streams that feed the estuary of the Smith River, California's healthiest and most important river for salmon and steelhead.

40|$|Vegetative {{propagation}} is {{very important}} for the survival of species with long juvenile and adult vegetative phases, as it is the case for bulbous plants. Bulbous plants are ornamental geophytes with a bulb as an underground storage organ. Among flower <b>bulbs,</b> tulip and <b>lily</b> are the two commercially leading plants in The Netherlands. Tulip propagates vegetatively via axillary bud outgrowth, while lily propagates via adventitious bulblet formation. The vegetative propagation rate in tulip is very low due to the limited amount of axillary buds that will grow successfully. Moreover, tulip is very recalcitrant to in vitro regeneration. On the other hand, lily propagates efficiently via adventitious bulblet formation, either naturally from the underground portion of the stem of the apical bud, or artificially from detached bulb scales. This thesis study aimed to understand how axillary bud outgrowth is controlled in tulip bulbs and how regeneration capacity is established in <b>lily</b> <b>bulb</b> scales. As a first step towards these goals, {{the state of the art}} of the molecular control of sexual and vegetative reproduction was reviewed for model species. Moreover, two approaches, “bottom-up” and “top-down”, to transfer the knowledge from model to non-model species were described (Chapter 2). In short, the “bottom-up” approach usually goes from individual genes to systems, assuming conservation of molecular pathways and using sequence homology searches to identify candidate genes. ”Top-down” methodologies go from systems to genes, and are based on large scale transcriptome profiling via  e. g. microarrays or RNA sequencing, followed by the identification of associations between phenotypes, genes, and gene expression patterns and levels. Next (Chapter 3), two sets of high quality transcriptomes, one for tulip and one for lily were generated  from a collection of several tissues using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Several assembly filtering parameters were applied, to highlight the limitations of stringent but routinely used filtering in de novo transcriptome assembly. The final created transcriptomes were made publicly available via a user friendly Transcriptome browser ([URL] and their usefulness was exemplified by a search for all potential transcription factors in lily and tulip, with special focus on the TCP transcription factor family. One TCP member was of special interest because it has proven to integrate several pathways that control axillary bud outgrowth in a wide range of species. It is called TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 (TB 1) in monocots and BRNACHED 1 (BRC 1) in dicots. A Tulipa gesneriana TB 1 transcript was identified from the generated transcriptome and subsequently, tulip axillary bud outgrowth was studied through a “bottom-up” approach (Chapter 4). The degree of axillary bud outgrowth in tulip determines the success of their vegetative propagation. However the number of axillary meristems in one bulb is low –six on average– and not all of them seem to have the same growth capacity. The combination of physiological and targeted molecular experiments indicated that the first two inner located buds do not seem to experience dormancy (assessed by weight increase and TgTB 1 expression) at any point of the growth cycle, while mid-located buds enter dormancy by the end of the growing season. Moreover it was shown that TgTB 1 expression in tulip bulbs can be modulated by sucrose, cytokinin and strigolactone, just as it has been reported for other species. However, the limited growth of mid-located buds even when their TgTB 1 expression was naturally or artificially downregulated, pointed at other factors, probably physical, inhibiting their growth. Next, the remarkable regeneration capacity of lily by initiating de novo shoot meristems from excised bulb scales without the addition of exogenous hormones or growth regulators was studied using a “top-down” approach (Chapter 5). An extensive and comprehensive transcriptome set was generated from <b>lily</b> <b>bulb</b> scales in a time-series using two cultivars and two explant types, all differing in regeneration capacity. This set up provided first insight in the key molecular process underlying pro-meristem induction and meristem initiation in lily. We found that wounding activates a very fast regeneration response, probably mediated by APETALA 2 /ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTORS (AP 2 /ERF,) such as LoERF 115 and WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 2 (LoWIND 2), which in turn might mediate polar auxin re-distribution, cell proliferation and de-differentiation. Moreover, the timing and level of induction of shoot meristem regulators, such as ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION 2 (LoESR 2) and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (LoSTM) correlated with the regeneration capacity of the scale. Regardless the regeneration capacity of the different explants e. g. cultivar or position within the scale, regeneration occurs at the proximal-adaxial side of the bulb scale, right on top of the excision line. Thus the possible cellular and physiological factors granting <b>lily</b> <b>bulb</b> scales their competence to regenerate was investigated (Chapter 6). We found that the adaxial parenchyma tissue seems to be more competent than the abaxial tissue, partially because of higher number of secondary veins and larger cell population than the abaxial parenchyma region. It was proposed that upon explant excision, the polar auxin transport is disrupted, creating an auxin maximum at the excision line, which might create a gradient of cell divisions favouring the adaxial parenchyma tissue. The direction of this cell division gradient proved to be negatively affected by the absence of the adaxial epidermis. Moreover, explants without epidermis reduced dramatically their regeneration capacity, and lost the typical proximal-adaxial orientation of regeneration. Thus, a better understanding of the composition and physiology of the epidermis in <b>lily</b> <b>bulb</b> scales is essential to identify the regeneration stimulating signals originating from this tissue layer in Lilium sp. Finally in Chapter 7, integration of all the results was done and I addressed how this may contributes to the fundamental and applied understanding of vegetative propagation in bulbous plants. Also, some challenges are discussed, for example, the complexity in the architecture of tulip bulbs and how this influences ways for improving its rate of axillary bud outgrowth. The challenge to prove the findings of this thesis through functional analysis is also discussed and the possibility of using transient virus-induced gene silencing is highlighted. Moreover, the potential of <b>lily</b> <b>bulb</b> scales as a model system to study some aspects of de novo regeneration, as well as to study the recalcitrance of in vitro propagation is highlighted, supporting the idea that  more “omics” data and biotechnological tools for bulbous plant research are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{freezing}} duration, previous {{storage duration}} of bulbs at - 2 °C, and partial dehydration of scales on freezing tolerance of lily (Lilium hybrids) scales were studied {{for a series}} of cultivars. Freezing tolerance of scales was estimated by measuring ion leakage and recording scale bulblet regeneration. Both methods gave similar results. Freezing tolerance decreased with freezing duration. A longer previous storage duration of the bulbs at - 2 °C tended to reduce freezing tolerance of the scales. Dehydration of the scales to 10 - 20 % loss of water content significantly increased freezing tolerance. Further dehydration to 30 - 40 % loss of water content did not further increase freezing tolerance. Nucleation temperatures, temperatures during crystallisation and melting temperatures of the scales were recorded for the cultivar. Nucleation occurred at higher temperatures after a longer previous storage duration of bulbs, indicating a reduced capacity to remain supercooled. The increased freezing tolerance of dehydrated lily scales could partly be explained by a decreased melting temperature of the scales. We conclude long term storage of <b>lily</b> <b>bulbs</b> at - 2 °C to be safer after partial dehydration to 10 - 20 % loss of the original water content. ...|$|R
