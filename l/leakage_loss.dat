40|$|A novel rotary {{compressor}} {{has been developed}} by LG Electronics. This novel compressor, termed the z-compressor, performs very well in terms of noise and vibration but {{not in terms of}} energy consumption. The compressor uses refrigerant R- 410 A as the working fluid. In order to study in detail the performance of the compressor from an energy point of view, a model has been developed. The model accounts for internal <b>leakages,</b> frictional <b>losses,</b> heat transfer, and motor losses. The model has been validated by comparing its results with experimentally obtained results. The mass flow rate and power input of the compressor are predicted within 7 %. The discharge temperature is predicted within 5 Â°C. The model was used to identify and analyze internal losses within the compressor. Four leakage paths that are associated with the same clearance account for approximately 55 % of the total <b>leakage</b> <b>losses.</b> 35 % of the total <b>leakage</b> <b>losses</b> occur in two paths that are associated with another component of the compressor. 60 % to 70 % of frictional losses are associated with the same two components.
