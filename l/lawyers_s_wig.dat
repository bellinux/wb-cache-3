40|$|This article {{contributes}} a {{new perspective}} to existing scholarship on internationalization of the legal profession {{by focusing on the}} increasing presence of foreign <b>lawyers</b> in U. <b>S.</b> law schools and law firms. It analyzes the interaction between foreign-educated lawyers and the legal profession in the U. S. based upon two sources of information: first, a series of interviews with foreign-educated <b>lawyers</b> and U. <b>S.</b> law firm hiring partners regarding experiences in law school and in firms, and second, a database comprised of biographical information for more than 300 foreign-educated lawyers who were working in New York during 1999 and 2000. The various roles occupied by foreign <b>lawyers</b> in U. <b>S.</b> law schools and law firms are considered, including serving as substitutes for U. S. J. D. graduates and as connections to foreign legal markets. Despite their rhetoric of internationalization, U. S. law firms remain essentially domestic institutions; they have rarely integrated foreign-educated lawyers into their structures in the U. S. However, {{in order to meet the}} growing competition from accounting and consulting firms as well as from foreign law firms, U. <b>S.</b> <b>lawyers</b> may need to reconsider their reliance upon this domestic mindset...|$|R

U. <b>S.</b> <b>lawyers</b> are important participants in this expanding influence of law, as they educate, train and deploy individuals educated and licensed in the U. S. and abroad. This article examines {{the ways in which}} law firms internationalize, and considers the regulatory environment governing crucial interactions between U. <b>S.</b> and foreign-educated <b>lawyers.</b> It builds upon prior work that investigated the impact on U.

40|$|The {{increasingly}} international {{reach of}} law owes {{part of its}} momentum to individual lawyers and law firms that function as carriers of ideas, processes and policies. U. <b>S.</b> <b>lawyers</b> are important participants in this expanding influence of law, both {{in the public sphere}} in areas such as human rights and in private areas, such as regulation of business. They work as representatives of both U. S. clients and foreign organizations and governments, bringing their basic mindset, shaped by education and practice experiences, into their dealings with foreign lawyers as they connect in a variety of roles, from co- and opposing counsel, to employees and partners. By working alongside and across the table from each other, U. <b>S.</b> and foreign <b>lawyers</b> have opportunities to influence one another and extend the reach of their conceptions about the way law and legal practice should work. Through these interactions, they define the terms of internationalization and thereby establish the agenda for the role of law at the international level. This article examines the regulatory environment in which that interaction occurs. It considers the obstacles faced by law firms intent upon combining foreign and U. <b>S.</b> <b>lawyers</b> and builds on prior work that investigated the impact on U. S. law firms of the development of an international market for legal services and the roles of foreign lawyers in the U. S. Regulation within the United States concerning the interaction between foreign and U. <b>S.</b> <b>lawyers</b> shapes the ways in which U.

Further, restrictions on the interaction of foreign and U. <b>S.</b> <b>lawyers</b> limit the influence of U. S. practice and procedures on foreign lawyers, because such restrictions limit the opportunities for foreign lawyers to learn the ways and thinking of U. <b>S.</b> <b>lawyers...</b>|$|R
