500|$|Due to its popularity, The Walking Dead has {{inspired}} dozens of parodies and spoofs featured on YouTube channels <b>like</b> <b>Bad</b> Lip Reading and TV {{shows such as}} Saturday Night Live and Mad TV. Bad Lip Reading made a widely viewed parody involving Rick and the Governor, entitled [...] "La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum". The series' cast was shown the parody at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2013, and David Morrisseywho portrays the Governor reacted by saying he now understood {{why so many people}} would walk up to him on the street and blurt, [...] "Hey, La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum!". Until seeing the video, he had wondered, [...] "what's wrong with these people?" [...] The Walking Dead has also been represented as a live comedy performance by English comedian Dan Willis at the Edinburgh Festival.|$|E
500|$|While in {{training}} for the Sanitar, Walpole devoted his leisure hours to gaining a reasonable fluency in the Russian language, and to his first full-length work of non-fiction, a literary biography of Joseph Conrad. In the summer of 1915 {{he worked on the}} Austrian-Russian front, assisting at operations in field hospitals and retrieving the dead and wounded from the battlefield. Occasionally he found time to write brief letters home; he told Bennett, [...] "A battle is an amazing mixture of hell and a family picnic – not as frightening as the dentist, but absorbing, sometimes thrilling like football, sometimes dull like church, and sometimes simply physically sickening <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> fish. Burying dead afterwards is worst of all." [...] When disheartened he comforted himself with the thought, [...] "This is not so bad as it was at Marlow".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reception. According to Darrell Giles of The Courier Mail, several American critics [...] characterized it as {{the best}} episode of the show. Jason Steele of the Chicago Tribunes RedEye named it one of his three favorite episodes of Will & Grace. Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk wrote that the episode was hilarious. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly noted, [...] "Damon's spunky appearance... as a straight guy posing as homosexual and competing with Jack (Sean Hayes) for a spot in a gay men's choir. The show is endlessly imaginative in the ways it explores themes like this with a humor that doesn't betray or belittle its core gay characters." [...] Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News was less positive about the episode, stating that it [...] "plays <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> camp. There's nothing realistic about it— seem more like the inhabitants of a lame Saturday Night Live sketch than marginally real characters." [...] He also noted that [...] "the extent of the tastelessness of the sex talk and Karen faking a sexual encounter is amazing." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, at the vet where Dr. Jewish {{breaks the}} bad news about Peter's dead parrot, Chris and Anna hook up and begin dating. The {{relationship}} goes smoothly until Peter berates Chris for treating her too well. Peter tells him that women <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> boys, so Chris calls Anna a [...] "bitch" [...] on their next date, thinking that will improve the relationship. Instead, she breaks up with him. After hearing what happened, Lois, angry at Peter, tells {{him to try to}} comfort Chris, but Peter fails to cheer up Chris when Peter gives him a bullfrog which died when Peter poked holes on its back. When Lois tells Chris that the only person he should turn to in this situation is himself, Chris beats Brian with a chair as an excuse to return to the vet, sees Anna there, and apologizes to her. She forgives Chris and they renew their relationship, while Brian collapses to the floor in pain. Brian asks for help but Stewie comes in and kicks Brian in his stomach, before leaving him there.|$|E
500|$|While Shaefer's {{audition}} was unsuccessful, {{the quartet}} continued auditioning for a lead singer, with VH1 filming the recruitment process while being {{referred to as}} the temporary name [...] "The Project". The resulting documentary was aired as VH1 Inside Out: The Rise of Velvet Revolver. A number of lead singers auditioned for the band, including Steve Ludwin, of Carrie and Little Hell, Todd Kerns, formerly of Age of Electric, Sebastian Bach, formerly of Skid Row, Shawn Albro of U.P.O., and Travis Meeks of Days of the New. Myles Kennedy, formerly of The Mayfield Four, declined an invitation from Sorum to audition. Ian Astbury of The Cult and Mike Patton of Faith No More also declined audition offers. The band were also interested in auditioning Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland, who had become friends with McKagan after attending the same gym. Weiland once played on the same bill as Kushner, and was in rehab {{at the same time as}} Sorum. Weiland was sent two discs of material, and felt that the first disc [...] "sounded <b>like</b> <b>Bad</b> Company gone wrong." [...] When he was sent the second disc, Weiland was more positive, comparing it to Core-era Stone Temple Pilots, though he turned them down because Stone Temple Pilots were still together.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the band}} was {{recording}} their first demo tape, they had not yet come to decide upon {{a name for the}} band. When asked, they would answer with [...] "Chewin' Tobacco Fish Deedle". Their first demo was recorded in a space provided by their school. As would be obvious from their list of influences, the style and quality of their early material swung wildly: [...] "Behind That Door, on the other hand, sounds <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> European reggae," [...] proclaimed one Finnish reviewer.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} Entertainment Weekly article, Corgan {{disclosed}} that {{things went wrong}} {{at some of the}} very first recording sessions. [...] "...it was like, 'What do you mean the guitar's out of tune? What do you mean I have to be there at 11? What do you mean I can't order $100 of lobster every day?' I mean, <b>like,</b> <b>bad.</b> But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look like I was going to walk away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{the whole}} of the first day's play of a Test match has been lost because of bad weather or other reasons <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> light, then Team A may enforce the follow on if Team B's first innings total is 150 or more fewer than Team A's. During the 2nd Test between England and New Zealand at Headingley in 2013, England batted first after the first day was lost because of rain. New Zealand, batting second, scored 180 runs fewer than England, meaning England could have {{enforced}} the follow on, though chose not to. This is similar to four-day first-class cricket, where the follow on can be enforced if the difference is 150 runs or fewer. If the Test is 2 days or fewer then the [...] "follow-on" [...] value is 100 runs.|$|E
2500|$|One {{theory is}} that {{increased}} regulation of electronic wastes and concern over the environmental harm in nature economies creates an economic disincentive to remove residues prior to export. [...] Critics of trade in used electronics maintain {{that it is still}} too easy for brokers calling themselves recyclers to export unscreened electronic waste to developing countries, such as China, India and parts of Africa, thus avoiding the expense of removing items <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> cathode ray tubes (the processing of which is expensive and difficult). The developing countries have become toxic dump yards of e-waste. [...] Proponents of international trade point to the success of fair trade programs in other industries, where cooperation has led to creation of sustainable jobs and can bring affordable technology in countries where repair and reuse rates are higher.|$|E

2500|$|Keays co-produced an album, Riding High (February 1976), by Melbourne-based {{hard rock}} group Freeway, which Catterall opined had [...] "a serious {{identity}} problem ... {{not knowing if}} it's the Allman Brothers Band, Grinderswitch or Lynard Skynard, it also has tendencies toward sounding <b>like</b> <b>Bad</b> Company and the Doobie Brothers"; while Keays work is criticised as he [...] "does tend to overuse" [...] synthesisers. In July 1977, he teamed up with Phil Manning (ex-Bay City Union, Chain) on guitar to form Manning/Keays Band. The line-up included Peter Cuddily on bass guitar (ex-Space Waltz); John Grant on keyboards (ex-Freeway); Andrew Kay on violin and keyboards; and Robert Ross on drums. The band started recording an album but Keays left the project, which continued as Manning. Also that year Keays relocated to the United States' West Coast, where he lived for almost two years.|$|E
2500|$|The Slitheen {{disguise}} {{themselves by}} fitting into the skins of their victims, using compression fields {{created by a}} collar worn around their necks to squeeze their huge size into a slightly smaller space. Initially the compression ratio was limited, so the disguises tended to be obese people. This issue was overcome by new technology {{by the time of}} The Lost Boy, in which the skins of thinner people were used (by the time of [...] "From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love" [...] short people could also be used). The exchange of gases that compression entails also builds up within the acquired skin, causing very loud flatulence in humans (the expelled gas smells <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> breath, which the Doctor noted was a form of calcium decay—though, in reality, bacteria that cause tooth decay are different from those that cause bad breath). This side-effect is also overcome by the newer technology in The Lost Boy.|$|E
2500|$|Penny {{confesses to}} Sam that she doesn't really <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> boys, and only dates them {{to prove to}} herself {{that she is not}} a boring person, but she likes Carrie Underwood, Bruno Mars and Katy Perry. Sam confesses he has similar {{interests}} and they kiss, and he takes her to the auditorium to watch Jake, Unique, Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) perform a stripped-down version of [...] "Wide Awake". Jake later convinces Marley to dress up like Katy Perry for him, but they get into a fight when Marley claims she is not yet ready to have sex with him. The following day, Jake seduces Bree and they have sex in the school grounds. Bree also informs Principal Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) of the assignment, and Sue suspends the entire glee club for a week for dressing inappropriately on school grounds. Will refuses to back down to Sue despite her new position, and New Directions later meets at the auditorium, where they defiantly perform [...] "Roar", a song also performed by Pamela Lansbury, now with its full complement of performers, and the episode ends.|$|E

2500|$|Harris' {{criticism}} of the gameplay include the [...] "frustrating control, chuggy animation, and levels that just go on far too long." [...] He felt the levels needed more variety, stating that [...] "the missions are dreadfully too long and feature very little change in gameplay regardless of the settings and craft to control." [...] Eduardo Zacarias of GameZone also said the game had poor controls and, like Harris, criticized [...] "the fact that the levels seem to drag on forever". He felt there were [...] "a few things that do keep the game from being a simple shooter in outer space, {{such as the ability}} to zoom through the forests of Endor on a speeder bike," [...] but added that [...] "these are just minor distractions that just hide the fact that this game is just way too repetitive." [...] Zacarias enjoyed the amount of detail in background of locations such as the forests of Endor, but criticized the vehicle graphics for looking <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> imitations. Nintendo Power gave Flight of the Falcon a score of 2.3 out of 5, echoing Harris and Zacarias's {{criticism of}} the length of the levels. The magazine stated, however, that the game has [...] "an unmistakable Star Wars flair." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vergne's {{right hand}} {{was injured in}} the {{collision}} with Piquet and required an X-ray scan after complaining {{he was unable to}} move it correctly. He was annoyed with Piquet and briefly visited the NextEV garage to know if the latter had also retired. Vergne stated that he would ensure that he was fit for the next race of the season in Paris but felt the incident [...] "destroyed" [...] his race in Monaco. He believed that the crash prevented him from finishing on the podium and chose not to speak to Piquet after the event ended. Piquet was annoyed at Vergne's attempts at overtaking him, labelling him [...] "impatient" [...] and felt he could have been easily passed during the pit stop phase. He thought Vergne would slow down because the latter was unwilling to be overtaken around the outside, and that Vergne had placed himself in that situation, deeming it [...] "unnecessary" [...] but felt it was a [...] "racing incident": [...] "It's a shame, I hate that it happened with him and I hate these kinds of situations. I don't <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> feelings and I'm sure he's very upset and thinks I did it on purpose, but I was just going to defend my position." [...] Vergne represented the incident as less important six days later by saying he did not regret performing his manoeuvre and it was part of motor racing.|$|E
2500|$|After {{deciding}} {{on the story}} and the main character, he would balance the characters, in terms of genders, personalities, and ages represented; when making character personalities, he used the Enneagram of Personality as reference, which classifies people into nine groups; the decision to do this came from {{the importance of the}} number [...] "9" [...] in the storyline of 999. An important thing to him when making characters was to create a mystery behind them, to make players curious about who the characters are and what their pasts are like. Another important element was the use of misdirection: by deliberately making certain characters seem <b>like</b> <b>bad</b> people, he would aim to get players to focus on them more, making it more difficult for them to see who the [...] "real bad guy" [...] is. He aimed to not give the player characters strong personalities, {{in order to make it}} easier for players to empathize with them. He chose to have the games be played from a first person perspective as he felt it makes for [...] "a stronger impact" [...] and is more interesting than a third person perspective; it was also used to limit the information that is available to the player in a realistic way, as the player only knows what they experience or are told. Because the player characters in most games can die many times, Uchikoshi felt that video game characters' deaths may be taken lightly, which he saw as a weak point in games. To combat this, he focused on trying to get players to want to keep the story alive, rather than trying to keep the player character alive; as a result of wanting to keep the story going, players would also avoid the death of their character.|$|E
