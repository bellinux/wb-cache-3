Innovation is thus not only limited to high-tech sectors of the economy, but rather is an omnipresent driver for growth. ” - Commission Communication of March 2003 on Innovation Policy. The EU has placed innovation at the heart of its economic policy objectives since the mid 1990 s. This growing emphasis culminated in the new strategic goal - set by the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 - that the European Union (EU) should become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustaining economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion by the year 2010. The Commission Communication of March 2003 on Innovation policy sets out a vision of innovation which integrates diverse factors into a coherent whole. This whole will embrace scientifi c research, technology development, product design, marketing, organisation structure and training and development. It is against this model that the CC 7 countries must measure themselves. This study set out to examine and analyse the current framework conditions for innovation in the Helsinki group of candidate countries. This group consists of Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Slovak Republic and Romania, (the CC 7). It was the second of two such studies: the fi rst study was carried out during the period June 2000 to September 2001 and covered the so-called <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Group</b> (the CC 6).

40|$|Background: Life {{satisfaction}} of stroke survivors {{is known to}} be associated with socio-economic factors and the survivor’s and his/her caregiver’s quality of life, but their respective influence remains to be fully elucidated. Purpose: To analyse the stroke survivors’ life satisfaction 2 years after the event and its relationships with quality of life, socio-economic and stroke-related characteristics, and with informal caregivers’ life satisfaction and quality of life. Methods: Over 18 months, all stroke patients from Luxembourg and northeastern Portugal who lived at home were identified from the Inspection Générale de la Sécurité Sociale and hospital records, respectively. The clinical diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease was confirmed. We excluded all patients who declared that stroke did not result in neurological impairmentsat the time of stroke from the statistical analysis. The samples comprised 79 patients in Luxembourg and 48 in Portugal. Patients and the people they identified as their main caregivers were interviewed using validated questionnaires measuring life satisfaction, i. e. the Newcastle Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (Newsqol – 11 subscales), which identifies the areas affected by stroke among patients, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life – bref (Whoqol-bref – 4 subscales) of informal caregivers. Survivors without neurological impairment at the time of stroke were excluded. Data were analysed via multiple-regression models. Results: Life satisfaction was higher among women and lower among subjects with impaired motor functions. It was lower among Portuguese respondents with low-level education (< 12 th grade) and higher among those at work (37. 6 / 100). In Luxembourg, retired people had more life satisfaction than did working people (– 7. 9 / 100). Controlling for socio-economic factors, life satisfaction was associated with feelings- Newsqol (slope 0. 25) among Luxembourg residents, and with feelings-, mobility- and self-care-Newsqol (slopes 0. 24, 0. 27 and 0. 33, respectively) among Portuguese respondents. Life {{satisfaction of}} patients was strongly related to that offamily caregivers among the Portuguese respondents (slope 0. 66) but the relationship was moderate in Luxembourg (slope 0. 28). The survivors’ life satisfaction was not correlated with any Whoqol-bref domain in the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>group,</b> but was correlated with the Whoqol-bref psychological, social relationships and environment domains among the Portuguese respondents (slopes 0. 55, 0. 59 and 0. 51, respectively). Conclusions: The life satisfaction scale and the Newsqol stroke instrument, which identify areas of quality of life affected by stroke, are reliable patient-centred markers of intervention outcome. They can be used within the framework of medical follow-up (such as telephone assistance, clinical practice and prevention). Depending on the stroke survivor’s and the family caregiver’s habitual lifestyle and material circumstances, enhancement of a caregiver’s quality of life can help maintain the patient’s life satisfaction, particularly in a rural setting...|$|E

Starting from the 1995 Green Paper on Innovation, the EU has increasingly placed innovation at the heart of its’ economic policy objectives. This process culminated in the strategic goal set by the Lisbon European Council in March 2000, that the European Union (EU) should become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustaining economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion by the year 2010. In the candidate countries, during this period of intense policy action in favour of innovation, the attention of Governments and stakeholders was focused on building the necessary legislative, regulatory and institutional environment for a functioning market economy. Allied to regulatory reform, a significant effort has been undertaken to change corporate ownership structures, promote the creation of private enterprises and improve the functioning of industry and services with a view to meeting the competitive pressure of the Single European Market. Much of the growth achieved has been due to improved cost-efficiency by existing enterprises and through new activities introduced by foreign direct investors rather than by the creation of new local sources of entrepreneurial value and innovation. To sustain growth, however, Governments in the candidate countries now face the challenge of designing and adopting new more complex policy solutions. For most of the candidate countries, the issue is no longer about meeting the conditions for entry to the EU, but about identifying and mobilising factors enabling them to continuously improve the level of competitiveness of their economies. Innovation is a core element of knowledge-based economies and a major source of competitiveness. As highlighted in a recent report, innovation is diverse and pervasive. It is not just based on research or science and technology, or even on enterprise and ingenuity (entre- preneurial skill and knowledge). It also involves managerial and marketing skills, organisational, social, economic and administrative knowledge. The need to take account of the “diverse routes to innovation” has been explicitly recognised in the March 2003 Commission Communication “Innovation Policy: updating the Union’s approach in the context of the Lisbon Strategy”. Accordingly, it is in this context that the study set out to “examine and analyse the current framework conditions for selected innovation issues” in the CC 7. This report is the second of two studies examining the level of development of and the key challenges for innovation policy in the countries currently in the process of accession to the European Union. The first study was carried out during the period June 2000 to September 2001 and covered the so-called <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Group</b> (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia, or CC 6) 3. This second study was completed during the 15 -month period from October 2001 and concerns the so-called Helsinki group (Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Turkey, or CC 7). The analysis was carried out in parallel with the conclusion of the accession negotiations with 10 of the 13 candidate countries 4. In order to fulfil its remit, the study team carried out an exhaustive analysis of information and data on innovation performance and the policy framework for innovation in each of the candidate countries. This analysis takes into account the opinions and views of over 300 key stakeholders in the CC 7 (public authorities, innovation support organisations and the business community) collected at national level through interviews, an innovation policy workshop and an opinion survey. This executive summary is structured around six main challenges arising from the main findings of the study, illustrated by examples of policy development from the seven countries, and proposing a number of corresponding policy options.
