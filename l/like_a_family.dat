An outraged Chute Boxe refused to accept Coleman's backstage apology. The Chute Boxe team was assigned a yellow card for instigating this infraction.|$|E

25|$|Darwin {{was still}} researching and experimenting with his ideas on natural {{selection}} {{when he received}} a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace describing a theory very similar to his own. This led to an immediate joint publication of both theories. Both Wallace and Darwin saw the history of life <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> tree, with each fork in the tree’s limbs being a common ancestor. The tips of the limbs represented modern species and the branches represented the common ancestors that are shared amongst many different species. To explain these relationships, Darwin said that all living things were related, and this meant that all life must be descended from a few forms, or even from a single common ancestor. He called this process descent with modification.|$|E

[...] "The people asking the questions are not responsible for the ball flying out of the park", he explained. Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie-breaker.|$|E

Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a [...] "stunning building among those extraordinary voices". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> to her son, and that [...] "it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.|$|E

Picard was successfully able to show to Q that humanity could think outside of the confines of perception and theorize on new possibilities while still being prepared to sacrifice themselves {{for the sake of the}} greater good.

2500|$|Sociologist Yuko Kawanishi, in an interview, {{said that}} Japanese {{corporate}} culture has blocked {{the goal of}} a work-life balance: [...] "The men became slaves to the company which became <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>family.</b> People got sucked into the system and women {{had to take care of}} the home, in a kind of division of labour". Others argue that the demanding hours expected of employees in general force women out of the workplace. In 2006—according to one study—almost half of all Japanese women resigned from their jobs once they became pregnant with their first child, and of these women, less than 30% would go on to continue full-time work after childbirth. Critics say that this gendered split of the workforce only perpetuates the notion that women are meant to be homemakers and men the breadwinners.|$|E
