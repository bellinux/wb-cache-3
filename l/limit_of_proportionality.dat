The results show that the modulus of elasticity increases with increasing densification of the material, but decreases with the increasing thickness of the material.

The mechanical attempts were performed under the Copant standards in the  climatized conditions (12 %). To do so, about two thirds of the logs, with a diameter between 20 - 30 cm, were vaporized at 100 o C and 100 % of relative humidity for 20 hours, while  the  remaining  logs  were  kept  as  control.   From  each  log,  a  central plank radially directed with eight centimeter of thickness was taken, from which small beams of 8 cm x 8 cm were taken. Half of the small beams from the vaporized logs were once again submitted to vaporization under the same previously described conditions for a period of 3 hours, thus obtaining three different levels of comparison (control, vaporized on logs and presteaming wood). The results showed a remarkable reduction on the crushing strength in parallel compression to the fiber and shear strength (radial and tangential direction) with the vaporization on the two conditions and sources of Eucalyptus dunnii used.

Yet the legal status <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> in international law is far from clear. Two major international treaties—the Rome Statute and the 1978 Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention—address war crimes and provide distinct definitions {{of the crime of}} disproportionate use of force. Many of the world’s major military powers are not signatories to either treaty. Consequently, the only framework of legal accountability for alleged proportionality violations committed by those nations is customary international law.

Foram utilizadas 60 ratas albinas da variedade Wistar e divididas em 6 grupos experimentais. Um grupo foi utilizado como controle. Cinco grupos tiveram o membro {{posterior}} direito imobilizado por 14 dias consecutivos. Destes 5 grupos um foi submetido à morte logo após o período de imobilização, um foi liberado da imobilização permanecendo em gaiolas plásticas por 10 dias, outro foi submetido a técnica de alongamento passivo manual por 10 dias consecutivos, outro foi submetido a EENM por 10 dias consecutivos e o último foi submetido a EENM somado ao alongamento passivo manual por 10 dias consecutivos. Após os períodos de intervenção os animais foram mortos e em seguida realizados os ensaios mecânicos de tração longitudinal dos músculos. As propriedades mecânicas avaliadas foram a carga e alongamento no limite de proporcionalidade e no limite máximo, a rigidez e a capacidade de absorver energia na fase elástica (resiliência) do músculo, obtidas a partir das curvas carga versus alongamento. Observamos que a imobilização provocou redução significativa nos valores das propriedades mecânicas avaliadas no músculo gastrocnêmio. A remobilização por alongamento passivo manual devolveu ao músculo as propriedades de alongamento no limite de proporcionalidade, rigidez e resiliência a padrões controle, entretanto não foi capaz de restabelecer as propriedades de carga no limite de proporcionalidade, carga e alongamento no limite máximo. A remobilização constituída por EENM restabeleceu todas as propriedades estudadas a padrões controle.

We used sixty female albinic rats of the variety Wistar and divided them in 6 experimental groups. One of these groups was used as control. The animals of the five other groups had their right hind immobilized for 14 consecutive days. From the five groups, one was submitted to death right after the immobilization period, a second was set free from the immobilization remaining in plastic cages for 10 days, a third was submitted to the manual passive stretching technique for 10 consecutive days, a fourth was submitted to NMES for 10 consecutive days {{and the last one}} was submitted to NMES and manual passive stretching for 10 consecutive days. After the intervention periods, the animals were submitted to death and afterwards the mechanical tests of longitudinal traction of the muscles were done. The mechanical properties evaluated were the load and the stretching in the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> and in the maximum limit, the stiffness and the capacity to absorb energy in the elastic phase (resilience) of the muscle, obtained based on the curves load versus stretching.

Cellulose micro/ nanofibrils were produced using a mechanical defibrillator, and characterized for their morphology. Extruded composites were produced with 0. 5 to 1. 0 % (by mass) of micro/ nanofibrils and compared to unreinforced composites. Composites reinforced with 1. 0 % of micro/nanofibrils presented higher water absorption and apparent porosity than their counter parts.

40|$|This report gives {{theoretical}} {{discussion of}} the distribution of leads on rivets connecting a plate to a beam under transverse leads. Two methods of solution are given which are applicable to loads up to the limit of proportionality; in the first the rivets are treated as discrete members, and in the second they are replaced by a continuous system of jointing. A method of solution is also given which is applicable to the case when nonlinear deformations occur in the rivets and the plate, but not in the beam. The methods are illustrated by numerical examples, and these show that the loads carried by the rivets and the plate are less than the values given by classical theory, which {{does not take into account}} the slip of the rivets, even below the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality.</b> The difference is considerably accentuated when nonlinear deformations occur in the restructure and the beam then carries the greater portion of the bending moment. If the material of the beam has a higher proportional limit and a higher ultimate strength than the material of the plate, there is thus a transfer of load from weaker to stronger material, and this is to the advantage of the structure. The methods given are of simple application and are recommended for use in the design of light-alloy structures when the design lead is likely to be above the proportional limit...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} project {{was to determine the}} fatigue-life behaviour of AISI 1008 sheet steel which has been mechanically formed to a radius of curvature of 120 mm and then to correlate the fatigue-life behaviour to that of the parent or “as manufactured” material. During the forming process it was felt important to induce plastic strain through stretch-bending by clamping the sides of a plate sample’s (width) edges in the bending fixture before being bent by a single acting mechanical press. It was determined through actual testing that there was a decrease in fatigue-life when the mechanical formed data was compared to fatigue data of the parent material. Standard fatigue mathematical models were used to relate the actual fatigue data. Due to the material being cold formed to a radius of curvature of 120 mm, residual stresses induced during the forming process played an essential role during the fatigue-life prediction calculations. The maximum relieved stress in the parent material was compressive in nature having a magnitude of 11 percent of the “as manufactured” yield strength (265 MPa). For the mechanical formed material compressive residual stresses were measured on the outer surface while tensile stresses were measured on the inner surface. The difference between actual number of cycles to failure to that calculated using the standard mathematical models for the parent material, ranged between 48 percent and 18 percent and for the mechanical formed samples between 35 percent and 1 percent, depending on the strain amplitude used.
