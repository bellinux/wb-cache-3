25|$|Lewiston was a {{slow but}} {{steadily}} growing farm town throughout its early history. By the early-to-mid-19th century, however, as water power was being honed, Lewiston's location on the Androscoggin River would prove {{to make it a}} perfect location for emerging industry. In 1809, Michael Little built a large wooden sawmill next to the falls. Burned in 1814 by an arsonist, it was later rebuilt. In 1836, local entrepreneurs—predominantly the <b>Little</b> <b>family</b> and friends—formed the Androscoggin Falls Dam, Lock & Canal Company:...for the purpose of erecting and constructing dams, locks, canals, mills, works, machines, and buildings on their own lands and also manufacturing cotton, wool, iron, steel, and paper in the towns of Lewiston, Minot, and Danville.|$|E

When Carr finally produced a musical version, Allen was forced to file suit for payment from her work on the adaptation.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{was also}} {{associated}} with the editing process of the video. She was Renck's editing supervisor. Madonna wanted a raw documentary look for the video which allowed her to be portrayed more realistically. Regarding the making of [...] "Hung Up", Renck {{said that it was}} a massive work to undertake, [...] "It's like you form this <b>little</b> <b>family</b> that's flourished and prospered for the month, and then you chop it down like a tree, [...] You come out with a sense of yearning and longing, like, 'Can we just do that again?

Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E

It debuted at Los Angeles' Ahmanson Theatre before heading on to Broadway's Martin Beck Theatre. It was critically panned and induced accusations of racism from the Japanese-American community. That year, Lansbury was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame, and the following year appeared in a Mame revival at Broadway's Gershwin Theatre. Although Lansbury was praised, the show was a commercial flop, with Lansbury noting that [...] "I realised that it's not a show of today. It's a period piece." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Roush of TV Guide wrote favorably about [...] "At Long Last Leave", {{describing}} it as a [...] "keeper" [...] and highlighting the [...] "dazzling opening sequence". He concluded that The Simpsons [...] "once again delivers the goods, proving {{itself to be}} a classic for our age and for the ages." [...] Childs was less positive, writing that the episode is [...] "nothing special" [...] as [...] "all of the elements seem drawn from earlier stories" [...] and [...] "only {{a few of the}} jokes rise to the lowered bar of latter-day Simpsons humor." [...] He added, however, that [...] "nothing in the episode goes outrageously wrong, either. There is <b>little</b> <b>Family</b> Guy-style stupidity and randomness, the satire is gently pointed inward, and the guest star, while splashy for his controversiality, does not hijack the plot—instead appearing for a single joke before vanishing." [...] TIME critic James Poniewozik commented that [...] "At Long Last Leave" [...] was an [...] "all right" [...] episode, noting that certain gags felt [...] "forced by the writers’ room". Poniewozik, who thinks the quality of The Simpsons declined {{at the end of the}} 1990s, added however that [...] "a few moments made me bark out loud and realize why I loved the show in the first place." ...|$|E
500|$|For the 1981 season, Ferrari {{introduced}} {{their first}} turbo engined F1 car, the 126C, which produced tremendous power but was let down by its poor handling. Villeneuve was partnered with Didier Pironi who noted that Villeneuve [...] "had a <b>little</b> <b>family</b> [...] {{but he made}} me welcome and made me feel at home overnight... treated me as an equal in every way." [...] Villeneuve won two races during the season. At the Spanish Grand Prix Villeneuve kept five quicker cars behind him {{for most of the}} race using the superior straight-line speed of his car. After an hour and 46 minutes of racing Villeneuve led second-placed Jacques Laffite by only 0.22 seconds. Fifth-placed Elio de Angelis was only just over a second further back. Harvey Postlethwaite, who was hired by Ferrari to design the follow-on and much more successful 126C2 that won the Constructors' Championship in 1982, later commented on the 126C: [...] "That car...had literally one quarter of the downforce that, say Williams or Brabham had. It had a power advantage over the Cosworths for sure, but it also had massive throttle lag at that time. In terms of sheer ability I think Gilles was on a different plane to the other drivers. To win those races, the 1981 GPs at Monaco and Jarama — on tight circuits — was quite out of this world. I know how bad that car was." [...] At the 1981 Canadian Grand Prix Villeneuve damaged the front wing of his Ferrari and drove for most of the race in heavy rain with the wing obscuring his view ahead. There was a risk of being black flagged but eventually the wing became detached and Villeneuve drove on to finish third with the nose section of his car missing.|$|E

Darabont {{did not want to}} attempt conveying on screen the protagonist being involved in an extramarital affair. The characters in the film, portrayed by Thomas Jane and Laurie Holden respectively, instead share a more emotional relationship. Jane explained, [...] "We kind of form a <b>little</b> <b>family,</b> sort of surrogate family where my son and I'm a father and she becomes the mother to the son. We become a little unit as we're trying to get through this nightmare together." [...] Holden compared the nightmare to what refugees experienced at the Louisiana Superdome during Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
