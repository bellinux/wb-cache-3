500|$|The type {{species of}} the genus is the [...] Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila). For many years, the {{consensus}} was to recognise only two species of frigatebird, with larger birds as F. aquila and smaller as F. ariel. In 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews delineated five species, which remain valid. Analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA indicated that the five species had diverged from a common ancestor only recently—as little as 1.5 million years ago. There are two species pairs, the great and Christmas Island frigatebirds, and the magnificent and Ascension frigatebirds, while the fifth species, the <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird,</b> is an early offshoot of the common ancestor of the other four species. Three sub{{species of the}} lesser and five subspecies of the great frigatebird are recognised.|$|E
500|$|Frigatebirds {{are large}} slender mostly black-plumaged seabirds, {{with the five}} species similar in {{appearance}} to each other. The largest species is the magnificent frigatebird, which reaches [...] in length, with three of the remaining four almost as large. The <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> is substantially smaller, at around [...] long. Frigatebirds exhibit marked sexual dimorphism; females are larger and up to 25 percent heavier than males, and generally have white markings on their underparts. Frigatebirds have short necks and long, slender hooked bills. Their long narrow wings (male wingspan can reach [...] ) taper to points. Their wings have eleven primary flight feathers, with the tenth the longest and eleventh a vestigial feather only, and 23 secondaries. Their tails are deeply forked, though this is not apparent unless the tail is fanned. The tail and wings give them a distinctive 'W' silhouette in flight. The legs and face are fully feathered. The totipalmate feet are short and weak, the webbing is reduced and part of each toe is free.|$|E

50|$|The {{island is}} listed as a wetland of {{international}} importance under the Ramsar Convention on 17 March 1996, as Ramsar Site 797. The island has also been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports over 1% of the world populations of red-footed boobies, <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds</b> and common noddies. It has what is possibly the largest red-footed booby colony in the world as well as the second largest population of <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds</b> in Australian territory.|$|R
50|$|Other birds {{breeding}} on {{the islands}} include masked boobies, Australian pelicans, <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds,</b> eastern reef egrets, silver gulls, crested, bridled and lesser crested terns, common noddies, and pied and sooty oystercatchers. Visiting waders include grey-tailed tattlers, ruddy turnstones, great knots and greater sand plovers.|$|R
50|$|A south Atlantic {{population}} of <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds</b> (subspecies F. a. trinitatis) once bred on the archipelago of Trindade, 1100 km east of Brazil. The main island was once covered in forest but after this was destroyed, overgrazing by the introduced goats prevented any recovery. A series of eradication {{programs in the}} second half of the 20th century eliminated all the introduced vertebrates other than house mice. Feral cats that had seriously depleted ground nesting birds were finally eradicated in 1998. In 1975-1976 the American ornithologist Storrs Olson visited the island and reported seeing a small colony of 15 nests on a rocky islet just off the coast. Since this date there have been no further reports of <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds</b> nesting on the island.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> {{was first}} {{described}} as Atagen ariel by the English zoologist George Gray in 1845 from a specimen collected on Raine Island, Queensland, Australia. The <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> {{is one of}} five closely related species belonging to the genus Fregata. The other four are: the great frigatebird (Fregata minor), the Christmas frigatebird (Frigata andrewsi), the magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) and the Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila). The genus is {{the only member of the}} Fregatidae family.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} very similar to the other {{frigatebirds}} and is similarly sized to all but the <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird.</b> However, it lacks a white axillary spur, and juveniles show a distinctive diamond-shaped belly patch.|$|E
50|$|The 124 ha {{land area}} of the cays has been {{recognised}} by BirdLife International as the Coringa-Herald Reefs IBA because of its importance as a breeding site for seabirds.

40|$|International audienceEuropa Island {{is a major}} {{breeding}} place for green turtles (Chelonia mydas; 0. 7 to 2. 4 million juvenile turtles hatch there annually), Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor; 700 to 1100 breeding pairs), and <b>Lesser</b> <b>Frigatebirds</b> (Fregata ariel; 1000 to 1200 pairs). By visual observation, we quantified the proportions of males, females, and juveniles of both frigatebird species prospecting over the hatching sites and preying on hatchling turtles. Of 1828 juveniles observed hatching at daytime (35 separate turtle emergences), 1632 were immediately eaten by male Great Frigatebirds. Only 10 hatchlings were preyed upon by female Great Frigatebirds; the remaining 186 were captured by juvenile Great Frigatebirds. Such feeding behavior was not observed in <b>Lesser</b> <b>Frigatebirds.</b> We suggest that the sexual and species differences in hatchling turtle predation are due to size {{differences between the two}} species and between male and female Great Frigatebirds...|$|R
5000|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world populations of brown boobies (up to 12,000 breeding pairs) and <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds</b> (up to 7700 breeding pairs). [...] Large numbers of Australian pelicans and smaller numbers of eastern reef egrets, ospreys and white-bellied sea-eagles also breed on the islands.|$|R
50|$|The only {{breeding}} landbirds in {{the site}} are the purple swamphen and buff-banded rail.

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 20th century, 3% of all red-tailed tropicbirds in {{the world}} (some 400) bred there, as well as 9% of the global {{population}} of the <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> (about 8500, though only a part of these seem to be present at any one time).(Jones 2001) ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata ariel) is a seabird of the frigatebird family Fregatidae. At around 75 cm (30 in) in length, {{it is the}} {{smallest}} species of frigatebird. It occurs over tropical and subtropical waters across the Indian and Pacific Oceans as well as off the Atlantic coast of Brazil.|$|E
5000|$|The island’s masked boobies are of {{the western}} Indian Ocean {{subspecies}} (Sula dactylatra melanops), of which Tromelin is a stronghold. The red-footed boobies constitute the only polymorphic population in the region, indicating its biogeographical isolation. Both great and <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds</b> used to nest on the island. The breeding populations of both birds have since been extirpated, although they continue to use the island for roosting.|$|R
50|$|Migratory waders {{recorded}} in the islands include some regular visitors as well as vagrants. None breeds there. However, North Keeling is important for breeding seabirds, with sizeable numbers of red-footed boobies, great and <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds,</b> common noddies and white terns. Other breeding seabirds include wedge-tailed shearwaters, masked boobies, brown boobies, red-tailed and white-tailed tropicbirds, and sooty terns. It {{is possible that the}} herald petrel breeds there as well.|$|R
50|$|The island {{supports}} over 1,000 nesting {{pairs of}} brown boobies, {{making it one}} of the largest colonies in Western Australia. There are also over 1,000 nesting pairs each of common noddies and crested terns, 500-1,000 <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds,</b> 100-500 masked boobies, as well as lesser crested, roseate and sooty terns, silver gulls and white-bellied sea eagles. Many of these do not breed elsewhere in the Pilbara. The main breeding season comprises the winter months from May to September.|$|R
50|$|The Christmas frigatebird {{measures}} 89 - 100 cm in length, has a wingspan of 205 - 230 cm {{and weighs}} around 1550 g. The adult male {{of this species}} is easily identified, since it is all black except for a white belly patch. Other plumages resemble those of the smaller <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird,</b> but have whiter bellies and longer white underwing spurs.|$|E
50|$|The {{archipelago}} is {{the main}} nesting site of the green sea turtle in Brazil. There are also large numbers of breeding seabirds, including the endemic subspecies of the Great frigatebird (Fregata minor nicolli) and <b>Lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> (F. ariel trinitatis), {{and it is only}} Atlantic breeding site for the Trindade petrel. Humpback whales have been confirmed to use the Trindade island as a nursery.|$|E
50|$|Noteworthy fauna {{includes}} {{several species of}} seabirds, including the red-footed booby (Sula sula), great frigatebird (Fregata minor), <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> (F. ariel), black noddy (Anous minutus), white tern (Gygis alba), masked booby (Sula dactylatra), brown booby (S. leucogaster) and brown noddy (Anous stolidus). The Polynesian rat and the azure-tailed skink (Emoia cyanura), together with coconut crabs and green turtles, completes the known land fauna.|$|E
5|$|The Fregatidae are {{a sister}} group to Suloidea which {{consists}} of cormorants, darters, gannets, and boobies. Three of the five extant species of frigatebirds are widespread, (the magnificent, great and <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds)</b> while two are endangered (the Christmas Island and Ascension Island frigatebirds) and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each. The oldest fossils date to the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. Classified in the genus Limnofregata, the three species had shorter, less-hooked bills and longer legs, and lived in a freshwater environment.|$|R
40|$|Aldabra Atoll, {{a strict}} Nature Reserve and major {{breeding}} station of <b>lesser</b> and greater <b>frigatebirds,</b> may {{be developed for}} tourism. Determining whether this affects the frigate breeding populations is complicated by their extended annual laying seasons and the biennial breeding periodicity of individuals rearing fledgelings. This study, using a census method incorporating adjustments for seasonal changes in nest numbers, changes in nest ownership and replacement laying, indicates that {{there are at least}} 4000 pairs of greater frigatebirds and 6000 pairs of <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds</b> annually involved in breeding activities. There is some evidence that more male than female greater frigatebirds attempt to pair each season. Comparison with an earlier census suggests that severe human disturbance induces curtailment of laying seasons, major changes in nest distribution and prevents many birds from breeding...|$|R
50|$|The island hosts over 300,000 nesting seabirds {{of seven}} species. A large colony, {{dominated}} by lesser noddies, but including about 1300 pairs of brown noddies, is present from May to September during the south-east monsoon. During the north-west monsoon, the hill supports a breeding colony of wedge-tailed shearwaters. Year-round breeders include white and bridled terns, white-tailed tropicbirds and some 1000-1,500 pairs of Audubon's shearwaters. Several hundred great and <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds</b> use {{the island for}} roosting and can be seen soaring over it. Some waders are present throughout the year, the commonest being the ruddy turnstone. Common moorhens and striated herons also breed on the island.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} {{classified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area for its seabirds and waders. As well as breeding cormorants and Australian pelicans, globally important bird species breeding or staging {{on the island}} are <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> with 2000-5700 breeding pairs, brown booby with 1500-8500 breeding pairs, grey-tailed tattler with up to 5500 individuals, and red-necked stint with up to 4100 individuals.|$|E
5000|$|Cosmoledo is an Important Bird Area {{and holds}} Seychelles' largest colonies {{of all three}} species of booby that breed in Seychelles. The atoll holds the last viable {{population}} of brown booby, breeding mainly on South Island, with a few on West-North Island. It also has the Indian Ocean's largest population of red-footed booby censused by the Island Conservation Society as about 15,000 pairs. [...] Exploitation has wiped out the <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> and has almost done the same to the great frigatebird, which is down to just 15 pairs compared to hundreds of pairs in the 1970s. Despite this, hundreds of non-breeding frigatebirds of both species are to be seen, these being probably from Aldabra. The <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> also once bred but now may be extinct. Cosmoledo also has Seychelles' largest colony of sooty tern breeding on {{the northern end of}} Wizard Island. Second only to Aldabra are the numbers of breeding red-tailed tropicbird, black-naped tern and crested tern.|$|E
50|$|Malden is an {{important}} breeding island for about a dozen species including masked boobies (Sula dactylatra), red-footed booby (Sula sula), tropicbirds (Phaethontidae), great frigatebird (Fregata minor), <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebird</b> (Fregata ariel), grey-backed tern (Onychoprion lunata), red-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda), sooty terns (sterna fuscata) It is also {{an important}} winter-stop for the bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis), a migrant from Alaska; and other migratory seabirds (nineteen species in all).|$|E
50|$|The total world {{population}} {{is estimated to}} be several hundred thousand birds. At least 6,000 pairs breed on the Aldabra Islands in the Indian Ocean and another 15,000 pairs breed on islands off the north coast of Australia. The largest colonies are on the Phoenix Islands and Line Islands in the central Pacific Ocean. Nests placed on the ground are very vulnerable to predation by introduced species such as feral cats. The elimination of cats from Howland, Baker and Jarvis Islands has led to the reestablishment and growth of colonies. Baker Island had no nesting <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds</b> in 1965 but after the elimination of the feral cats on the island in around 1970 the birds returned and in 2002 16,200 individuals were recorded.|$|R
5000|$|Nine small cays, with a {{combined}} area of 9 ha, comprise the Swain Reefs Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because together they support over 1% of the world population of breeding roseate terns, and even larger numbers of non-breeding roseate terns, with up to 25,000 individuals recorded there. [...] Other birds recorded on the cays include masked and brown boobies, silver gulls, black-naped, sooty, bridled, greater crested, lesser crested and little terns, black and common noddies, and <b>lesser</b> <b>frigatebirds.</b> Cays supporting seabirds include Gannet Cay (1.7 ha), Bylund Cay (0.6 ha), Thomas Cay (1 ha), Bacchi Cay (0.5 ha), Frigate Cay (2 ha), Price Cay (1.6 ha), Distant Cay (0.25 ha), Riptide Cay (0.25 ha) and Bell Cay (1.5 ha).|$|R
40|$|International audienceCharacteristics of the {{tropical}} oceanic environment (low productivity, little seasonality) and poor diversity of tropical seabird foraging methods and prey relative to temperate and polar species suggest that tropical seabirds overall encompass a narrow range of isotopic niches, with large overlaps among species. To test this hypothesis, we examined the stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotopic composition of blood and feathers of 5 seabird species from Europa Island, Mozambique Channel. While differences were small, blood δ 13 C and δ 15 N values characterized 5 distinct and non-overlapping trophic niches during the breeding period. Seabirds used 2 distinct foraging areas (δ 13 C), one used by sooty tern Sterna fuscata and white-tailed tropicbird Phaethon lepturus and one used by red-footed booby Sula sula and great Fregata minor and <b>lesser</b> F. ariel <b>frigatebirds.</b> Seabird species overall encompassed less than 1 trophic level (δ 15 N), which is in agreement with a diet mainly based on flying fish and squid. Feather δ 13 C and δ 15 N values showed that the trophic structure of the community was different during the breeding and non-breeding (moulting) periods, suggesting {{a shift in the}} feeding ecology when adult birds were no longer central-place foragers. The stable isotope method underlined sex-related (red-footed booby) and age-related (great frigatebird immatures and adults) feeding strategies. It also suggested that breeding adults could feed themselves on different prey than those given to their chicks (sooty tern). Within {{the tropical}} pelagic ecosystem, seabirds overall shared the same trophic level as large predatory fishes (albacore, yellowfin and skipjack tunas), but they had lower δ 15 N values than the deeper-dwelling bigeye tuna and swordfish. We conclude that analyzing stable isotope values in blood and feathers appears to be a promising alternative method for investigating food and feeding ecology of tropical seabirds year round, and for determining sex- and age-related differences in their foraging strategies. A limitation of the method is the lack of information on marine isoscapes; future studies aimed at isotopically characterizing the tropical marine environment could help to associate consumer signatures to geographic origins...|$|R
