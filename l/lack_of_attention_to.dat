5|$|The {{conservative}} {{tradition of}} the mosque, with its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred {{with the introduction of}} printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.|$|E
5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice {{and opened the door}} for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E

5|$|Rupert's Land was ceded to Canada by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869 and {{incorporated}} into the Northwest Territories; a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Métis concerns caused Métis leader Louis Riel to establish a local provisional government {{as part of the}} Red River Rebellion. In response, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald introduced the Manitoba Act in the Canadian House of Commons, the bill was given Royal Assent and Manitoba was brought into Canada as a province in 1870. Louis Riel was pursued by British army officer Garnet Wolseley because of the rebellion, and Riel fled into exile. The Canadian government blocked the Métis' attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of Manitoba's entry into confederation. Facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from Ontario, large numbers of Métis moved to what would become Saskatchewan and Alberta.|$|E
5|$|The life {{expectancy}} of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop {{as a result of}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.|$|E
5|$|After the Second Test, McCabe was {{involved}} in an infamous incident that has caused speculation ever since. His captain Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, Bradman gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with a sizeable Irish Catholic minority that included McCabe often pitted against Anglicans and/or Protestants such as Bradman (of Anglo-Irish descent), particularly practitioners of Freemasonry, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. Four of the five Catholics in the team, McCabe, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Bradman denied having prior knowledge of the meeting, although the alleged infighting was reported in the press. Opening batsman Jack Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. During the meeting, players were variously accused of undermining Bradman's authority, laziness, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> fitness, but the board refused to specifically accuse those summoned. The details were leaked to the media, but the board denied that the meeting had taken place. Bradman denied that he was anti-Catholic, saying that O'Reilly and Fingleton wanted to depose him from the captaincy and install McCabe in his place.|$|E

25|$|South Africa {{also has}} a strong water {{industry}} with a track record in innovation. However, much less progress has been achieved on sanitation: Access increased only from 71% to 79% during the same period. Significant problems remain concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> maintenance. The uncertainty about the government's ability to sustain funding levels in the sector is also a concern.

40|$|Background Research {{involving}} {{the discovery of}} novel anticancer drugs and treatments hold precedence among the general public. However, investigating the etiology and epidemiology of malignancies can {{have a significant effect}} on reducing the prevalence of cancer in society. Under-standing risk factors that drive neoplastic development can provide educated individuals the opportunity to avoid such catalysts. Methods Literature searches were conducted on promi-nent magazine and newspaper sources to analyze the accuracy and relevance the material had toward cancer prevention. Additionally, two professionals involved in oncology were interviewed to gain a more personal view of the population’s knowledge on cancer awareness and prevention. Results The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> paid <b>to</b> the understanding of cancer and its subsequent prevention has resulted in fun-damental misconceptions that facilitate the development of neoplastic growths. Conclusions Addressing the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> paid <b>to</b> cancer awareness and prevention through proper education can {{have a significant effect on}} limiting the impact cancer has on society...|$|R
25|$|However, {{during the}} course of Barbarossa the {{logistical}} elements had been largely ignored. Chief of the General Staff, Hans Jeschonnek, since his days as chief of the operations staff, had opposed the notion that organisation, maintenance and logistics should be the responsibility of the General Staff. Instead, he proposed that the Staff be kept small and confined to operational matters. Supply and organisation were not the General Staff’s concern. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> logistical detail was apparent in German plans. Virtually no attention or organisation had been prepared for logistics in the Soviet Union. The Wehrmacht optimistically assumed that mechanised forces could advance into the country without major supply difficulties. Depending on railroad repair teams to mend the Soviet rail system, they believed they could finish the campaign after reaching Smolensk, using it as a jumping off point to capture Moscow. However, the units scheduled to repair rail communications lay at the bottom of German priorities.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Swedish parliament, Riksdagen, due to the secrecy issues raised during the trial that granted the two private individuals access to sensitive personal data. This bill did not pass, but in 2004, a new act on ethical review of research involving humans was introduced. Changes were put in place in order to strengthen the protection for human subjects participating in medical research and to expand the scope of the ethical councils, while bringing the Swedish legislation closer to the European Commission directive. The official act governing medical research was further adjusted in 2008: ethical review is now legally required in Sweden, the review committees have official status, and consent can be withdrawn by participants in medical research at any point. However, voices in the medical research community have raised concerns about law revisions' <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> additional safeguards for researchers falsely accused of scientific misconduct and are calling for procedures that would ensure that scientific misconduct investigations are handled in a correct and legally secure manner.|$|E
500|$|Until 1977, {{ethics rules}} {{prevented}} accounting and auditing firms from advertising to clients. When {{the rules were}} lifted, spending by the largest CPA firms on advertisements rose from US$4 million in the 1980s to more than $100million in the 2000s. Critics claimed that, by allowing the firms to advertise, the business side overstepped the professional side of the profession, {{which led to a}} conflict of interest. This focus allowed for occurrences of fraud, and caused the firms, according to Arthur Bowman, [...] "... to offer services that made them more consultants and business advisers than auditors." [...] As accounting firms became less interested in the lower-paying audits due to more focus on higher earning services such as consulting, problems arose.
