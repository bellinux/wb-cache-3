60|$|How it happened, Alice never knew, but {{exactly as}} {{she came to the}} <b>last</b> <b>peg,</b> she was gone. Whether she {{vanished}} into the air, or whether she ran quickly into the wood ('and she CAN run very fast!' thought Alice), there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to move.|$|E

If {{she would have}} her fish cooked properly in her own house, she could give him six times as much for half the money. And positively," [...] she continued, in inward speech, as the maid presented the bread and butter, [...] "Kipper's biscuit! I suppose {{she is going to}} let him provide her with everything, just as he does for those rich people on Maple Avenue." ...|$|E

No, you can believe what you like, but I'm satisfied at <b>last</b> that <b>Peg</b> is a witch and that skull of hers does tell her things. She told me father was coming home and he come!" ...|$|R

The player forced to push down the <b>last</b> remaining <b>peg</b> loses the game.|$|R
60|$|Lucy felt comforted {{without knowing}} why, and the piece went {{smoothly}} {{on to its}} <b>last</b> scene. <b>Peg</b> was just relinquishing the repentant husband to his forgiving wife with those brave words of hers, when a rending sound above their heads made all look up and start back; all but Lucy, who stood bewildered. Christie's quick eye saw the impending danger, and with a sudden spring she caught her friend from it. It was only a second's work, but it cost her much; for in the act, down crashed one of the mechanical contrivances used in a late spectacle, and in its fall stretched Christie stunned and senseless on the stage.|$|R

50|$|Wells {{was born}} at Yallum Station near Penola, South Australia {{and grew up in}} the Mount Gambier, South Australia district, and after a short stint in a merchants office, joined the South Australian Survey Department in October 1878. In 1883 the {{surveyor}} General, G.W. Goyder, offered him the Assistant Surveyor position to the Northern Territory and Queensland Border Survey Expedition, under Augustus Poeppel. This task took almost three years to complete, the honours of driving in the <b>last</b> <b>peg</b> being shared with assistant John Carruthers. and Wells spent {{the next couple of years}} working in the far north of S.A. and the N.T., surveying pastoral boundaries.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the Singaporean dollar was pegged to the British pound {{sterling}} {{at a rate}} of S$60 = £7. This <b>peg</b> <b>lasted</b> until the demise of the Sterling Area due to the Nixon Shock in the early 1970s, after which the Singaporean dollar was linked to the US dollar for a short time. As Singapore's economy grew and its trade links diversified to many other countries and regions, Singapore moved towards pegging its currency against a fixed and undisclosed trade-weighted basket of currencies from 1973 to 1985.|$|R
6000|$|... "Next mornin' two Piutes come down. They {{had lost}} mustangs {{up on the}} rocks. All the feed on my place was gone. There wasn't nothin' to do but try to git out. The Piutes said there wasn't no chance north--no water--no grass--an' so I decided to go south, if we could climb over thet <b>last</b> slide. <b>Peg</b> broke her leg there, an'--I--I had to shoot her. But we climbed out {{with the rest of}} the bunch. I left it then to the Piutes. We {{traveled}} five days west to head the canyons. No grass an' only a little water, salt at thet. Blue Roan was game if ever I seen a game hoss. Then the Piutes took to workin' in an' out an' around, not to git out, but to find a little grazin'. I never knowed the earth was so barren. One by one them hosses went down.... An' at last, I couldn't--I couldn't see Blue Roan starvin'--dyin' right before my eyes--an' I shot him, too.... An' what hurts me most now is thet I didn't have the nerve to kill him fust off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right, Peg, {{only you}} mustn't take it so hard. Things {{will work out}} all right. Homans and I were talking about that to-day. You see, Worry wants the boys to elect a captain soon. But perhaps he has not confided in you youngsters. He will suggest that you elect Homans or me. Well, I won't run for the place, so it'll be Homans. He's the man to captain us, that's certain. Graves thinks, though, that he can pull the wires and be elected captain. He's way off. Besides, Peg, he's making a big mistake. Worry doesn't like him, and when he finds out about this break in {{training}} we'll have a new third-baseman. No doubt Blake will play the bag. Graves is the only drag in Worry's baseball machine now, and he'll not <b>last....</b> So, <b>Peg,</b> don't think any more about it. Mind you, the whole team circles round you. You're the pivot, and as sure as you're born you'll be Wayne's captain next year. That's something for you {{to keep in mind}} and work for. If Graves keeps after you--hand him one! That's not against rules. Punch him! If Worry knew the truth he would pat you on the back for slugging Graves. Cheer up, Peg! Even if Graves has got all the kids on his side, which I doubt, Homans and I are with you. And you can just bet that Worry Arthurs will side with us.... Now run along, for I must study." ...|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the game}} was {{technically}} completed within a year, PopCap opted {{to spend more time}} to polish it, improving the visuals and background images. The team spent time refining the various sound effects used in the game, in order to provide an appropriate atmosphere. In some cases, they found the desired sound quickly; the sound of the ball hitting a peg was borrowed from another game in development at PopCap, but was considered perfect for Peggle. Other cases required iteration; the sound of the ball shooter was originally closer to that of a cannon, while a [...] "plunk" [...] sound effect was used when the ball catcher caught a ball. These were changed to more airy sounds (an air cannon and a brief angelic chorus) {{in order to make the}} elements sound as if part of the game's music. The team found it helped to create a defining moment at the end of each level when the player is moments from clearing the final peg. This initially was programmed as a simple message stating [...] "Extreme Fever" [...] and the music of Ode to Joy as a placeholder. Sidhu wanted to recreate the [...] "wild sounds and visuals" [...] that were present on winning pachinko games. However, the team found that the players reacted well to the simpler placeholder elements, and the team focused on improving the presentation of these, including adding a zoom on the current ball as it neared the <b>last</b> orange <b>peg</b> to be cleared.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} extensively investigated for in vivo nanomedical {{applications in the}} <b>last</b> decade. <b>PEG</b> coating improves the solubility and stability of the nanoparticles, and provides stealth properties by preventing opsonization and subsequent removal by the reticuloendothelial system. All these effects conferred by the PEG coating are dependent on its molecular weight. Therefore, {{the selection of the}} right MW of PEG is a crucial point in the design of new nanomaterials for in vivo applications. The aim of this work lies in the in vivo optimization of the circulation times of small iron oxide nanoparticles by coating them with PEG of different MWs. PEGylated small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (PEG-SPIONs), using PEG MWs ranging from 600 to 8000, were synthesized following a ligand exchange methodology, resulting in highly stable and water-soluble nanoparticles. Semi-quantitative and quantitative MRI studies allowed us to track the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of intravenously injected PEG-SPIONs (HD < 50 nm) in vivo up to one week. Results show that high MW PEGs (6000 – 8000) lead to nanoparticle aggregation and low MW PEGs (≤ 1500) are not able to stabilize the 6 nm iron oxide nanoparticles in physiological medium or confer stealth properties, thus leading to rapid recognition by the RES. In contrast, PEG 3000 -SPIONs show excellent in vivo behavior, they do not aggregate and they exhibit better stealth properties, giving rise to slower liver uptake and longer circulation times. In conclusion, 3000 Da {{turned out to be the}} optimal MW for the PEGylation of small nanoparticles (∼ 6 nm) designed for biomedical applications in which long circulation times together with moderate liver uptake are desirable...|$|R
2500|$|The Canadian Parliament {{passed the}} Uniform Currency Act in April 1871, tying up loose ends {{as to the}} {{currencies}} of the various provinces and replacing them with a common Canadian dollar. The gold standard was temporarily abandoned during the First World War and definitively abolished on April 10, 1933. At {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, the exchange rate to the U.S. dollar was fixed at C$1.10 = US$1.00. This was changed to parity in 1946. In 1949, sterling was devalued and Canada followed, returning to a peg of C$1.10 = US$1.00. However, Canada allowed its dollar to float in 1950, whereupon the currency rose to a slight premium over the U.S. dollar for the next decade. But the Canadian dollar fell sharply after 1960 before it was again pegged in 1962 at C$1.00 = US$0.925. This was sometimes pejoratively referred to as the [...] "Diefenbuck" [...] or the [...] "Diefendollar", after the then Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker. This <b>peg</b> <b>lasted</b> until 1970, after which the currency's value has floated.|$|R

6000|$|The {{traditional}} Arab proposed, in {{the traditional}} way, to run down Cheops, cross the eighth of a mile of sand intervening {{between it and the}} tall pyramid of Cephron, ascend to Cephron's summit and return to us on the top of Cheops--all in nine minutes by the watch, and the whole service to be rendered for a single dollar. In the first flush of irritation, I said let the Arab and his exploits go to the mischief. But stay. The upper third of Cephron was coated with dressed marble, smooth as glass. A blessed thought entered my brain. He must infallibly break his neck. Close the contract with dispatch, I said, and let him go. He started. We watched. He went bounding down the vast broadside, spring after spring, like an ibex. He grew small and smaller till he became a bobbing pigmy, away down toward the bottom--then disappeared. We turned and peered over the other side--forty seconds--eighty seconds --a hundred--happiness, he is dead already!--two minutes--and a quarter --"There he goes!" [...] Too true--it was too true. He was very small, now. Gradually, but surely, he overcame the level ground. He began to spring and climb again. Up, up, up--at last he reached the smooth coating--now for it. But he clung to it with toes and fingers, like a fly. He crawled this way and that--away to the right, slanting upward--away to the left, still slanting upward--and stood at <b>last,</b> a black <b>peg</b> on the summit, and waved his pigmy scarf! Then he crept downward to the raw steps again, then picked up his agile heels and flew. We lost him presently. But presently again we saw him under us, mounting with undiminished energy. Shortly he bounded into our midst with a gallant war-whoop. Time, eight minutes, forty-one seconds. He had won. His bones were intact. It was a failure. I reflected. I said to myself, he is tired, and must grow dizzy. I will risk another dollar on him.|$|R
