40|$|Continuously porous {{hydroxyapatite}} (HAp) /t-ZrO 2 composites containing concentric <b>laminated</b> <b>frames</b> and microchanneled {{bodies were}} fabricated by an extrusion process. To investigate the mechanical properties of HAp/t-ZrO 2 composites, the porous composites were sintered at different temperatures using a microwave furnace. The microstructure {{was designed to}} imitate that of natural bone, particularly small bone, with both cortical and spongy bone sections. Each microchannel was separated by alternating lamina of HAp, HAp–(t-ZrO 2) and t-ZrO 2. HAp and ZrO 2 phases existed {{on the surface of}} the microchannel and the core zone to increase the biocompatibility and mechanical properties of the HAp-ZrO 2 artificial bone. The sintering behavior was evaluated and the optimum sintering temperature was found to be 1400 °C, which produced a stable scaffold. The material characteristics, such as the microstructure, crystal structure and compressive strength, were evaluated in detail for different sintering temperatures. A detailed in vitro study was carried out using MTT assay, western blot analysis, gene expression by polymerase chain reaction and laser confocal image analysis of cell proliferation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} activities {{developed by}} the authors within the EC funded research program named FACE (Friendly Aircraft Cabin Environment) aimed at characterising some aeronautical composite structural components from the vibro-acoustic behaviour point of view. In this document will be also presented the overall analysis of a carbon resin primary fuselage structure from low to medium-high frequency range. Vibro-acoustic behaviour is simulated by means of numerical predictive methods. The modelling techniques are shown {{with reference to the}} simulation of dynamic behaviour of panels coupled with a fluid volume, in order to predict Transmission Loss properties. Particularly, the models and results have been referred to a typical aeronautical structure for fuselage: 4 bay fuselage side panel, made of skin, stringers and frames. The first test article consists in a composite panel that has been modeled numerically and tested in order to characterize its vibro-acoustic behaviour. It is a curved panel, global dimensions of 2. 2 m x 1. 5 m, where the skin is a pre-preg composite <b>laminate,</b> <b>frames</b> are Z-section pre-preg composite laminate and stringers are T-section braided tube with a pre-preg offset bulb. Numerical simulations have been carried on, in order to reproduce the vibrations and noise transmission: in low frequency range by means of Finite Element Method (FEM), and in medium-high frequency range by means of Statistical Energetic Analysis (SEA). For what concerning the FEM dynamic analysis the mesh size values of the elements are consistent with the maximum frequency chosen. According to the procedures described in the work, a FEM model has been built, having 9266 nodes and 14069 elements; the skin has been modeled with shell elements; the frames have been modeled with beam elements and stringers have been split, modeling the stringer foot with shell elements, web and bulb with beam elements. The MSC/NASTRAN has been used throughout the F. E. calculations of this article. The numerical modal analysis has been performed in [0 - 2000] Hz frequency range, considering panel as free-free suspended. For what concerning the SEA, the modelling approach employed has been a mixed “ribbed plate“ – “subsystem” approach. Source and receiving rooms have been modelled as acoustic cavities subsystems with one of the enclosing faces of each room corresponding with the panel area and geometry. Correlation between numerical and experimental modal analysis results has been used in order to validate numerical FEM models, while energetic parameters (mean square velocity) and modal density have been used for SEA models validation. Subsequently, model sensitivity has been analysed by varying some geometrical parameters critical from an acoustic point of view. Results confirm the theory at the basis of noise transmission and give some important information about the composite materials behavior used in primary structures in place of well known metallic materials. Final result of the work is the model of a fuselage section assembled by mixing many Graphite Fibres Reinforced Panels layups...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a limited}} number of {{in-plane}} shear racking tests in the field of glass facades design and the designer is sometimes faced with the lack of knowledge about their actual in-plane behavior. This is particularly important for the glass facades exposed to the seismic load, which imposes story drifts to the main structure and hence to the glass panels which can pose a significant risk to users. The dissertation presents an innovative composite shear panel composed of <b>laminated</b> timber <b>frame</b> and a double heat strengthened laminated glass, which has the function of taking over of the horizontal loads. The contact between timber frame and glass panel is made adhesiveless which consequently enables sliding of glass panels within timber frame. We conducted six monotonous and six cyclic quasi-static racking tests in the laboratory of the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering, University of Ljubljana. Full dynamic tests have been also conducted at earthquake institute IZIIS in Skopje for two parallel composite shear panels for different earthquake acceleration records. For detailed analysis and understanding of the behavior of the considered composite shear panels, we carried out a series of complementary experiments to capture the response of laminated glass to bending and compression loads, the development of friction force between timber and glass, load bearing capacity of different joint details and mechanical characteristics of the timber frame. Three different types of composite shear panel specimens are tested for three possible boundary conditions. For the interpretation of the hysteresis response we upgraded software HISPA+, which enables us to evaluate ductility, stiffness degradation and the equivalent viscous damping coefficients. The results are showing robust behavior of tested panels and particularly high energy dissipation level due to the friction between the glass panels and timber frame. Simplified bilinear model for the displacement response {{at the top of the}} composite panel is introduced which was later used in the analysis of the simplified three stories timber frame model for evaluating of the stabilizing effect on the frame structure. The results are showing that considered composite panels have high potential in sharing of the earthquake imposed load where one must be aware of the fact that further parametric analysis must be done for broader acceptance of this statement...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, vernacular {{buildings}} were constructed {{based upon a}} deep understanding of the surroundings and the features of locally sourced materials. This wisdom led to a rational building composition and appropriate material selection, which ensured adequate living conditions and proper building life cycle, without any advanced technologies. In the discussion about reducing {{the environmental impacts of}} a building, there should be useful ideas to be taken from traditional solutions for the further development of modern buildings. A life cycle perspective is nowadays becoming more significant for comprehensive building analysis as the distribution of the environmental impacts over a building life cycle change. In such a context, building material selection is an important factor. Wood products have lately attracted attention as promising construction materials due to their unique environmental properties. This study investigated the optimal use and development of wood products in sustainable construction in comparison to other building materials, based on life cycle assessment method. With regard to learning from vernacular buildings, a holistic analysis of wood in construction was carried out. In this dissertation, first the methodological issues relating to the fair assessment of wood products and wood construction based on the current normative standards and assessment data were discussed. Secondly, wood in sustainable construction was discussed according to ten principles in terms of appropriate building material selection over the building life cycle. This study demonstrated that there are both strengths and weakness to the use of wood in sustainable construction. In this sense, the importance of diverse perspectives to building materials has been highlighted. It was also discussed that wood may contribute to the environment more positively when it is used more. A reduction in consumption (e. g. energy) and emissions (e. g. CO 2) has thus far been the principle behind mitigating environmental impacts. In this context, for instance, a CLT (Cross <b>laminated</b> timber) <b>framed</b> building would not be preferable since it requires a large amount of wood, resulting in high embodied energy. However, on the other hand, that gives significant environmental benefits (e. g. energy recovery) to the building. In this case, by optimising the weaknesses (high embodied energy) and maximising the strengths (environmental benefits), the greater use of wood may improve the environmental profile of a building. This would be a paradigm shift from the current approach to the environmental problems. In that sense, wood seems to have significant potential. It would be important to consider a specific approach and use for wood in construction based upon the proper understanding of their characteristics as practiced in traditional buildings...|$|R
