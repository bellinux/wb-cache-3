25|$|With {{technological}} innovations, {{new applications}} and shorter product lifetimes {{there is an}} ever increasing quantity of waste electrical and electronic equipment. The environmental pressures associated with this are well documented and include material and energy losses {{and an increase in}} air, water and <b>land</b> <b>pollution</b> from waste treatment methods. The incorrect disposal and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment also poses threats to human health, particularly when involving illegal exports.|$|E

This once again is a huge health hazard and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; however, they also work with the Zabbaleen (or Zabaleen), a community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste {{since the turn of the}} 20th century and live in an area known locally as Manshiyat naser. Both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.|$|E

30|$|Population, {{resources}} and environments have significantly impacted {{the development of}} human society. With the advancement of industrialization, the exploration of mineral resources {{plays an important role}} in production of food and materials. By the statistics, over 95  % of energy, over 80  % of industrial raw materials and over 70  % of agricultural production materials come from mineral resources (Yan et al. 1992), supporting the operation of 70  % of national GDP (Li 2004). However, over exploration of mineral resources exceeds the ability of self-renewal and recovery of nature, causing formation of gobs, surface subsidence, surface cracks, <b>land</b> <b>pollutions</b> and <b>land</b> occupation, etc. (Zhang et al. 2007). One of obvious external indications is characterized by changes of land use patterns. The changes also cause one of the most profound human-induced alterations of the earth’s system (Vitousek et al. 1997), mainly including shaping of native and semi-natural vegetation (McIntyre and Lavorel 2007).|$|R
