40|$|The <b>Local</b> <b>Clearance</b> Triangulation (LCT) of {{polygonal}} obstacles is a cell decomposition {{designed for}} the efficient computation of locally shortest paths with clearance. This paper presents a revised definition of LCTs, new theoretical results and optimizations, and new algorithms introducing dy-namic updates and robustness. Given an input obstacle set with n vertices, a theoretical analysis is proposed showing that LCTs generate a triangular decomposition of O(n) cells, guaranteeing that discrete search algorithms can compute paths in optimal times. In addition, several examples are pre-sented indicating {{that the number of}} triangles is low in practice, close to 2 n, and a new technique is described for reducing the number of triangles when the maximum query clearance is known in advance. Algorithms for repairing the <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> property dynamically are also introduced, lead-ing to efficient LCT updates for addressing dynamic changes in the obsta-cle set. Dynamic updates automatically handle intersecting and overlapping segments with guaranteed robustness, using techniques that combine one exact geometric predicate with adjustment of illegal floating point coordi-nates. The presented results demonstrate that LCTs are efficient and highly flexible for representing dynamic polygonal environments with clearance information...|$|R

ISSN 1175 - 396 X Why do I need a Customs <b>clearance</b> for <b>imported</b> goods? All imported goods arriving in New Zealand are {{required by law to}} be cleared through the New Zealand Customs Service. Imported goods are subject to security requirements and the payment of import duty and GST charges. Customs undertakes security screening and collects revenue charges on behalf of the New Zealand Government. What is a Customs <b>clearance?</b> A Customs <b>import</b> <b>clearance</b> refers to the procedure where the importer of the goods is required to lodge an electronic declaration (import entry) covering the particulars of their imported goods, the payment of any revenue charges due and subsequent formal release of those goods by Customs. What is the procedure for clearing commercial import consignments? An electronic entry must be lodged, either over the Internet at www. customsentry. govt. nz, or using EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) software. In some cases, importers may also be asked to provide additional information such as: • An airwaybill or bill of lading. • Invoices. • Other documents, such as packing lists, or insurance certificates. Importers may also need to contact shipping companies, airlines or freight forwarders for advice on their requirements, operating hours and/or location of the goods. How do I lodge a Customs import entry? Import entries may be lodged over the Internet or via EDI. Many importers use their freight forwarder or a Customs broker to lodge <b>import</b> <b>clearances</b> on their behalf, as they generally already have EDI software, and are familiar with Customs legal requirements. Using EDI EDI users are required to: • Develop or purchase EDI software which contains features necessary to transmit clearance messages and receive responses. • Test proper functionality with Customs prior to use. • Pay for the EDI link and associated messaging costs. Thus EDI is generally more suitable for higher-frequency users.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} efficiently computing optimal paths of arbitrary clearance from a polygonal representation of a given virtual environment. Key to the proposed method is {{a new type of}} triangulated navigation mesh, called a <b>Local</b> <b>Clearance</b> Triangulation, which enables the efficient and correct determination if a disc of arbitrary size can pass through any narrow passages of the mesh. The proposed approach uniquely balances speed of computation and optimality of paths by first computing high-quality locally shortest paths efficiently in optimal time. Only in case global optimality is needed, an extended search will gradually improve the current path (if not already the global optimal) until the globally shortest one is determined. The presented method represents the first solution correctly extracting shortest paths of arbitrary clearance directly from a triangulated environment...|$|R

40|$|CSF {{is thought}} to flow {{continuously}} {{from the site of}} production in the ventricles into interconnected spaces; i. e. cisterns and subarachnoid spaces (SASs). Since the SAS of the optic nerve is defined by a cul-de-sac anatomy, it is not evident how local CSF might recycle from that region to the general SAS. The concept of free communication of CSF has recently been challenged by the description of a concentration gradient of beta-trace protein, a lipocalin-like prostaglandin d-synthase (L-PGDS), between the spinal CSF and that in the SAS of the optic nerve, indicating diminished <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> or <b>local</b> overproduction of L-PGDS here. In fact, computed cisternography with a contrast agent in three patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and asymmetric papilloedema demonstrate a lack of contrast-loaded CSF in the SAS of the optic nerve despite it being present in the intracranial SAS, thus suggesting compartmentation of the SAS of the optic nerve.

Thrombin and fibrinolysis inhibitor activity in tissue extracts also were measured. In TI mice fibrin was detected perivascularly by 6 weeks after infection and at 8 weeks {{it was found}} over the granulomas as they developed. Fibrin was cleared {{from the center of}} granulomas by 10 weeks. Thrombin inhibitor activity increased at 4 to 6 weeks but declined below control levels later as granulomas formed. Fibrinolysis inhibitor activity, on the other hand, peaked at 9 to 12 weeks after infection. In AT mice extensive fibrin deposition was detected in the liver throughout the period when smaller and incomplete granulomas developed. Central clearing did not occur. Thrombin inhibitor activity greatly increased by 8 weeks after infection but fibrinolysis inhibitor activity remained unchanged. These findings suggest that fibrin deposition and fibrinolysis are orderly events regulated in the lesions by proteinases and their inhibitors and this seems to be a general tissue reaction in the early stage of chronic granuloma formation. Since <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> of fibrin in vivo and fibrinolysis inhibitor activity from tissue extracts studied in vitro are more evident in TI mice than in AT mice, it appears that T cell function is important in modulating the tissue response during granulomatous inflammation...|$|R
40|$|In these {{patients}} {{the sequence of}} events is probably as follows: upper respiratory tract colonization occurs early as described above, and is followed by aspiration of organisms into the lower respiratory tract. Aspiration of pharyngeal content during sleep is frequent in healthy adults and becomes very common when consciousness is depressed (Huxley et ai, 1978). Impaired mucociliary clearance allows the organism to persist and penetrate to the alveolus. Multiplication and tissue invasion then occur because alveolar macro-phage clearance and immune function are depressed. Pseudomonas is thus able to reach its full potential as an opportunistic patho-gen. Mortality in initial reports was over 70 % although with better treatment this may be reduced (McKendrick & Geddes, 1981). Treatment with an aminoglycoside and certain /Mactam antibiotics can be successful but the underlying state of the patient is probably the most important factor. Newer antibiotics such as ceftazidime are at present being evaluated. Pseudomonas infections of the respiratory tract provide a rare opportunity to study pulmonary host defences. The range of disease from simple colonization to fatal pneumonia demonstrates the importance of both <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> mechanisms and systemic defences, and furthermore empha-sizes that the host {{is by far the most}} impor-tant variable in the confrontation.

40|$|National audienceIn {{the western}} part of Morocco, various studies deal with land use (LU) mapping and analysis. However, no {{quantitative}} or qualitative analysis has been focused on the interrelations between mass wasting (MW) and LU. This paper is centered on the mapping in the NW Morocco (Chefchaouen province) to define different LU classes and their consequences for slope stability. Seven classes of LU were mapped: dense forests, shrubs or matorrals, reforestation areas, farmlands, naked areas, urban zones and free water bodies. Four major types of MW occur within this region: landslides, rock falls, debris flows and undercutting. Badlands (BL) do not belong to MW but are characterized by successive thalweg and crests resulting from linear erosion, also responsible for the loss in farmlands. Therefore, their location and extension are analyzed. The analysis of the spatial distribution of MW according to LU classes demonstrated that high densities of MW and BL classes cover three main LU classes: farmlands include 45 % of MW and BL; dense forest's areas reach up to 24 % of the phenomena, commonly due to an important <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> of vegetation; shrubs are concerned by 11 % of the MW only, in conformity with the discrete character of their plant cover.

There is typically tachycardia and raised plasma norepinephrine levels on upright posture, but little or no orthostatic hypotension. The pathophysiology of OI {{is believed to be}} very heterogeneous. Most studies of the syndrome have focused on abnormalities in norepinephrine release. Here the hypothesis that abnormal norepinephrine transporter (NET) function might contribute to the pathophysiology in some patients with OI was tested. In a proband with significant orthostatic symptoms and tachycardia, disproportionately elevated plasma norepinephrine with standing, impaired systemic, and <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> of infused tritiated norepinephrine, impaired tyramine responsiveness, and a dissociation between stimulated plasma norepinephrine and DHPG elevation were found. Studies of NET gene structure in the proband revealed a coding mutation that converts a highly conserved transmembrane domain Ala residue to Pro. Analysis of the protein produced by the mutant cDNA in transfected cells demonstrated greater than 98 % reduction in activity relative to normal. NE, DHPG/NE, and heart rate correlated with the mutant allele in this family. CONCLUSION: These results represent the first identification of a specific genetic defect in OI and the first disease linked to a coding alteration in a Na+/Cl(-) -dependent neurotransmitter transporter.
