25|$|The oldest, {{still working}} planetarium {{can be found}} in the Dutch town Franeker. It was built by Eise Eisinga (1744–1828) in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house. It took Eisinga seven years to build his planetarium, which was {{completed}} in 1781.|$|E
500|$|On Election Night, {{the first}} returns {{came in from}} Sable Island, Nova Scotia. Usually a Liberal stronghold, the handful of {{residents}} there favoured the Tories by two votes. St. Laurent listened to the election returns on a radio in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home on [...] in Quebec City, and when the radio broke, moved to an upstairs television set. Diefenbaker began the evening at his house in Prince Albert, and once his re-election to the Commons was certain, moved to his local campaign headquarters.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, West began {{recording}} {{his seventh}} studio album with collaborators, including No I.D. and DJ Khaled. The first recordings {{were held in}} January 2013, in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personal loft at a Paris hotel, {{referred to in the}} album's credits as the [...] "No Name Hotel". West kept compositions simple in order to hear the tracks more clearly; too much bass or complexity would simply overpower the room's poor acoustics. The beats emanating from the loft space, which sometimes lasted through the night, provoked complaints from neighbors. Reports emerged that he and his then-girlfriend Kim Kardashian had moved to the loft in order for West to begin work on the album.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, {{the home}} was owned by Fred Pfister (who named it [...] "Riverwind"). Fred had {{previously}} owned the equally historic Fell House in nearby Allendale, New Jersey. Fred died in July 1969 and his wake {{was held in the}} majestic 60-foot-long <b>living</b> <b>room</b> because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> deep love <b>of</b> this beautiful home. His family lived there until 1972.|$|R
50|$|Walker {{slept on}} the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>his</b> high school friend and current {{production}} partner David Ballard’s apartment. He spent most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time writing to the songs Ballard produced and started selling CDs again to make a living. It was during this time where he met his current manager Askia Fountain (Timeless Entertainment). Fountain was immediately impressed with Walker’s sound and became his manager on the spot.|$|R
60|$|Captain Lee {{was in a}} sound sleep, {{but quickly}} roused up when told that an {{important}} message awaited him. He met the party in one <b>of</b> the <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the fort. <b>His</b> head was tied up in a wet towel, and his eyes showed that he was suffering.|$|R
2500|$|In September 2007, in Ohio, 16-year-old Daniel Petric snuck out of {{his bedroom}} window to {{purchase}} the game Halo 3 against the orders of his father, a minister at New Life Assembly of God in Wellington, Ohio, U.S. His parents eventually banned him from the game after he spent up to 18 hours a day with it, and secured it in a lockbox in a closet where the father also kept a 9mm handgun according to prosecutors. In October 2007, Daniel used his father's key to open the lockbox and remove the gun and the game. He then entered the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house and shot both {{of them in the}} head, killing his mother and wounding his father. Petric was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole, which was later commuted to 23 years in prison. Defense attorneys argued that Petric was influenced by video game addiction. The court dismissed these claims. The judge, James Burge, commented that while he thought there was ample evidence the boy knew what he was doing, Burge thought the game had affected him like a drug, saying [...] "I firmly believe that Daniel Petric had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents they would be dead forever." ...|$|E
60|$|Frederick was abstemious. A {{glass of}} wine at dinner was his wildest excess. Three cigars a day he {{permitted}} himself, and these he smoked either on the broad veranda or in the smoking room. What else was a smoking room for? Cigarettes he detested. Yet his brother was ever rolling thin, brown-paper cigarettes and smoking them wherever he might happen to be. A litter of tobacco crumbs was always {{to be found in}} the big easy chair he frequented and among the cushions of the window-seats. Then there were the cocktails. Brought up under the stern tutelage of Isaac and Eliza Travers, Frederick looked upon liquor in the house as an abomination. Ancient cities had been smitten by God's wrath for just such practices. Before lunch and dinner, Tom, aided and abetted by Polly, mixed an endless variety of drinks, she being particularly adept with strange swivel-stick concoctions learned at the ends of the earth. To Frederick, at such times, it seemed that his butler's pantry and dining room had been turned into bar-rooms. When he suggested this, under a facetious show, Tom proclaimed that when he made his pile he would build a liquor cabinet in every <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house.|$|E

5000|$|In 1940 Fletcher Pratt's Naval War Game {{was first}} published. The game started in New York, but other clubs formed around the US. Jack Coggins was invited by Pratt to participate, and {{recalled}} that Pratt's game involved dozens of tiny wooden ships—built to {{a scale of}} about one inch to 50 feet—spread over the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>his</b> apartment. Their maneuvers {{and the results of}} their battles were calculated via a complex mathematical formula, with scale distances marked off with tape measures. The game's popularity grew and moved to using a ballroom for games with 60 or more players per side. The game was respected by the Naval War College and serving naval officers regularly participated in games For an evaluation of the Fletcher Pratt Game versus reality see Chapter 10 of The Fletcher Pratt Naval Wargame book. link ...|$|R
5000|$|Producer Greg Kurstin had a {{particular}} influence on Port of Morrow, encouraging Mercer to experiment in the studio. During the recording, Mercer was commuting each week, flying from Portland to Los Angeles to record with producer Greg Kurstin at his studio. Mercer brought songs written {{as far back as}} 2007, such as [...] "Simple Song," [...] which was written on the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former house. Former Shins bandmates Marty Crandall and Dave Hernandez appear as guest musicians on Port of Morrow. Feeling that both musicians have a certain tone and style that would suit a song, Mercer simply called them up to ask regardless of any possible acrimony. While working on the album, Mercer felt he might have waited too long to record a follow-up, fearing that he might be in a similar situation as The Stone Roses, whose reputation fell hard when they waited five years to record a sophomore record.|$|R
5000|$|However, it {{does not}} stop him. At the school's library, and while writing a history paper on the library computer, Justin goes {{to the extent of}} using it to access porn (using his USB Drive). Eventually, he gets caught hacking the {{internet}} firewall by the school librarian, leading to his suspension from the swim team and being placed on overall probation. Later, after fantasizing while trying to sleep, Justin sneaks out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bedroom to use the computer in the <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> in defiance <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grounding. He then continues to surf the web for more porn, eventually racking up extensive bills on his parents' credit cards.|$|R
5000|$|Derek Round {{was murdered}} in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own home in Whanganui, New Zealand. His body {{was found on the}} morning of May 17, 2012. Police {{described}} his death as violent, reporting as follows: [...] "Although I can't go into details at this stage the results would indicate a horrific attack on Derek, which took place in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home", detective Senior Sergeant Dave Kirby of Whanguanui CIB said. Inquiries are continuing. Later it was announced that Derek died due to several violent blows to the head.|$|E

50|$|Approached by friend Rula Lenska, Hodges {{agreed to}} {{decorate}} a life size fibre-glass baby elephant for the London Elephant Parade 2010. For him, {{this was a}} huge step outside his chosen art medium. He was {{very pleased with the}} ideas that came to him and after removing the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> door <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Brixton home to get the elephant in he lived with the elephant painstakingly realising his ideas. Since the parade was based in London he chose to add a splash of blue by painting the River Thames across the elephant with each side adorned in ripped parts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own prints. The shape of the river twisting through London is also famous because of the opening credits of the British soap opera EastEnders, which Hodges felt appropriate since his friend Lenska had appeared in this show and another collector Pam St Clement has starred in it for many years. He admits that working in collage and media such as PVA glue were outside his experience. One side of the elephant is a complicated collage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> prints while the other, is humorously and more simply designed around meerkats taken from his drawing Family (2005).|$|R
