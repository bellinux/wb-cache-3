40|$|Objective: Minor Head Injury (MHI) {{patients}} should not cause severe sequelae. In fact, many studies had reported that some MHI patients had abnormal scan, clinical deterioration, {{and many of}} them have had neurosurgical intervention. This study analyzed correlations between clinical signs with abnormal scan, clinical deterioration and surgery intervention on minor head injury patients. Methods: A series of 364 MHI patients were prospectively enrolled in this study. In all cases clinical data were collected and a CT Scan was obtained. The relationship between clinical findings (<b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>conciousness,</b> amnesia, seizure, vomiting, headache, cepalhameatome, skull fracture, age more than 60 years),were identified as independent risk factors in correlations to abnormal scan, clinical deterioration and surgery intervention using bivariate and logistic regression multivariate analytics with 95 % CI. Results: the incidence of abnormal scan was 13. 8 % (48 patients), 3. 3 % (12 patients) with clinical deterioration, and incidence of surgery intervention was 3. 8 % (14 patiens). Lost of conciousness, amnesia, cepalhematoma, skull fracture, and age more than 60 years old are independent variabels had statistically significant with abnormal scan. Amnesia, cepalhematome, skull fracture are independent variables which had statistic significantly with clinical deterioration and surgical intervention. Conclusions: Clinical variables which had statistic significantly can be used as predictors of abnormal scan, clinical deterioration, and surgical intervention.

This study was executed {{to find out the}} correlation between the brain CT scan image findings and its clinical impairment among the mild head trauma patients with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15. The study was a retrospective study by analyzing the uniform medical records of the head trauma patients hospitalized at the Neurology ward of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital within the period of 1999 to 2001. During that period 1, 663 patients were hospitalized due to head trauma, and 1, 166 of them (70. 1 %) were suffered from mild head trauma patients with GCS score of 13 - 15. Among those with brain CT scan examinations (N: 271), the neurological abnormalities were found on 144 (53. 1 %) of patients, consisted of cerebral edema (11, 4 %), intracerebral hemorrhage (5. 5 %), epidural hemorrhage (16. 2 %), subdural hemorrhage (18. 1 %), subarachnoid hemorrhage (5. 5 %), and combination (13. 8 %). The further analysis showed that cranial nerves disturbance, amnesia, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>conciousness</b> for more than 10 minutes, and vomiting are significantly correlated to the brain CT scan abnormality. Combination of the above four clinical signs and symptoms have sensitivity of 90 % in predicting brain insults.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{a history of}} remote head injury as {{a risk factor for}} subsequent dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: 271 participants of a community based longitudinal study of aging in north Manhattan without evidence of significant cognitive impairment were interrogated for a history of head injury on two occasions at entry into the study. The examining physician sought a history of head injury with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>conciousness.</b> Independently, a risk factor interviewer inquired about a history of head injury with loss of consiousness or amnesia, the duration of any loss of consiousness, and the date of the head injury. Patients were followed up with standardised annual evaluations for up to five years to determine the first occurrence of dementia. RESULTS: Over the course of the study incident dementia due to probable or possible Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed in 39 patients. Cox proportional hazards modelling showed that a history of head injury with loss of consiousness reported to the physician was associated with earlier onset of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (relative risk (RR) = 4. 1, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 3 - 12. 7). head injury with loss of consiousness or amnesia reported to the risk factor interviewer was not significantly associated with earlier onset of Alzheimer's disease overall (RR 2. 0, 95 % CI 0. 7 - 6. 2), but those who reported loss of consiousness exceeding five minutes were at significantly increased risk (RR 11. 2, 95 % CI 2. 3 - 59. 8). Incident Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with head injury which occurred within the preceding 30 years (RR 5. 4, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 19. 5). CONCLUSION: The results of this cohort study are consistent with the findings of several case-control studies suggesting that head injury may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease...|$|E

40|$|Objective:Human {{pandemic}} influenza H 1 N 1 virus {{as the cause}} of febrile respiratory infection ranging from self-limited to severe illness has spread globally during 2009. Signs and symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract involvement, fever, sore throat, rhinitis, myalgia, malaise, headache, chills and fatigue are common. In this article we report the clinical presentation of Influenza A (H 1 N 1) in our hospitalized children. Methods:Between September and October 2009, all children requiring hospitalization for suspected H 1 N 1 infection were transferred to Pediatric Infectious Diseases ward. For all patients the throat swab was taken for PCR testing to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of H 1 N 1 Influenza A. Case patients consisted of H 1 N 1 -positive patients. Age, sex, symptoms, signs, laboratory data, CXR changes, details of therapy, duration of admission and patient outcome were documented. Findings:Twenty patients were H 1 N 1 positive. Mean age of the patients was 65. 50 � 9. 8 months. Fever and coughs were with 55 % the most commonly reported symptoms. Other presentations included vomiting (55 %), abdominal pain (25 %), cyanosis and dyspnea (5 %), body ache (40 %), rhinorrhea (80 %), sore throat (35 %), head stiffness (5 %) and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>conciousness</b> (5 %).

The amplitude of the ASSR, was reduced significantly during late induction and dropped below noise levels during surgical anesthesia. It increased during emergence and further increased during recovery although the amplitude during recovery was significantly less than pre-induction values. Total EEG power increased significantly after induction. The EEG median frequency and 95 % quantile frequency decreased significantly during surgery and increased significantly during emergence. Muscle artifacts could account for many of the EEG changes. The results for the transient auditory evoked potential indicated that, except during emergence, detection was associated with clear N 1 and P 3 waves whereas undetection was not. The lack of either N 1 and P 3 for detection during emergence perhaps occurred because the patients were not yet fully conscious. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
