500|$|Daniel Hales, {{brother of}} the organisation's {{worldwide}} leader Bruce Hales, described the book {{as part of a}} trend of what he said were lies told about his group by critics and disaffected former members. He said such criticism showed it is [...] "open season to kill us". [...] "We're happy to <b>live</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> in anonymity, just quietly in our neighbourhoods in our low-key way. We're quite happy to have our beliefs questioned, ethically debated, and points of religion looked at. That's not a problem. We don't mind being criticised. We don't even mind being despised because of it. But once it starts to be charged that we're acting criminally, we're acting illegally, we're acting immorally, we're acting against society, then we felt that we really had to put our point of view. We felt that it wasn't fair to our members," [...] said Daniel Hales to The West Australian.|$|E
500|$|According to U.S. News & World Report, Romm {{believes}} {{that global warming}} [...] "is advancing more swiftly than most people think and than the mainstream media usually report. [...] He has called for significantly ramping up government spending on clean energy technology, halting {{the construction of new}} coal plants, rapidly increasing the use of energy-efficient technologies, and imposing a cap-and-trade system to sharply limit carbon dioxide emissions". [...] In 2006, in a radio interview, Romm stated, [...] "Global warming is going to transform this country and our transportation and the way we <b>live</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives.</b> [...] If we don't act pretty soon, in an intelligent fashion, then change will be forced upon us by the radically changed climate... global warming is the issue of the century". [...] In March 2009, Romm summarized and updated his views in an [...] "introduction" [...] to his blog, and in another post, setting forth a summary of [...] "global warming impacts".|$|E
500|$|Alejandro González Iñárritu was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} appointed as director, but film commitments later forced him {{to pull out of}} the project. Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of what it must be like to be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all <b>live</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives.</b> That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier—I've never analyzed books about that kind of stuff and I've never really watched procedurals.

500|$|During the 1999 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} rule of law, Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as [...] "there {{is no way of}} checking the Minister's decision, who decides to make an order detaining a subject, depriving him of his liberty, completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free". He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed, saying: [...] "The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and so we do not need it any more. Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law. Let us be honest and repeal it." [...] Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that [...] "the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception. It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister. It is in that sense a subjective discretion." [...] Nonetheless, he recognized that the ISA remained relevant, for instance, as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage, and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong: [...] "It is a case-by-case decision, because that is how we <b>live</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> in a real society." [...] Responding to Jeyaretnam, Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions, and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act, including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public, and also the President's personal discretion to order a detainee's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention.|$|E
2500|$|Unger's call {{is for a}} {{revolution}} in our religious beliefs that encompasses both individual transformation and institutional reorganization; to create change {{in the life of}} the individual as well as in the organization of society. The first part of the program of individual transformation means waking from the dazed state in which we <b>live</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives,</b> and recognizing our mortality and groundlessness without turning to the feel good theologies and philosophies. The second part of the program of social transformation means supplementing the metaphysical revolution with institutional practices by creating social institutions that allow us to constantly overthrow our constraints and our context, and to make this overthrow not a one time event but a continuing process. This is the program of empowered democracy that calls for reforms in the market economy, education, politics, and civil society. [...] "The goal is not to humanize society but to divinize humanity." [...] It is [...] "to raise ordinary life to a higher level of intensity and capability." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} shot and edited in a cinéma vérité style, to look like it was taped with one {{hand-held}} camera, including jump cuts similar to ones found in home movies. T.J. Miller, who plays Hud, has said in various interviews that he taped {{a third of the}} movie and almost half of it made it into the film. Director Matt Reeves described the presentation, [...] "We wanted this to be as if someone found a Handicam, took out the tape {{and put it in the}} player to watch it. What you're watching is a home movie that then turns into something else." [...] Reeves explained that the pedestrians documenting the severed head of the Statue of Liberty with the camera phones was reflective of the contemporary period. According to him: [...] "Cloverfield very much speaks to the fear and anxieties of our time, how we <b>live</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives.</b> Constantly documenting things and putting them up on YouTube, sending people videos through e-mail– we felt it was very applicable to the way people feel now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before the show, Madonna {{released}} pink wristbands to {{audience members}} {{in support of}} the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout. Madonna stopped {{in the middle of the}} show to speak on the issues at hand: [...] "...I feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant, but we can make a difference...we don't have to do it with violence, but love." [...] She continued, noting Martin Luther King, Jr. as a fighter for the equal rights of African Americans, and stating, [...] "I am here to say that the gay community and gay people here, and all around the world, have the same rights, to be treated with dignity, respect, tolerance, compassion, and love." [...] She then asked the audience to raise their wristbands with her to show their [...] "love and support of the gay community." [...] She concluded, [...] "for people quoting the Bible, and using God as a defense mechanism: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, and Moses preached this—it's in every Holy book—'love thy neighbor as thyself'. You can not use religion, or God's name, to treat other people badly. So let's go out into the world, and spread this message of love, and <b>live</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> without fear. Amen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Birdman {{director}} Alejandro G. Iñárritu originally {{conceived the}} film as a comedy filmed in a single shot set in a theatre. The original choice behind the film's genre, which was subsequently re-adapted to concentrate on Riggan's final emotional tail spin, came from the director wanting to see a change in his approach. All his previous films were dramas, and after directing Biutiful, {{he did not want}} to approach his new film in the same tragic manner again. The decision to make the film appear as a single shot came from his realization that [...] "we <b>live</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> with no editing." [...] By presenting {{the film as}} a continuous shot he could [...] "submerge the protagonist in an 'inescapable reality' and take the audience with him". Iñárritu shared his idea with the Argentine screenwriters/cousins Nicolás Giacobone and Armando Bo, as well as playwright Alexander Dinelaris Jr., who had all worked with him on his previous film. Their first reaction was to tell him the continuous-shot idea could not work. According to Dinelaris and Giacobone, [...] "huge" [...] and [...] "important" [...] people told him to not even try the project for the same reason. Iñárritu himself described the technique as [...] "almost suicidal", worrying that it would be distracting instead of immersive. Dinelaris later said that had they truly paused and considered the idea, they might have talked Iñárritu out of it.|$|E

50|$|Poverty {{alleviation}} {{also involves}} improving the living conditions {{of people who}} are already poor. Aid, particularly in medical and scientific areas, is essential in providing better lives, such as the Green Revolution and the eradication of smallpox. Problems with today's development aid include the high proportion of tied aid, which mandates receiving nations to buy products, often more expensive, originating only from donor countries. Nevertheless, some believe (Peter Singer in his book The Life You Can Save) that small changes in the way each of us in affluent nations <b>lives</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> could solve world poverty.|$|R
