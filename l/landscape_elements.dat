5|$|While all the cathedrals are impressive, some, {{because of}} their location, are highly {{significant}} landmarks and <b>landscape</b> <b>elements.</b> Among these is Chichester, which can be seen for many miles across a landscape of open fields {{and is the only}} one of England’s cathedrals that is visible from the sea. The grey spire of Norwich rises serenely from its surrounding city, to be a focus of the Norwich School of landscape painters. Ely, on a small hill, dominates the rural countryside and its appearance in times of flood causes it to be known as The Ship of the Fens. The three spires of Lichfield are known as The Ladies of the Vale. The “exquisite tower” of Worcester is seen best across the River Severn. Lincoln with its vast façade and three towers, the tallest being over 80 metres (270ft), rises majestically from a steep hill above the town. Salisbury Cathedral with its “faultless spire” constitutes one of the iconic views of England, made famous by the landscape painter John Constable. In the north of England, Durham makes a “spectacular” view as it sits dramatically on its steep rocky peninsula above the River Wear, “half Church of God, half castle ‘gainst the Scots”.|$|E
25|$|Aronia is {{considered}} cold hardy and heat tolerant in USDA Zones 3 to 8. Aronia plants grow well both in orchard-type rows or set as <b>landscape</b> <b>elements,</b> including several varieties in 3 to 12 foot heights.|$|E
25|$|While not {{a legally}} {{mandated}} requirement, public art {{was part of}} the urban design planning process (and later design development work) through the Artery Arts Program. The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park <b>landscape</b> <b>elements,</b> and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.|$|E

40|$|IIASA's Forestry {{activities}} within the SIBERIA II study follow two directions: first, to provide input data to both global biosphere process models and a landscape based regional model, and second, to update and consolidate the database of environmental {{data for the}} Siberian area. For the landscape-based regional model, a <b>landscape</b> <b>element</b> classification is suggested. In the past, the <b>landscape</b> <b>element</b> classification has been performed using cartographic information of soil, vegetation, relief, climatic zones, tectonics, etc., following the Russian landscape concept of Gudilin(1987). This approach however, {{does not take into}} account the temporal variability of the various input datasets, including vegetation and land use change. This study provides an alternative to the traditional form of landscape determination. The study examined the theoretical and practical aspects of <b>landscape</b> <b>element</b> classification based mainly on remote sensing data supplemented with GIS data following the concept of Gudilin and comparing it to other approaches (Forman and Gordon, 1986, and graph-based methods) ...|$|R

25|$|In 1998, Naumburg Cathedral was inscribed {{into the}} Tentative List for World Heritage {{nominations}} and extended {{seven years later}} by its surrounding cultural landscape. ″The ′Naumburg Cathedral and the surrounding cultural landscape along the rivers Saale and Unstrut′ are outstanding and representative examples of the High Middle Ages (1000-1300).

In 1482 Leonardo went to Milan {{at the behest of}} Lorenzo de' Medici in order to win favour with Ludovico il Moro, and the painting was abandoned.|$|E
500|$|The {{open spaces}} of the precinct are {{significant}} as they provide impressive settings for the structures. They are also important spaces {{in their own right}} retaining the stark open character of a penal institution required for surveillance. The extensive forecourt of the main cell block, with its scale and secure location within the perimeter walls, is particularly impressive. Paths are bitumen with grassed garden beds delineated by raised brick edging. South Knoll comprises the remains of the high, natural ground level which at least by 1896 had been terraced to form flat, grassed areas. The former playing fields and tennis courts are still in evidence. There is a brick- vaulted reservoir located under the Knoll. The significant landscape presents an austere and formal quality within the perimeter walls. [...] Generally the landscape is sparse and simple, comprising unobtrusive elements such as lawn, low plantings and pavement. [...] <b>Landscape</b> <b>elements</b> outside the walls include the exotic almond and pine trees on the Terrace.|$|E

2500|$|Two popular genres {{which are}} {{under-represented}} in Kunisada's oeuvre are nature images (kachō-e/ 花鳥絵) and landscapes (fūkei-e/ 風景絵).

2500|$|Mantegna's last work in Padua was {{a monumental}} [...] San Zeno altarpiece, {{created for the}} abbot of the Basilica of San Zeno, Verona from 1457 to 1459.

2500|$|In 1955, the National Park Service {{implemented}} {{a new program}} to restore park facilities throughout the nation. [...] The program's main thrust was to standardize national park facilities across the country. [...] In Rim Village, some rustic features were replaced or covered over {{in the effort to}} modernize park facilities and original <b>landscape</b> <b>elements</b> were altered or removed. [...] Later the Rim Village campground was removed entirely and the site converted into a day-use picnic area. The rustic tables and fireplaces were replaced with more contemporary models.|$|E

2500|$|While {{exploring}} {{the works of}} European painters such as Titian, Tintoretto, and Rubens, Marsh met Thomas Hart Benton {{in one of the}} galleries in France. Benton, known today as a social realist, and regionalist painter, [...] was also a great student of the Baroque masters. The resemblance Marsh saw between Tintoretto's famous works and Benton's [...] motivated Marsh to try to paint in a similar way. Following his European trip (in which he also visited Florence) Marsh returned to New York with a desire to utilize the principles he felt were evident in the art of the Renaissance painters—particularly the way large groups of figures, together with architecture or <b>landscape</b> <b>elements,</b> were organized into stable compositions.|$|E
2500|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} in the Colonial Korea era from 1910 to 1945, {{there was an}} attempt by the colonial government of the Empire of Japan to replace Korean architecture with Japanese architectural traditions. Significant structures of Korean Imperial palace compounds and their traditional Korean gardens were demolished. [...] Important <b>landscape</b> <b>elements</b> were removed and sold or taken for use in Japan. Ancient bunjae trees were taken for replanting as bonsai in Japanese gardens. Also during Japanese occupation, the construction of traditional Korean religious buildings (Buddhist or Confucian) was discouraged, as well as adaptations in Christian churches. Some Korean people resisted the Japanese nationalist agenda by building traditional Korean hanok homes, such as the houses of Jeonju village. The colonial disregard for Korean architecture and its history left important Korean landmarks neglected and unmaintained, and the deterioration or demolition of significant examples of architecture resulted. [...] Some historic buildings were also redecorated using Japanese ornamentation methods.|$|E
