40|$|Hemodynamic {{effect of}} {{different}} techniques {{and type of}} anesthesia are defined. The volume of reduced hemorrhage in surgical field is debatable, without any definite conclusion. The objective {{of the study is}} to investigate the effects of <b>local</b> infiltrative <b>anesthesia</b> with adrenaline during general balanced anesthesia and nitroglicerol on blood pressure and hemorrhage reduction in middle ear operations. Prospective, randomized study included 58 adult patients planned for the otorhinolaryngological surgery. Studied group of patient (n 30) planned for middle ear operations. Before incision surgeon was administered <b>local</b> infiltrative <b>anesthesia</b> using 2 % lidocaine with adrenaline (1 : 200000) The controls group (n 28), planned for other surgery had no <b>local</b> infiltrative <b>anesthesia</b> with adrenaline. Hemodinamic parameters were monitored before surgical incision and 30 minutes after that. Surgeon’s verbal reply on hemorrhage reduction during surgery was recorded. Statistical analysis of parametric data was carried out by Mann-Whitney sum test. Blood pressure and heart rate was not different between the two groups. But, intraoperatively, the study showed lowering of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This mode of treatment and surgeons verbal reply confirmed that <b>local</b> infiltrative <b>anesthesia</b> with adrenaline under balanced anesthesia had no effect on hemorrhage reductionin surgical field...|$|R

25|$|Alloderm is donor tissue {{taken from}} cadavers and then denatured, {{purified}} and treated to remove viable cells that could pass along disease. Under a <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> Alloderm is placed into the mucosa, or body, of the lips in small rolls {{to make them}} larger. Alloderm can also be placed into the vermilion, the pink area of the lip, to provide definition and a sharper border.|$|E
25|$|During the transplant, a {{radiologist}} uses ultrasound and radiography {{to guide}} placement of a catheter through the upper abdomen {{and into the}} portal vein of the liver. The islets are then infused through the catheter into the liver. The patient will receive a local anesthetic. If a patient cannot tolerate <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> the surgeon may use general anesthesia and do the transplant through a small incision. Possible risks of the procedure include bleeding or blood clots.|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{retrospectively}} {{investigated the}} efficacy of combination of superficial cervical plexus block (CPB) and <b>local</b> infiltration <b>anesthesia</b> in patients underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Methods: After ethics approval, we searched medical records of patients who underwent CEA with combination of superficial CPB and <b>local</b> infiltration <b>anesthesia</b> performed before surgery. Data were given as mean±SD or number(%). Results: There were 22 patients (age: 68. 9 ± 9. 2 yr, weight: 73. 7 ± 11. 1 kg) who underwent CEA under defined anesthesia method from June 2007 to April 2011. The amounts of local anesthetics used for combination anesthesia and intraoperative supplementary anesthesia (95. 4 %) were 29. 9 ± 11. 2 mL and 12. 1 ± 5. 6 mL, respectively. All patients received fentanyl (87. 5 ± 52. 1 µg) and midazolam (1. 8 ± 0. 6 mg), and nine patients (40. 9 %) received propofol (< 2 mg/kg/hr) intraoperatively. Surgery was completed successfully in all patients. Pain scores (0 - 10) of eighteen patients (81. 8 %) who were transferred to recovery unit were ≤ 3 without receiving any analgesic. Myocardial infarction, stroke or death were not observed. Conclusions: Carotid endarterectomy can be successfully performed under combined anesthesia including superficial CPB and <b>local</b> infiltration <b>anesthesia.</b> In addition to this, the percentage of supplemental anesthetic drug requirement is high intraoperatively and pain scores of patients are low postoperatively...|$|R
30|$|There {{were few}} {{differences}} in immune response {{between the two}} groups, potentially since {{a majority of the}} hospitalization surgery patients received propofol-based anesthesia. We hypothesize that the use of volatile anesthetic/opioid analgesia in hospitalization surgery has a greater influence on immune function in breast cancer patients than <b>local</b> anesthetic/propofol-based <b>anesthesia</b> in day surgery.|$|R

25|$|The FDA has {{approved}} cryoablation of a fibroadenoma as a safe, effective and minimally-invasive alternative to open surgical removal in 2001. In the procedure, ultrasound imaging {{is used to}} guide a probe into the mass of breast tissue. Extremely cold temperatures are then used to destroy the abnormal cells, and over time the cells are reabsorbed into the body. The procedure can be performed as an outpatient surgery using <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia</b> only, and leaves substantially less scarring than open surgical procedures and no breast tissue deformation.|$|E
25|$|An {{elective}} secondary {{procedure is}} required to place the coupling peg or post in those patients who desire improved prosthetic motility. That procedure is usually delayed for at least 6 months after enucleation to allow time for implant vascularization. Technetium bone or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans are not now universally used, {{but they have been}} used to conﬁrm vascularization before peg insertion. Under <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> a conjunctival incision is created at the peg insertion site. A hole is created into the porous implant to allow insertion of the peg or post.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a visual}} {{examination}} and a dermatoscopic exam, or in vivo diagnostic {{tools such as}} a confocal microscope, the doctor may biopsy the suspicious mole. A skin biopsy performed under <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia</b> is often required to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis and in defining severity. Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by histological analysis and Breslow scoring. Incisional biopsies such as punch biopsies are usually contraindicated in suspected melanomas, because {{of the possibility of}} sampling error or local implantation causing misestimation of tumour thickness. However, fears that such biopsies may increase the risk of metastatic disease seem unfounded.|$|E

25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} for an ingrown nail {{is carried out}} by a podiatrist, a foot and ankle specialist. This is typically an in-office procedure requiring <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia</b> and special surgical instruments. The surgical approach is {{the removal of the}} offending part of the nail plate known as a wedge resection. If the ingrown toenail recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the sides of the nail with chemicals or excision is done; this is known as a matrixcestomy. Antibiotics may be used after the procedure but are not recommended, as they may delay healing. Surgical {{treatment for}} ingrown nails is more effective at preventing the nail from regrowing inwards compared to non-surgical treatments.|$|E
25|$|Radiofrequency ablation: Monopolar {{radiofrequency}} thermal ablation transfers radiofrequency {{energy to}} the tonsil tissue through probes inserted in the tonsil. The procedure can be performed in an office (outpatient) setting under light sedation or <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> After the treatment is performed, scarring occurs within the tonsil causing it to decrease in size {{over a period of}} several weeks. The treatment can be performed several times. The advantages of this technique are minimal discomfort, ease of operations, and immediate return to work or school. Tonsillar tissue remains after the procedure but is less prominent. This procedure is recommended for treating enlarged tonsils and not chronic or recurrent tonsillitis.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century saw {{improvements}} in abortion technology, increasing its safety, and reducing its side-effects. Vacuum devices, first {{described by the}} Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson in the 19th century, allowed {{for the development of}} suction-aspiration abortion. The process was improved by the Russian doctor S. G. Bykov in 1927, where the method was used during its period of liberal abortion laws from 1920 to 1936. The technology was also used in China and Japan before being introduced to Britain and the United States in the 1960s. The invention of the Karman cannula, a flexible plastic cannula which replaced earlier metal models in the 1970s, reduced the occurrence of perforation and made suction-aspiration methods possible under <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia.</b>|$|E
