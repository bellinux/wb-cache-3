5|$|As the division's assault units {{began their}} {{approach}} march towards the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> {{late on the}} evening of 6 June, the German artillery opened up with a gas bombardment that severely hindered the march, breaking up the assaulting units as men became lost. Suffering over 2,000 casualties before the battle even began, many of the division's assault units reached their assembly points with less than 200 men, nevertheless they arrived on time and at the appointed hour, after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines had destroyed {{a large part of the}} German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome by the division's lead battalions—the 33rd, 34th, 38th and 39th—and by 5am, the division had gained the crest of the Messines ridge and began digging in to defend against a possible counter-attack. In the engagements that followed the division largely played only a supporting role.|$|E
5|$|Following the explosions, the Allied advance was {{virtually}} unopposed as the Germans were too stunned and demoralised {{to put up}} much resistance. However, not everything went the Australians' way. The 3rd Division, under Major General John Monash, suffered heavy casualties when they were shelled by phosgene gas and shrapnel shells while moving towards the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> nevertheless the division still managed to get into position {{for the start of}} the attack. Strong German counterattacks were launched the next day, once again supported by concentrated artillery fire; however, the advance was able to continue on through the mess of concrete blockhouses the Germans had erected and continued on until all the objectives had been taken. Australian casualties amounted to nearly 6,800 men. On 2 July 1917, Major General Holmes was mortally wounded by a German shellburst while surveying the Messines battlefield with the Premier of New South Wales, William Holman.|$|E
5|$|In the north, 1 RAR was {{inserted}} into its new landing zone—LZ March— to the south-west. With B Company securing the site, the battalion moved on {{foot to the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> but not before they were mistakenly engaged by US helicopter gunships and artillery fire. However, after the Australians established communications, the shelling was halted and they began their advance. No sooner had the lead elements—D Company {{under the command of}} Major Ian Fisher—emerged into the cleared area that was originally to have been used as the battalion's LZ, when the forward platoon came under fire from Viet Cong positions in the tree-line on the north-east corner. In the action which followed, six Australians from 12 Platoon were wounded, including platoon commander Lieutenant Jim Bourke, who was shot through the jaw but remained in command until he passed out from loss of blood. Meanwhile, two medics who attempted to move forward to treat the casualties were themselves shot and killed.|$|E

50|$|The air {{plan called}} for 350 fighter-bombers hitting the German front lines {{followed}} by 1,500 bombers assigned to targets 2500 yd deep and 6000 yd wide. As the friendly troops moved forward, another 396 medium bombers would bomb the rear areas for another 45 minutes. Friendly troops were moved back 1200 yd from their <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departures</b> for safety.|$|R
5|$|Following {{this the}} commandos were used mainly as highly trained {{infantry}} units {{for the rest}} of their involvement in the North African campaign and for the majority of this time they were attached to the 36th Infantry Brigade. Over the course of the next five months the commandos were involved in a number of costly attacks and periods of static defence, in between which they carried out aggressive fighting patrols. Indicative of the nature of the fighting during this time was No. 6 Commando's attack on the Green Hill feature on 30 November 1942. The main attack was launched at 4:00am, as three troops—Nos. 3, 4 and 6 Troops—attacked from the north and west, while No. 5 Troop conducted a diversionary attack from the flank. As soon as the main force left its <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> it came under intense oblique fire from interlocking medium and heavy machine guns positioned in a diamond-shaped perimeter on top of the hill. The fire was so intense that the troop providing support by fire on the flank was unable to suppress it and the attack was temporarily postponed until the afternoon when it was hoped that artillery support could be utilised.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 October the allied {{artillery}} and mortar bombardment began, targeting Chinese positions on the Hinge. Hassett moved the 3 RAR tactical headquarters on to Hill 317 just before the assaulting troops stepped off the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co-ordinate fire support. Waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment, the attack finally began at 08:00. B Company moved off down the ridgeline, with two-up and one-in-depth, using the trees and long grass for concealment. Initially it seemed that the Chinese had withdrawn during the night, when suddenly the lead Australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear. A series of intense fire-fights ensued as the Australians fought back and by 09:20 the Hinge finally fell, with the Australians losing two killed and 20 wounded. Chinese casualties included more than 20 killed. As a result of the fighting Captain Henry Nicholls and Lieutenant Jim Hughes were awarded the Military Cross, while Corporal J. Park and Corporal E.F. Bosworth were awarded the Military Medal. Yet even as the surviving Chinese withdrew, artillery and mortar fire began to fall on the Hinge. B Company moved quickly to consolidate the position, but were hampered by the shelling, while they now faced a pressing shortage of ammunition and difficulties evacuating their casualties.|$|E

25|$|The enemy battery {{was located}} on the forward slope of a small coconut grove several {{thousand}} yards from the Piva River. Counterbattery fire from the 155mm howitzer battery of the U.S. Army's 37th Division began to explode around the grove. Fire was adjusted quickly by direct observation, and shortly afterwards the Japanese battery was knocked out of action. While the artillery duel was underway, the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment and 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment began forming into attack formation behind the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b> The preparatory fires ceased at 09:00 {{and at that time}} the two attack battalions advanced through the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment's lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{operational}} {{plan called for}} the four battalions to link up in a recaptured Moung Soui. The southern pincer was forced to move through a swamp, which slowed it down.

A strategy conference {{was held at the}} royalist headquarters in Long Tieng. While it was in session, the northern half of the task force came under 130mm field gun fire. Having only 81mm mortars for reply, and lacking bunkers for cover, the Thais moved north out of range, further opening the pincers and giving PAVN maneuver room.|$|E

The following day, 1 May, at 0640 the battery on Sadau opened the preliminary bombardment along with two cruisers and six destroyers stationed offshore.

25|$|Nevertheless, the battalion's {{first major}} action {{did not come}} until mid-1917 when the British shifted their focus towards the Ypres sector in Belgium and the 3rd Division was {{committed}} to the Battle of Messines as part of II Anzac Corps on 7 June. The 34th Battalion, {{along with the rest}} of the 9th Brigade, was tasked with leading the division's assault. Beginning their approach march late on 6 June, they were caught in a German gas bombardment that inflicted heavy casualties; nevertheless, they arrived at the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> on time and, after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines destroyed a large part of the German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome. By 5am on 7 June, the division had gained the crest of the Messines Ridge and dug-in to defend against a possible counter-attack, with the 34th occupying a position around Grey Farm.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, around first light, {{the landing}} was delayed almost {{half an hour}} as the fighter cover from the Fifth Air Force that {{had been assigned to}} support the landing failed to arrive; finally the order for the assault force to leave the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> was given by Smith despite the risks of proceeding without fighter cover. The initial assault force consisted of 500 marines from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines. These troops were tasked with securing a bridgehead through which follow on troops from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines would pass as they pushed inland towards the Bitokara Mission. Due to the presence of a coral reef offshore, the initial assault had to be made by two companies from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines aboard smaller tracked landing vehicles; these were lowered into the water from the larger tank landing craft, and as they made the run into the shore, they were provided covering machine gun fire from the tanks that were aboard one of the medium landing ships. This was answered by sporadic fire from the beach.|$|E
25|$|As in the Pear Trench sector, {{the tanks}} {{assigned}} {{to support the}} attack on Hamel had not arrived {{by the time the}} infantry reached the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> which meant that they had to attack without armoured support. As the 43rd went in straight against the defences, some of the German defenders began withdrawing. As elements of the 43rd outflanked the German positions in the village through the edge of Notamel Wood, heavy fighting broke out in Hamel and one group of Australians, along with their attached American platoon, killed 15 Germans and captured another 40. Meanwhile, the 44th went in against the German trenches along the ridge line to the south. There, after the tanks finally arrived, they took large numbers of prisoners as they cleared out the trenches. Around Notamel Wood, resistance was initially heavy as the German positions were well-sited to provide interlocking fields of fire. The company of the 43rd {{on the edge of the}} wood was held up briefly by a machine-gun enfilading their line of advance before a tank crushed the position; further north, the 42nd Battalion, after briefly becoming confused, had been moved into position with precision drill, and as the combined weight of air support, artillery and armour was brought to bear the German resistance in the wood melted away.|$|E

The infantry dismounted and deployed an attacking line, with the 1st Battalion on {{the left of the}} road and the 2nd Battalion on the right. With US tanks leading the infantry on the road, the two battalions crossed the line at 13:00. The tanks opened fire against the mountain escarpments to aid the South Korean infantry engaged there. The US infantry {{on either side of the}} road swept the lower hills, as the tanks on the road paced their advance with the infantry. A North Korean outpost line in the valley withdrew and there was almost no North Korean opposition during the first hour of the US advance.

500|$|After having {{endured a}} long winter in Flanders serving in mainly a {{defensive}} role, the battalion's first major engagement came at Messines, in Belgium in early June 1917.

Near Ploegsteert Corner, during the {{march to the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> the battalion suffered {{a high number of}} casualties following a German gas attack which subsequently resulted the 39th only being able to muster about a third of its manpower for the attack, amounting to an assault force of only 120 men. Despite this, the 39th was quickly reorganised into a single wave, and attacking on the 10th Brigade's right, it subsequently overcame the initial German opposition facing them and then, during {{the second phase of the}} battle advanced south of Douve, on the southern edge of the Messines Ridge. It was involved in further fighting north of Grey Farm, where they were initially held up by German machine-gun fire, but after this was overcome they continued to advance to their final objective, eventually digging-in [...] beyond the farm, having managed to capture all of its objectives.

5000|$|The harness saddle has {{at least}} two <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> evolution, both <b>departures</b> from the very ancient throat-and-girth harness [...] One line was {{developed}} as a refinement of that harness and involved {{a wide variety of}} martingale and breastplate type straps in front of the shoulder and between the forelegs, all attached to a saddle and girth. This line is documented in Byzantium in the 10th century and Khmer in the 12th century, and occurs today in Japanese plough harnesses and Indian tongas. The other line, far more successful, evolved in China from ancient withers-straps that originally were used with a breastplate-and-breeching harness without a girth. This was the Han departure from the throat-and-girth harness. A minority of 2nd century Han art shows this new breastplate-and-breeching harness with a girth added to it, and in that context ancient Chinese texts sometimes refer to the withers-strap as a saddle. This 2nd century harness saddle supported one of two arches attached to shafts, and had terrets through which the reins were carried.
