Totals of 2–5 inches (50–125 mm) spread across northwest Virginia, western Maryland, eastern West Virginia, and the Susquehanna Valley of Pennsylvania. In New York, the rainfall combined with moisture from Hurricane Lili, which triggered flooding that closed {{a portion of}} a railway <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{question of}} whether Jefferson {{was the father of}} Hemings' children is known as the Jefferson–Hemings controversy.

A small number of historians disagree.|$|E

5|$|Because Nebraska {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Following the kickoff and return, Virginia Tech began at its 19-yard line. On the first play of the second half, Oxendine broke loose for a 36-yard run to the Nebraska 45-yard <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> first down. Despite that strong opening play, Tech was unable to gain another first down {{and was forced to}} punt after gaining only two additional yards. The Tech punt rolled out of bounds at the Nebraska 26-yard line.|$|E
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1810 the Napoleonic Wars had lasted for seven years and the French Navy, {{over the course of}} the conflict, had been {{successively}} driven from the Atlantic until every French port was watched by a Royal Navy close blockade, ready to attack any French ship which emerged from harbour. In 1809, the main French fleet at Brest had attempted to break out into open water, only to be driven back and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads. Much of the French effort at sea subsequently fell on commerce raiders, including privateers and frigate squadrons, often operating from smaller harbours such as those on the Northern coast of France in the English Channel. The two principal raiding ports were Cherbourg and Le Havre in Normandy, each of which maintained squadrons. In 1810, Cherbourg's anchorage held two ships of the <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> large, newly built frigate Iphigénie, while the frigates Elisa and Amazone were stationed at Le Havre.|$|E

At {{about the same time}} a British fleet under Admiral William Hotham also arrived, augmenting the West Indies fleet of Admiral Samuel Barrington. The British then captured French-held St. Lucia, despite d'Estaing's attempt at relief. The British used St. Lucia to monitor the French on Martinique, where d'Estaing was based.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} the goal is the penalty area.

This area {{has a number of}} functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul {{by a member of the}} defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.|$|E

5|$|Midway {{between the}} village of Ovid and the hamlet of Romulus, the two routes split, {{allowing}} NY414 to continue due north to Seneca Falls. NY96, meanwhile, turns to the northwest, following {{the eastern edge of}} the Seneca Army Depot for most of the distance to Romulus hamlet. Just south of the community's center, NY96 separates from the depot grounds and continues north through the hamlet and into the town of Varick. The route uneventfully crosses the town, passing by open fields on a predominantly northward alignment on its way to the Fayette town <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> junction with NY336, an east–west connector between NY96A and NY414. NY96 continues across rural terrain to the outskirts of {{the village of}} Waterloo, where the number of homes rises as the route enters the village on Fayette Street.|$|E

5|$|North of Haskinville, NY21 {{takes on}} a more northerly course through the county that {{eventually}} brings it {{to the village of}} Wayland, where it intersects I-390 at exit3 south of the village. The interchange also serves as the southern terminus of NY15 and is adjacent to the north end of NY415, which terminates north of the exit at NY21. NY15 joins NY21 north into the center of Wayland, where the two routes separate upon intersecting NY63. While NY15 continues north from the village into Livingston County, NY21 leaves Wayland on an eastwest alignment, roughly paralleling the northern county <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> B Rail Corporation line as it runs through a valley surrounding the Cohocton River. After , the road enters the hamlet of North Cohocton, centered around NY21's junction with the northern terminus of NY371.|$|E

5|$|Only {{purebred}} Mérens may {{be registered}} in the breed stud book. The selection of stallions is rigorous, based on tests {{at the age of}} three. The breeding goal is to produce horses with the ideal conformation and good character. The gaits are subject to particular observation in all stallions, and during the three-year-old inspections, they must perform a dressage test, a cross-country jumping test, a test on the longe <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> physical inspection. The Mérens {{has one of the most}} stringent inspection procedures, and breeders aim to achieve a steady increase in the quality of the breed. Mares are evaluated during a breed competition organized by the French National Stud.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{the line}} {{have been made}} since the {{extension}} to Østerås. The current municipal master plan calls for the line to be extended to Bekkestua Station, where it would again intersect with the Kolsås Line. One possibility is also that the service be continued along the Kolsås <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> new branch be built to Sandvika, the municipal center of Bærum. However, an extension {{has not been a}} priority for the municipal politicians, although the right-of-way has been secured, which will simplify construction.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 7 May 1794 {{was a minor}} naval action fought {{between a}} British ship of the <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> French frigate early in the French Revolutionary Wars. The French Navy sought to disrupt British trade by intercepting and {{capturing}} merchant ships with roving frigates, a strategy countered by protecting British convoys with heavier warships, particularly in European waters. On 5 May 1794, the British escorts of a convoy from Cork sighted two French ships approaching and gave chase. The ships, a frigate and a corvette, outmatched by their opponents, separated and the convoy escorts did likewise, each following one of the raiders on a separate course.|$|E
