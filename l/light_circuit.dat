50|$|To {{avoid having}} {{the entire system}} go dark if a single lamp burned out, each street lamp was {{equipped}} with a device that ensured that the circuit would remain intact. Early series street lights were equipped with isolation transformers. that would allow current to pass across the transformer whether the bulb worked or not. Later the film cutout was invented. The film cutout was a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp. If the lamp failed (an open circuit), the current through the string became zero, causing the voltage of the circuit (thousands of volts) to be imposed across the insulating film, penetrating it (see Ohm's law). In this way, the failed lamp was bypassed and power restored {{to the rest of}} the district. The street <b>light</b> <b>circuit</b> contained an automatic current regulator, preventing the current from increasing as lamps burned out, preserving the life of the remaining lamps. When the failed lamp was replaced, a new piece of film was installed, once again separating the contacts in the cutout. This system was recognizable by the large porcelain insulator separating the lamp and reflector from the mounting arm. This was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp's base may have operated at several thousand volts above ground/earth.|$|E

40|$|We study {{a scheme}} for {{approximate}} calculation of mean end-to-end packet delay {{in a network}} that integrates circuit switched and packet switched traffic, using the movable boundary traffic integration scheme on each link. Numerical results obtained from the approximation are compared with simulation results. We analyse the discrepancies between the simulation and the approximation. The analysis reveals an important phenomenon that occurs when packets and circuits are integrated in a network. When a link is shared between circuit switched and packet switched traffic, using the movable boundary scheme, then the packet departure process is burstier than Poisson. In a network of such links, at <b>light</b> <b>circuit</b> switched loads, the active calls occupy multiple hops, hence bursts of packets departing from a link {{are likely to find}} the next link available. Thus at <b>light</b> <b>circuit</b> loads there is a positive correlation between packet bursts and link availability, yielding packet delays less than what would be expected on the grounds of burstiness, and causing the Poisson process based approximation to overestimate mean packet delay. At higher circuit loads the active circuits occupy fewer hops, and the correlation is diminished; the Poisson approximation then underestimates the delay of the bursty packet arrivals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} the topology design in IP backbone networks while exploiting both {{the advantages of}} IP routing and optical networking. The emerging WDM and optical switching technologies enable the use of optically switched circuits to interconnect routers, which may not have direct fiber links with each other, in an IP-over-WDM network. All these “light circuits ” form the underlying topology of the IP network. In this study, we optimize this WDM-layer topology to minimize the packet-loss rate under dynamic IP traffic. The dimensions of this optimization include finding the right connectivity pattern and allocate limited capacity to each <b>light</b> <b>circuit.</b> Giving {{the fact that the}} total interface capacity of a router is bounded by its internal packet-switching speed, we found the problem manifests itself as a trade off between the interface count and the interface speed. Dense connectivity leads to low average interface speed and utilization, vice versa for sparse connectivity. Interestingly, low interface utilization alone do not guarantee low packet-loss rate since higher speed pipes carry traffic more efficiently. Using both analytical and experimental methods, we verified that there are two critical loads for any network. When the network load is higher than the high critical load, the best topology is always the clique. When the network load is lower than the low critical load, the best topology is always the ring. When the network load is between these two extremes, which we believe to be the normal operating point of a backbone network, the best topology has a moderate connectivity density. 1...|$|E

A developed dimmable circuit and the rearrangement of fluorescent trigger circuit in the platform linked together consist of this illumination simulation system. Integrating with the control on temperature and humidity, the expected environmental conditions including the sunshine illumination, temperature and humidity for botanic physiology measurement can be implemented. Many literatures confirm that various wavelengths of light will resulted in different responses on the physiology of a plant. The products from photosynthesis processes in a plant vary with segments of light spectrum absorbed. Therefore, a sturdy plant must grow with full spectrum of illumination. Since the popular and energy-saving illumination source-LED is with single specific wavelength and is unable to satisfy the full spectrum requirement for the photosynthesis processes, this approach chooses dimming fluorescent light source as illumination device. For illumination simulation, the illumination values in a greenhouse are the specification of the developed system. For realization, the dimming <b>light</b> <b>circuit</b> adjusts the amplitude, the angle, and the frequency etc. as illumination control. In this research it is verified that the dominant factor for illumination control is the load power, thus the dimming light system developed will be accomplished by implementing the amplitude adjustment.
