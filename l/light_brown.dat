5|$|Lara Croft is {{depicted}} as an athletic and fast woman with brown eyes and reddish-brown hair, frequently kept in a plait or ponytail. The character's classic costume is a turquoise tank top, <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage pants and black or <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> shirts. When exploring, she often carries two pistols, but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.|$|E
5|$|The ornatus {{morphotype}} is most reliably {{distinguished by}} its longer fur, averaging 26.8mm compared to 22.4mm in javanicus. Other distinguishing characteristics include overall color (generally <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> in ornatus compared with brown to reddish in javanicus), {{and amount of}} brown coloring in the fur (ornatus has less brown than javanicus, resulting in a lighter-colored ventral region).|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} Solomon Islands skinks are {{a dark green}} but are often {{speckled}} with <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> or black. The scales on the underside vary from light yellow to different shades of green. The toes on all four legs have thick, curved nails used for climbing and gripping tree limbs.|$|E

5|$|The tail appears {{naked and}} is shorter than or {{about as long}} as the head and body; it is longer in T.talamancae. Its {{coloration}} is variable; it is dark brown above and at the sides and <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> and often white to a greater or smaller extent below, and in some specimens the tail has the same color above and below. The scales on the tail are smaller than in T.talamancae.|$|E
5|$|After {{five to six}} instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's forceps {{will become}} curved, while the females' forceps remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, which can be {{anything}} from a <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> (as in the Tawny earwig) to a dark black (as in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.|$|E
5|$|Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later {{described}} the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile, wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, blond hair, {{and a small}} moustache. He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E

40|$|Small {{fragment}} of dark brown woven goat hair fabric with several stitches of thicker, <b>lighter</b> <b>brown</b> goat hair yarn. There {{are two very}} small bits of woven wool fabric that have been sewn on with thick linen stitches. This fragment may have been attached to 12588 a at one time.; Dirty and brittle. The small attached wool pieces are very matted. Some of the linen stitches have broken. The thicker, <b>lighter</b> <b>brown</b> yarns are frayed...|$|R
5|$|The adult female {{is mainly}} {{scalloped}} and mottled in <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> {{with a more}} uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|The cap {{flesh is}} {{composed}} of two distinct layers: a thin, compact, black-brown and hairy upper layer, and a thick, soft, white to <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> lower layer that is made of thin, thread-like filaments arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. The stem is similarly divided, with a thin, dark and hairy cortical layer covered by hairs, which encircles inner ochre-colored flesh. A drop of potassium hydroxide applied {{to the surface of}} the mushroom will cause it to instantly stain black.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is {{a species of}} longtailed carpet shark, family Hemiscylliidae, found in shallow, tropical waters off Australia and New Guinea (and possibly elsewhere). The common name of this shark comes from the very large, white-margined black spot behind each pectoral fin, which are reminiscent of military epaulettes. A small species usually under 1m (3.3ft) long, the {{epaulette shark}} has a slender body with a short head and broad, paddle-shaped paired fins. The caudal peduncle (to which the tail fin is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults are <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 24-25 mm. The forewings are <b>light</b> greyish <b>brown.</b> The hindwings are also <b>light</b> greyish <b>brown,</b> but paler.|$|R
50|$|Adult H. arisanensis measure 5.0 - 6.5 cm in snout-vent length. It is blackish-brown to reddish-brown dorsally and {{somewhat}} <b>lighter</b> <b>brown</b> or grey-brown ventrally.|$|R
50|$|Isomoralla eriscota is {{a species}} of moth in the family Oecophoridae and occurs in Australia. The adult has <b>brown</b> {{forewings}} with <b>lighter</b> <b>brown</b> bands.|$|R
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the {{four-horned antelope}}. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, can be told apart by its <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe. A thin skin (or epicarp), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy mesocarp, which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The mesocarp of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported carotene contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white endosperm, which is sweet and tastes somewhat like coconut.|$|E
5|$|The spores of G.pectinatum are {{brown and}} opaque. They have a roughly spherical shape and are ornamented with {{transparent}} (hyaline), truncate warts; the diameter is 4–4.5µm, or 5.5–6.5 if the lengths of the warts is included. Spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 2- or 4-spored, while cystidia (specialized sterile cells that {{occur at the}} hymenial surface in some mushrooms) are absent. The capillitia—a mass of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores—are <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> and 3–7µm in diameter. They are tapered, thick-walled with a narrow interior, and either smooth or slightly encrusted.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 25-28 mm. The forewings are shining chestnut-brown with ill-defined {{groups of}} scales, forming medial and postmedial bands. The hindwings are <b>lighter</b> <b>brown.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 10-12.5 mm. The forewings {{are dark}} brown with about five yellowish white spots. The hindwings are uniform and <b>lighter</b> <b>brown</b> than the forewings.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the fruit}} bodies of P.bembae are roughly {{similar to those}} in Xerocomus, species in this genus do not have the powdery veil {{characteristic}} of P.bembae. Two similar species in the same area include P.annulus and P.croceus, described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann, based on specimens collected in the Congo. Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, P.bembae differs from both in its larger cystidia, its cream-colored flesh with pale reddish-brown to <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> tones under the cap cuticle (compared to white in P.annulus and P.croceus), its yellow mycelium (white in P.annulus and P.croceus), and differences in ecology.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have {{caps and}} stipes, often with indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. The flesh has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones {{in the flesh}} reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high nighttime humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth. The spines are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent (extending {{down the length of}} the stipe). Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, <b>light</b> <b>brown,</b> or dark brown in age.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last year has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E
40|$|Small {{fragment}} of woven wool fabric with brown warp and red weft. There is a poorly preserved border present. There {{are a few}} <b>lighter</b> <b>brown</b> wefts preserved in several long warp yarns. Thre are also some purple yarns caught up with these long warps and a blue yarn has adhered to the surface.; Minor dirt, but very worn. Most {{of one of the}} twining yarns of the border is missing. Some of the warps in the red weft section are damaged. Very little is left of the <b>lighter</b> <b>brown</b> weft. Minor edge fraying...|$|R
50|$|The Arctic shrew is most {{distinctive}} in its tricolored fur. It is dark brown or black {{on its back}} from its head {{to the base of}} its tail, while its flanks are a <b>lighter</b> <b>brown,</b> and its underside is <b>lighter</b> still grayish <b>brown.</b> Even its tail is bi-colored, dark brown on the dorsal side, and gradually fading to a <b>lighter</b> <b>brown</b> on the ventral side. The fur is grayer in winter time, and its tricolor is most marked during the winter months from October to June, for the fur is thicker and brighter. Arctic shrews molt twice a year, and the tricolor bands in the fur are less prominent in younger shrews.|$|R
50|$|Males {{and females}} {{do not differ}} in appearance, though the latter are a bit smaller. Immature birds lack {{iridescence}} and are dark brown, grading into slightly <b>lighter</b> <b>brown</b> on the underside.|$|R
5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head. It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring around the eyes, and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the tomb is praised and also derided; it is derided {{for the lack of}} proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction. Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> colour of the stone used, had observed that the tomb has the “colour of potted meat”. Even ASI has observed that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is “rather florid”. Another observation is that the tomb can not be compared to the Taj Mahal or the Humayun Tomb, as, {{at the time it was}} built, the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared “thread bare”.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{peridium}} {{is a thin}} shiny {{tissue that}} is depressed into areas demarcated by the pyramidal plates. The puffball base, which occupies about a third to {{a quarter of the}} bottom of the fruit body, consists of moderately-sized chambers that persist even after the gleba has matured and the spores have dispersed. The base can assume a purplish hue after weathering. The base is rooted into the soil with rhizomorphs. Initially white, the gleba turns color from yellow to golden brown to dark brown as the spores mature. As the gleba dries, the inner peridium dries and cracks, exposing the spore mass in cracks between the scales. The gleba is supported by a yellowish-brown to <b>light</b> <b>brown</b> subgleba.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 29-36 mm. The forewings are <b>light</b> greyish <b>brown,</b> with numerous wavy transverse lines and mottled with <b>light</b> reddish <b>brown</b> (slightly darker in females). The head and abdomen are <b>light</b> reddish <b>brown,</b> while the thorax is darker. There are two short blackish lines {{at the base of}} the abdomen. The hindwings are light coppery and darker at the margin.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 45-49 mm. The head and thorax are dark brown, edgedlaterally with white. The abdomen is <b>lighter</b> <b>brown.</b> The forewings are also <b>lighter</b> <b>brown</b> speckled with blackish and with a broad basal and discal dark brown fasciae. There is a blackish ring {{at the end of}} the cell and a thick dark line running from the apex to the inner margin. The hindwings are bright red with a black base and with a black submarginal line which does not reach the costa. The underside of the body and wings is ferruginous speckled with black. The legs are whitish.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 9-10 mm. The forewings are blackish {{brown with}} greenish-violet reflections {{and a few}} white scales just beyond the middle forming an indistinct, short, transverse line. The hindwings are much <b>lighter</b> <b>brown.</b>|$|R
