5|$|This unorthodox {{deployment}} {{gave the}} Smith Gun 360 degrees of rotation which, {{combined with a}} maximum 40-degree elevation, produced a basic firing-plate-mounted field weapon light enough to be towed behind a civilian vehicle, despite not being designed for this. (Home Guard units quickly discovered this fact, having to be prohibited from doing so as it would damage the weapon's wheels (and possibly the axle), inhibiting or even preventing traverse.) Happily, ammunition shortages made the similarly-constructed <b>limber</b> redundant and so a source of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|Suillus sibiricus {{has been}} {{recorded}} in parts of Europe, North America and Siberia. The fungus forms strict ectomycorrhizal associations with pines of the subgenus Strobus. These include Swiss pine (Pinus cembra) in the Alps and Tatras of central Europe, Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in the Balkans, western white pine (P.monticola) and <b>limber</b> pine (P.flexilis) in the Pacific Northwest of North America, P.banksiana in Quebec, Canada, and Siberian pine (P.sibirica) and Siberian dwarf pine (P.pumila) in Siberia and the Russian Far East. The range of the fungus is hence limited by {{the distribution of the}} host tree. S.sibiricus has also been shown to be able to form ectomycorrhizae with the Himalayan species P.wallichiana in pure culture conditions in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical to the carriage of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with caster wheels to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat was about two minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was not equipped with a <b>limber,</b> it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E
50|$|The Anzac Demolition Squadron were {{composed}} as follows:a) two rail demolition parties consisting of one officer and 53 other ranks with 10 pack horses and two half <b>limbers</b> carrying explosivesb) one bridge demolition party {{consisting of two}} officers and 70 other ranks with two pack horses and three half <b>limbers</b> carrying explosives.|$|R

50|$|The {{unit was}} {{equipped}} with two brass 6-pounder field guns; these guns had no <b>limbers,</b> restricting their movement. These guns hindered the primary function of the naval artillery, which {{was to provide a}} mobile shore battery for the defence of Fremantle Harbour. In 1889 these guns were replaced by two 9-pounder guns, complete with <b>limbers</b> and wagons. The Fremantle Naval Artillery was eventually disbanded and reformed as the Fremantle Artillery Volunteers.|$|R
5|$|The Land Warfare Hall {{was opened}} on 28 September 1992 by Field Marshal Lord Bramall. The {{building}} provides accommodation for the Imperial War Museum's collection of armoured vehicles, artillery and military vehicles. Also included are vehicles {{belonging to the}} Duxford Aviation Society Military Vehicle Section. The hall comprises a viewing balcony that runs {{for most of the}} length of the hall, providing views over a range of tableaux of vehicles, tanks and artillery that run chronologically from the First World War to the present day. Notable among the First World War exhibits is a battle-damaged artillery <b>limber</b> used by L Battery Royal Horse Artillery during an action at Néry in September 1914 where three Victoria Crosses were won. The Second World War in particular is illustrated with tableaux of the North African Campaign, the Eastern Front and the invasion of Normandy. Outside the building is a Whale floating roadway bridge span from Mulberry B harbour at Arromanches.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{elevation}} forests contain whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and <b>limber</b> pine, including the largest individual whitebark pine in North America. Based on tree ring chronologies, {{some of the}} whitebark pines {{are believed to be}} 700 to 1000 or more years old. The {{highest elevation}} forests typically have understories of grasses and forbs that are resistant to freezing at any point of the growing season. Willows, alders, cottonwoods, and sedges are found in riparian areas. Ponderosa pine occupy the dry, lower elevations near {{the western edge of the}} forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. In the slightly moister ponderosa pine forests grasses such as pinegrass are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.|$|E
5|$|All {{available}} lorries and camels were organised in convoys moving {{north from}} the railhead along the Gaza to Junction Station road from Deir el Belah to El Mejdel {{and then on}} to Julis, where the 26 and 27 Depot Unit of Supply (DUS) set up advanced supply dumps to serve the Australian Mounted Division and the Anzac Mounted Division. From these dumps the Transport Sections of 5 Company (New Zealand Army Service Corps) and the 32nd, 33rd, and 34th Companies (Australian Army Service Corps) served the Anzac Mounted Division, and the 35th, 36th, and 37th Companies served the Australian Mounted Division. These companies of horse- and mule-drawn wagons could operate to serve their brigades during brigade operations and when required could form into divisional trains during divisional operations. A forward lorry-head was established at Ramleh, where the loads were dumped and the Transport Companies distributed the supplies to the forward units. Members of the Egyptian Labour Corps (as second drivers) worked alongside the Australian Army Service Corps transporting, loading, and unloading the General Service and <b>Limber</b> wagons of supplies ordered by the brigades. The huge endeavour was administered by the supply sections in a similar fashion to the divisional ammunition columns which also worked to supply ammunition to the fighting units in a similarly continuous operation.|$|E

5|$|The French were fast {{to bring}} up and deploy the fresh troops in front of San Giuliano, and the Austrians were slow to mount their attack. Boudet and the 9ème Légère (9th Light Infantry Regiment) were quickly {{moved on to the}} exit from the main vine belt, where they {{surprised}} the head of Saint-Julien’s column. As the Austrian infantry deployed {{on the south side of}} the road, the 9ème Légère conducted a steady withdrawal for 30 minutes back to Desaix’s position. There he had placed GdB Louis Charles de Guénand’s brigade on the north side while most of the remaining French army (Monnier and Lannes) were forming up north from there. The Austrians deployed three artillery batteries on the north side of the road supported by a dragoon regiment. GdB Auguste de Marmont massed the remaining French cannon against the Austrians as they advanced. Boudet's division advanced in line of brigades against the head of the Austrian column, defeating Saint-Julien's leading Austrian brigade. Zach brought forward GM Latterman's grenadier brigade in line and renewed the attack. Faced with a crisis, Napoleon sent Desaix forward again and ordered a cavalry charge requested by Desaix. The 9ème Légère halted to face the main Austrian advance and Marmont's guns blasted the Austrians with grapeshot at close range. Further back, an Austrian ammunition <b>limber</b> exploded. In the temporary heightening of confusion, Lattermann's formation was charged on its left flank by Kellermann's heavy cavalry (ca. 400 men) and disintegrated. At the decisive moment of the battle, Desaix was shot from his horse. Zach and at least 2,000 of his men were taken prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{altitude}} in Grand Teton National Park impacts {{the types of}} plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line {{to the base of}} the mountains, whitebark pine, <b>limber</b> pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.|$|E
25|$|In 1803 the Year XI {{system was}} {{introduced}} {{but it was}} only half-way established by 1809. The Year XI system included 6- and 12-pounder cannons and 5½-inch and 6⅓-inch howitzers. Gribeauval field artillery continued to be used however. In 1829 France adopted the Valée system which reduced the calibers of field artillery to 8- and 12-pound cannons and 24-pound and 6-inch howitzers. Mobility was improved by building only two <b>limber</b> sizes. The 8-pounders and 24-pound howitzers employed the smaller <b>limber</b> while 12-pounders and 6-inch howitzers used the larger <b>limber.</b> Instead of having to march beside the guns, the Valée system allowed all gunners to ride into action while sitting on the limbers. All batteries were standardized at four cannons and two howitzers.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon {{determined}} {{to replace the}} 8-pounders with {{a larger proportion of}} 12-pounders. In 1803 with the Year XI system, France began to cast new 6-pounder and 12-pounder cannons and 5½-inch and 6⅓-inch howitzers. By 1809 the new system was only partly established. In 1829 France adopted the Valée system which reduced the calibers of field artillery to 8- and 12-pound cannons and 24-pound and 6-inch howitzers. All batteries were organized with four cannons and two howitzers. Mobility was increased by standardizing <b>limber</b> sizes so that 8-pounders and 24-pound howitzers used the smaller <b>limber</b> while 12-pounders and 6-inch howitzers used the larger <b>limber.</b> The gunners no longer had to walk beside the guns; instead they rode into action while sitting atop the limbers.|$|E
25|$|The gun {{could be}} towed by an {{artillery}} tractor or by a horse team. In the latter case, a 400-kg <b>limber</b> was used.|$|E

50|$|It was {{generally}} similar in design to Krupp's 21 cm Mrs 18, but had an improved carriage that sped up emplacement and displacement times. It was transported in the customary two loads - barrel and carriage, although the carriage rode on two <b>limbers.</b> Each {{end of the}} carriage had inclined under-surfaces that rode on the <b>limbers.</b> When winched apart or together, those inclined surfaces allowed the carriage to easily raise out of or lower into position. It fired from a central platform stabilized by three jacks, which allowed all-around traverse.|$|R

25|$|The Mle 1915 was a {{conventional}} design with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system mounted under the barrel, a gun shield {{to protect the}} crew and a box carriage with wooden wheels. It used an interrupted-screw breech with separate-loading ammunition; the shell being loaded first followed by the proper amount of propellant in a brass cartridge case. A loading tray was hinged {{to the left side}} of the cradle. It was swung into position after the breech had opened to hold the shell before it was pushed into the chamber, which had a catch to hold the shell in place until it could be rammed, but had to be moved out of the way before the breech could be closed for firing. It could be towed by a team of eight horses if a two-wheeled <b>limber</b> was placed under the trail and the barrel pulled back along the trail to move the center of gravity towards the <b>limber.</b> For (slow) motor-traction no <b>limber</b> was necessary and the trail was hooked directly to the tractor.|$|E

25|$|Mountain pine beetles inhabit ponderosa, whitebark, lodgepole, Scotch, jack pine, and <b>limber</b> pine trees. Normally, these insects play an {{important}} role in the life of a forest, attacking old or weakened trees, and speeding development of a younger forest.

25|$|The Valée system {{consisted}} {{in various}} technical {{improvements to the}} Gribeauval system and Napoleon I's Year XI system. The system mainly improved the mobility of the artillery train, and simplified maintenance by standardizing <b>limber</b> usage and wheel size, and {{reducing the number of}} carriage types to two.
