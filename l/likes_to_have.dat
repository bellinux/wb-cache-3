It is now traditional for the entire front row of an Edinburgh audience to place their shoes upon the stage during the interval, which causes Noble much amusement when he returns.|$|E

They were excited to meet people from small towns and see how America really lives. However, the initial {{excitement}} quickly wore off. The friends had minor meltdowns and fought for control over the radio; King <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> music constantly playing while driving, Winfrey prefers silence. Despite {{the challenges of the}} road trip, they got to see the beauty of Sedona, meet the people of Navajo Nation, crash a couple of weddings, take a dip in the healing waters of Pagosa Springs, and learn about Amish culture. Winfrey's many driving anxieties and King's tone-deaf singing made the trip a huge hit with viewers.|$|E

Inspired by Gaga's [...] "Fear of Self Monster", the song deals with the intimate experience between two people alone in a bedroom.

She explained that she came across such women while working on the MAC AIDS Fund, and that the song is not about freedom, but rather the assurance that Gaga understood their feelings.

He had a wonderful physique – was big and powerful yet very active. Nevers was the mental type every coach <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> on his football team.

She <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> order, rules, and control in her life. [...] Other characters in the show, such as Joy's own mother, believe that her obsession with control is how she copes with denial of her own out-of-control life, her daughter George's death, her younger daughter's rather unconventional style of grieving over George's death, and her divorce from her husband. In the episode where her mother comes to visit, however, {{it becomes clear that}} Joy's problems stem more from the chaotic lifestyle and abandonment issues of her own childhood.|$|E
