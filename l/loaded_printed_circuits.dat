40|$|A {{new type}} of {{one-dimensional}} leaky-wave antenna (LWA) with independent control of the beam-pointing angle and beamwidth is presented. The antenna {{is based on a}} simple structure composed of a bulk parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) <b>loaded</b> with two <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> boards (PCBs), each one consisting of an array of printed dipoles. One PCB acts as a partially reflective surface (PRS), and the other grounded PCB behaves as a high impedance surface (HIS). It is shown that an independent control of the leaky-mode phase and leakage rate can be achieved by changing the lengths of the PRS and HIS dipoles, thus resulting in a flexible adjustment of the LWA pointing direction and directivity. The leaky-mode dispersion curves are obtained with a simple Transverse Equivalent Network (TEN), and they are validated with three-dimensional full-wave simulations. Experimental results on fabricated prototypes operating at 15 GHz are reported, demonstrating the versatile and independent control of the LWA performance by changing the PRS and HIS parameters. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A {{software}} tool {{is presented to}} help in the teaching of the electromagnetic theory of open dielectric waveguides. The study of the modal spectrum of canonical closed waveguides is a basic topic in any course of electromagnetics or microwave engineering. However, surface-wave modes and leaky-wave modes in open waveguides are not yet so well known in the academic environment. Nevertheless, this study is necessary, since novel open dielectric waveguides have been proposed for millimeter-wave and optical electronics {{in order to reduce the}} conductor losses. Therefore, the comprehension of the phenomenon of leaky-wave modes and behavior is indispensable for any future microwave engineer, who has to work with the new millimeter-wave and optical technologies. This program constitutes the first tool explicitly conceived to help the teaching of the working principles of open dielectric guides <b>loaded</b> with <b>printed</b> <b>circuits,</b> and the associated practical leaky-wave antennas (LWAs). The code can be a very good supplement to understand how practical leaky-wave antennas work, after a basic theoretical understanding of leaky waves has been first obtained. From the appearance of leaky-wave modes in open waveguides to the design of a backward-to-forward leaky-wave antenna, some simple and very clarifying step-by-step exercises are presented to illustrate these not-so-well-known concepts. Although the program refers to a specific type of open dielectric guides (laterally-shielded, top-open, stub-loaded, rectangular dielectric waveguides with planar perturbations), the results are applicable to any open dielectric guide, helping to teach the basic theory and topics relating to leaky- and surface-wave modes in uniform and periodic structure...|$|R

50|$|When Sarmanian {{launched}} the company, most computer and electronics manufacturers were fabricating their own boards. Independent suppliers, however, became increasingly efficient and were proving a more cost-effective solution {{for a broad}} range of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board applications. Likewise, computer and electronics manufacturers became more comfortable using suppliers for key electronic components, including <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> boards. Reductions in time to market, engineering/prototyping costs, and manufacturing ramp-up costs were being demonstrated by these suppliers to win business. In 1979, 40% of all rigid <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board fabrication was being outsourced to suppliers like PCC. By 1989, that figure was about 60%, and by 1995, 80%. By 2001, 98% of all <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board production was going to external suppliers.

Owing to the diversity of materials and components, the separation process is difficult, which results in complex and expensive recovery of precious materials and electronic components from waste <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> boards.
