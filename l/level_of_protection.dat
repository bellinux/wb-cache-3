5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E
5|$|The most {{usual way}} in the 15th century for a patron to {{commission}} a piece was to visit a master's workshop. Only {{a certain number of}} masters could operate within any city's bounds; they were regulated by artisan guilds to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. Guilds protected and regulated painting, overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply; and they maintained discrete sets of rules for panel painters, cloth painters and book illuminators. For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel painters enjoyed the highest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> with cloth painters ranking below.|$|E
5|$|Government {{troops were}} {{stationed}} at Aberdour Castle during the Jacobite Rising of 1715. During their stay, a second fire again caused extensive damage. In 1725, the Mortons bought an adjacent property, Cuttlehill House, which they renamed Aberdour House, and the castle {{ceased to be}} a residence. The east range was again repaired, and was used for various purposes, including a school room, a barracks, and a masonic hall. In 1924 the castle and gardens were placed in state care, and continue to be managed by Historic Scotland as a visitor attraction. The south-east wing was initially restored as a home for the custodian, and now houses a cafe. The castle is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the castle, dovecot and walled garden are Category A listed buildings, the highest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> for a historic building in Scotland. The grounds, and surrounding former parks, are listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national register of significant gardens.|$|E

5|$|Runoff {{from the}} heavily wooded {{monument}} forms small headwater streams of the Illinois River, a major {{tributary of the}} Rogue River.

Supplemented by water entering the cave from above, the stream emerges from the main entrance as Cave Creek. Within the cave, Cave Creek {{is known as the}} River Styx, named for the river Styx of Greek mythology connecting Earth to the Underworld. In late 2014, Congress added the River Styx to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, which added a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> aimed at keeping the stream free-flowing in perpetuity.

5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

40|$|Trade {{treaties}} {{have introduced}} {{the principle that}} similar risks should be treated similarly, and that countries must achieve internal consistency in the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> they afford against certain hazards within their territories. The {{problem is that there}} is no agreement on when risks are 2 ̆ 2 similar 2 ̆ 2 or when <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> are 2 ̆ 2 consistent. 2 ̆ 2 The danger is that in resolving these issues, international trade institutions will infringe on the political sovereignty of their Members. This Article proposes a science-based solution. A substantial body of scientific research establishes that a person 2 ̆ 7 s judgments about the risk posed by a hazard are influenced by a number of factors, including certain characteristics of the hazard itself, scientific uncertainty in the evidence about the risk. This Article argues that such factors should also be relevant to deciding whether a country is being consistent in setting its <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> International trade institutions that ignore such factors imperil their own success and legitimacy, and do so unnecessarily. General and specific empirical studies can provide a neutral means <b>of</b> deciding whether <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> are risk-based or are merely disguised restrictions on international trade...|$|R
