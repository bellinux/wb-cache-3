Subjects and Methods: This study included 107 consecutive patients (67 males, mean age: 57. 8 ± 9. 7 years) who underwent PV mapping and ablation due to symptomatic drug-refractory AF. The first 43 patients underwent isolation of both ipsilateral PVs using the Carto-Merge 3 dimensional mapping system (group 1). The other 64 patients underwent isolation of both ipsilateral PVs using the same technique with a large-sized (a diameter of 30 to 35 mm) <b>Lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> (group 2). When ipsilateral PVs did not show any potential after the initial circumferential ablation, we defined this as ‘immediate complete antral isolation (ICAI) ’. We compared the AF recurrence rate of both groups. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} of the clinical characteristics between group 1 and group 2. All the patients were followed-up for 1 year. The ICAI rate of group 1 and group 2 was significantly different (21 % vs. 78 %, p< 0. 001), and the AF recurrence rates of group 1 and group 2 were also different (34. 9 % vs. 18. 8 %, p= 0. 042). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of a large-sized <b>Lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> was a significant predictive factor for preventing recurrence (odds ratio: 0. 489, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 136 - 0. 927).

40|$|Purpose: X-ray fluoroscopically guided cardiac {{electrophysiology}} (EP) {{procedures are}} commonly {{carried out to}} treat patients with arrhythmias. X-ray images have poor soft tissue contrast and, for this reason, overlay of a three-dimensional (3 D) roadmap derived from preprocedural volumetric images {{can be used to}} add anatomical information. It is useful to know the position of the catheter electrodes relative to the cardiac anatomy, for example, to record ablation therapy locations during atrial fibrillation therapy. Also, the electrode positions of the coronary sinus (CS) catheter or <b>lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> can be used for road map motion correction. Methods: In this paper, the authors present a novel unified computational framework for image-based catheter detection and tracking without any user interaction. The proposed framework includes fast blob detection, shape-constrained searching and model-based detection. In addition, catheter tracking methods were designed based on the customized catheter models input from the detection method. Three real-time detection and tracking methods are derived from the computational framework to detect or track the three most common types of catheters in EP procedures: the ablation catheter, the CS catheter, and the <b>lasso</b> <b>catheter.</b> Since the proposed methods use the same blob detection method to extract key information from x-ray images, the ablation, CS, and lasso catheters can be detected and tracked simultaneously in real-time. Results: The catheter detection methods were tested on 105 different clinical fluoroscopy sequences taken from 31 clinical procedures. Two-dimensional (2 D) detection errors of 0. 50 ± 0. 29, 0. 92 ± 0. 61, and 0. 63 ± 0. 45 mm as well as success rates of 99. 4 %, 97. 2 %, and 88. 9 % were achieved for the CS catheter, ablation catheter, and <b>lasso</b> <b>catheter,</b> respectively. With the tracking method, accuracies were increased to 0. 45 ± 0. 28, 0. 64 ± 0. 37, and 0. 53 ± 0. 38 mm and success rates increased to 100 %, 99. 2 %, and 96. 5 % for the CS, ablation, and lasso catheters, respectively. Subjective clinical evaluation by three experienced electrophysiologists showed that the detection and tracking results were clinically acceptable. Conclusions: The proposed detection and tracking methods are automatic and can detect and track CS, ablation, and lasso catheters simultaneously and in real-time. The accuracy of the proposed methods is sub-mm and the methods are robust toward low-dose x-ray fluoroscopic images, which are mainly used during EP procedures to maintain low radiation dose...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary Vein Conduction During Cryoballoon Ablation. Introduction: Cryoballoon (CB) {{ablation}} {{represents a}} novel technology for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We investigated feasibility {{and safety of}} CB-PVI, utilizing a novel spiral catheter (SC), thereby obtaining real-time PV potential registration. Methods: Following double transseptal puncture, a <b>Lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) and the 28 mm CB were positioned within the left atrium. A novel SC (Promap, ProRhythm Inc., Ronkonkoma, NY, USA) was inserted through the lumen of the CB allowing PV signal registration during treatment. Time to PV conduction block was analyzed. If no stable balloon position was obtained, the SC was exchanged for a regular guide wire and PV conduction was assessed after treatment by <b>Lasso</b> <b>catheter.</b> Results: In 18 patients, 39 of 72 PVs (54 %) were successfully isolated using the SC. The remaining 33 PVs were isolated switching to the regular guide wire. Time to PV conduction block was significantly shorter in PVs in which sustained PVI was achieved as compared to PVs in which PV conduction recovered within 30 minutes (33 +/- 21 seconds vs 99 +/- 65 seconds). In 40 PVs, time to PV conduction block was not obtained because of: (1) PVI not being achieved during initial treatment; (2) a distal position of the SC; or (3) isolation with regular guide wire. No procedural complications occurred. Conclusion: Visualization of real-time PV conduction during CB PVI is safe, feasible, and allows accurate timing of PVI onset in a subset of PVs. Time to PV conduction block predicts sustained PVI. However, mechanical properties of the SC need to be improved to further simplify CB PVI.

40|$|Abstract. Radio-frequency {{catheter}} ablation of the pulmonary veins {{attached to}} the left atrium is usually carried out under fluoroscopy guidance. Two-dimensional X-ray navigation may involve overlay im-ages derived from a static pre-operative 3 -D volumetric data set to add anatomical details. However, respiratory motion may impair the utility of static overlay images for catheter navigation. We developed a system for image-based 3 -D motion estimation and compensation {{as a solution to}} this problem for which no previous solution is yet known. It is based on 3 -D catheter tracking involving 2 -D/ 3 -D registration. A biplane X-ray C-arm system is used to image a special circumferential (<b>lasso)</b> <b>catheter</b> from two directions. In the first step of the method, a 3 -D model of the device is reconstructed. 3 -D respiratory motion at the site of ablation is then estimated by tracking the reconstructed model in 3 -D from bi-plane fluoroscopy. In our experiments, the circumferential catheter was tracked in 231 biplane fluoro frames (462 monoplane fluoro frames) with an average 2 -D tracking error of 1. 0 mm ± 0. 5 mm. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{indications}} for catheter ablation {{have been}} {{expanded to include}} persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) to enable {{a high degree of}} sinus rhythm maintenance. We occasionally encounter patients undergoing pacemaker implantation in whom sick sinus syndrome became clinically evident after ablation. This study investigated whether underlying sinus node dysfunction (SND) during persistent AF can be predicted before deciding the indications for ablation. Methods and resultsIn total, 87 consecutive patients with persistent AF who underwent catheter ablation between January 2010 and July 2011 were enrolled in the study. Nocturnal polysomnography as well as transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography were performed in all patients before ablation. We used the double <b>Lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> and electroanatomical mapping-guided extensive encircling pulmonary vein isolation (EEPVI) method. We performed electrophysiological studies after EEPVI, and SND was defined as a corrected SN recovery time of ≥ 550 ms. SND was detected in 42 (48 %) patients (SND group); the other patients showed normal sinus node function (NSN group). The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was significantly greater in the SND group than in the NSN group (25. 7 ± 13 vs. 17. 5 ± 11, p= 0. 002). Multivariate analysis revealed that moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing (defined as AHI≥ 15) was an independent predictor of SND after catheter ablation for persistent AF. ConclusionThe results suggest that underlying SND in patients with persistent AF can be predicted by evaluating sleep-disordered breathing before catheter ablation...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of a novel cryothermal balloon ablation system in creating pulmonary vein (PV) isolation. BackgroundPulmonary vein isolation using standard radiofrequency ablation techniques is limited by procedure-related complications, such as thrombus formation and PV stenosis. Cryothermal ablation may {{reduce the risk of}} such complications. MethodsEight dogs underwent circumferential ablation of both superior PVs for either 4 or 8 min using a cryothermal balloon catheter (CryoCath Technologies Inc., Kirkland, Canada). Both fluoroscopy and intracardiac ultrasound (ICE) -guided balloon and <b>Lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> positioning at the PV ostia assessed short-term PV integrity. In six additional dogs, long-term PV integrity was assessed by computed tomography at 16 weeks after ablation. ResultsSuccessful electrical isolation was achieved acutely in 14 of 16 (87. 5 %) PVs and was confirmed in one-week survival studies in 10 of 12 (83 %) PVs. Successful isolation was higher {{in the absence of any}} peri-balloon flow leak as seen by ICE (p = 0. 015), and with balloon temperatures ≤− 80 °C (p = 0. 015). Cryolesions were located at the veno-atrial junction and were homogeneous, with intact endothelium and free of thrombus formation. Although limited angiographic PV narrowing was noted in the early follow-up period, no significant PV narrowing was seen long-term. Right phrenic nerve injury was seen in 50 % of the animals studied at one week. ConclusionsThis novel cryothermal balloon ablation system is effective for isolating PVs, but injury to the right phrenic nerve was noted in this early experience. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of this technique...|$|E
40|$|Real time {{spectrum}} analysis of signals obtained through <b>lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> during radiofrequency ablation of pulmonary vein {{was performed to}} determine the channel with dominant frequency. Threshold algorithm was used for signals which {{could be classified as}} type I and type II AF. Type III AF Signals which were highly fractionated or differentiated were evaluated for frequency content by performing Fast Fourier Transform. Data from Seven patients was collected and an episode of 180 ± 40 seconds was recorded and analyzed for each pulmonary vein that showed electrical activation. Frequency spectra for one second segment of signal for each channel were determined. The frequencies of channels were then compared to determine the channel with highest or dominant frequency. In most cases the frequency of a single channel varied erratically between 1 to 10 Hz for every subsequent one second segment which made DF detection among the channels unreliable and a single channel with dominant frequency could not be determined. A five second averaging for each channel did not produce a stable DF output and improvement was minimal. The erratic frequency behavior could be attributed to the spatial shift of micro- reentrant circuits or temporal variation in waveform over lap at the point of detection. To determine the DF more precisely either an increase in number of electrode or increase in time segment block for DF calculation is warranted. Increasing the time segment block will defeat the purpose of real time analysis thus an increase in number of electrode mapping the area of interest would be appropriate to resolve the issue...|$|E
40|$|Segmentation of {{the left}} atrium is vital for {{pre-operative}} assessment of its anatomy in radio-frequency catheter ablation (RFCA) surgery. RFCA is commonly used for treating atrial fibrillation. In this paper we present an semi-automatic approach for segmenting the left atrium and the pulmonary veins from MR angiography (MRA) data sets. We also present an automatic approach for further subdividing the segmented atrium into the atrium body and the pulmonary veins. The segmentation algorithm {{is based on the}} notion that in MRA the atrium becomes connected to surrounding structures via partial volume affected voxels and narrow vessels, the atrium can be separated if these regions are characterized and identified. The blood pool, obtained by subtracting the pre- and post-contrast scans, is first segmented using a regiongrowing approach. The segmented blood pool is then subdivided into disjoint subdivisions based on its Euclidean distance transform. These subdivisions are then merged automatically starting from a seed point and stopping at points where the atrium leaks into a neighbouring structure. The resulting merged subdivisions produce the segmented atrium. Measuring the size of the pulmonary vein ostium is vital for selecting the optimal <b>Lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> diameter. We present a second technique for automatically identifying the atrium body from segmented left atrium images. The separating surface between the atrium body and the pulmonary veins gives the ostia locations and can {{play an important role in}} measuring their diameters. The technique relies on evolving interfaces modelled using level sets. Results have been presented on 20 patient MRA datasets...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of left atrial {{scarring}} (LAS) on the outcome of patients undergoing pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) for atrial fibrillation (AF). BackgroundLeft atrial scarring may be responsible for both the perpetuation and genesis of AF. MethodsA total of 700 consecutive patients undergoing first-time PVAI were studied. Before ablation, extensive voltage mapping of the left atrium (LA) was performed using a multipolar <b>Lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> guided by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). Patients with LAS were defined by a complete absence of electrographic recording by a circular mapping catheter in multiple LA locations, and this was validated by electroanatomic mapping. All four pulmonary vein antra and the superior vena cava were isolated using an ICE-guided technique. Patients were followed at least nine months for late AF recurrence. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the predictive value of LAS and other variables on outcome. ResultsOf 700 patients, 42 had LAS, which represented 21 ± 11 % of the LA surface area by electroanatomic mapping. Patients with LAS had a significantly higher AF recurrence (57 %) compared with non-LAS patients (19 %, p = 0. 003). Also, LAS was associated with a significantly larger LA size, lower ejection fraction, and higher C-reactive protein levels. Univariate analysis revealed age, nonparoxysmal AF, and LAS as predictors of recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed LAS as the only independent predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio 3. 4, 95 % confidence interval 1. 3 to 9. 4; p = 0. 01). ConclusionsPre-existent LAS in patients undergoing PVAI for AF is a powerful, independent predictor of procedural failure. Left atrial scarring is associated with a lower EF, larger LA size, and increased inflammatory markers...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comThe differentiation of pulmonary vein (PV) electrograms from atrial far-field signals during PV isolation (PVI) for atrial fibrillation (AF) may be difficult. In addition, owing to highly variable PV ostial sizes, current fixed-diameter circular PV mapping catheters may not yield optimal electrograms. We evaluated an expandable, circular 15 – 25 mm diameter, 20 -pole mapping catheter for PV mapping during sustained AF in 25 patients. After selective PV angiography to define the ostial position and size, the catheter was introduced into each PV and withdrawn to the most stable proximal position, with optimal wall contact ensured by progressive loop expansion. At each PV ostium, electrograms recorded at high resolution (HR) were compared with those recorded at a resolution {{similar to that of}} a standard 10 -pole <b>Lasso</b> <b>catheter.</b> After PVI performed during ongoing AF, the presence of residual far-field potentials (FFP) under both set-ups was compared. We mapped 97 PV, including 4 pairs with common ostia. In the HR recordings, the PV potentials had greater amplitude (0. 5 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 3 ± 0. 1 mV, P = 0. 001) and fragmentation, whereas left atrial FFP were minimized. After successful isolation of all PV, FFP were observed in 33 % of left superior and 28 % of left inferior PV on the HR recordings, compared to 66 % and 61 %, respectively under normal resolution. Catheter stability and optimal wall contact, in combination with HR electrograms can optimize circumferential PV mapping during AF and improve the discrimination of FFP postablation.

40|$|Background : Short-term oucomes of {{radiofrequency}} (RF) catheter {{isolation of}} the pulmonary veins (PVs) in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (PAF/PEAF) are encouraging. However, long-term outcomes are not well defined. Therefore, we evaluated 3 – 5 -year outcomes in our series of patients. Freedom from symptomatic AF/flutter/tachycardia recurrences with patients off antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) was considered a treatment success. Methods : Consecutive patients with symptomatic PAF/PEAF and AAD failure, without significant structural heart disease, were prospectively recruited between September 2003 and November 2009. Irrigated-tip RF ablation catheter and <b>Lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> were used after standard trans-septal approach with X-ray fluoroscopic guidance. Ablation endpoints were: complete segmental/circumferential ostial and antral electrical PV isolation, non-PV foci ablation, and bi-directional flutter isthmus (FI) block when indicated. The procedure was repeated if AF/flutter/tachycardia recurred after 3 -month blanking period. The suspected arrhythmia recurrences were evaluated by series of ECG/Holter recordings. Data were analyzed by t-, chi-square, and Fisher’s exact tests. P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results : In 126 patients, median age 55 years (range 19 – 75), 94 men (75 %), 86 with PAF and 40 with PEAF (31 %), 207 procedures were performed: single in 63 (50 %), double in 48 (38 %), and multiple in 15. FI was ablated in 53 patients (42 %). Tamponade occurred in 4 (3 %). No PV stenosis, esophageal injury, or stroke were detected clinically in 115 patients (91 %) during 36 -month (13 – 89) follow-up. We achieved treatment success in 69 patients (61 %), partial success with a significant reduction of AF/flutter/tachycardia recurrences on AAD in 13 patients (12 %), and in 33 patients (27 %) the procedure was not successful. Overall, 73 % of our patients had long-term benefit. Outcomes were better in patients with PAF vs. PEAF (84 % vs. 48 %, p < 0, 001), in younger age, in those without concomitant diseases, and in those with normal PV anatomy. These results were maintained in the subgroup of 58 patients over 56 months of follow-up: 35 (60 %), 6 (11 %), and 17 (29 %), respectively. Conclusions : Lasso-guided RF irrigated-tip segmental/circumferential PV isolation is a safe and long-term successful treatment of PAF {{in the majority of}} our patients. The method needs improvements in patients with PEAF, possibly with the introduction of new technologies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound Current Source Density Imaging (UCSDI) is a noninvasive {{modality}} for mapping electrical {{activities in}} the body (brain and heart) in 4 -dimensions (space + time). Conventional cardiac mapping technologies for guiding the radiofrequency ablation procedure for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias have certain limitations. UCSDI can potentially overcome these limitations and enhance the electrophysiology mapping of the heart. UCSDI exploits the acoustoelectric (AE) effect, an interaction between ultrasound pressure and electrical resistivity. When an ultrasound beam intersects a current path in a material, the local resistivity of the material is modulated by the ultrasonic pressure, and a change in voltage signal can be detected based on Ohm's Law. The degree of modulation {{is determined by the}} AE interaction constant K. K is a fundamental property of any type of material, and directly affects the amplitude of the AE signal detected in UCSDI. UCSDI requires detecting a small AE signal associated with electrocardiogram. So sensitivity becomes a major challenge for transferring UCSDI to the clinic. This dissertation will determine the limits of sensitivity and resolution for UCSDI, balancing the tradeoff between them by finding the optimal parameters for electrical cardiac mapping, and finally test the optimized system in a realistic setting. This work begins by describing a technique for measuring K, the AE interaction constant, in ionic solution and biological tissue, and reporting the value of K in excised rabbit cardiac tissue for the first time. K was found to be strongly dependent on concentration for the divalent salt CuSO₄, but not for the monovalent salt NaCl, consistent with their different chemical properties. In the rabbit heart tissue, K was determined to be 0. 041 ± 0. 012 %/MPa, similar to the measurement of K in physiologic saline: 0. 034 ± 0. 003 %/MPa. Next, this dissertation investigates the sensitivity limit of UCSDI by quantifying the relation between the recording electrode distance and the measured AE signal amplitude in gel phantoms and excised porcine heart tissue using a clinical intracardiac catheter. Sensitivity of UCSDI with catheter was 4. 7 μV/mA (R² = 0. 999) in cylindrical gel (0. 9 % NaCl), and 3. 2 μV/mA (R² = 0. 92) in porcine heart tissue. The AE signal was detectable more than 25 mm away from the source in cylindrical gel (0. 9 % NaCl). Effect of transducer properties on UCSDI sensitivity is also investigated using simulation. The optimal ultrasound transducer parameters chosen for cardiac imaging are center frequency = 0. 5 MHz and f/number = 1. 4. Last but not least, this dissertation shows the result of implementing the optimized ultrasound parameters in live rabbit heart preparation, the comparison of different recording electrode configuration and multichannel UCSDI recording and reconstruction. The AE signal detected using the 0. 5 MHz transducer was much stronger (2. 99 μV/MPa) than the 1. 0 MHz transducer (0. 42 μV/MPa). The clinical <b>lasso</b> <b>catheter</b> placed on the epicardium exhibited excellent sensitivity without being too invasive. 3 -dimensional cardiac activation maps of the live rabbit heart using only one pair of recording electrodes were also demonstrated for the first time. Cardiac conduction velocity for atrial (1. 31 m/s) and apical (0. 67 m/s) pacing were calculated based on the activation maps. The future outlook of this dissertation includes integrating UCSDI with 2 -dimensional ultrasound transducer array for fast imaging, and developing a multi-modality catheter with 4 -dimensional UCSDI, multi-electrode recording and echocardiography capacity...|$|E
