50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, the Texas Maritime Academy took {{delivery}} of the USNS Sirius. Built in 1966 as a replenishment ship for the Royal Navy and purchased by the U.S. Navy as a logistics ship, it supported two carrier battle groups in the Indian Ocean during the Iranian hostage crisis and continued its career in the Navy serving across the world, notably in the Persian Gulf. It was retired and given to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration (MARAD), then assigned to TAMUG under an agreement {{that it can be}} activated by MARAD at any time. During the fall of 2005, the Sirius served in New Orleans for Katrina relief, from September 10 until November 29 and at Lake Charles, LA for Rita relief until March 2. Because of its extended relief effort the Sirius was unable to undergo a refit in 2006 to adapt its new role as a training vessel and comply with U.S. Coast Guard safety standards. Because the Sirius had not undergone a refit, it could not be formally commissioned as the USTS Texas Clipper nor could it be used for summer training cruises. This is forcing the University to look to the other state maritime academies (California Maritime Academy from 2006-present) to help fulfill the summer cruise requirements until the work on the Sirius was completed. In the winter of 2009 the US Coast Guard ruled that the Sirius was unfit for training and was prepared for decommissioning while the school looked for a new training ship. On June 25, 2009, the Sirius was returned to the U.S. Maritime Administration.In 2009, the academy acquired the S.S. Cape Gibson. The academy trained on this ship while it was docked at the campus, but was again unable to sail on her until a refit was done. In 2012, The vessel was towed to the government's navy reserve fleet near Beaumont and replaced with the TS General Rudder. The academy's own General Rudder was the first vessel since 2005 that it was able complete summer training cruises on. The <b>limiting</b> <b>size</b> of the vessel (64 personal) however means a good majority of the cadets still sail with other maritime academies.|$|E

40|$|The {{spurious}} {{interaction of}} quantum systems with their environment known as decoherence leads, {{as a function}} of time, to a decay of coherence of superposition states. Since the interactions between system and environment are local, they can also cause a loss of spatial coherence: correlations between spatially distant parts of the system are lost and the equilibrium states can become localized. This effect limits the distance over which quantum information can be transmitted, e. g., along a spin chain. We investigate this issue in a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator, where it is possible to monitor the spreading of quantum information in a three-dimensional network: states that are initially localized on individual spins (qubits) spread under the influence of a suitable Hamiltonian apparently without limits. If we add a perturbation to this Hamiltonian, the spreading stops and the system reaches a <b>limiting</b> <b>size,</b> which becomes smaller as the strength of the perturbation increases. This <b>limiting</b> <b>size</b> appears to represent a dynamical equilibrium. We present a phenomenological model to describe these results. Comment: 12 pages, 13 figures. Revised versio...|$|E

40|$|By {{balancing}} the average energy gap with its typical change due to mutations for protein-like heteropolymers with M residues, {{we show that}} native states are unstable to mutations on a scale M* ~ (lambda/sigma_mu) ^(1 /zeta_s), where lambda is the dispersion in the interaction free energies and sigma_mu their typical change. Theoretical bounds and numerical estimates (based on complete enumeration on four lattices) of the instability exponent zeta_s are given. Our analysis suggests that a <b>limiting</b> <b>size</b> of single-domain proteins should exist, and leads to the prediction that small proteins are insensitive to random mutations.

This result implies that, under these assumptions, any test with nontrivial power will exhibit size distortions.

40|$|ABSTRACT Domains within fluid {{membranes}} grow by the aggregation {{of molecules}} which diffuse laterally within the membrane matrix. A simple theoretical model is introduced which predicts that a flat or weakly curved domain becomes unstable {{at a certain}} <b>limiting</b> <b>size</b> and then undergoes a budding or invagination process. This instability {{is driven by the}} competition between the bending energy of the domain and the line tension of the domain edge. For lipid bilayers, the budding domain can rupture the membrane and then it pinches off from the matrix.

Com-parisons are made between the mass-number relationship found experimentally and the relationship calculated from theoretical considerations. The mass concentration found experimentally to correspond to a given particle concentration is considerably greater than would be expected on theoretical grounds. This could be due to incorrect assumptions about particle shape factors in the theoretical treatment but there is evidence to suggest that some of the discrepancy is due to incorrect operation of the gravimetric size selectors and that they may accept particles considerably larger than their intended <b>limiting</b> <b>size...</b>|$|E

Although voltammograms show multiple cathodic waves, it is {{shown that they}} all result from the reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(0) {{and there is no}} evidence for Pt(II) as a stable intermediate at any potential; the multiple waves arise because the hexachloroplatinic acid exists in solution as a mixture of kinetically inert Cl?/H 2 O complexes.
