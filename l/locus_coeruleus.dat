5|$|The {{input to}} the {{hippocampus}} (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) {{comes from the}} entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|There {{are dozens}} of other {{chemical}} neurotransmitters {{that are used in}} more limited areas of the brain, often areas dedicated to a particular function. Serotonin, for example—the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei. Norepinephrine, which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus.</b> Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus.</b> Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} receives many inputs {{from the}} brainstem, {{the most notable}} from {{the nucleus of the}} solitary tract, the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus,</b> and the ventrolateral medulla.|$|E
25|$|Post-traumatic stress disorder, Parkinson's disease, REM {{behavior}} disorder: Patients {{with these}} syndromes exhibit a significant (>50%) {{decrease in the}} number of <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> (LC) neurons, resulting is increased disinhibition of the PPN.|$|E
25|$|According to Cloninger, the {{norepinephrine}} neurotransmitter has {{its major}} ascending pathways arising in the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> in the pons, projecting onward to the hypothalamic and limbic structures, and then branching upwards to the neocortex.|$|E
25|$|Its {{mechanism}} of action {{in the treatment of}} ADHD is to increase noradrenergic tone in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) directly by binding to postsynaptic α2A adrenergic receptors and indirectly by increasing norepinephrine input from the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The pontomesencephalotegmental complex acts {{mainly on}} M1 receptors in the brainstem, deep {{cerebellar}} nuclei, pontine nuclei, <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus,</b> raphe nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus and inferior olive. It also projects to the thalamus, tectum, basal ganglia and basal forebrain.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} hypothalamic {{function is}} responsive to—and regulated by—levels {{of all three}} classical monoamine neurotransmitters, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), in those tracts from which it receives innervation. For example, noradrenergic inputs arising from the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> have important regulatory effects upon corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels.|$|E
25|$|Stimulants used {{to treat}} ADHD raise the {{extracellular}} concentrations of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, which increases cellular communication between neurons that utilize these compounds. The therapeutic benefits are due to noradrenergic effects at the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> and the prefrontal cortex and dopaminergic effects at the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex.|$|E
25|$|A gap {{junction}} located in neurons {{is often referred}} to as an electrical synapse. The electrical synapse was discovered using electrical measurements before the {{gap junction}} structure was described. Electrical synapses are present throughout the central nervous system and have been studied specifically in the neocortex, hippocampus, vestibular nucleus, thalamic reticular nucleus, <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus,</b> inferior olivary nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, ventral tegmental area, olfactory bulb, retina and spinal cord of vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|To date, TAAR1 {{has been}} {{identified}} and cloned in five different mammal genomes: human, mouse, rat, monkey, and chimpanzee. In rats, mRNA for TAAR1 is found at low to moderate levels in peripheral tissues like the stomach, kidney, and lungs, and at low levels in the brain. Rhesus monkey Taar1 and human TAAR1 (hTAAR1) share high sequence similarity, and TAAR1 mRNA is highly expressed in the same important monoaminergic regions of both species. These regions include the dorsal and ventral caudate nucleus, putamen, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus,</b> amygdala, and raphe nucleus. TAAR1 has also been identified in human astrocytes.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{demonstrate}} that the changes to the olfactory bulb and main olfactory system following birth are extremely important and influential for maternal behavior. Pregnancy and childbirth result in a high state of plasticity of the olfactory system that may facilitate olfactory learning within the mother. Neurogenesis likely facilitates the formation of olfactory memory in the mother, {{as well as the}} infant. A significant change takes place in the regulation of olfaction just after birth so that odors related with the offspring are no longer aversive, allowing the female to positively respond to her babies. Research with a variety of animals suggest the role of norepinephrine in olfactory learning, in which norepinephrine neurons in the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> send projections to neurons in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. This is significant in the formation of olfactory memory and learning.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} some {{observation}} of weak neuron to glial cell coupling in the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus,</b> and in the cerebellum between Purkinje neurons and Bergmann glial cells. It appears that astrocytes are coupled by gap junctions, both to other astrocytes and to oligodendrocytes. [...] Moreover, mutations in the gap junction genes Cx43 and Cx56.6 cause white matter degeneration similar to that observed in Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease and multiple sclerosis.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} predisposing psycho-biological and {{environmental}} factors that go into determining whether one’s earlier emotional trauma might {{lead to the development}} of a true clinical picture of post-traumatic stress disorder. [...] One factor has to do with variation in certain brain structures. [...] According to Jerome Kagan, some people are born with a <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> that tends to produce higher concentrations of norepinephrine, a brain chemical involved in arousal of your body's self-defense response. [...] This would lower their threshold for becoming aroused and make them more likely to become anxious when they encounter stresses in life that are reminiscent of childhood separations and fears, hence making them more prone to becoming posttraumatic.|$|E
2500|$|Neural {{activity}} during REM sleep seems to {{originate in the}} brain stem, especially the pontine tegmentum and <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus.</b> REM sleep is punctuated and immediately preceded by PGO (ponto-geniculo-occipital) waves, bursts of electrical activity originating in the brain stem. (PGO waves have long been measured directly in cats but not in humans because of constraints on experimentation; however comparable effects have been observed in humans during [...] "phasic" [...] events which occur during REM sleep, {{and the existence of}} similar PGO waves is thus inferred.) These waves occur in clusters about every 6 seconds for 1–2 minutes during the transition from deep to paradoxical sleep. They exhibit their highest amplitude upon moving into the visual cortex and are a cause of the [...] "rapid eye movements" [...] in paradoxical sleep. Other muscles may also contract under the influence of these waves.|$|E
2500|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} linked with Lewy body {{dementia}} for their similar hallucinatory symptoms. The symptoms strike {{during the evening}} {{in any part of}} the visual field, and are rarely [...] The segue into hallucination may begin with illusions where sensory perception is greatly distorted, but no novel sensory information is present. These typically last for several minutes, during which time the subject may be either conscious and normal or drowsy/inaccessible. Insight into these hallucinations is usually preserved and REM sleep is usually reduced. Parkinson's disease is usually associated with a degraded substantia nigra pars compacta, but recent evidence suggests that PD affects a number of sites in the brain. Some places of noted degradation include the median raphe nuclei, the noradrenergic parts of the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus,</b> and the cholinergic neurons in the parabrachial area and pedunculopontine nuclei of the tegmentum.|$|E
50|$|Opioids {{inhibit the}} firing of neurons in the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus.</b> When opioid {{consumption}} is stopped, the increased activity of the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> contributes to the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. The alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine is used to counteract this withdrawal effect by decreasing adrenergic neurotransmission from the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> is {{responsible}} for mediating many of the sympathetic effects during stress. The <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> is activated by stress, and will respond by increasing norepinephrine secretion, which in turn will alter cognitive function (through the prefrontal cortex), increase motivation (through nucleus accumbens), activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and increase the sympathetic discharge/inhibit parasympathetic tone (through the brainstem). Specific to the activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis, norepinephrine will stimulate the secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor from the hypothalamus, that induces adrenocorticotropic hormone release from the anterior pituitary and subsequent cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands. Norepinephrine released from <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> will feedback to inhibit its production, and corticotropin-releasing hormone will feedback to inhibit its production, while positively feeding to the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> to increase norepinephrine production.|$|E

50|$|The <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> is the {{principal}} site for brain synthesis of norepinephrine (noradrenaline). The <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> and {{the areas of the}} body affected by the norepinephrine it produces are described collectively as the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system or LC-NA system. Norepinephrine may also be released directly into the blood from the adrenal medulla.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} regions in the brain where noradrenergic neurons are located. These regions are called <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> and the lateral tegmental. With {{administration}} of selective NRIs, neuronal activity in <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> region is induced because of increased concentration of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft. This results in activation of α2 adrenergic receptors, as discussed in above.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} source of norepinephrine in the brain is the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus,</b> which contains noradrenergic cell group A6 and adjoins cell group A4. The <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> is quite small in absolute terms—in primates it is estimated to contain around 15,000 neurons, less than one millionth of the neurons in the brain—but it sends projections to every {{major part of the}} brain and also to the spinal cord.|$|E

50|$|The <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> {{is a part}} of the reticular {{activating}} system, and {{is almost}} completely inactivated in rapid eye movement sleep.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers have {{concluded}} that [...] "Because these neurons are a pivotal source of norepinephrine throughout the brainstem and forebrain and {{are involved in the}} regulation of diverse functions disrupted in Rett syndrome, such as respiration and cognition, we hypothesize that the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> is a critical site at which loss of MECP2 results in CNS dysfunction." [...] The restoration of normal <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> function may therefore be of potential therapeutic value in the treatment of Rett syndrome.|$|E
50|$|In adult humans (19-78) the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> has 22,000 to 51,000 total {{pigmented}} neurons {{that range}} in size between 31,000 and 60,000 μm3.|$|E

50|$|The noradrenergic {{system is}} a bundle of axons that {{originate}} in the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> and ascends up into the neocortex, limbic system, and basal forebrain. Most of the neurons are projected to the posterior cortex which is important with sensory information, and alertness. The activation of the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> and release of norepinephrine causes wakefulness and increases vigilance. The neurons that project into the basal forebrain impact cholinergic neurons that results in a flood of acetylcholine into the cerebral cortex.|$|E
50|$|Brain {{levels of}} {{norepinephrine}} are lower {{in people with}} Rett syndrome (reviewed in). The genetic loss of MECP2 changes the properties of cells in the <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus,</b> the exclusive source of noradrenergic innervation to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These changes include hyperexcitability and decreased functioning of its noradrenergic innervation. Moreover, a reduction of the tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) mRNA level, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, was detected in the whole pons of MECP2-null male {{as well as in}} adult heterozygous (MECP2+/-) female mice. Using immunoquantitative techniques, a decrease of Th protein staining level, number of <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> TH-expressing neurons and density of dendritic arborization surrounding the structure was shown in symptomatic MeCP2-deficient mice. However, <b>locus</b> <b>coeruleus</b> cells are not dying, but are more likely losing their fully mature phenotype, since no apoptotic neurons in the pons were detected.|$|E
