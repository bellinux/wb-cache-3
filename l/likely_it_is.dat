5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now {{the only way to}} tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E
5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, {{it is estimated that}} in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to contain lead. However, {{this is not always}} the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E

5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, {{the rest of the}} pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
25|$|Some {{transgender}} men {{report a}} decrease in breast size with androgen therapy. However, no morphological changes were found when this was studied and <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> due to loss of fat in the breasts.|$|E

5000|$|Friedman {{has criticized}} Carl Sagan, {{a proponent of}} SETI, for {{ignoring}} empirical evidence, such as [...] "600-plus UNKNOWNS" [...] of Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14. Friedman argued that this empirical data directly contradicts Sagan's claim in Other Worlds that the [...] "reliable cases are uninteresting and the interesting cases are unreliable". Specifically, Friedman refers to a table in Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 that he says [...] "shows that the better {{the quality of the}} sighting, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be an 'unknown', and the less <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be listed as containing 'insufficient information'" [...] (p. 42).|$|R
25|$|Functional cysts and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts usually resolve spontaneously. However, {{the bigger}} an ovarian cyst is, the less <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to {{disappear}} on its own. Treatment {{may be required}} if cysts persist over several months, grow, or cause increasing pain.|$|E
25|$|Gravitational {{perturbation}} {{of planets}} and planetesimals by nearby stars becomes less likely as {{the density of}} stars decreases. Hence the further a planet lies from the Galactic Center or a spiral arm, the less <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to be struck by a large bolide. A sufficiently large impact may extinguish all complex life on a planet.|$|E
25|$|The {{energy and}} the type of the {{ionizing}} radiation emitted by a radioactive substance are also important factors in determining its threat to humans. The chemical properties of the radioactive element will determine how mobile the substance is and how <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to spread into the environment and contaminate humans. This is further {{complicated by the fact that}} many radioisotopes do not decay immediately to a stable state but rather to radioactive decay products within a decay chain before ultimately reaching a stable state.|$|E

25|$|The pond {{level is}} {{controlled}} by the height of the pipe in the dam. Since beavers depend on water for their survival, the more a beaver pond is lowered with a pipe, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that the beavers will try to build a new dam to return the water to its previous high level. In addition, the more a beaver pond is lowered, the more valuable wetland acreage is lost. Therefore, it is important to lower a beaver pond only enough to resolve the threat to human health, safety, or property.|$|E
25|$|For {{a finite}} {{population}}, the population mean of a property {{is equal to}} the arithmetic mean of the given property while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height {{is equal to the}} sum of the heights of every individual divided {{by the total number of}} individuals. The sample mean may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples. The law of large numbers dictates that the larger the size of the sample, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that the sample mean will be close to the population mean.|$|E
25|$|About {{half of the}} intercrater area {{consists}} of material characterized by a very high density of small, mostly degraded craters, and an irregular to rough surface. Superposition relations suggest that this unit {{is about the same}} age as, or older than, all mappable craters and basins. The origin of intercrater plains material is enigmatic; some may be primitive crust, as implied by Trask and Guest, but more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> of mixed origin, dominated by breccias formed by now-unrecognizable ancient craters. Some of the more plainslike areas included within this unit may well have an origin similar to that of intermediate plains material.|$|E

25|$|The {{more time}} that has elapsed {{since the last}} civil war, the less <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that a {{conflict}} will recur. The study had two possible explanations for this: one opportunity-based and the other grievance-based. The elapsed time may represent the depreciation of whatever capital the rebellion was fought over and thus increase the opportunity cost of restarting the conflict. Alternatively, elapsed time may represent the gradual process of healing of old hatreds. The {{study found that the}} presence of a diaspora substantially reduced the positive effect of time, as the funding from diasporas offsets the depreciation of rebellion-specific capital.|$|E
25|$|Males of {{some species}} use bodily fluids, such as seminal fluid from their ejaculate, {{to aid in}} the {{coercion}} of females. Seminal fluid in males of Drosophila melanogaster may contain chemicals that increase the amount of time it takes for females to remate, decrease the length of successive matings, or keep her from remating at all. The less a female mates with other males after copulation with a male, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for him to ensure his paternity. These chemicals may also serve to increase the female’s reproductive success, but at the cost of decreased longevity and immune response.|$|E
25|$|Esperanto is {{estimated}} to have approximately 100,000 to 2 million fluent speakers. In the same manner estimates {{for the number of}} Ido speakers are far from accurate, but 500 to a few thousand is most <b>likely.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also important to note the distinction between the number of speakers compared to the number of supporters; the two languages resemble each other enough that a few weeks of study will enable one to understand the other with little difficulty, {{and there are a number}} of people that have learned Ido out of curiosity but prefer to support the larger Esperanto movement and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Saint-Jean in Taloire, {{may have}} been built {{as early as the}} 13th or 14th century, but the 15th century seems more <b>likely.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> damaged by the {{earthquake}} of 1951.|$|R
50|$|Physically Miotapirus was {{virtually}} identical to its modern relatives; with {{a length of}} 2 m (6 ft 8 in) <b>it</b> <b>was</b> even the same size. Most <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> also nocturnal and very adaptable.|$|R
50|$|Frasier Crane's friend Dr. Lawrence Crandell {{orders a}} Black & White neat in season 7 episode 22 of Cheers. However, due to {{continuity}} error (most <b>likely),</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> served over rocks.|$|R
25|$|With {{long-term}} use and during withdrawal of benzodiazepines, treatment-emergent depression and emotional blunting may emerge and sometimes also suicidal ideation. There {{is evidence that}} the higher the dose used the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> benzodiazepine use will induce these feelings. Reducing the dose or discontinuing benzodiazepines may be indicated in such cases. Withdrawal symptoms can persist for quite some time after discontinuing benzodiazepines. Some common protracted withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, depression, insomnia, and physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal effects. The protracted withdrawal state may still occur despite slow titration of dosage. It is believed that the protracted withdrawal effects are due to persisting neuroadaptations.|$|E
25|$|The archaeological {{record is}} replete with {{excavations}} of built structures across time, but due to the natural decay of materials and the vagaries of preservation, the further backward in time, the less <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for artifacts to have survived. For example, Paleolithic shelter constructions from the Lower Paleolithic (c. 2,600,000 - 300,000 BP) and Middle Paleolithic (c. 300,000 - 45,000 BP) are generally less complete and thus subject to interpretation, while those dating to the Upper Paleolithic (c. 45,000- 10,000 BP) are both more numerous and better preserved. Paleolithic structures generally have no remaining superstructure, and must be inferred from a footprint of artifacts.|$|E
25|$|Lord Diplock {{explained}} that {{the rationale for the}} section 15 presumption was the difficulty in proving the purpose of trafficking. In drug trafficking cases, the strongest attainable evidence was likely to be the act of transporting the drugs. Regardless of this, his Lordship held that {{even in the absence of}} section 15, it could be inferred that the transportation of a large quantity of drugs was for trafficking purposes. As a matter of common sense, the larger the quantity, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for trafficking. Therefore, the appellants' argument that the Court of Criminal Appeal had erred in construing the presumption created by section 15(2) of the MDA was rejected.|$|E
