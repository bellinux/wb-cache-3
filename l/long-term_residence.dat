25|$|Homelessness is the {{condition}} of people without a permanent dwelling, such as a house or apartment. People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing. The legal definition of homeless varies from country to country, or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region. The term homeless may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a homeless shelter, a domestic violence shelter, <b>long-term</b> <b>residence</b> in a motel, a vehicle, squatting, cardboard boxes, a tent city, tarpaulins, shanty town structures made of discarded building materials or other ad hoc housing situations. According to the UK homelessness charity Crisis, a home {{is not just a}} physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, a sense of belonging and a place of emotional wellbeing. American government homeless enumeration studies also include people who sleep in a public or private place not designed for use as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.

30|$|Today, urban {{governance}} has {{to mediate}} between the general housing expectations {{and the new}} reality of housing as main investment opportunity leading to rising land prices in all cities. In order to reduce urban sprawl locals will need {{to adapt to the}} limited sizes of their future residences. The desired move of locals from far-distant suburban districts on cities peripheries can however only succeed, when residential projects integrate key important qualities: A generally introverted layout based on a central core from where all rooms can be accessed, various layers of family privacy and a certain distance to migrant communities. The major potential in this regard can be found in exclusive residential projects along the coast, including high-rises, which however face two main obstacles (Fig.  7). The first is the general security concerns regarding fire and the second is the lack of conviction to invest in apartments as <b>long-term</b> <b>residences.</b> Among socio-cultural factors the general hesitation to move to apartments is rooted in doubts regarding the construction standards, future maintenance costs and unpredictable changes within the immediate surroundings. If these hindering factors can be removed, the current trend of young local families relocating to recent projects can mark another step within the housing evolution in Gulf cities; From densely built vernacular settlements to sprawling suburban realms and finally to dense clusters of residential towers and blocks along waterfronts (Fig.  7).|$|R

40|$|The {{unimpeded}} downstream {{movement patterns}} and migration success of small {{female and male}} Anguilla anguilla through a catchment in north-west Europe were studied using an acoustic hydrophone array along the River Finn and into the Foyle Estuary in Ireland. Twenty silver-stage A. anguilla (total length, LT, range: 332 – 520 mm) were trapped 152 km upstream from a coastal marine sea-lough outlet and internally tagged with acoustic transmitters of which 19 initiated downstream migration. Migration speed was highly influenced by river flow within the freshwater (FW) compartment. Anguilla anguilla activity patterns were correlated with environmental influences; light, tidal direction and lunar phase all influenced the initiation of migration of tagged individuals. Migration speed varied significantly between upstream and lower river compartments. Individuals migrated at a slower speed in transitional water and sea-lough compartments compared with the FW compartment. While 88 · 5 % survival was recorded during migration through the upper 121 km {{of the river and}} estuary, only 26 % of A. anguilla which initiated downstream migration were detected at the outermost end of the acoustic array. Telemetry equipment functioned efficiently, including in the sea-lough, so this suggests high levels of mortality during sea-lough migration, or less likely, <b>long-term</b> sea-lough <b>residence</b> by silver A. anguilla emigrants.

40|$|Oxygen is {{critical}} to normal brain functioning and development. In high altitude where the oxygen concentration and pressure are very low, human cognitive capability such as working memory {{has been found to}} be jeopardized. Such effect might persist with <b>long-term</b> high-altitude <b>residence.</b> The current study investigated the verbal working memory of 28 high-altitude residents with blood level oxygen dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in contrast with that of the 30 sea level residents. All of the subjects were healthy college students, matched on their age, gender ratio and social-economic status; they also did not show any difference on their hemoglobin level. The high-altitude subjects showed longer reaction time and decreased response accuracy in behavioral performance. Both groups showed activation in the typical regions associated with the 2 -back verbal working memory task, and the behavioral performance of both groups showed significant correlations with the BOLD signal change amplitude and Granger causality values (as a measure of the interregional effective connectivity) between these regions. With group comparison statistics, the high-altitude subjects showed decreased activation at the inferior and middle frontal gyrus, the middle occipital and the lingual gyrus, the pyramis of vermis, as well as the thalamus. In conclusion, the current study revealed impairment in verbal working memory among high-altitude residents, which might be associated with the impact of prolonged chronic hypoxia exposure on the brain functionality...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we uncovered the anticonvulsant properties of turmeric oil and its sesquiterpenoids (ar-turmerone, ?-, ?-turmerone and ?-atlantone) in both zebrafish and mouse models of chemically-induced seizures using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). In this follow-up study, we aimed at evaluating the anticonvulsant activity of ar-turmerone further. A more in-depth anticonvulsant evaluation of ar-turmerone was therefore {{carried out in}} the i. v. PTZ and 6 -Hz mouse models. The potential toxic effects of ar-turmerone were evaluated using the beam walking test to assess mouse motor function and balance. In addition, determination of the concentration-time profile of ar-turmerone was carried out for a more extended evaluation of its bioavailability in the mouse brain. Ar-turmerone displayed anticonvulsant properties in both acute seizure models in mice and modulated the expression patterns of two seizure-related genes (c-fos and brain-derived neurotrophic factor [bdnf]) in zebrafish. Importantly, no effects on motor function and balance were observed in mice after treatment with ar-turmerone even after administering a dose 500 -fold higher than the effective dose in the 6 -Hz model. In addition, quantification of its concentration in mouse brains revealed rapid absorption after i. p. administration, capacity to cross the BBB and <b>long-term</b> brain <b>residence.</b> Hence, our results provide additional information on the anticonvulsant properties of ar-turmerone and support further evaluation towards elucidating its mechanism of action, bioavailability, toxicity and potential clinical application.

The nurse practitioner role, with its expertise in both medicine and nursing, is known to enhance collaboration and promote interprofessional care delivery. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify, from the healthcare professionals' perspective, nurse practitioner strategies used to enhance interprofessional care. Method: A hermeneutic phenomenology design was employed. Healthcare professionals from acute care hospitals and associated <b>long-term</b> care <b>residences</b> (n =  6) in one Canadian province were invited to participate. Individual interviews were held with healthcare professionals (n =  52) who regularly work with a nurse practitioner. The participants were asked to share experiences that held significance or value in promoting interprofessional care. Results: Four valued role attributes were identified; consistent role presence, time to focus on the patient, effective communication, and respectful centrality. Identified strategies extending from the attributes included knowledge sharing, respectful negotiation, identifying patient issues, being open and transparent, listening to opinions, bridging professions, and working as the hub of the group. Multiple types of interprofessional relationships were perceived, with the hierarchical type as the most common. Conclusions: Nurse practitioners in acute care hospital and long-term care settings have valued attributes that can promote interprofessional care. Effective strategies to promote interprofessional care emerge from these role attributes. However, the interprofessional relationship type perceived could enhance or impede the contribution of the strategies to interprofessional care promotion...|$|R
