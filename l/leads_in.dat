40|$|The {{feasibility}} of <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> hair {{as an indicator}} of lead exposure has been compared to that of <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> blood and zinc protoporphyrin in blood levels in 1 - 3 year-old children living within 1 km of a lead smelter. Lead exposure was measured as <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> house dust, outdoor and indoor <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> air concentrations, outdoor and indoor lead depositions, and subjective assessment of indoor dustiness. <b>Lead</b> <b>in</b> blood ranged from 51 - 353 μg/ 1 and <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> hair from 0. 8 - 114 μg/g. It can be concluded that within the range of environmental exposure studied and for the age group concerned, measurement of <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> blood and of the zinc protoporphyrin in blood levels appear to be better biological parameters to assess both total enviromental exposure and health risk than measurement of <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> hair level alone...|$|R

40|$|Whole Blood Lead Level (BLL) is {{the main}} marker used to verify lead contamination. The present study explores how BLL is {{associated}} with <b>lead</b> concentrations <b>in</b> serum, saliva and house dust. Samples were collected twice from Santo Amaro, BA, Brazil, a region that was contaminated by a <b>lead</b> smelter <b>in</b> the past; a time interval of 12 months was allowed between the two collections. It is noteworthy that the following measures have recently been taken to diminish exposure of the population to lead: streets have been paved with asphalt, and educational campaigns have been launched to reduce exposure to contaminated dust. Compared with the first time point, all the samples collected at the second time point contained lower lead concentration (p< 0. 05), which suggested that the adopted measures effectively reduced exposure of the population to <b>lead</b> present <b>in</b> contaminated soil and dust. Statistically significant correlations only existed between <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> blood collected {{in the first year}} and <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> blood collected in the second year (Spearman's r= 0. 55; p< 0. 0001; n= 62), and <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> house dust collected in the first year and <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> house dust collected in the second year (Spearman's r= 0. 5; p< 0. 0001; n= 59). Results support the validity of <b>lead</b> determination <b>in</b> blood and in house dust to assess lead exposure over time.

5|$|Historically {{four major}} {{industries}} shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil. Before {{and after the}} U.S. Civil War the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic driver for the state, thus creating the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major petroleum deposits (Spindletop in particular) that initiated an economic boom which became {{the driving force behind}} the economy for much of the 20th century. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2015, it is second on the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with 54. With a growing base of industry, the state <b>leads</b> <b>in</b> many industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the nation in state export revenue since 2002, and has the second-highest gross state product. If it were a country, Texas would be the 10th largest economy in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, the German Navy adopted, as its top {{cryptographic}} device, {{a modified}} civilian Enigma machine; in 1928 the German Army followed suit. The {{complexity of the}} system was much increased in 1930 {{by the introduction of}} a plugboard (Steckerbrett), albeit with only six connecting <b>leads</b> <b>in</b> use. In December 1932, Marian Rejewski made what historian David Kahn describes {{as one of the greatest}} advances in cryptologic history, by applying pure mathematicsthe theory of permutations and groupsto breaking the German armed forces' Enigma machine ciphers. Rejewski had worked out the precise interconnections of the Enigma rotors and reflector, after the Bureau had received, from French Military Intelligence Captain Gustave Bertrand, two German documents and two pages of Enigma daily keys (for September and October of that year). These had been obtained by a French military intelligence agent, a German codenamed Rex, from an agent who worked at Germany's Cipher Office in Berlin, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, whom the French codenamed Asché.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} {{possible}} exposure to indoor lead by school and preschool children was conducted around Selan-gor, Malaysia. For collecting suspended particulates less than 10 micrometer in diameter (PM 10) {{inside and outside}} the school and preschool buildings, a low-volume sampler was used. For collecting dust in the indoor environments, small brushes and Kimwipes were used. <b>Lead</b> <b>in</b> PM 10 and in dust was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with a graphite furnace. The average <b>lead</b> concentrations <b>in</b> PM 10 in the indoor environment were found to be higher in schools (118. 85 86. 08 ngm 3) than in pre-schools (6. 97 0. 30 ngm 3). Higher concentrations of <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the indoor dust in school environments (ranging between 19. 101. 55 and 31. 62 0. 98 mgg 1) compared to <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the indoor dust in preschool environments (ranged between 0. 37 0. 01 and 2. 740. 04 mgg 1) suggest that indoor sources, particularly paint on indoor walls, are also capable of generating <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> indoor environments. Furthermore, in all indoor environments, the levels of <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> PM 10 increased with rising levels of <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> their associated outdoor environments, thus suggesting that the local outdoor environments also add lead to the indoor environments...|$|R
5|$|Inspired {{by their}} own daughters, Schooley and McCorkle {{conceived}} Kim as a teenage girl capable of doing anything, basing the character on their own childhood hero James Bond. Upon noticing the lack of strong female <b>leads</b> <b>in</b> children's animated television, they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's action hero accompanied by a male comedic sidekick {{in the form of}} best friend-turned-boyfriend Ron Stoppable. Devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes, the character's crime-fighting abilities are instead drawn from her cheerleading experience, thus making her more relatable to young viewers. Originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character Lara Croft, Kim's appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a teenage girl instead.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Elizabeth Hummel is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{and one of}} the male <b>leads</b> <b>in</b> the Fox musical comedy-drama series Glee.
