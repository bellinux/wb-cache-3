50|$|Schizencephaly can be {{distinguished}} from porencephaly {{by the fact that}} in schizencephaly the fluid-filled component, if present, is entirely lined by <b>heterotopic</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> while a porencephalic cyst is lined mostly by white matter. Individuals with clefts in both hemispheres, or bilateral clefts, are often developmentally delayed and have delayed speech and language skills and corticospinal dysfunction. Individuals with smaller, unilateral clefts (clefts in one hemisphere) may be weak or paralyzed {{on one side of the}} body and may have average or near-average intelligence. Patients with schizencephaly may also have varying degrees of microcephaly, Intellectual disability, hemiparesis (weakness or paralysis affecting one side of the body), or quadriparesis (weakness or paralysis affecting all four extremities), and may have reduced muscle tone (hypotonia). Most patients have seizures, and some may have hydrocephalus.|$|R

40|$|Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD), a {{disorder}} first described by French physicians Lhermitte and Duclos in 1920 [25], is a benign, slow growing dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum, characterized by {{replacement of the}} granule cell layer by abnormal granule and Purkinje like cells. The most frequent presenting signs and symptoms are megalocephaly, increased intracranial pressure, nausea, hydrocephalus, ataxia, gait abnormalities, and intermittent headaches, {{all of which are}} attributed to the mass effect [6, 11, 25]. Many cases are associated with a mutation in the phosphatase and tensin homolog or PTEN gene which is also involved in numerous otherwise unrelated central nervous system abnormalities, namely Cowden syndrome [1, 6, 11], autism spectrum disorder [18], cerebral cortical dysplasia [11, 30] and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome [30].

40|$|Neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} can {{be related}} to less common underlying neuropsychiatric conditions – in this case report, the condition discussed is that of <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> heterotopia (GMH). The patient presented with a history of prominent aggression, impulsivity and manipulative and attention-seeking behaviour. Episodes of depression and incidents of deliberate self-harm and suicide attempts had been reported. Neuropsychiatric symptoms included anxiety, a labile mood, delusional thinking and auditory hallucinations. Testing revealed some cognitive difficulties and severe impairment of frontal lobe functions. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his brain revealed the presence of GMH, which had previously been misdiagnosed as tuberous sclerosis. An MRI scan of the brain is the special investigation of choice for the correct diagnosis of GMH. The pathognomonic finding is that of <b>heterotopic</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> abnormally located within areas of white matter. Defective foetal neuronal migration between the third and fifth month of pregnancy can lead to GMH, which can present later on in childhood or adolescence with epilepsy, intellectual impairment or reading difficulties.

40|$|Subependymal heterotopia has {{recently}} been recognised {{as a cause of}} epilepsy, but the clinical and investigational features have not been fully described. The clinical, psychometric, imaging, and electroencephalographic features of 13 adult patients with subependymal heterotopia and epilepsy have been reviewed. Age at seizure onset ranged from 18 months to 20 years (median 13 years). There were significantly more female (12) than male (1) patients (p < 0. 01). Diagnosis of subependymal heterotopia was made by MRI in 11 patients and CT in two. The <b>heterotopic</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> was nodular in 11 patients and diffuse in two; bilateral in eight and unilateral in five. There were significantly more patients with predominant right than left cerebral hemisphere involvement (p < 0. 01). The most commonly involved site was the occipital horn of the lateral ventricles (10 of 13 patients). Eleven patients presented with partial epilepsy, 10 of whom also had secondarily generalised seizures. The clinical description of the seizures often suggested either an occipital (four patients) or temporal (five patients) onset. Two patients presented with absence attacks without clear focal features. Patients demonstrated normal early milestones (12 of 13 patients), including normal motor development (all patients) and average or above average intelligence (10 of 13 patients). An EEG examination showed normal background activity in all but two patients, one of whom had large intracranial haematomas. Epileptiform activity was usually widespread (10 of 13 patients) and in three patients, there was generalised 3 -Hz spike and wave activity that had previously led to an erroneous diagnosis of concomitant primary generalised epilepsy. Onset of epilepsy in the second decade of life, normal developmental milestones and intelligence, and the finding of an overwhelming female preponderance differentiates subependymal heterotopia from other cortical dysgeneses. The female preponderance supports the importance of the X chromosome and sex steroids in the maturation and development of the cerebral cortex...|$|R

Methods: Seventy-two people with MS (46 relapsing–remitting (RR), 26 secondary progressive (SP)) and 36 healthy controls were included in this study. MTR, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were measured in lesional and extra-lesional cortical <b>grey</b> <b>matter.</b> Results: Mean fractional anisotropy was higher and MTR lower in lesional compared with extra-lesional cortical <b>grey</b> <b>matter.</b> In extra-lesional cortical <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> mean fractional anisotropy and MTR were lower, and mean diffusivity was higher in the MS group compared with controls.

50|$|Although <b>grey</b> {{and white}} <b>matter</b> volume was reduced {{throughout}} the brain, researchers {{noted that the}} <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> of the neocortical brain regions was particularly affected. This {{is consistent with the}} fact that older individuals who had experienced PTA showed greater cognitive impairments than a control group of individuals of the same age who had not experienced PTA. The duration of the episode of PTA was related {{to the size of the}} <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> lesion; longer episodes of PTA correlated with larger <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> lesions. Advanced age also correlated with reduced glial activity. With less <b>grey</b> <b>matter,</b> the patient is less able to retrieve memories effectively, as neuron function is impaired.|$|R
30|$|To date, {{only one}} VBM study has {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> volume {{and the results of}} a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment (Conroy et al. 2012). In that retrospective study, <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> density in the right superior and middle frontal gyri was positively correlated with post-chemotherapy interval. Furthermore, overall neuropsychological performance was positively related to mean <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> density of these regions. In light of those important findings, and given the cross-sectional design of that study, there exists a need for an increase in longitudinal studies examining <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> alterations and their relationship with neuropsychological functioning.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{is characterized}} at the gross pathological level {{by the presence}} of widespread focal demyelinating lesions of the myelin-rich white matter. However, it is becoming clear that <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> is not spared, even during the earliest phases of the disease. Furthermore, <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> damage may have an important role both in physical and cognitive disability. <b>Grey</b> <b>matter</b> pathology involves both inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms, but {{the relationship between the two}} is unclear. Histological, immunological and neuroimaging studies have provided new insight in this rapidly expanding field, and form the basis of the most recent hypotheses on the pathogenesis of <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> damage...|$|R
