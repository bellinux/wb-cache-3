(I did however like Eduardo’s incongruous anger at Homer’s yearbook regrets: [...] "Everyone has a bad yearbook story! They spelled my name wrong, get over it!") In addition, the episode pauses for some oddly poetic interludes (the couch gag, Homer’s skydiving adventure, the unexpected tag at the end) where the score and the images go for mood rather than hard laughs.

Philip Rivers had a good day as well, throwing 19 of 26 for 222 yards and two TDs, although he did throw two picks including a 31-yard interception return for a TD by Denver cornerback Darrent Williams. The game started out with Tomlinson running it in from 3 yards out to make it 7-0 San Diego. Denvers Mike Bell ran for two TDs in during the 2nd quarter {{to make it a}} 14-7 Denver lead at halftime. After the break, Denver continued the scoring with an Jason Elams 42-yd field goal and Williams INT return to make it a 24-7 lead for Denver.

Elam helped the Broncos cause by hitting a 38-yd kick to extend the Broncos lead to 27-21, but that only lasted until Rivers found Vincent Jackson open at the back of the end zone to put the Chargers up 28-27.

That left Denver 1:14 to try to tie the game. They started that drive from their 3 and made it all the way to the Chargers 32 in part to a personal foul on Chargers defensive end Igor Olshansky, who was ejected for punching Broncos center Tom Nalen.

5000|$|Outdoor Showers: For this challenge, {{the teams}} are each tasked with {{building}} a hand pump-powered outdoor shower for their hut within a 90-minute time limit (100 minutes for the Red Team, {{as a reward for}} winning the previous challenge), though are thrown a curveball by being given no instructions, only the required materials. Whoever finishes to the required standard first wins. The Blue Team's build soon falls apart due to arguments between Jesse and Holly, eventually causing Jesse to storm off the project. He eventually returns, but not in time to save the project, which they fail to complete in the allotted time. The experts judge the work that they did complete to be actually quite good, but tell them that teamwork is clearly a major issue for them, and one that needs to be resolved if they are to succeed. The Pink Team experiences another troublesome project, which immediately gets off to a difficult start due to Tyler insisting on creating a detailed plan, but Danielle not believing a plan is necessary at all. They end up being unable to get their hand pump working, and so resort to attaching a hose to their kitchen taps. The shower works, but is the last to be finished, barely making the 90 minute time limit. The Red Team squander their head start through a lack of planning, and it takes Fabian and Luayn {{a long time to get}} things together and build their shower. The result is arguably the closest to the shower the experts were expecting the teams to build, though is very rickety. <b>Like</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> the Purple Team take an unorthodox approach by assembling their frame upside-down, using tall sheets of corrugated steel for the shower walls rather than the wooden panelling used by most of the other teams, and having their shower spray out upwards to provide a [...] "rain" [...] effect. The result is very solid overall, though the time spent righting the frame prevents them finishing in first place. Victory therefore is claimed by the Green Team, as Jake and Nicole are able to put their differences aside and build their shower relatively quickly; while they stick the pump at the opposite end of the water line to most of the other couples (meaning that their shower needs a second person to pump the water), this is still considered acceptable by the experts.|$|E
