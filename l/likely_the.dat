5|$|Canvaswork {{in which}} the linen ground was covered entirely by tent, gobelin, or cross {{stitches}} in wool or silk thread was often used for cushion covers and small bags.

5|$|In Europe, audiences {{had a very}} {{different}} take on his work. Many perceived it as a subversive and Marxist satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, {{it was at least}} considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not <b>likely</b> <b>the</b> intended message. It is likely that his pop art was nothing more than an attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E
5|$|Just as in Q1, the two Mercedes cars set {{the fastest}} times in Q2 as well. Verstappen {{was unable to}} {{continue}} and therefore only four of the running cars were to be eliminated.

5|$|The Kaivalya Upanishad, remarks Deussen, is {{from the}} group of five Upanishads which extol and assert god Shiva as a {{symbolism}} for Atman (soul). These five Upanishads – Atharvashiras, Atharvashikha, Nilarudra, Kalagnirudra and Kaivalya – are ancient, with Nilarudra <b>likely</b> <b>the</b> oldest and Kaivalya the relatively later era 1st millennium BCE Upanishad, composed closer to Shvetashvatara Upanishad, Mundaka Upanishad, and Mahanarayana Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsukue {{neighborhood}} prospered as a port town {{during the}} feudal period, {{as it was}} used as a port of rest for daimyōs on their way to and from the capital as part of the sankin-kōtai system.

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to found a}} national organization was <b>likely</b> <b>the</b> result of several factors. First, the mainstream trade unions were increasingly reformist and centralized. Second, the localists gained confidence from their involvement in the dock workers' strike in Hamburg in late 1896 and early 1897. Third, loss of membership (for example, the Berlin metal workers rejoined the DMV in 1897) convinced the localists {{of the need for}} action.|$|E
