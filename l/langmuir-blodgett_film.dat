5000|$|Using this technique, Blodgett {{developed}} practical {{uses for}} Langmuir’s gossamer films. Blodgett used a barium stearate film to cover glass with 44 monomolecular layers, making the glass more than 99% transmissive and creating [...] "invisible" [...] glass.

This type of nonreflective coating is now called <b>Langmuir-Blodgett</b> <b>film</b> and is widely used. The first major cinematic production to use Blodgett's invisible glass was the popular film Gone with the Wind (1939), noted for its crystal-clear cinematography. Once introduced, nonreflective lenses were used for projectors and cameras by the post-war movie industry. Blodgett's glass was also used for submarine periscopes and airplane spy cameras during World War II.|$|E
50|$|A Langmuir {{monolayer}} or insoluble monolayer is a one-molecule {{thick layer}} of an insoluble organic material spread onto an aqueous subphase in a Langmuir-Blodgett Trough. Traditional compounds used to prepare Langmuir monolayers are amphiphilic materials that possess a hydrophilic headgroup and a hydrophobic tail. Since the 1980s {{a large number of}} other materials have been employed to produce Langmuir monolayers, some of which are semi-amphiphilic, including polymeric, ceramic or metallic nanoparticles and macromolecules such as polymers. Langmuir monolayers are extensively studied for the fabrication of <b>Langmuir-Blodgett</b> <b>film</b> (LB films), which are formed by transferred monolayers on a solid substrate. A Gibbs monolayer or soluble monolayer is a monolayer formed by a compound that is soluble in one of the phases separated by the interface on which the monolayer is formed.|$|E
50|$|For assembly, a {{purified}} amphiphilic polypeptoid {{of specific}} sequence is dissolved in aqueous solution. These form a monolayer (<b>Langmuir-Blodgett</b> <b>film)</b> on the air-water interface with their hydrophobic side chains oriented in air and hydrophilic side chains in the water. When this mono-layer is shrunk, it buckles into a bilayer with the hydrophobic groups forming the interior {{core of the}} peptoid nanosheet. This method has been standardized in the Zuckermann laboratory by repetitively tilting vials of peptoid solution at 85° before returning the vials to the upright position. This repetitive vial “rocking” motion lessens the interfacial area of the air-water interface inside the vial, compressing the peptoid mono-layer {{by a factor of}} four and causing the mono-layer to buckle into peptoid nanosheets. Using this method, nanosheets are produced in high yield, and 95% of the peptoid polymer starting material is efficiently converted into peptoid nanosheets after rocking the vials several hundred times.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{studies of}} Langmuir and <b>Langmuir-Blodgett</b> <b>films</b> of {{functionalized}} surfactants {{show that the}} organization of surfactants {{is strongly dependent on}} cross-sectional match between the functionalized headgroup and the film-forming alkyl chain parts of the molecules. The organization of a particular functionalized surfactant with a slight cross-sectional mismatch between head and tail has been investigated by synchrotron radiation in floating monolayers and by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in <b>Langmuir-Blodgett</b> <b>films.</b> The transfer process was accompanied by an increase of the oblique unit cell area by 17 % and by an increase of the average diameter of perfectly ordered domains from 3 nm to approximately 10 nm.

50|$|Figure 4 {{shows the}} {{combination}} of a PSTM, AFM, and conventional microscope. In PSTM and AFM the silicon nitride cantilever can be used as the optical probe tip in order to simultaneously perform (AFM) and PSTM. This allows comparison of the recorded optical signal with the higher resolution topography data obtained by AFM. Silicon nitride is a suitable material for an optical probe tip as it is optically transparent down to 300 nm. However, since it is not optically conducting, the photons collected by the probe tip must be focused through a lens to the detector instead of travelling through an optical fiber. The instrument can be operated in constant height or constant force mode and resolution is limited to 10-50 nm due to tip convolution. Since the optical signal obtained in PSTM is affected by the optical properties of the sample as well as topography, comparison of the PSTM data with AFM data allows determination of the absorbance of the sample. In one study, the 514 nm absorbance of a <b>Langmuir-Blodgett</b> <b>film</b> of 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCA) was recorded using this method.|$|E

To control the growth of nanoparticles with tunable optical properties, supporing matrices such as glasses, zeolites, polymers or fatty acids have been used. In addition, to prepare nanoparticles of sulfides, selenides and tellurides, the <b>Langmuir-Blodgett</b> <b>film</b> technique has been used successfully. In comparison to wet chemical methods, electrochemical synthesis is more desirable, {{such as the use of}} aqueous solvents rather than toxic organic solvents, formation of conformal deposits, room-temperature deposition, low cost, and precise control of composition and thickness of semiconductor coating on metal nanoparticles. However, owing to the difficulty of preparing electrically addressable arrays of nanoparticles, the use of electrochemical techniques to produce core-shell nanoparticles was difficult.

For AuNPs synthesized using the reduction method followed by spin coating to form thin films, AuNPs were normally non-uniformly distributed.

Meanwhile, the template-directed assembly method is promising for obtaining well-distributed AuNPs for a memory device. However, the polymer template has to be removed using O 2 plasma[19].|$|E
