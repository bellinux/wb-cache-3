50|$|The Procellariiformes are for {{the most}} part {{exclusively}} marine foragers; the only exception to this rule are the two species of giant petrel, which regularly feed on carrion or other seabirds while on land. While some other species of fulmarine and Procellaria petrels also take carrion, the diet of most species of albatrosses and petrels is dominated by fish, squid, krill and other marine zooplankton. The importance of these food sources varies from species to species and family to family. For example, of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, the black-footed albatross takes mostly fish, while the Laysan feeds mainly on squid. The albatrosses in general feed on fish, squid and krill. Among the procellariids, the prions concentrate on small crustacea, the fulmarine petrels take fish and krill but <b>little</b> <b>squid,</b> while the Procellaria petrels consume mainly squid. The storm petrels take small droplets of oil {{from the surface of the}} water, as well as small crustaceans and fish.|$|E
50|$|They are {{headquartered}} in the Purple Rocks, at the isles of Trisk and Utheraal, having their main fortress {{on the former}} whose facade is shaped like a giant <b>squid.</b> <b>Little</b> was known about the Purple Rocks, but the Kraken cult enveloped the islanders. The Kraken have completely dominated Trisk and they also maintain fortresses on Utheraal to collect tribute.|$|R
50|$|Spirula spirula is {{a species}} of deep-water squid-like {{cephalopod}} mollusk. It is the only extant member of the genus Spirula, the family Spirulidae, and the order Spirulida. Because of the shape of its internal shell, it {{is commonly known as}} the ram's horn <b>squid</b> or the <b>little</b> post horn <b>squid.</b> Because the live animal has a light-emitting organ, it is also sometimes known as the tail-light squid.|$|R
40|$|A single {{specimen}} of the <b>little</b> Indian <b>squid</b> Loliolus hardwickei {{was caught by}} trawl net bythe research vessel “F. V Silver Pompano” on 18 th March 2014. It was caught from waters off Cochin {{at a depth of}} about 20 m (09 ° 58 ´ 30 ´´N; 76 ° 06 ´ 18 ´´E). The specimen was previously described as Loliolus investigatoris(Goodrich, 1896). Nevertheless, it is now reported that Loliolus investigatoris is a junior synonym of Loliolus hardwickei. This species is known to inhabit estuarine and coastal waters to a maximum depth of 30 m (FAO species catalogue for Fishery purposes, Cephalopods of the World No. 4, Vol. 2, 2010). The current specimen was 56. 8 mm in length and had weight of 13. 39 g...|$|R
50|$|The {{longcomb sawfish}} thrashes its rostrum from {{side-to-side}} to dislodge prey from the seabed and to stun fish. It {{is believed to}} feed on crustaceans, fish and <b>squid.</b> <b>Little</b> is known of its breeding habits but they are probably similar to the better studied largetooth sawfish (Pristis microdon) which produces a litter of live young after a gestation period of about five months and which gives birth in alternate years. It is known that longcomb sawfish pups measure about 60 to 108 cm at birth.|$|R

Target strength of live, tethered squid was related to mantle length with values standardized to the length squared of − 62. 0, − 67. 4, − 67. 9, and − 67. 6 dB at 38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz, respectively. There were relatively small differences in target strength between dorsal and anterior aspects and none between live and freshly dead squid. Potential scattering mechanisms in squid have been long debated. Here, the reproductive organs had <b>little</b> effect on <b>squid</b> target strength. These data {{support the hypothesis that}} the pen may be an important source of squid acoustic scattering. The beak, eyes, and arms, probably via the sucker rings, also play a role in acoustic scattering though their effects were small and frequency specific. An unexpected source of scattering was the cranium of the squid which provided a target strength nearly as high as that of the entire squid though the mechanism remains unclear. Our in situ measurements of the target strength of free-swimming squid support the use of the values presented here in D. gigas assessment studies...|$|R
