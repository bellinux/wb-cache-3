40|$|Decision {{making is}} {{inherent}} to mankind, {{as human beings}} daily face situations in which they should choose among different alternatives by means of reasoning and mental processes. Many of these decision problems are under uncertain environments with vague and imprecise information. This type of information is usually modelled by linguistic information because of the common {{use of language by}} the experts involved in the given <b>decision</b> situations, originating <b>linguistic</b> <b>decision</b> making. The use of <b>linguistic</b> information in <b>decision</b> making demands processes of Computing with Words to solve the related decision problems. Different methodologies and approaches have been proposed to accomplish such processes in an accurate and interpretable way. The good performance of linguistic computing dealing with uncertainty has caused a spread use of it in different types of decision based applications. This paper overviews the more significant and extended linguistic computing models due to its key role in <b>linguistic</b> <b>decision</b> making and a wide range of the most recent applications of <b>linguistic</b> <b>decision</b> support models...|$|R
40|$|Hesitant fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> <b>decision</b> {{making is}} a focus point in <b>linguistic</b> <b>decision</b> making, {{in which the}} main method is based on {{preference}} ordering. This paper develops a new hesitant fuzzy linguistic TOPSIS method for group multi-criteria <b>linguistic</b> <b>decision</b> making; the method is inspired by the TOPSIS method and the preference degree between two hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs). To this end, we first use the preference degree to define a pseudo-distance between two HFLTSs and analyze its properties. Then we present the positive (optimistic) and negative (pessimistic) information of each criterion provided by each decision maker and aggregate these by using weights of decision makers to obtain the hesitant fuzzy linguistic positive and negative ideal solutions. On {{the basis of the}} proposed pseudo-distance, we finally obtain the positive (negative) ideal separation matrix and a new relative closeness degree to rank alternatives. We also design an algorithm based on the provided method to carry out hesitant fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> <b>decision</b> making. An illustrative example shows the elaboration of the proposed method and comparison with the symbolic aggregation-based method, the hesitant fuzzy linguistic TOPSIS method and the hesitant fuzzy linguistic VIKOR method; it seems that the proposed method is a useful and alternative decision-making method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Linguistic</b> <b>decision</b> tree (LDT) [7] is a {{classification}} model {{based on a}} random set based semantics which {{is referred to as}} label semantics [4]. Each branch of a trained LDT is associated with a probability distribution over classes. In this paper, two hybrid learning models by combining <b>linguistic</b> <b>decision</b> tree and fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier are proposed. In the first model, an unlabelled instance is classified according to the Bayesian estimation given a single LDT. In the second model, a set of disjoint LDTs are used as Bayesian estimators. Experimental studies show that the first new hybrid models has both better accuracy and transparency comparing to fuzzy Naive Bayes and LDTs at shallow tree depths. The second model has the equivalent performance to the LDT model. ...|$|R

40|$|Parallel corpora encode {{extremely}} valuable linguistic knowledge, the revealing {{of which is}} facilitated by the recent advances in multilingual corpus linguistics. The <b>linguistic</b> <b>decisions</b> made by the human translators in order to faithfully convey {{the meaning of the}} source text can be traced and can bring evidence on linguistic facts which in a monolingual context might be overlooked by a computer program. When linguistic annotations are available or easy to produce for one or more languages in a parallel corpus, but not for all, inductive learning methods provide a powerful support for systematic and consistent cross-lingual transfer of the linguistic interpretations and allow for focused comparative studies for the languages of the parallel corpus. 1. Parallel corpora and corpus alignment A bitext or a parallel text is an association between two texts (written or spoken) in different languages that represent translations of each other. By extension, a parallel text might contain several language translations of the same (source) text. A collection of parallel texts, or even a large enough parallel text is called a parallel corpus.

This approach can not only efficiently tackle ‘curse of dimensionality’ in spam detection with massive attributes, but also improve the performance of spam detection when the semantic attributes are constructed to a proper hierarchy. ...|$|R

40|$|Dialog is a {{joint action}} at {{different}} levels. At the highest level, the goal of interlocutors is to align their mental representations.

We then argue that the mechanisms underlying such processes involve covert imitation of interlocutors’ communicative behavior, leading to emulation of their expected behavior. In other words, communication provides a very good example of predictive emulation, {{in a way that}} leads to successful joint activity...|$|E
