This thesis is specifically concerned with the secondary connections often encountered in industrial installations. Faults on these systems have not been adequately investigated. Three types of faults are considered, namely: 1. A <b>line-to-line</b> <b>fault</b> between two phases. 2. A <b>line-to-line</b> <b>fault</b> on the center-tapped three-phase circuit. 3. A phase-to-ground fault with the opposite center-tap grounded. Unsymmetrical faults on this system cause unsymmetrical currents and voltages.

40|$|In the {{classical}} approach, line-to-line faults are usually analysed using a parallel connection of symmetrical component sequence networks. The sequence networks are solved separately, {{and then the}} positive and negative sequence networks are connected in parallel for a <b>line-to-line</b> <b>fault,</b> and solved to obtain the phase quantities. The solution proceeds by identifying the connection of the sequence networks at the fault point and then solving for the symmetrical component currents and voltages. These are then used to determine the symmetrical component voltages at the other busbars and hence the symmetrical component currents in the lines. The approach requires that the connection of the sequence networks be known for the common fault types. However, a solution by the general method of fault admittance matrix does not require prior knowledge of how the sequence networks are connected.

Fault protection is required for ground <b>faults,</b> <b>line-to-line</b> <b>faults</b> and arc faults.

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems, the fault frequently involves arcing and burning {{for all the}} wiring exposed to mechanical damage and other insulation stresses including wiring not fixed and connected by flexible cords and cables. The IEC Standard 60364 stops the design of electric power systems at the outlets of branch circuits or at the fixed equipment. A complete design instead should {{take care of the}} connections of the portable equipment and of extension cords (as requested by NFPA 70) that are exposed to arc-faults and may cause fire and/or electric shock hazard. The cords supplying the Class II equipment are without a grounding protection conductor, so the failure of the double insulation, caused by external damage, can't be expected to be easily detected as a ground fault. A protection must be provided to prevent the fault from extinguishing itself without being detected and remaining energized, thus presenting an electric shock hazard by direct contact with a live part, rendered accessible after local insulation failure.

Different types of fault current limiters are available but the SFCL, thanks to its intrinsic properties, with an extremely non-linear resistivity, {{can be seen as a}} natural fault current limiter. At this day, the resistive SFCL (rSFCL) and the inductive SFCL (iSFCL) appear to be the most used in electrical network. Some papers deal with rSFCL and iSFCL but most of them reduce the comparison to the three-phase short-circuit only. However, despite it's one of the most critical case, it is not the most common. For example, if a phase-to-phase short circuit with earth connection occurs close to a transformer with low zero sequence impedance, its amplitude could be higher than the three-phase one. The proposed study, based on symmetrical components, takes into account various fault types (i. e. single line-to-ground fault, <b>line-to-line</b> <b>fault,</b> double line-to-ground fault, three-phase fault) at different locations in meshed and non-meshed HV power system. Comparisons were made by studying the initial symmetrical short-circuit current and the first peak short-circuit current at the fault point and near the fault location (parallel transmission line, generator, …). Various SFCL impedance values and SFCL locations were studied to determine which type of SFCLs is the most effective. In addition, we studied the effects of the power system parameters changes in presence of SFCL (i. e. transformer connection, X/R line ratio). Results show that the rSFCL is the most suitable to limit the first peak of the fault current. About the optimal location the SFCL, we conclude that the transformer feeder is more interesting than the line feeder. In fact, for a power system with parallel transmission lines, we show that a line feeder position induces a significant increase of the current in the healthy line leading to a breaker trip...|$|E
