40|$|Although gall {{diversity}} in the Neotropical region is immense, comparative studies on the phenology of host plants and their galls are scarce. Gall systems generally require high levels of phenological synchrony between the associated organisms. The relationships between the phenology of two <b>leaf</b> <b>galls</b> induced by an unidentified Cecidomyiidae in Aspidosperma spruceanum Benth. ex Müell. Arg. and by Pseudophacopteron sp. in A. australe Müell. Arg. were investigated. The investigation was performed on ten individuals per species in 15 -day intervals taking into consideration the percentage of galled leaves. In a one-year study, three distinct phenophases for the <b>leaf</b> <b>galls</b> and four phenophases for host plants were observed. The maximum percentage of <b>leaf</b> <b>galls</b> (80 %) on A. australe occurred just after the peak of leaf sprouting. In A. spruceanum, the percentage of <b>leaf</b> <b>galls</b> was always over 50 %, which {{can be related to}} continuous <b>leaf</b> production and <b>gall</b> induction in this species. In both species, developing galls were observed over the entire year, indicating multivoltinism.

50|$|Pyemotes herfsi, {{also known}} as the oak <b>leaf</b> <b>gall</b> mite or itch mite, is an ectoparasitic mite {{identified}} in central Europe in 1936 and subsequently found in India, Australia, and the United States. The mite parasitizes a variety of insect hosts and bites humans, causing red, itchy, and painful s (welts). The mites are barely visible, measuring about 0.2 millimeters; their great reproductive potential, small size, and high capacity for dispersal by wind make them difficult to control or avoid.|$|E
50|$|The sexual form {{begins with}} {{male and female}} eggs laid on the {{underside}} of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine's trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs parthenogenetically in a <b>leaf</b> <b>gall</b> that she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that stops it from healing. This poison eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces by laying eggs for up to seven more generations (which also can reproduce parthenogenetically) each summer. These offspring spread to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge next spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form, else they perform the same role without wings. These nymphs start the cycle again by either staying on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same.|$|E

40|$|Background. Pistacia integerrima (P. integerrina) insect galls {{are widely}} used in {{ayurveda}} and siddha sys- tem of medicine as karkatasringi. The use of leaf galls as a rejuvenator {{may be attributed to}} antioxidant prop- erty, however there is less scientiﬁc evidence. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the chemical composition and the antioxidant potential of <b>leaf</b> <b>gall</b> extracts (aqueous and ethanol) of P. integerrina, which is extensively used in the preparation of traditional medications. Material and methods. The antioxidant activities of aqueous and ethanolic <b>leaf</b> <b>gall</b> extracts were examined using diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl scavenging and ferric reducing power (FRAP) methods. Results. The presences of phenolics, tannins, phytosterols, triterpenoids, saponins, ﬂavonoids and reducing sugars were identiﬁed in both the extracts. In comparison to the aqueous extract, the ethanolic extract had the highest total phenolic and ﬂavonoid content at 234 ± 2. 4 mg of GAE/g d. w. and 95. 5 ± 3. 2 mg of QUE/g d. w., respectively. This higher content of total phenolics and ﬂavonoids found in the ethanolic extract was directly associated with higher antioxidant activity. Conclusion. This study demonstrates the poetnet antioxidant activities of P. integerrima <b>leaf</b> <b>gall</b> extracts. Further, there was a strong association between the higher antioxidant activities with that of higher total phe- nolic and ﬂavonoid content in the ethanolic <b>leaf</b> <b>gall</b> extracts of P. integerrima. The results encourage the use of P. integerrima <b>leaf</b> <b>gall</b> extracts for medicinal health, functional food and nutraceuticals applications, due to their antioxidant properties.

40|$|Introduction: Free {{radicals}} are implicated in several metabolic diseases and the medicinal properties of {{plants have been}} explored for their potent antioxidant activities to counteract metabolic disorders. This research highlights the chemical composition and antioxidant potential of <b>leaf</b> <b>gall</b> extracts (aqueous and methanol) of Syzygium cumini (S. cumini), which have been extensively used in traditional medications to treat various metabolic diseases. Methods: The antioxidant activities of <b>leaf</b> <b>gall</b> extracts were examined using diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH), nitric oxide scavenging, hydroxyl scavenging and ferric reducing power (FRAP) methods. Results: In all the methods, the methanolic extract showed higher antioxidant potential than the standard ascorbic acid. The presence of phenolics, flavonoids, phytosterols, terpenoids, and reducing sugars was identified in both the extracts. When compared, the methanol extract had the highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents at 474 ± 2. 2 mg of GAE/g d. w and 668 ± 1. 4 mg of QUE/g d. w, respectively. The significant high antioxidant activity can be positively correlated to the high content of total polyphenols/flavonoids of the methanol extract. Conclusion: The present study confirms the folklore use of S. cumini leaves gall extracts as a natural antioxidant and justifies its ethnobotanical use. Further, the result of antioxidant properties encourages the use of S. cumini <b>leaf</b> <b>gall</b> extracts for medicinal health, functional food and nutraceuticals applications...|$|E
