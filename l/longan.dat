The most complete description of the medicinal use of the durian as remedies for fevers is a Malay prescription, collected by Burkill and Haniff in 1930. It instructs the reader to boil the roots of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis with the roots of Durio zibethinus, Nephelium <b>longan,</b> Nephelium mutabile and Artocarpus integrifolia, and drink the decoction or use it as a poultice.|$|E
25|$|Lychee giant stink bugs, Tessaratoma papillosa, are {{destructive}} pests of lychee trees (Litchi chinensis) in China. They also {{feed on the}} {{closely related}} Sapindaceae fruit trees like <b>longan</b> (Dimocarpus <b>longan)</b> and rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum). The closely related Tessaratoma quadrata and Tessaratoma javanica are also minor pests of apple, pear, and lychee trees.|$|E
25|$|In tessaratomids {{considered}} to be agricultural pests (like the Musgraveia sulciventris and Tessaratoma papillosa), the wasps that parasitize them are being studied as potential biological control agents. In the Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces of China, mass-reared Anastatus japonicus are being released to combat Tessaratoma papillosa pests in lychee and <b>longan</b> crops. The same measures are also reportedly being done in Thailand.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{historical}} {{reference to}} Yang Meng was in 919, when Yang <b>Longan</b> had just declared himself the King of Wu, a kingdom {{derived from the}} domains that Yang Xingmi conquered {{at the end of}} Tang. [...] Yang Longyan created his younger brothers and his only known son Yang Fen (楊玢) dukes — in Yang Meng's case, the Duke of Lujiang. [...] It was said that Yang Meng was talented, and he often lamented the state of the affairs in Wu, which then was in effect controlled by the regent Xu Wen, stating, [...] "It is the state of my family's; is it all right for it to be taken over by others?"

Now this tree is an evergreen, and all the year round some portion of its foliage is undergoing decay, the particular leaves being, in such a stage, partially orange and black. This bat can, therefore, at all seasons suspend from its branches and elude its enemies by its resemblance to the leaves of the tree."[68] ...|$|E
50|$|The {{warm and}} moist climate and fertile {{land in the}} {{prefecture}} of Ningde provide it with favorable conditions for agriculture.

60|$|On the 25th of March I reached Dinapore, a large {{military}} station, sufficiently insalubrious, {{particularly for}} European troops, the barracks being so misplaced that the inmates are suffocated: the buildings run {{east and west}} instead of north and south, and therefore lose all the breeze in the hottest weather. From this place I sent the boat down to Patna, and proceeded thither by land {{to the house of}} Dr. Irvine, an old acquaintance and botanist, from whom I received a most kind welcome. On the road, Bengal forms of vegetation, to which I had been for three months a stranger, reappeared; likewise groves of fan and toddy palms, which are both very rare higher up the river; clumps of large bamboo, orange, Acacia Sissoo, Melia, Guatteria longifolia, Spondias mangifera, Odina, Euphorbia pentagona, neriifolia and trigona, were common road-side plants. In the gardens, Papaw, Croton, Jatropha, Buddleia, Cookia, Loquat, Litchi, <b>Longan,</b> all kinds of the orange tribe, and the cocoa-nut, some from their presence, and many from their profusion, indicated a decided change of climate, a receding from the desert north-west of India, and its dry winds, and an approach to the damper regions of the many-mouthed Ganges.|$|E
6000|$|To me {{the most}} {{interesting}} object in Bhagulpore was the Horticultural Gardens, whose origin and flourishing condition are due to the activity and enterprise of the late Major Napleton, commander of the hill-rangers. The site is good, consisting of fifteen acres, that were, four years ago, an indigo field, but form now a smiling garden. About fifty men are employed; {{and the number of}} seeds and vegetables annually distributed is very great. Of trees the most conspicuous are the tamarind, Tecoma jasminoides, Erythrina, Adansonia, Bombax, teak, banyan, peepul, Sissoo, Casuarina, Terminalia, Melia, Bauhinia. Of introduced species English and Chinese flat peaches (pruned to the centre to let the sun in), Mangos of various sorts, Eugenia Jambos, various Anonas, Litchi, Loquat and <b>Longan,</b> oranges, Sapodilla; apple, pear, both succeeding tolerably; various Cabool and Persian varieties of fruit-trees; figs, grapes, guava, apricots, and jujube. The grapes looked extremely well, but they require great skill and care in the management. They form a long covered walk, with a row of plantains on the W. side, to diminish the effects of the hot winds, but even with this screen, the fruit on that side are inferior to that on the opposite trellis. Easterly winds, again, being moist, blight these and other plants, by favouring the abundant increase of insects, and causing the leaves to curl and fall off; and against this evil there is no remedy. With a clear sky the mischief is not great; under a cloudy one the prevalence of such winds is fatal to the crop. The white ant sometimes attacks the stems, and is best checked by washing the roots with limewater, yellow arsenic, or tobacco-water. Numerous Cerealia, and the varieties of cotton, sugar-cane, etc. all thrive extremely well; so do many of our English vegetables. Cabbages, peas, and beans are much injured by the caterpillars of a Pontia, like our English [...] "White;" [...] raspberries, currants, and gooseberries will not grow at all.|$|E
50|$|Another {{event is}} the <b>Longan</b> Fair (งานเทศกาลลำไย) in August which is {{designed}} to promote this hugely popular fruit. There are the beautifully decorated <b>longan</b> parade and <b>longan</b> contests.|$|E

5000|$|... (Horticulturist, not Botanist)Paul Thomson (June 29, 1916 - May 31, 2008) was an American exotic fruit enthusiast, self-taught {{horticulturist}} and botanist, fruit farmer, and the {{co-founder of}} the California Rare Fruit Growers Association, a group of amateur horticulturists which now has more than 3,000 members in approximately 35 countries. Thomson is credited with helping to expand the farming of exotic fruits in California - everything from cherimoyas to <b>longans</b> to pitahayas.|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit is}} edible, with the <b>Longan</b> (D. <b>longan)</b> being grown commercially for fruit production.|$|E
50|$|Later on, due to {{immigration}} {{and the growing}} demand for nostalgic foods, the <b>longan</b> tree was officially introduced to Australia in the mid-1800s, Thailand in the late-1800s, and Hawaii and Florida in the 1900s. The warm, sandy-soiled conditions allowed for the easy growth of <b>longan</b> trees. This jump-started the <b>longan</b> industry in these locations.|$|E
50|$|Its {{earliest}} {{record of}} existence draws {{back to the}} Han Dynasty in 200 BC. The emperor had demanded lychee and <b>longan</b> trees to be planted in his palace gardens in Shaanxi, but the plants failed. Fortunately, four hundred years later, <b>longan</b> trees flourished {{in other parts of}} China like Fujian and Guangdong, where <b>longan</b> production soon became an industry.|$|E
5000|$|Chao'an District(Chaozhou) and Chenghai District(Shantou) In Chao'an and Chenghai, {{children}} who are [...] "Chu Hua Yuan" [...] should use twelve different flower petals soaked in water and wash their body. After that, they should wear a new red dudou—the original Chinese form of the Vietnamese yếm—that their mothers made for them and put twelve <b>longans</b> and two copper coin in the dudou. Then they should wear new clothes and red clogs given by their grandmothers.|$|R
50|$|Another {{ritual is}} the {{installation}} of the bridal bed (安床, ān chuáng). At an auspicious date and time, a woman of good fortune installs the bridal bed in the bridal room. New red or pink bedsheets are used and a plate of dried <b>longans,</b> lotus seeds, red dates, persimmons, sprig of pomegranate leaves together with 2 red packets are placed on the bed. A pair of bedside lamps (子孙登) is lit to symbolize the addition of sons to the family.|$|R
50|$|In Chinese cuisine, Tremella fuciformis is {{traditionally}} used in sweet dishes. While tasteless, it is valued for its gelatinous texture {{as well as}} its supposed medicinal benefits. Most commonly, it is used to make a dessert soup called luk mei (六味) in Cantonese, often in combination with jujubes, dried <b>longans,</b> and other ingredients. It is also used as a component of a drink and as an ice cream. Since cultivation has made it less expensive, it is now additionally used in some savoury dishes.|$|R
5000|$|Dimocarpus australianus {{also known}} as Australian Native Lychee, is a species of trees, {{closely related to the}} <b>longan,</b> constituting part of the plant family Sapindaceae. They grow {{naturally}} only (endemic) in Cape York Peninsula, Australia. The edible fruit tastes like lychee, sweeter than <b>longan,</b> and occasionally gets described as 'too sweet' in comparison by <b>longan</b> fanciers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Longan</b> is {{commonly}} found in traditional Eastern folk medicine as opposed to modern Western medicine. This is not an unusual occurrence since, prior to the 1800s, <b>longan</b> was most prevalent in Asia.|$|E
50|$|The alupag is a {{fruit of}} the Dimocarpus didyma tree. The fruit is not unlike the <b>longan</b> or lychee. Compared to a <b>longan,</b> it has bumpier skin. The tree's wood is used to make combs.|$|E
5000|$|Symbolic analogy: Eliminating {{evil and}} blessing is the eternal motif of Qingyang folk cultures. The main {{expression}} of Qingyang sachet is using symbolic means.

5000|$|Douhua ( [...] , dòuhuā or , dòufuhuā in Chinese), or tofu brain ( [...] or , dòufunaǒ in Chinese) {{is often}} eaten as a dessert, but {{sometimes}} salty pickles or hot sauce are added instead. This {{is a type}} of soft tofu with an even higher moisture content. Because {{it is very difficult to}} pick up with chopsticks, it is generally eaten with a spoon. With the addition of flavorings such as finely chopped spring onions, dried shrimp, soy sauce, or chilli sauce, douhua is a popular breakfast dish across China. In Malaysia, douhua is usually served warm with white or dark (palm) sugar syrup, or served cold with <b>longans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thomson began {{experimenting with}} rare fruits {{during the early}} 1950s after being {{stationed}} in San Diego. He and his wife, Helen, purchased five acres (2 ha) of land in Bonsall, California, in 1952. The couple initially lived in a trailer on the land while they were building their home. He began experimenting with tropical fruits and fruit trees that were usually found in climates warmer than that part of Southern California. Thomson initially planted papayas, lychees, mangoes, <b>longans</b> and other tropical species on his new 5 acre farm. However, most of his attempts to grow these fruits were a failure due to freezing temperatures during the winters. For example, mangoes could not survive the winter climate in Bonsall.|$|R
