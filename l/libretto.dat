5|$|A repeat {{performance}} of BWV243a may have accompanied the first performance of BWV10 on 2July 1724. The <b>libretto</b> of the cantata performed in Leipzig at {{the feast of}} the Visitation of 1725 survives. Maria Aurora von Königsmarck is the possible author of this Magnificat paraphrase. Around a decade before the <b>libretto</b> was reprinted in Leipzig it had already been set by Reinhard Keiser and Johann Mattheson. It is not known whether Bach set the <b>libretto,</b> neither which setting of the <b>libretto</b> was used for the 1725 Visitation feast in Leipzig. A year later Bach performed Der Herr wird ein Neues im Lande, JLB13, a Visitation cantata by his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach. Picander's <b>libretto</b> for the Visitation cantata of 1728 may have been set as part of Bach's fourth cantata cycle: the <b>libretto,</b> surviving without music, starts with a dictum quoted from Luther's German translation of Luke1:46–47.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, George Frideric Handel {{wrote the}} opera Samson, with a <b>libretto</b> by Newburgh Hamilton, based on Samson Agonistes. The opera {{is almost entirely}} set inside Samson's prison and Delilah only briefly appears in Act II. In 1877, Camille Saint-Saëns {{composed}} the opera Samson and Delilah with a <b>libretto</b> by Ferdinand Lemaire in which the entire story of Samson and Delilah is retold. In the <b>libretto,</b> Delilah is portrayed as a seductive femme fatale, but the music played during her parts invokes sympathy for her.|$|E

5|$|In 1838 Planché was to {{collaborate}} on an opera with another notable composer, Felix Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn originally approved of Planché's choice of topic, Edward III's siege of Calais in the Hundred Years War, and responded positively {{to the first}} two acts of the <b>libretto.</b> But, after Mendelssohn received the final act, he expressed doubts about the subject, asked Planché to start work on a completely new <b>libretto,</b> and eventually stopped replying to Planché's letters. The opera was never realised.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is a monography about Giuseppe Palomba, a neapolitan librettist, lived between {{the eighteenth and}} nineteenth century. The first part of the thesis reconstructes the musical comic theatre’s history in Naples from 1700 to 1825. Then, after a bibliographic research about the librettist’s Opera, the themes, the structures, the style and the language of a sample of Palomba’s <b>librettos</b> (63 <b>librettos)</b> are analysed in detail. The last section of this work analyses the critically acclaimed <b>librettos</b> derived from Goldoni. On the whole Palomba’s <b>librettos</b> give important information about the greatest opera composers of the era, theatres and impresarios, companies of players, the public tastes, other librettists and finally the Opera’s commerce and exportation in Europe. And from these <b>librettos</b> it is possible to reconstruct a unknown part of musical comic theatre...|$|R
2500|$|Wagner's <b>libretti,</b> {{which he}} {{invariably}} wrote himself, usually passed through four stages; {{with one or}} two minor qualifications, the <b>libretti</b> of the four Ring operas were no different. These stages are as follows: ...|$|R

5|$|This is {{the order}} in which the musical numbers appear in the <b>libretto.</b> The music is known to survive for numbers shown in bold; a ballet also survives, but its {{location}} is uncertain. Reviews of the opera hint at three additional numbers not in the <b>libretto,</b> but as their names and exact locations are unknown, they are not listed.|$|E
25|$|However, Verdi {{had given}} some {{consideration}} {{of the idea of}} adapting one of the <b>librettos</b> written by Temistocle Solera in earlier years, <b>librettos</b> which music historian David Kimball regards as having something of grand opera in their structure.|$|R
50|$|Scribe wrote <b>libretti</b> for operas {{for many}} major composers of his time, often for {{productions}} {{destined for the}} Paris Opéra. Many of these <b>libretti</b> constitute {{the basis of the}} Grand Opera genre and changed the whole course of French lyric drama.|$|R
2500|$|According to Reinhard Strohm, {{at least}} 22 {{original}} or significantly re-worked opera <b>libretti</b> {{can be attributed}} to Lalli. [...] Apart from his 1711 comic opera Elisa and four comic intermezzi, the remainder of the opera <b>libretti</b> attributed to him are all in the opera seria and dramma per musica genres. Lalli also wrote texts and <b>libretti</b> for several musical works in other genres: cantatas, serenatas, and azioni sacri (stage works on religious subjects and precursors of the oratorio).|$|R

5|$|According to the <b>libretto,</b> {{the action}} of Tosca occurs in Rome in June 1800. Sardou, in his play, dates it more precisely; La Tosca {{takes place in the}} afternoon, evening, and early morning of 17 and 18June 1800.|$|E
50|$|<b>Libretti</b> for operas, oratorios and cantatas in the 17th and 18th centuries {{generally}} {{were written}} by someone other than the composer, often a well-known poet. Metastasio (1698-1782) (real name Pietro Trapassi) {{was one of the}} most highly regarded librettists in Europe. His <b>libretti</b> were set many times by many different composers. Another noted 18th-century librettist was Lorenzo Da Ponte, who wrote the <b>libretti</b> for three of Mozart's greatest operas, as well as for many other composers.|$|R

50|$|Grazio Braccioli (1682-1752) was an Italian jurist, {{poet and}} librettist. Born in Ferrara, he wrote 9 <b>libretti</b> for operas {{produced}} at the Teatro Sant'Angelo in Venice between 1711 and 1715. Among them were the <b>libretti</b> for Vivaldi's Orlando furioso and Orlando finto pazzo.|$|R
5|$|Although {{he never}} {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} composing a full opera, and considered many subjects– including that of the Nibelung saga later adapted by Wagner, about which he corresponded with his sister Fanny– he never wrote {{more than a few}} pages of sketches for any project. In Mendelssohn's last years the opera manager Benjamin Lumley tried to contract him to write an opera from Shakespeare's The Tempest on a <b>libretto</b> by Eugène Scribe, and even announced it as forthcoming in 1847, the year of Mendelssohn's death. The <b>libretto</b> was eventually set by Fromental Halévy. At his death Mendelssohn left some sketches for an opera on the story of the Lorelei.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's first {{project was}} a <b>libretto</b> for a comic opera called Le Corsaire, based on Lord Byron's The Corsair. Realizing {{he would have}} trouble finding a composer, however, he turned to other pursuits.|$|E

50|$|The <b>librettos</b> of {{the church}} cantatas {{presented}} {{for the first time}} in Leipzig during Bach's third to fifth year in that city have a diverse origin. The most substantial group of <b>librettos</b> with a similar structure derives from a 1704 cycle of cantata texts printed in Meiningen, which was used for most of the cantatas presented in the liturgical year 1725-26. In 1728 many of the <b>librettos</b> of cantatas associated with Bach's third to fifth year in Leipzig were grouped in a single publication by Christoph Birkmann.|$|R
