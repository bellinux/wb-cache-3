500|$|Barkley {{supported}} William Gibbs McAdoo {{for president}} at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, but the nomination went to James M. Cox. He campaigned for Cox and his running mate, Franklin D. Roosevelt, but his speeches focused more on Wilson's progressive record than Cox's fitness for office. Republican Warren G. Harding defeated Cox in the general election, and Barkley found common ground with him {{on issues such as}} the creation of the Veterans' Bureau and the passage of the progressive Sheppard–Towner Act. Barkley thought the administration was too favorable to big business interests, however, and in 1922, he proclaimed that if Harding had returned the country to normalcy, [...] "then in God's name <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> Abnormalcy".|$|E
500|$|The {{first four}} titles were {{published}} in 1930 and were an immediate success. Exact sales figures are not available for the years prior to 1979, but {{an indication of the}} books' popularity can be seen in a letter that Laura Harris, a Grosset and Dunlap editor, wrote to the Syndicate in 1931: [...] "can you <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> the manuscript as soon as possible, and no later than July 10? There will only be three or four titles brought out then and the Nancy Drew {{is one of the most}} important." [...] The 6,000 copies that Macy's ordered for the 1933 Christmas season sold out within days. In 1934 Fortune magazine featured the Syndicate in a cover story and singled Nancy Drew out for particular attention: [...] "Nancy is the greatest phenomenon among all the fifty-centers. She is a best seller. How she crashed a Valhalla that had been rigidly restricted to the male of her species is a mystery even to her publishers." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1962, the Beatles {{concluded}} {{their fifth}} and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, {{they had agreed}} that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, {{in an effort to}} maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, [...] "Look, {{if you really want to}} get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ..." [...] Lennon said: [...] "We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> our own sense of individuality." ...|$|E

500|$|What {{became known}} as the [...] "Norway debate" [...] opened on 7 May, and lasted for two days. The initial speeches, {{including}} Chamberlain's, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, member for Portsmouth North, in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism. Leo Amery then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing Oliver Cromwell's words on dissolving the Long Parliament: [...] "You have sat here too long for any good you are doing. Depart, I say, and <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> done with you. In the name of God, go!" [...] When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his [...] "friends—and I still have some friends in this House—to support the Government tonight". Though {{the use of the word}} [...] "friends" [...] was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an [...] "error of judgment" [...] for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty [...] "when the gravity of the war situation required national unity". Lloyd George joined the attackers and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government. When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E

2500|$|In 1856, at the {{beginning}} of his reign, Alexander had made a memorable speech to the deputies of the Polish nobility who inhabited Congress Poland, Western Ukraine, Lithuania, Livonia and Belarus, in which he admonished, [...] "Gentlemen, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> no dreams!" [...] The result was the January Uprising of 1863–1864 that was suppressed after eighteen months of fighting. Hundreds of Poles were executed, and thousands were deported to Siberia. The price for suppression was Russian support for the unification of Germany. Years later, Germany and Russia became enemies.|$|E
2500|$|It {{appears that}} Turner then betrayed his friends, and {{provided}} the authorities with the necessary information on the Irish fugitives, even down {{to the location of}} the victims’ rooms. Paul Weber presumes that only Tandy and Blackwell offered active resistance to the ensuing arrest: “Blackwell vehemently complained about this violent intrusion on his rights as a French officer, but his furious protests were to no avail.” [...] Corbet too demanded to know on whose authority the soldiers acted? [...] Weber informs us that among the letters found upon Blackwell’s person, there is one unfinished, the completion of which appears to have been prematurely prevented during those early hours of the twenty-fourth: “He must have left Lady Pamela’s home in a state of emotional confusion” and, influenced by “a guilty conscience, wrote, ‘there, dear Madam, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> none affliction in the common of two.’ Blackwell was obviously at pains to reason his female addressee out of a liaison, the beginnings of which had left him utterly bewildered.” [...] To all appearances, Weber speculates, the supper party did not stop at political talks.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 June 2011, Williams {{said that}} the British Government was {{committing}} Britain to [...] "radical, long-term policies for which no-one voted". Writing in the New Statesman magazine, Williams raised concerns about the coalition's health, education and welfare reforms. He said there was [...] "indignation" [...] {{due to a lack}} of [...] "proper public argument". He also {{said that the}} [...] "Big Society" [...] idea was viewed with [...] "widespread suspicion", noting also that [...] "we are still waiting for a full and robust account of what the Left would do differently and what a Left-inspired version of localism would look like". The article also said there was concern that the government would abandon its responsibility for tackling child poverty, illiteracy and poor access to the best schools. He also expressed concern about the [...] "quiet resurgence of the seductive language of 'deserving' and 'undeserving' poor" [...] and the steady pressure to increase [...] "what look like punitive responses to alleged abuses of the system". In response, David Cameron said that he “profoundly disagreed” with Williams's claim that the government was forcing through “radical policies for which no one voted”. Cameron said that the government was acting in a “good and moral” fashion and defended the “Big Society” and the Coalition’s deficit reduction, welfare and education plans. “I am absolutely convinced that our policies are about actually giving people a greater responsibility and greater chances in their life, and I will defend those very vigorously”, he said. “By all means <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> a robust debate but I can tell you, it will always be a two-sided debate.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1892, as {{a member}} of the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association, Keith, who wrote for the San Francisco News Letter over the pen name of “Di Vernon,” and was noted as having scored a [...] "journalistic triumph" [...] for her {{comments}} published by the Illustrated American. Beginning with a Fourth of July article, 1890, she published a glowing article in the News Letter, in which she stated: “It is treason to haul down the flag from the masthead; it is treason to degrade it in the estimation of a child.” In February, 1891, she asked: “Shall the flag of our country be debased by bearing upon its fair surface an advertising device? If there be no law to prevent it, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> one at once.” In September, 1891, she delivered an address before the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association at Union Square Hall. The peroration was a patriotic outburst, calling upon Congress to protect the flag from the advertising 'fiend'. This was published in the Daily Report, of San Francisco, and in the New York Journalist, giving it a widespread circulation. This address also contained an exposition of “Di Vernon's” pet project, the organization of the “Order of the American Flag,” a patriotic legion, among the children of America. At other times during the last few years which preceded this, Keith (as Di Vernon) made similar appeals to arouse the patriotic sentiment. So she was surprised, after picking up a copy of the Illustrated American in April, 1892, to find a self-laudatory editorial, in which the paper congratulated itself that the crusade which it had inaugurated against the flag-advertising was about yield results. To claim the whole credit for that aroused Di Vernon's sense of justice. She wrote to the editor, asking the date of the “inauguration.” Maurice Meyer Minton, Sr. replied in a courteous note, stating that the matter was brought up in editorials of vol. 9, page 530, dated Feb. 6, 1892. Keith (Di Vernon) found all the dates of her patriotic articles, and in the News Letter of May 14, 1892, published a history of the whole matter, under the [...] caption: “Honor the Flag.” With characteristic directness, Di Vernon asked: “Don't you think that instead of taking the lead, you were rather late in dropping into line?” ...|$|E
