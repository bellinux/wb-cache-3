The research {{was carried out in}} three phases: field study, pilot survey and main survey. The main survey data were analyzed through Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique.

40|$|In {{the trend}} of {{globalization}} and coordination of banks, insurance and security companies, Taiwan life insurance industry has been facing tremendous competitive pressure. As {{a result of the}} shift from focusing on tangible resources to intangible resources, enterprises are seeking for gaining more and more competitive advantages through managing and maximizing their most valuable asset, i. e., knowledge. While knowledge management (KM) has been used and operated in the business world for decades, its applications, which involve recognition of knowledge, development of information system and support of organization, have just been initiated in Taiwan life insurance industry recently. The issues of knowledge management have been discussed widely by a number of researchers. However, there is a genuine lack of knowledge management adoption and practice model for the life insurance industry. This study addresses this research gap via conducting empirical surveys with an embedded qualitative field study among the <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Taiwan. The research aims to examine the value of knowledge, perception of knowledge management and the factors of knowledge management adoption and practice in the context of Taiwan life insurance industry. The research was carried out in three main phases. In the first phase, a tentative research model was developed through a comprehensive literature review. A qualitative field study was then undertaken to fine-tune the research model. Six life insurance companies participated in the field study, resulting in ten interviews with key persons in the companies. A semi-structured interview protocol was used to collect the data. Via the procedures of content analysis, twelve factors and ninety-three variables were identified from the field study. The combined research model was thus developed by incorporating the results from the field study and the tentative research model which was proposed based on the extensive literature review. In the second phase, a questionnaire was developed, according to the combined research model. The research instrument was pilot tested by surveying several managers and staff in a life insurance company in Taiwan. The findings from the empirical pilot survey indicated that the research instrument was relatively reliable. However, some minor amendments were made based on the feedback from pilot test. In the third phase, a nation-wide main survey was administered among 605 managers and staff within different departments and sections in the life insurance companies in Taiwan. 362 valid responses were collected in this phase which yielded a 59. 8 % effective response rate. The national survey data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) based Structural Equation Modeling technique. The findings revealed that “environments and industrial factors”, “knowledge management promotion” as well as “cultural factors” significantly influenced the “perceived usefulness” of knowledge management. However, the effect of the “complexity” concerning knowledge management on employees’ attitudes toward its adoption was found to be insignificant in this study. It was “individual characteristics”, “perceived usefulness” and “subjective norm” that significantly influenced the employees’ attitudes toward knowledge management adoption. It thus implied that the employees would attempt to overcome the difficulties involved in knowledge management as it was perceived useful for them and there was an environment in which knowledge management activities were valued and encouraged. Moreover, the results indicated that “attitude toward KM adoption” significantly influenced knowledge management practice, which in turn affected the perceived performance of the organization. The research model well explained how knowledge management was adopted and applied in Taiwan <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprises.</b> This study thus contributes significantly to the existing literature since there was little research available in investigating life insurance enterprises’ adopting and applying knowledge management. In the meantime, {{the findings of this study}} also provide managerial implications to the life insurance business, particularly that embarking on knowledge management in Taiwan. Finally, the applications of this study can be extended through further adaptation in other financial industries and various geographic contexts...|$|E

40|$|Retained {{earnings}} {{of mutual funds}} and other collective investment schemes There are inconsistencies in the current treatment of the retained {{earnings of}} various collective investment schemes. For mutual funds, regarded as portfolio investment in BPM 5, their undistributed earnings are not deemed to be distributed 1, whereas the net earnings of pension funds and the technical reserves of life insurance companies are deemed to be distributed as income, {{and then returned to}} these institutional units, also in the financial account 2. I. Current international standards for the statistical treatment of the issue In the 1993 SNA, BPM 5, (and ESA 95) <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprises</b> and pension funds are deemed to have no retained earnings (other than that attributable to shareholders ’ funds in life insurance companies) : the excess of net property income receivable over costs of production is channeled to policy holders or beneficiaries (households and nonresidents) through the primary distribution of income account. These funds are deemed to be reinvested, through the financial account, by the policyholders in these institutional units through net equity on life insurance reserves and pension funds. The rationale for this treatment in the 1993 SNA (para. 7. 124) is that, as the technical reserves are assets of the beneficiaries and policyholders, the investment income receivable must be shown as being paid by these enterprises to the policyholders and beneficiaries. The 1993 SNA, BPM 5 (and ESA 95) classify investments in mutual funds in the same way, that is, as shares and other equity in the financial account and balance sheet in the national accounts ’ framework (see 1993 SNA, para. 11. 86 – 97, and ESA 95, para. 5. 96 – 97) and as equity securities in the balance of payments (BPM 5, para. 388 3), irrespective of what assets the mutual fund has acquired. 4 Therefore, even if a mutual fund invests solely in debt instruments, the shares in the fund are still regarded as equity instruments...|$|E
