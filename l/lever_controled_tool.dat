50|$|To {{assist the}} {{operator}} in determining their functions, each lever in a frame will generally be uniquely labelled, one common method being to number the levers in order {{from left to}} right. A lever's identification may be painted on its side or engraved on a badge or plate fitted either to the lever or behind it. This may {{be accompanied by a}} description of the lever's function. Usually, a large track diagram is positioned within easy view of the operator, which clearly shows each lever number adjacent to symbols representing the items of equipment that they operate. Levers are commonly coloured according to the type of equipment they control, the code of colours varying between different railway administrations. For example, in British practice, the following code generally applies: a red <b>lever</b> <b>controls</b> a stop signal or shunt signal, a yellow <b>lever</b> <b>controls</b> a distant signal, a black <b>lever</b> <b>controls</b> a set of points, a blue <b>lever</b> <b>controls</b> a facing point lock, and a white lever is spare. Brown levers are used to lock level crossing gates.|$|R

40|$|Most, if not all, {{management}} <b>control</b> <b>tools</b> were formulated {{for firms}} employing an industrial value creation logic (i. e., Ford, McDonald’s, and Wal-Mart). We argue {{that given the}} growth, both in number and importance, of firms employing a knowledge value creation logic (i. e., Accenture, Goldman Sachs, and Clifford Chance) and firms employing a network logic (i. e., Verizon, eBay, and Expedia) that these <b>control</b> <b>tools</b> should be revisited {{in light of this}} potentially critical contingency. This paper outlines the key characteristics of knowledge intensive firms and network service firms and then examines how these contingencies impact Simons’ (1995) <b>Levers</b> of <b>Control</b> and Kaplan and Norton’s (1996) Balanced Scorecard. We find that whilst each lever/perspective is still relevant for each value creation logic, the relative importance and thus intensity of use should vary between logics.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three research papers that deal with the topic of “accounting and innovation” and provide evidence for the area of innovation from two accounting perspectives, i. e., the external disclosure perspective and the internal management control system perspective. The disclosure perspective is addressed in the first paper. Using content analysis, it examines the innovation capital disclosure characteristics, i. e., disclosure quantity and quality, in intellectual capital statements of 51 European for-profit firms. Additionally, the relationship between innovation capital disclosure characteristics and industry, firm size, region of domicile, and disclosure guidelines adopted are analyzed. The second and third paper address the management control system perspective. The second paper contributes to the research on management control systems in product development by exploring the performance effects and the interplay of the <b>levers</b> of <b>control,</b> i. e., interactive, diagnostic, beliefs, and boundary control systems, {{based on data from}} a survey of 468 senior managers from the manufacturing industry. Therefore, I compare by structural equation modeling a base model of unrelated <b>levers</b> of <b>control</b> (additive model) with (a) a model of mutual association of <b>levers</b> of <b>control</b> (interdependence model), (b) a model of joint use of <b>levers</b> of <b>control</b> (interaction model), and (c) a combined model of mutual association and joint use of <b>levers</b> of <b>control</b> (combined interdependence/interaction model). The best fitting and most parsimonious model is analyzed in terms of the performance effects of the <b>levers</b> of <b>control.</b> Based on the sample of the second paper, the third paper contributes to the recent literature on the relationship between management control systems and innovation by considering how the four <b>levers</b> of <b>control</b> are used as “packages” in product development. I employ cluster analysis to determine how the <b>levers</b> of <b>control</b> are combined, {{depending on the type of}} strategy formation (i. e., intended or emergent) and the degree of innovativeness of the firm. Furthermore, I explore which of these combinations are equifinal in terms of product development and organizational performance...|$|R

50|$|Evidence of {{the early}} manual {{operation}} of the station survives. The wheel handle valve controls are now gone but marks on the control room floor indicate the locations of their footings. The steel frame within the chamber accommodates the fixings for the shafts that ran down from the wheel handles to the pipes at the basement level. The original Kemp hydraulic controls machine now stands near the roller door. It once stood on the raised concrete pad at the river side of the control room. Associated with this is the <b>lever</b> <b>control</b> mounted on a small pedestal which {{stands in the middle}} of the <b>control</b> room. The <b>lever</b> <b>control</b> opened and shut the valves which when they were too tight had to be manipulated by hand. This hydraulic control mechanism is no longer operational. Dotted lines on the control room floor near the lever pedestal indicate that the river valves are to the southeast and the dam valves to the northwest. Three original pressure gauges are housed in a timber panel below the middle window on the northwest wall. These were connected to the pumps.|$|R
