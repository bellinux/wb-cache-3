5|$|A {{squadron}} of the 8th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment of the 3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade, commanded by Major Macpherson, left Nazareth at 05:00 on 25 September. They led the advance towards Tiberias {{along the main}} road, while troopers from the 10th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment, also of the 3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade, were ordered {{to the top of}} Mount Tabor. From this height, they could observe Macpherson's squadron and report on its progress to their brigade commander by heliograph.|$|E
5|$|As the 1st and 3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigades {{continued}} their dismounted attacks, they were shelled by Ottoman artillery. By 17:30 the 1st <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade had blocked all exits from Beersheba in the mosque area, including {{the hospital and}} barracks, capturing 96 prisoners, hospital staff, a priest, medical-corps details and 89 patients. The brigade established an outpost line in this sector, having suffered seven men killed and 83 wounded, 68 horses killed and 23 wounded. The 10th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment (3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade) held an outpost line north of Beersheba during the night, {{when a group of}} Ottoman soldiers approached the line at about 21:00. They were surrounded on three sides before the regiment fired on them with machine-guns, killing 50.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rest}} of the 3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade {{advanced}} to Tiberias, their left flank moved over the site of the 1187AD Battle of Hattin. On 26 September, the 3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade camped to the north of Tiberias, at Medjel on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. A squadron of the 9th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment rode out at 12:30 to investigate reports of a considerable enemy force at Safed. By the time they arrived at 18:00, the force had withdrawn. Meanwhile, the 8th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment restored order in the town and established guards on stores of grain while the remainder of the brigade rested after their night-time advance.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{during this same}} time, <b>lighter</b> <b>horses</b> were bred in {{northern}} Africa and the Middle East, where a faster, more agile horse was preferred. The <b>lighter</b> <b>horse</b> suited the raids and battles of desert people, allowing them to outmaneuver rather than overpower the enemy. [...] When Middle Eastern warriors and European knights collided in warfare, the heavy knights were frequently outmaneuvered. [...] The Europeans, however, responded by crossing their native breeds with [...] "oriental" [...] type horses such as the Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman horse [...] This cross-breeding led both to a nimbler war horse, such as today's Andalusian horse, but also created a type of horse known as a Courser, a predecessor to the Thoroughbred, which {{was used as a}} message horse.|$|R
5|$|In 1921, the Citizens Force was reorganised to {{replicate}} the numerical designations of the AIF units and perpetuate their honours and traditions. As a result, the 12th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment was re-raised in the New England region of New South Wales and headquartered at Armidale. In re-forming, the regiment drew lineage from the Citizens Forces' 12th (New England) <b>Light</b> <b>Horse,</b> which had existed parallel to the AIF <b>light</b> <b>horse</b> regiment and had remained in Australia during the war. This regiment, through a complex series of reorganisations, traced its lineage to the 6th Australian <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment, which had been raised in 1903 and perpetuated units that had contributed personnel to fight in South Africa during the Boer War.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, the 12th were {{relieved}} at Dueidar and {{moved back to}} Heliopolis. While there, Lieutenant Colonel Harold McIntosh took command of the regiment following Royston's elevation to temporary commander of the 2nd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade. On 27 July the regiment, without its machine-gun section which had been detached to the 2nd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade, was sent to Gebel Habeita to relieve the 9th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment. After undertaking {{the first part of}} the journey to Seraphum by train, they marched the rest of the way. In early August, Ottoman forces launched an attack in the Battle of Romani. During this fighting, the 12th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment provided flank protection, carrying out patrols, and was not directly engaged except for its machine-gun section.|$|E

5|$|The 4th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade (less the 4th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment and two squadrons or five {{troops of}} 12th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment) arrived at Beisan at 13:45 on 24 September. Here they {{received}} Order No. 31 from the Australian Mounted Division to attack Samakh. After leaving Beisan for Jisr el Mejamie, at 16:35 {{they received a}} message dropped from an aircraft, which reported that Samakh was defended by 50 rifles and machine guns. They arrived at Jisr el Mejamie at 21:00 and made contact with the regiment of the 4th Cavalry Division, holding the bridge. A further order to capture Samakh was received at 22:10, which included the additional objective of reconnoitring towards Tiberias, where they were {{to cooperate with the}} 3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade in capturing the town. The orders gave the brigade commander, Brigadier General William Grant, the choice of attacking immediately, or waiting for the 4th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment and the squadrons of the 12th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment. He decided not to delay attacking the apparently weak rearguard, as he expected to be reinforced by the 15th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment, 5th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade, on the way to Samakh. If Grant had waited for reinforcements, the attack would have been during in daylight, {{in full view of the}} defenders in the railway station building, which may have resulted in at least as many casualties, and perhaps many more, during a potentially more protracted fight.|$|E
5|$|The 5th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade (Australian Mounted Division), {{which had}} been {{attached}} to the infantry in the Judean Hills, was ordered to rejoin their division at Jenin. The brigade doubled back {{to turn down the}} road to Jenin, arriving on dusk at 18:00 on 22 September to relieve the 3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade, which then withdrew to Afulah. The 4th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade remained at Jenin until 22 September, when it was ordered back to Afulah, where they arrived at midday on 23 September. The 5th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade was still at Jenin on 25 September, {{the last day of the}} Battle of Megiddo, when it was ordered to send a regiment to reinforce the 4th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade's pre-dawn attack on Samakh. They charged against a well prepared German and Ottoman rearguard during the Battle of Samakh. Later in the day, one squadron of the 8th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment, 3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade approached Tiberias along the road from Nazareth, while a squadron from the 12th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment, advanced north from Samakh. Together they captured Tiberias and 56 prisoners, half of which were German. The next day Allenby held a corps commanders' conference at Jenin where he ordered the pursuit to Damascus. Infantry from the 7th Brigade of the 3rd (Lahore) Division were detached to the Desert Mounted Corps to relieve the mounted and cavalry divisions of their garrison duties. The infantry took over the captured areas, marching via Jenin, and Nazareth, to arrive at Samakh on 28 September.|$|E
50|$|The driving {{events at}} these {{competitions}} are somewhat akin to fine harness classes at <b>horse</b> shows for <b>light</b> <b>horses,</b> though the four horse and larger hitch classes also resemble {{some aspects of}} combined driving.

5|$|The {{pressure}} {{had been}} too great for the advance posts of the much-reduced Yeomanry Mounted Division, which fell back down the Wadi Zeit but the pursuing Ottoman force was suddenly blocked by the 11th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment of 4th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade. The 4th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade had moved by the same route as the 7th Mounted Brigade, but near El Burj they found the road blocked by fire. Brigadier General Grant, reporting to Barrow, ordered the brigade south of Beit Ur el Tahta to support the 6th Mounted Brigade. The 11th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment was pushed forward with two machine guns to hold Wadi Zeit south west of Beit Ur el Foqa.|$|E
5|$|Relatively <b>light</b> <b>horses</b> {{were used}} by many cultures, {{including}} the Ancient Egyptians, the Mongols, the Arabs, and the Native Americans.

5|$|After {{being forced}} out of his Yildirim Army Group {{headquarters}} at Nazareth {{on the morning of}} 20 September, Liman von Sanders drove via Tiberias to Samakh to organise the establishment of a strong rearguard at Samakh. The 4th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade was ordered to move to Beisan from Afulah at 08:30 on 24 September and was subsequently ordered at 13:45 to advance to capture Samakh. This town was strategically important to both sides as it controlled a direct road to Damascus. On 25 September, the 11th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment supported by part of the 12th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Regiment charged in the pre-dawn while the German and Australian machine–gunners conducted a firefight.

5|$|After the {{infantry}} established {{a gap in}} the Ottoman front line on the coast early on the morning of 19 September, the Australian Mounted Division's 3rd and 4th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigades (less the 5th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade temporarily detached to the 60th Division) in reserve, followed the 4th Cavalry Division north on the Plain of Sharon and across the Mount Carmel Range, by the Musmus Pass, to Lejjun on the Esdrealon Plain. While the 4th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade remained to garrison Lejjun and provide various guards for artillery, supplies, and corps headquarters before being ordered to capture Samakh, the 3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade advanced to Jenin, where the 9th and 10th <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> captured the town after a brief fire fight. Subsequently, these two regiments captured some 8,000 Ottoman soldiers, who had been attempting to retreat northwards out of the Judean Hills, during the night of 20/21 September. The outnumbered Australian Light Horsemen were reinforced as quickly as possible, and the majority of the prisoners were marched back into holding camps, near Lejjun in the morning. The 3rd <b>Light</b> <b>Horse</b> Brigade remained in the area to garrison Jenin until they advanced to capture Tiberias on 25 September 1918, before participating in the pursuit to Damascus.|$|E
