2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the <b>lead</b> (<b>thread</b> helix angle) {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E

50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one <b>lead</b> of <b>thread</b> after completing an orbit around the screw. The nut assembly typically includes a slotted cage and cam rings. The cage captivates the rollers in elongated slots, equally spacing the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the rollers.

After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the nut assembly (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw).

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} flap tension on the tearing characteristics of mucosal tissue samples in relation to various suture and needle characteristics. Material and methods: Lining and masticatory mucosal tissue samples obtained from pig jaws were prepared for in vitro testing. Tension tearing diagrams of 60 experiments were traced for 3 - 0, 5 - 0 and 7 - 0 sutures with applied forces up to 20 N. In the second part, the same experiments were repeated with 100 diagrams to test the influence of needle characteristics with 5 - 0 and 6 - 0 sutures using only gingival tissue samples. Results: 3 - 0 sutures mainly lead to tissue breakage {{at an average of}} 13. 4 N. In contrast, 7 - 0 sutures only resulted in breakage of the thread at a mean applied force of 3. 7 N. With 5 - 0 sutures, both events occurred at random at a mean force of 14. 6 N. Irrespective of the needle characteristics, the mean breaking force for gingival samples with 5 - 0 and 6 - 0 sutures was approximately 10 N. Conclusions: Tissue trauma may be reduced by choosing finer suture diameters, because thinner (6 - 0, 7 - 0) sutures <b>lead</b> to <b>thread</b> breakage rather than tissue breakage.
