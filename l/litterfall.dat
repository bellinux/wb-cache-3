5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. Fruit bodies {{are found in}} wet coniferous and deciduous forests, where they grow singly or in small groups {{on the ground in}} <b>litterfall</b> or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Cortinarius iodes forms {{mycorrhizal}} {{associations with}} deciduous trees, particularly oaks. The fruit bodies of Cortinarius iodes sometimes grow singly, {{but more often}} scattered or in groups under hardwood trees, in humus and <b>litterfall.</b> Typical habitats include bog edges, swampy areas, and hummocks. Fruiting usually occurs from July to November. In North America, it is common in eastern regions, and rare in the Pacific Northwest. Its distribution extends from eastern Canada south into Central America and northern regions of South America. It also occurs in northern Asia.|$|E

Biomass increment based on stand specific allometry plus <b>litterfall</b> is considered a suitable although incomplete accounting of above-ground net primary production (ANPP).

500|$|Lepiota babruzalka is an agaric {{mushroom}} of {{the genus}} Lepiota in the order Agaricales. Described as new to science in 2009, it is found in Kerala State, India, where it grows {{on the ground in}} <b>litterfall</b> around bamboo stems. Fruit bodies have caps that measure up to [...] in diameter, and are covered with reddish-brown scales. The cap is supported by a long and slender stem up to [...] long and [...] thick. One of the distinguishing microscopic features of the species is the variably shaped cystidia found on the edges of the gills.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terrestrial}} ecosystems, researchers generally measure net {{primary production}} (NPP). Although its definition is straightforward, field measurements used to estimate productivity vary according to investigator and biome. Field estimates rarely account for below ground productivity, herbivory, turnover, <b>litterfall,</b> volatile organic compounds, root exudates, and allocation to symbiotic microorganisms. [...] Biomass based NPP estimates result in underestimation of NPP due to incomplete accounting of these components. | issn = 1051-0761 | issue = 2 }} [...] However, many field measurements correlate well to NPP. [...] There {{are a number of}} comprehensive reviews of the field methods used to estimate NPP. [...] Estimates of ecosystem respiration, the total carbon dioxide produced by the ecosystem, can also be made with gas flux measurements.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of bacteria in lakes and ponds obtain their energy by decomposing vegetation and animal matter. [...] In the pelagic zone, dead fish and the occasional allochthonous input of <b>litterfall</b> are examples of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM>1mm). [...] Bacteria degrade these into fine particulate organic matter (FPOM<1nbsp&mm) and then further into usable nutrients. [...] Small organisms such as plankton are also characterized as FPOM. [...] Very low concentrations of nutrients are released during decomposition because the bacteria are utilizing them {{to build their own}} biomass. [...] Bacteria, however, are consumed by protozoa, which are in turn consumed by zooplankton, and then further up the trophic levels. [...] Nutrients, including those that contain carbon and phosphorus, are reintroduced into the water column at any number of points along this food chain via excretion or organism death, making them available again for bacteria. [...] This regeneration cycle is known as the microbial loop and is a key component of lentic food webs.|$|E
2500|$|Allochthonous {{energy sources}} are those derived {{from outside the}} lotic system, that is, from the {{terrestrial}} environment. [...] Leaves, twigs, fruits, etc. are typical forms of terrestrial CPOM that have entered the water by direct <b>litterfall</b> or lateral leaf blow. [...] In addition, terrestrial animal-derived materials, such as feces or carcasses that {{have been added to}} the system are examples of allochthonous CPOM. [...] The CPOM undergoes a specific process of degradation. [...] Allan gives the example of a leaf fallen into a stream. [...] First, the soluble chemicals are dissolved and leached from the leaf upon its saturation with water. [...] This adds to the DOM load in the system. [...] Next, microbes such as bacteria and fungi colonize the leaf, softening it as the mycelium of the fungus grows into it. [...] The composition of the microbial community is influenced by the species of tree from which the leaves are shed (Rubbo and Kiesecker 2004). [...] This combination of bacteria, fungi, and leaf are a food source for shredding invertebrates, [...] which leave only FPOM after consumption. [...] These fine particles may be colonized by microbes again or serve as a food source for animals that consume FPOM. [...] Organic matter can also enter the lotic system already in the FPOM stage by wind, surface runoff, bank erosion, or groundwater. [...] Similarly, DOM can be introduced through canopy drip from rain or from surface flows.|$|E
50|$|Net primary {{production}} and <b>litterfall</b> are intimately connected. In every terrestrial ecosystem, the largest fraction of all net {{primary production}} is lost to herbivores and <b>litterfall</b> (needs reference). Due to their interconnectedness, global patterns of <b>litterfall</b> are similar to global patterns of net primary productivity.|$|E
50|$|The main {{objectives}} of <b>litterfall</b> {{sampling and analysis}} are to quantify <b>litterfall</b> production and chemical composition over {{time in order to}} assess the variation in <b>litterfall</b> quantities, and hence its role in nutrient cycling across an environmental gradient of climate (moisture and temperature) and soil conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Litterfall</b> is {{characterized}} as fresh, undecomposed, and easily recognizable (by species and type) plant debris. This {{can be anything}} from leaves, cones, needles, twigs, bark, seeds/nuts, logs, or reproductive organs (e.g. the stamen of flowering plants). Items larger than 2 cm diameter {{are referred to as}} coarse litter, while anything smaller is referred to as fine litter or litter. The type of <b>litterfall</b> is most directly affected by ecosystem type. For example, leaf tissues account for about 70 percent of <b>litterfall</b> in forests, but woody litter tends to increase with forest age. In grasslands, there is very little aboveground perennial tissue so the annual <b>litterfall</b> is very low and quite nearly equal to the net primary production.|$|E
50|$|The {{decline of}} {{nutrient}} ratios {{is also a}} function of decomposition of <b>litterfall</b> (i.e. as <b>litterfall</b> decomposes, more nutrients enter the soil below and the litter will have a lower nutrient ratio). <b>Litterfall</b> containing high nutrient concentrations will decompose more rapidly and asymptote as those nutrients decrease. Knowing this, ecologists {{have been able to}} use nutrient concentrations as measured by remote sensing as an index of a potential rate of decomposition for any given area. Globally, data from various forest ecosystems shows an inverse relationship in the decline in nutrient ratios to the apparent nutrition availability of the forest.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} shown that foliar stable {{nitrogen}} isotope (15N) abundance in N. ampullaria plants growing under forest canopy (<b>litterfall</b> present) is significantly lower than in plants without access to <b>litterfall.</b> Conversely, total nitrogen concentrations are higher in these plants compared to those growing in open sites with no <b>litterfall.</b> A 2003 study estimated that N. ampullaria plants growing under forest canopy derive 35.7% (±0.1%) of their foliar nitrogen from leaf litter. A 2011 study found that N. ampullaria derives 41.7% (±5.5%) of its laminar nitrogen and 54.8% (±7.0%) of its pitcher nitrogen from leaf litter, and showed that detritivory increased the rate of net photosynthesis in the laminae.|$|E
50|$|Leaching is {{the process}} by which cations such as iron (Fe) and {{aluminum}} (Al), as well as organic matter are removed from the <b>litterfall</b> and transported downward into the soil below. This process is known as podzolization and is particularly intense in boreal and cool temperate forests that are mainly constituted by coniferous pines whose <b>litterfall</b> is rich in phenolic compounds and fulvic acid.|$|E
50|$|Many {{organisms that}} {{live on the}} forest floor are decomposers, such as fungi. Organisms whose diet {{consists}} of plant detritus, such as earthworms, are termed detritivores. The community of decomposers in the litter layer also includes bacteria, amoeba, nematodes, rotifer, springtails, cryptostigmata, potworms, insect larvae, mollusks, oribatid mites, woodlice, and millipedes. Their consumption of the <b>litterfall</b> results in the breakdown of simple carbon compounds into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), and releases inorganic ions (like nitrogen and phosphorus) into the soil where the surrounding plants can then reabsorb the nutrients that were shed as <b>litterfall.</b> In this way, <b>litterfall</b> becomes {{an important part of the}} nutrient cycle that sustains forest environments.|$|E
5000|$|Ecologists {{employ a}} simple {{approach}} to the collection of <b>litterfall,</b> most of which centers around once piece of equipment, known as a litterbag. A litterbag is simply any type of container that can be set out in any given area for a specified {{amount of time to}} collect the plant litter that falls from the canopy above.Litterbags are generally set in random locations within a given area and marked with GPS or local coordinates, and then monitored on a specific time interval. Once the samples have been collected, they are usually classified on type, size and species (if possible) and recorded on a spreadsheet. When measuring bulk <b>litterfall</b> for an area, ecologists will weigh the dry contents of the litterbag. By this method <b>litterfall</b> flux can be defined as: ...|$|E
50|$|During leaf senescence, {{a portion}} of the plant’s {{nutrients}} are reabsorbed into the leaves. The nutrient concentrations in <b>litterfall</b> differ from the nutrient concentrations in the mature foliage by the reabsorption of constituents during leaf senescence. Plants that grow in areas with low nutrient availability tend to produce litter with low nutrient concentrations, as a larger proportion of the available nutrients is reabsorbed. After senescence, the nutrient-enriched leaves become <b>litterfall</b> and settle on the soil below.|$|E
5000|$|Latitude {{also has}} a strong effect on <b>litterfall</b> rates and thickness. Specifically, <b>litterfall</b> declines with {{increasing}} latitude. In tropical rainforests, there is a thin litter layer due to the rapid decomposition, while in boreal forests, the rate of decomposition is slower and leads to the accumulation of a thick litter layer, {{also known as a}} mor. Net primary production works inversely to this trend, suggesting that the accumulation of organic matter is mainly a result of decomposition rate.|$|E

50|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lepiota ananya grow single or {{scattered}} on the ground among decaying <b>litterfall.</b> The species is known only from its type locality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Litterfall</b> is the {{dominant}} pathway for nutrient return to the soil, especially for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The accumulation of these nutrients in {{the top layer of}} soil is known as soil immobilization. Once the <b>litterfall</b> has settled, decomposition of the litter layer, accomplished through the leaching of nutrients by rainfall and throughfall and by the efforts of detritivores, releases the breakdown products into the soil below and therefore contributes to the cation exchange capacity of the soil. This holds especially true for highly weathered tropical soils.|$|E
50|$|The mass-balance {{approach}} is also utilized in these experiments {{and suggests that}} the decomposition for a given amount of time should equal the input of <b>litterfall</b> for that same amount of time.|$|E
50|$|Cortinarius sinapivelus {{is known}} {{only from the}} type collection. The fruit bodies {{were found in the}} ground under <b>litterfall</b> on the Kaputar Plateau in subalpine grassy woodland. Associated plant species were Eucalyptus dalrympleana and E. pauciflora.|$|E
50|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Cortinarius nebulobrunneus {{grow in the}} ground under <b>litterfall</b> in June and July. The fungus is known only from New South Wales, where it occurs in subalpine grassy woodland. Associated plant species include Eucalyptus dalrympleana, E. pauciflora and E. viminalis.|$|E
50|$|Numerous reptiles, {{amphibians}}, birds, {{and even}} some mammals rely on litter for shelter and forage. For example, amphibians such as salamanders and caecilians inhabit the damp microclimate underneath fallen leaves for part or all of their life cycle. This makes them difficult to observe. A BBC film crew captured footage of a female caecilian with young {{for the first time}} in a documentary that aired in 2008.Some species of birds require leaf litter both for foraging and as material used to construct nests, such as the ovenbird of eastern North America. Sometimes <b>litterfall</b> even provides energy to much larger mammals, such as in boreal forests where lichen <b>litterfall</b> is one of the main constituents of wintering deer and elk diets.|$|E
50|$|The litter {{layer is}} quite {{variable}} in its thickness, decomposition rate and nutrient content and is affected {{in part by}} seasonality, plant species, climate, soil fertility, elevation, and latitude. The most extreme variability of <b>litterfall</b> {{is seen as a}} function of seasonality; each individual species of plant has seasonal losses of certain parts of its body, which can be determined by the collection and classification of plant <b>litterfall</b> throughout the year, and in turn affects the thickness of the litter layer. In tropical environments, the largest amount of debris falls {{in the latter part of}} dry seasons and early during wet season. As a result of this variability due to seasons, the decomposition rate for any given area will also be variable.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} to obtaining new data is the cryptic nature of the plant: although brightly coloured, it is often covered by <b>litterfall,</b> and non-specific botanical surveys have a high probability of missing them.
