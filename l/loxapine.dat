50|$|Schizophrenia as {{a disease}} state is {{characterized}} by severe cognitive dysfunction and it is uncertain to what extent patients are aware of this deficiency.

Results from this study (N=185) revealed large discrepancy in patients’ assessment of their cognitive functioning relative to the assessment of their clinicians. Though it is impossible to access ones’ consciousness and truly understand what a schizophrenic believes, regardless in this study, patients were not aware of their cognitive dysfunctional reasoning. In the DSM-5, to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia, they must have two {{or more of the following}} symptoms in the duration of one month: delusions*, hallucinations*, disorganized speech*, grossly disorganized/catatonic behavior and negative symptoms (*these three symptoms above all other symptoms must be present to correctly diagnose a patient.) Sometimes these symptoms are very prominent and are treated with a combination of antipsychotics (i.e. haloperidol, <b>loxapine),</b> atypical antipsychotics (such as clozapine and risperdone) and psychosocial therapies that include family interventions and socials skills.

40|$|Leslie CitromeDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USAAbstract: Agitation (excessive motor or verbal activity) can be {{associated}} with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, and can further escalate into aggressive behavior and potentially lead to injuries in patients and staff. Medications used to treat agitation include antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, usually administered intramuscularly when rapid action is desired. <b>Loxapine,</b> a first-generation antipsychotic, has recently been reformulated into an inhaled powder that allows for direct administration to the lungs, resulting in rapid absorption into the systemic circulation. Administered via a single-use device, inhaled <b>loxapine</b> was tested in randomized controlled trials in agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania; doses of 5 mg and 10 mg were found to be efficacious, with an apparent dose response. In the Phase III studies, number needed to treat versus placebo for a ≥ 40 % reduction from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale – Excited Component (PANSS-EC) at 2 hours was three for patients with bipolar disorder, and five for 5 mg and four for 10 mg for patients with schizophrenia, with effect sizes comparable to what has been observed in analogous studies of intramuscular injection of antipsychotics or lorazepam. Separation from placebo on the PANSS-EC was as early as 10 minutes postinhalation, the first time point where this was measured. Dysgeusia was the most commonly encountered spontaneously reported adverse event. Adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia were relatively rare. Spirometry studies identified the potential for bronchospasm particularly in persons with asthma.

40|$|A {{number of}} drugs are largely metabolized after oral administration, {{especially}} by redox processes. Among the neuroleptics, <b>loxapine,</b> clotiapine and clozapine, which are seven-membered tricyclic molecules with a piperazine side-chain, {{are known to}} be extensively metabolized by oxidation. An electrochemical study of these compounds was initiated in order to determine their in vitro redox properties and to elucidate their oxidation mechanisms. The measurements were carried out in aqueous and non-aqueous media using voltammetric, cyclic voltammetric, coulometric, exhaustive electrolysis and thin-layer spectroelectrochemical techniques. The oxidation mechanisms, which differ essentially depending on the pH of the solution, are suggested. In view of these results, various similarities have been detected between the in vitro oxidation processes and the pharmacological behaviour reported in the literature. For example, the importance of the piperazine side-chain has been pointed out: oxidation no longer occurs if this side-chain is protonated; similarly, binding to the receptor is prevented if the lone electron pair of the tertiary atom is occupied. Nucleophilic additions have also been observed in non-aqueous media and the compounds have been identified using classical spectroscopic techniques. If the oxidation mechanism is identical on the piperazine chain for the three compounds, the process is somewhat different when it occurs on the tricyclic ring. <b>Loxapine</b> and clotiapine exhibit different behaviour from clozapine, in their electrochemical as well as in their pharmacological properties.
