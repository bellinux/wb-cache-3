5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though {{was unable to find}} any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E
5|$|After the A defense {{forced a}} punt {{on the opening}} {{possession}} of the third quarter, Vinnie Sunseri intercepted the first Manziel pass {{of the second half}} and returned it 73yards for a touchdown and extended the Alabama lead to 35–14. The Aggies responded on the drive that followed with a 14-yard Manziel touchdown pass to Malcome Kennedy which was followed with a three-yard Kenyan Drake touchdown run that made the score 42–21 in favor of the Crimson Tide {{at the end of the}} third quarter. In the fourth, the Aggies scored first on a 12-yard Kennedy touchdown reception, and Alabama <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> about to respond with a touchdown as well, but Yeldon fumbled at the two-yard line that was recovered by A Three plays later, Manziel threw a 95-yard touchdown pass to Mike Evans that cut the Crimson Tide lead to 42–35. Alabama rebounded on their next drive that was capped with a five-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Jalston Fowler that extended their lead to 49–35. A four-yard touchdown pass from Manziel to Kennedy in the last 0:20 made the final score 49–42. Alabama recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal the win.|$|E

Ontario had control of the game, and <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to pull if off at the end. However, in the last end they did not have the hammer, meaning Jones would have last rock. Ontario had a rock on the button that was well guarded, and the only way at it was an in-off a rock sitting just outside the house. Jones made this very {{difficult}} shot, which gave her four points and the win.|$|E

25|$|A {{crowd of}} 82,106 at Croke Park was treated {{to one of}} the best All-Ireland finals of all-time, {{and at the end of}} it all, the Cats were {{acclaimed}} as one of the greatest teams of all-time, if not the greatest. Kilkenny created a piece of history with a fourth successive All-Ireland title following a defeat of Tipperary, thus becoming only the second county to put four titles back-to-back, joining the great Cork team of the 1940s in an elite club. For long periods Tipp <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to end the reign of Brian Cody's side. Tipperary had to play almost twenty minutes with fourteen men following the dismissal of Benny Dunne, and their resolve was finally broken in the final stages, when late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their heroic efforts to secure a 2-22 to 0-23 victory.|$|E

They would march out to Old Gilman House to take a shower and come back because they had no shower facilities inside the Hole. Later that got upgraded to let them go down to the garage." [...] Sometimes executives were allowed out for a short time to attend Church events, but many ended up spending months or even years in the Hole.|$|E

Sarah Wyland of Great American Country felt that Aldean was professional in handling the technical problem by continuing to sing the song with Clarkson. However, Natalie Maines, the lead vocalist of the Dixie Chicks, lambasted Aldean's performance in her Twitter account, writing [...] "Well the good thing about his mic going out is suddenly the song got a lot more in tune."

500|$|While Robinson {{said the}} {{response}} from American critics was largely positive and enthusiastic, Kaes said American critics and audiences were divided: some praised its artistic value and others, particularly those distrustful of Germany following World War I, wished to ban it altogether. Some in the Hollywood film industry felt threatened by the potential rivalry and spoke out against Caligaris release, condemning it as a [...] "foreign invasion". Nevertheless, the film remained popular in the United States. Several American reviewers compared it to an Edgar Allan Poe story, including a 1921 review in Variety magazine, which praised the direction and [...] "perfect tempo" [...] of the film, {{as well as the}} sets that [...] "squeeze and turn and adjust the eye, and through the eye the mentality". A New York Times review likened it to modernist art, comparing the film's sets to Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, and said the film [...] "gives dimensions and meaning to shape, making it an active part of the story, instead of merely the conventional and inert background", which was key to the film's [...] "importance as a work of cinematography". Albert Lewin, a critic who eventually became a film director and screenwriter, called Caligari [...] "the only serious picture, exhibited in America so far, that in anything like the same degree has the authentic thrills and shock of art". A story in a November 1921 edition of Exceptional Photoplays, an independent publication issued by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, said it [...] "occupies the position of unique artistic merit", and said American films in comparison <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> made for [...] "a group of defective adults at the nine-year-old level".|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{praised the}} game's {{colourful}} visuals and special effects. Chris Scullion from the Official Nintendo Magazine thought the game design {{had all the}} speed and charm of the original, and enjoyed its [...] "lush" [...] atmosphere and landscapes. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot also appreciated the game's artistic design, visual [...] "dreaminess" [...] and elegance, and Gerald Villoria of GameSpy liked the game's colourful and vibrant levels. Nintendo Life's Anthony Dickens praised the general visual style of the game, noting that its boss battles in particular [...] "ooze" [...] with bright and exotic colours. Despite the general praise of the game's colourful palette, some critics viewed the aesthetics unfavourably. GameZone's Louis Bedigan felt that Nights: Journey of Dreams lacked the [...] "eye-popping effects" [...] of other contemporaries such as Super Mario Galaxy (2007) and Twilight Princess (2006), and Dickens opined that the game's cutscenes were more akin to PlayStation 2 titles. Tom Bramwell from Eurogamer felt that the environments <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> from 1996, despite the attempts made to distract the player from the game's simple premise. Paul Govan of GamesTM found that the game engine struggled to match the cutscene's visual fluidity with its actual gameplay, and expressed disappointment that Wii owners would be unfazed by its graphical prowess, unlike Sega Saturn owners {{at the time of}} the original Nights into Dreams release. Dickens thought the game was graphically rushed by Sega, and speculated that it was [...] "cobbled together quickly" [...] by artists who had focused too much on designing the game's introduction sequence. Adam Rosenberg from UGO Networks found the graphics to be a disappointment, saying that its environments were [...] "drab" [...] considering it was based on the dreams of twelve-year-old children, and also noticed frame rate issues. Likewise, two reviewers from Electronic Gaming Monthly, Shane Bettenhausen and Sam Kennedy, thought the 3D was [...] "amateurish" [...] and suffered from basic issues including uneven graphics and unskippable cutscenes.|$|E

500|$|Usher's stage {{performances}} {{have been}} complimented by critics for being [...] "packed with high-octane choreography {{held together by}} sleek, masterful showmanship", and his engaging skill with audiences being [...] "enough {{to pull off a}} one-man show". His performances and dancing technique have often marked comparisons to his influences Michael Jackson and James Brown. He told People Magazine in 2008 that [...] "James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of him I was given a clear view of what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him." [...] On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed Usher's simultaneous ability, stating [...] "the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art", and claims his show [...] "ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney {{and the rest of the}} lip-synching, teen-pop acts". Usher performed singles [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Yeah!" [...] at 2004 MTV Video Music Awards under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 of their [...] "20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances". Chad Batka for The New York Times said [...] "He has established himself as one of R's supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary." [...] Capable of playing the piano, Usher also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and the bass guitar, amid singles [...] "Good Kisser" [...] and [...] "She Came to Give It to You" [...] in 2014. The UR Experience Tour was reported to have consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalists according to Billboard, in which The Guardian called him [...] "a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage". Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone labels him the [...] "Award Show King", explaining [...] "His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> shot in one take.
