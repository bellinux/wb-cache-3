40|$|The IDENTIFY DEVICE command {{includes}} an optional World Wide Name field containing an IEEE NAA Registered identifier in words 108 - 111. Serial Attached SCSI HBAs may {{use this to}} identify that the drive is the same even if it changes locations in the SCSI domain (the SAS address given to a drive {{is based on the}} expander phy to which it is attached). e 05178 r 0 proposes the field be upgraded to mandatory. The IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command does not currently define that field. It would be helpful if it were optionally available, and if implemented by an ATAPI device supporting SCSI commands, matched the SCSI target device name returned in the SCSI INQUIRY command Device Identification VPD page (83 h). The other SCSI names/identifiers it could be each have problems: a) It cannot serve as the SCSI target port name, because if the SATA device is behind a SATA port selector, the same name appears in two different domains. b) It cannot serve as the SCSI target port identifier, because the value is not actually used for addressing within any domains. In SAS, the expander to which the SATA device is attached assigns it a SAS address. An advanced expander could send IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE to retrieve the World Wide Name and use that as the SAS address, but this is not required in SAS- 1. 1. c) It cannot serve as the <b>logical</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name,</b> because the PACKET command payload might include a SCSI- 2 compatible LOGICAL UNIT NUMBER field in the CDB (byte 1 bits 7 : 5), and each <b>logical</b> <b>unit</b> <b>name</b> must be unique. For IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE, the World Wide Name needs to be optional, because ATAPI DVD drives, which are the most common packet devices, have little need. ATAPI tape drives are more likely to implement it...|$|E
40|$|The INQUIRY Device Identification VPD page (83 h) returns logical unit, target port, and (with 02 - 254) {{target device}} related identifiers. However, it has several {{limitations}} for iSCSI, SRP, and SBP- 2 devices, and for devices with target ports using different transport protocols: 1. iSCSI uses a string format for port names and device names that cannot {{be represented in}} the current VPD formats. The strings approach 256 bytes in length; 02 - 303 expanded INQUIRY’s allocation length to return such amounts of data. Suggestion: A new VPD device identifier type for this string format is needed so iSCSI devices can report its target port (ASSOCIATION field set to 1 h) and target device identifiers (ASSOCIATION field set to 2 h). 2. RAID controllers tend to name their logical units (reported with ASSOCIATION field set to 0 h) by concatenating a self-generated number {{to the end of}} a port name (e. g. the NAA IEEE Registered Extended identifier is 64 bits concatenated onto an IEEE Registered identifier).
