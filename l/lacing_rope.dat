The decoration of the vases was of the incisive type (decoration cut into the clay before firing), but scapulae and impressed vases also existed; adobe <b>lace,</b> in <b>rope</b> form, with or without incisions are also found.|$|R

5000|$|A {{drawstring}} (draw string, draw-string) is a , , <b>lace,</b> or <b>rope</b> used to [...] "" [...] (gather, or shorten) fabric {{or other}} material. The {{ends of the}} drawstring may be tied {{to hold it in}} place (and/or simultaneously close an opening). Alternately, the drawstring may be kept drawn using a cordlock. Typically, the drawstring is loose when not being used, and tightened when needed during use.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{weakness of}} abatis, {{in contrast to}} barbed wire, {{is that it can}} be destroyed by fire. Also, if <b>laced</b> together with <b>rope</b> instead of wire, the rope can be very quickly destroyed by such fires, after which the abatis can be quickly pulled apart by grappling hooks thrown from a safe distance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{left side}} resembles the bayan (large metal drum of the tabla) {{except that it}} uses dholak masala (oil-based application) on the inner surface instead of a syahi (permanent black spot). The right head is unique in its construction. Goat skin is {{stitched}} onto an iron ring. In the centre of this skin is a syahi, similar to tabla except much thinner. The traditional nals were <b>laced</b> with <b>rope</b> and had sticks to function as turnbuckles. Today, metal turnbuckles have replaced the <b>rope</b> <b>lacing</b> in most models. The nal is very popular in the tamasha (street performance) of Maharashtra. It has been absorbed into the Hindi film industry and today the nal is very popular for filmi music. There is often some confusion concerning the term [...] "dholki" [...] because, this term literally means, [...] "a small dholak"; as such, the term is often used for smaller dhalaks that structurally are dissimilar to the nal. The smaller surface of the Dholki is made of skin for sharp notes and the bigger surface is made of other skin for low pitches, which allows a combination of bass and treble with rhythmic high and low pitches.|$|R

[...] {{from the}} Erya (3rd-2nd century BC) and [...] "Gūanbù, alias kūnbù" [...] from the Wupu Bencao (3rd century). Tao Hongjing (456-536) noted kūnbù is edible. [...] As {{previously}} mentioned, however, kūnbù can not be identified with kombu. Zhang Yuxi referred to haidai in the book 嘉祐補註神農本草 (1060).|$|R
50|$|Leather sleepsacks are {{generally}} very confining {{but do not}} stretch. If they are sized correctly they are very comfortable for long-term usage, and many bondage enthusiasts spend entire nights comfortably confined in them. In {{order to make the}} tightest fit possible, many leather sleepsacks have small D-rings down each side of the main zipper along the front of the sack, which allows the sack to be pulled tighter around the body using <b>rope</b> <b>laced</b> between the D-rings. This system of D-rings and <b>rope</b> <b>lacing</b> also protects the zipper from any stress that the occupant of the sack might exert on it. To further add to the confining aspects of the sleepsack, there are usually straps or belts that go around the body at intervals {{along the length of the}} sack, starting at the collar and going down to the ankles. To keep the straps in place and prevent them from shifting, they pass through larger D-rings down the sides of the sleepsack.|$|R

Later, in 1865, after the marriage of her sister, she was able to set up her home as a factory for <b>rope,</b> <b>lace</b> and various other items. In this way, Rodríguez lived a quiet life in which she was able to grow and deepen her faith, meditating and praying throughout the daily routine.|$|R
50|$|Temporary corset piercings {{are often}} {{performed}} for aesthetic reasons, often {{as part of}} a fetish event or photo shoot. A body piercer may also perform a corset piercing to promote their business, to be photographed for a portfolio or to be used for advertising purposes. They may also be performed as play piercings as part of BDSM activity. Often temporary corset piercings are worn <b>laced</b> with ribbon, <b>rope,</b> or chain.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2011, a {{large scale}} {{installation}} entitled [...] "Pulp Fashion: The Art of Isabelle de Borchgrave" [...] opened to great acclaim at the Legion of Honor Museum in San Francisco. The retrospective exhibition, described by the museum officials as [...] "trompe l'oeil masterpieces," [...] is presented in six sections: [...] "The Artist's Studio" [...] is recreated to provide insight into de Borchgrave's creative process; [...] "In White" [...] showcases the purity of craftsmanship in a selection of nine dresses devoid of color; [...] "Papiers à la Mode" [...] features iconic looks from key periods in fashion history, and legendary designers such as Charles Worth, Paul Poiret and Coco Chanel are represented by signature pieces; [...] "Fortuny" [...] is an immersive environment created under a paper tent populated by recreations of Fortuny's famed pleated and draped gowns; [...] "The Medici" [...] is the artist's most extravagant series, with elaborate velvets, needlework <b>lace,</b> <b>ropes</b> of pearls, and intricate coiffures transformed into paper sculptures, and [...] "Inspiration"— de Borchgrave's latest body of work, inspired by four paintings from the Legion of Honor's collection that she admired during her visit to the museum {{in the summer of}} 2010. The paintings were: Massimo Stanzione, Woman in Neapolitan Costume, ca. 1635, Konstantin Makovsky, The Russian Bride's Attire, 1889, Jacob Ferdinand Voet, Anna Caffarelli Minuttiba, ca. 1675, and Anthony van Dyck, Marie Claire de Cory and Child, 1634. Quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle, John Buchanan, the Museum's director, called the exhibition [...] "pure poetry". [...] "This is the coolest thing I've ever seen", he added. The installation, which Isabelle de Borchgrave called [...] "a wink at history", will be on view through 5 June 2011.|$|R
50|$|After {{completing}} a basic schooling, Bonifacia {{began to work}} as a ropemaker. Later, in 1865, after the marriage of her sister, the only surviving sibling, she was able to set up a small workshop in the family home for making <b>rope,</b> <b>lace</b> and various other items. In this way, Rodríguez lived a quiet life with her now-widowed mother, one in which she was able to grow and deepen her faith, meditating and praying throughout the daily routine.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} three natural divisions of Gloucestershire have given rise in each to a special industry, as already indicated. The forest district, until {{the development of the}} Sussex mines in the 16th century, was the chief iron producing area of the kingdom, the mines having been worked in Roman times, while the abundance of timber gave rise to numerous tanneries and to an important shipbuilding trade. The hill district, besides fostering agricultural pursuits, gradually absorbed the woollen trade from the big towns, which now devoted themselves almost entirely to foreign commerce. Silkweaving was introduced in the 17th century, and was especially prosperous in the Stroud valley. The abundance of clay and building-stone in the county gave rise to considerable manufactures of brick, tiles and pottery. Numerous minor industries sprang up in the 17th and 18th centuries, such as flax-growing and the manufacture of pins, buttons, <b>lace,</b> stockings, <b>rope</b> and sailcloth.|$|R
