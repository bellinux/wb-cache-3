5|$|Overall, Hurricane Inez killed about 1,000people, {{mostly on}} Hispaniola, and caused over $200million in damage. Crop damage {{was less than}} other storms of similar magnitude, due to Inez's small size and its {{occurrence}} <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{struggling}} {{during the}} 1914 season, Chance criticized the talent brought {{to him by}} Yankees scout Arthur Irwin. After repeatedly seeking to have Irwin fired, he offered his resignation from the team <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> {{on the condition that}} he still was to receive his 1915 salary. After this was accepted by team owner Frank J. Farrell, Chance resigned with three weeks remaining in the season, and Peckinpaugh served as player–manager {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 96–66. Some described the Mets as collapsing <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> while the race between the Reds and their division rival Houston Astros {{was close enough to}} create the possibility of a three-way tie. The Reds won a coin flip <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> which, by rule at the time, awarded them home field for the game. Upon winning, the Mets advanced to NL Division Series (NLDS) where they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, three-games-to-one. They then advanced to the NL Championship Series (NLCS) but were defeated by the Atlanta Braves in six games, bringing an end to the Mets' season. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular-season game by both teams, with all events in the game added to regular-season statistics.|$|E
5|$|After the Hokies' {{participation}} in the 2000 BCS National Championship Game, the Virginia Tech entered the 2000-2001 college football season with high expectations. Until <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> those hopes were borne out, and it appeared as if the Hokies {{would return to the}} national championship game. After a late-season loss to No.3-ranked Miami, however, Tech was knocked out of contention for the national title. Following the conclusion of its 10–1 season, No. 6 Tech was selected to participate in the Gator Bowl. Facing the Hokies were the No. 16 Clemson Tigers, who had finished 9–2 during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Alston guided {{his teams}} {{to at least}} 85 wins per season between 1969 and 1976. They {{finished}} in second place in their division six times during that span.

Beginning in 1973, Alston's team featured an infield of Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell and Ron Cey.

5|$|Auroras {{departure}} from Australia was delayed {{by a series}} of organisational and financial setbacks, and the party did not arrive in McMurdo Sound until 16 January 1915—very <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> for depot-laying work. Mackintosh, who believed that Shackleton might attempt to cross the continent in that first season, insisted that sledging work should begin without delay, with a view to laying down supply depots at 79° and 80°S. Joyce opposed this; more time, he maintained, should be set aside to acclimatise and train men and dogs. However he was overruled by Mackintosh, who was unaware that Shackleton had ruled out a crossing that season.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{previous}} season, several other wing players left the team. Caris LeVert graduated. Aubrey Dawkins transferred {{to play for}} the UCF Knights. Kameron Chatman announced his intention to transfer.

Grove concluded the year at Oklahoma City with a 17–7 record, an improvement over the previous season. However, Grove received a knee injury <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> which he did not think much of at the time. In October, Grove injured his other knee when he was involved in an automobile accident in Missouri.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{after leading}} the {{division}} {{standing by the}} end of April, the Mets again began to struggle. The Mets would not hold first place at any point after May 1, although they came close in mid-June. By {{the end of the season}} the Mets had finished 18 games behind the first place Phillies. For its part, Philadelphia was mainly engaged in a fierce division race with the Atlanta Braves, trailing them as <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> as September 6. However, Philadelphia would surge at the end of the month and once again be crowned division champs. 2010 ultimately served as a disappointment for the Mets–Phillies rivalry.|$|E
