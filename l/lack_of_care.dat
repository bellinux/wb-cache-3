5|$|In 1861, {{there were}} {{concerns}} that the old-style Poitevin was becoming extinct, and {{questions about whether the}} Poitou mule retained the quality that it previously had. The large Poitevin mares became rarer, due to large amounts of crossbreeding and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> shown towards breeding stock selection. Thoroughbreds and Thoroughbred crosses, especially at the stud farms in Saint-Maixent and La Roche-sur-Yon, created the Anglo-Poitevin type, a half-blood used by the army. The continued draining of the marshes also influenced the breed. Many Poitevins at this point were actually a mix of Breton and old-type Poitevin bloodstock. However, a distinction persisted between the real Poitevin and mixed-blood horses, and farmers who preferred the former preserved the type, which formed the base for the creation of the breed studbook.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E

Voter apathy or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> interest {{is often cited}} {{as a cause of}} low turnout among eligible voters in jurisdictions where voting is optional and the donkey vote where voting is compulsory. Voter fatigue describes a possible cause of voter apathy: elections that are held too frequently.|$|R

25|$|Aoki has {{received}} criticisms by the mixed martial arts community for his disrespectful victory celebrations and perceived <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for his opponents, often causing injuries which {{are seen as}} needless. He firstly became known for breaking Keith Wisniewski's arm, then doing the same with Kuniyoshi Hironaka via flying armbar in a Brazilian jiu-jitsu bout, sidelining him for a year. In 2009, controversy would come when he faced Mizuto Hirota in a super bout. After Aoki won by breaking Hirota's arm in a brutal fashion, he gave the middle finger to the downed fighter and the crowd while running excitedly.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening of}} East European orphanages {{in the early}} 1990s {{following}} the end of the Cold War provided substantial opportunities for research on attachment and other aspects of institutional rearing, however such research rarely mentions [...] "maternal deprivation" [...] other than in a historical context. Maternal deprivation as a discrete syndrome is a concept that is rarely used other than in connection with extreme deprivation and failure to thrive. Rather there is consideration of a range of different lacks and deficiencies in different forms of care, or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> of which attachment is only one aspect, as well as consideration of constitutional and genetic factors in determining developmental outcome. Subsequent studies have however confirmed Bowlby's concept of [...] "cycles of disadvantage" [...] although not all children from unhappy homes reproduce the deficiencies in their own experience. Rather, it is now conceptualised as a series of pathways through childhood and a number of varied influences will determine which path a particular child takes.|$|E
500|$|SCATTOR {{training}} {{was not easy}} for either the trainers or the trainees. Cultural differences and language barriers had to be breached by both. English–Vietnamese dictionaries were used extensively and Vietnamese sailors who spoke even broken English were often pressed into service to help translate the training syllabus for each job on the cutter. Coast Guardsmen that had maintained their cutters with pride could not understand the Vietnamese sailors seeming <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> about housekeeping chores. Orders dictated that any cutter entering the ACTOV Program had {{to be ready for}} turnover within four months. Often after a return from patrol duties the Vietnamese sailors would just leave the cutter as soon as it reached homeport, leaving maintenance, cleanup, and re-provisioning to the Coast Guardsmen. [...] AWOL rates for Vietnamese sailors often interfered with training schedules as well as patrol operations. Morale of the Coast Guardsmen charged with the training of the replacement Vietnamese crew was often very low and this caused friction between the two parts of the crew. Because of political pressures in the United States to end involvement in the war as soon as possible, the SCATTOR program of {{training was}} accelerated to a 15-week program and eventually an 11-week program. This caused overcrowding on the cutters and further problems with the mixed crews.|$|E

In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom. The absence of parish officers who should be controlling the boys is an intentional rebuke on Hogarth's part; he agreed with Henry Fielding that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> from the overseers of the poor, who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring.|$|E

2500|$|The care {{crisis in}} the United States refers to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> work {{as the result of}} globalization. For the middle class, there has been an ongoing debate over who should take care of children: family members or child care {{providers}} [...] However, the debate is slowly shifting to one concerning parents and child care providers to domestic workers.

Anosodiaphoria follows a stage of anosognosia, in which there may be verbal, explicit denial of the illness, and after several days to weeks, develop the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> emotional response.

2500|$|Deceit, fraud, and {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation, are {{all legal}} terms related to deliberately making an untruthful statement. In law, the criterion used {{is that the}} person did not actually have an [...] "honest belief" [...] (or [...] "honestly held belief") that their statement was true. More exactly, it is an untruthful statement that is made (a) knowingly, and either (b) without belief in its truth or (c) reckless {{as to whether or}} not it is true. At times, recklessness, silence, or omission can also be enough to make a misrepresentation fraudulent or deceitful, for example where the person showed either utter indifference or a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> whether or not the statement was true, or deliberately stays silent when a previous statement is no longer the case. This can also include not bothering to check whether or not the statement is true. Fraud and deceit differ from negligence, because they are based on dishonesty while negligence means something closer to 'unreasonable carelessness' or 'lack of expected professional skill'.|$|E
